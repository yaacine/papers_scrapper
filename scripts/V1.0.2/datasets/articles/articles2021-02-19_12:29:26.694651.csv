Consisting of four genetically distinct serotypes. dengue virus (DENV) causes serious life-threatening infections due to its complexity. Antibody-dependent enhancement by pre-existing cross-reactive as well as homotypic antibodies further worsens the clinical symptoms of dengue. Thus. a vaccine conferring simultaneous and durable immunity to each of the four DENV serotypes is essential to restrict its escalation. In deeply affected resource-limited countries. oral vaccination using food-grade organisms is considered to be a beneficial approach in terms of costs. patient comfort. and simple logistics for mass immunization. The current study used a mouse model to explore the immunogenicity of an oral dengue vaccine candidate prepared using whole recombinant yeast cells (WC) and cell-free extracts (CFE) from cells expressing recombinant Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin protein B-subunit (LTB) fused to the consensus dengue envelope domain III (scEDIII).

The dengue virus (DENV) includes four genetically distinct serotypes that cause serious life-threatening infections. including dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Dengue vaccine development is complicated by the possibility of vaccine-enhanced severe dengue disease due to antibody-dependent enhancement by pre-existing cross-reactivity. as well as homotypic antibodies. Thus. the development of an efficacious dengue vaccine conferring simultaneous and durable immunity to each of the four DENV serotypes has not yet been developed despite years of research. For mass immunization in deeply affected resource-limited countries. oral vaccination is considered more beneficial than conventional approaches. Therefore. in a continuing effort towards designing economical and potent vaccine candidates. the current study applied yeast surface display technology to develop an oral dengue vaccine candidate using whole recombinant yeast cells displaying the recombinant fusion protein of M cell targeting ligand Co1 fused to the synthetic consensus dengue envelope domain III (scEDIII).

Therefore. synthesis of recombinant nattokinase in a host system. which can be both safe for human consumption as well as demonstrate good productivity and amenable to the downstream processing. will have a great socioeconomic significance. A nat05 gene encoding nattokinase–the most important serine protease secreted by the Bacillus subtilis natto–was cloned from B. subtilis strain N05 and expressed using pHT43 plasmid in another B. subtilis strain (BD170). Enzymatic assays. as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and zymogram. were employed to assess the efficiency of the production of nattokinase using a relatively novel recombinant DNA technique. Among the five recombinant bacterial clones (R1–R5). R4 was found to secrete high amounts of nattokinase into the culture medium. as evidenced by the total proteolytic enzyme assay. fibrinolytic enzyme assay. SDS-PAGE. and zymogram. A preliminary analysis of the biochemical properties of the crude enzyme showed characteristics that are typical of nattokinase as reported by other studies. Thus. in this study. we were able to successfully produce nattokinase in B. subtilis strain (BD170) using recombinant DNA approach.

High-altitude flying bats face various direct and indirect threats. including collision with tall anthropogenic structures and aerial vehicles. aerial fragmentation. reduced insect biomass. and the altered ambient conditions associated with climate change. Furthermore. dust and chemical pollutants in the troposphere might impair the health and survival of bats. Such indirect threats are diffuse regarding their origin and effect on bats. whereas direct threats are site and context specific. Overall. troposphere habitat conservation is hampered by the “Tragedy of the Commons” because its stewardship is in the hands of many.

In North America. several bat species are threatened by white-nose disease. which has caused an unprecedented mass mortality of > 6 million bats since 2006. The fungus Pseudogymnoascus (Geomyces) destructans is the causative agent of the disease. Though asexual reproduction is the norm. sexual reproduction is possible as two mating types exist. Sexual reproduction has been implicated in the emergence of virulent strains of fungi but to date no rapid means of mating type characterisation was available for P. destructans. In this study. three mating type-specific primer sets were designed and tested on 80 isolates. The primers were multiplexed with microsatellite loci allowing for rapid and concurrent genotyping and mating type assignment.

Cycladenia humilis. the sole species of Cycladenia. is an enigmatic perennial widely dispersed across the western United States. Within this species there are three currently recognized varieties: C. humilis var. humilis in Northern California. C. humilis var. venusta in Southern California. and C. humilis var. jonesii in Utah and Northern Arizona. Some populations occur geographically in areas between the typical distribution of each variety and the presently accepted taxonomy inadequately addresses these populations. Using five nDNA regions. we seek to clarify relationships between current varieties and assess the pattern of variation throughout the species. Analyses including K-means clustering. principle component analysis. fields for recombination. AMOVA. and ecological niche modeling were applied. Results indicate significant genetic structure between varieties and supports recognition of C. jonesii at the species level as distinct from C. humilis. Well defined intraspecific groupings are evident in the data. with evidence supporting the recognition of an additional variety in C. humilis. and two varieties in C. jonesii. Haplotype diversity and relationships between metapopulation clusters inform conservation efforts regarding diversity within Cycladenia and offer insights into the historical demography of this genus.,True,woXjK-kAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/5921/,138327397090365272,/scholar?cites=138327397090365272,,https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6920&context=etd,0,0,0

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae. five septins comprise two species of hetero-octamers. Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1. Slow GTPase activity by Cdc12 directs the choice of incorporation of Cdc11 vs Shs1. but many septins. including Cdc3. lack GTPase activity. We serendipitously discovered that guanidine hydrochloride rescues septin function in cdc10 mutants by promoting assembly of non-native Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1 hexamers. We provide evidence that in S. cerevisiae Cdc3 guanidinium occupies the site of a ‘missing’ Arg side chain found in other fungal species where (i) the Cdc3 subunit is an active GTPase and (ii) Cdc10-less hexamers natively co-exist with octamers. We propose that guanidinium reactivates a latent septin assembly pathway that was suppressed during fungal evolution in order to restrict assembly to octamers. Since homodimerization by a GTPase-active human septin also creates hexamers that exclude Cdc10-like central subunits. our new mechanistic insights likely apply throughout phylogeny.,True,J9XDhPkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,3,https://elifesciences.org/articles/54355,10035913079378336643,/scholar?cites=10035913079378336643,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/54355.pdf,0,0,0

How cells tune the biophysical properties of septin filaments to control filament flexibility and length. and in turn the size. shape. and position of higher-order septin structures is not well understood. We examined how rod composition and nucleotide availability influence physical properties of septins such as annealing. fragmentation. bundling and bending. We found that septin complexes have symmetric termini. even when both Shs1 and Cdc11 are coexpressed. The relative proportion of Cdc11/Shs1 septin complexes controls the biophysical properties of filaments and influences the rate of annealing. fragmentation. and filament flexibility.

All septins are GTP-binding proteins that arrange into non-polar hetero-oligomeric complexes. These heteromeric complexes associate with the membrane and polymerize to form filaments. Septin involvement in diverse cellular processes in different eukaryotes requires organization into diverse higher-order structures. Recent studies have only begun to understand the septin assembly process. Septins filaments assemble on a membrane and can shrink and grow through annealing and fragmentation. respectively.

1073281,Complete killing of Caenorhabditis elegans by Burkholderia pseudomallei is dependent on prolonged direct association with the viable pathogen,2011,Song-Hua Lee and Soon-Keat Ooi and Nor Muhammad Mahadi and Man-Wah Tan and Sheila Nathan,6,PLos one,3,e16707,Public Library of Science,Background Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis. a disease of significant morbidity and mortality in both human and animals in endemic areas. Much remains to be known about the contributions of genotypic variations within the bacteria and the host. and environmental factors that lead to the manifestation of the clinical symptoms of melioidosis.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. we showed that different isolates of B. pseudomallei have divergent ability to kill the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The rate of nematode killing was also dependent on growth media: B. pseudomallei grown on peptone-glucose media killed C. elegans more rapidly than bacteria grown on the nematode growth media. Filter and bacteria cell-free culture filtrate assays demonstrated that the extent of killing observed is significantly less than that observed in the direct killing assay. Additionally. we showed that B. pseudomallei does not persistently accumulate within the C. elegans gut as brief exposure to B. pseudomallei is not sufficient for C. elegans infection.   Conclusions/Significance A combination of genetic and environmental factors affects virulence. In addition. we have also demonstrated that a Burkholderia-specific mechanism mediating the pathogenic effect in C. elegans requires proliferating B. pseudomallei to continuously produce toxins to mediate complete killing.,True,owyNmjwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,32,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016707,16461572280311096524,/scholar?cites=16461572280311096524,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016707,0,0,0

However. the virulence mechanisms underlying rapid lethality of C. elegans upon B. pseudomallei infection remain poorly defined. To probe the host-pathogen interaction. we constructed GFP-tagged B. pseudomallei and followed bacterial accumulation within the C. elegans intestinal lumen. Contrary to slow-killing by most bacterial pathogens. B. pseudomallei caused fairly limited intestinal lumen colonization throughout the period of observation. Using grinder-defective mutant worms that allow the entry of intact bacteria also did not result in full intestinal lumen colonization. In addition. we observed a significant decline in C. elegans defecation and pharyngeal pumping rates upon B. pseudomallei infection. The decline in defecation rates ruled out the contribution of defecation to the limited B. pseudomallei …,True,owyNmjwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,30,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/viru.21808,15827695857852545891,/scholar?cites=15827695857852545891,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/viru.21808,0,0,0

Biochemically dissecting the contributions of individual subunits of such complexes to the multi-step ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling reaction requires the use of assays that monitor the production of reaction products and measure the formation of reaction intermediates. This JOVE protocol describes assays that allow one to measure the biochemical activities of chromatin remodeling complexes or subcomplexes containing various combinations of subunits.  Chromatin remodeling is measured using an ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding assay. which monitors the movement of a nucleosome on a DNA molecule using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)-based method.  Nucleosome binding activity is measured by monitoring the formation of remodeling complex-bound mononucleosomes using a similar EMSA-based method. and DNA- or nucleosome-dependent ATPase activity is assayed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) to measure the rate of conversion of ATP to ADP and phosphate in the presence of either DNA or nucleosomes.  Using these assays. one can examine the functions of subunits of a chromatin remodeling complex by comparing the activities of the complete complex to those lacking one or more subunits. The human INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is used as an example; however. the methods described here can be adapted to the study of other chromatin …,True,owyNmjwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3,https://www.jove.com/t/51721/biochemical-assays-for-analyzing-activities-atp-dependent-chromatin,9548720154652496448,/scholar?cites=9548720154652496448,,https://www.jove.com/t/51721/biochemical-assays-for-analyzing-activities-atp-dependent-chromatin,0,0,0

ALC1 displays robust catalytic activity only when its macrodomain interacts with the poly(ADP‐ribose) (PAR) on nucleosome‐bound PARP‐1. However. little is known about the mechanism by which PARylated PARP‐1 regulates ALC1 activity. We seek to define the features of PARP‐1 required for ALC1 activation. PARP‐1 is a multi‐domain enzyme that catalyzes most PAR synthesis in cells. PARP‐1 includes DNA‐binding zinc finger domains (Zn1. Zn2 and Zn3).

Kyushu University,Population dynamics of insect pests are complex and are dependent on various biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding pest population dynamics and factors affecting them is important for predicting pest outbreaks and constructing the management strategy. Aphids are among the major pest groups in bean crops and aphid outbreaks can frequently occur when the management is inappropriate. In the present study. we examined the population fluctuation and abundance of aphid species and their associated predators and parasitoids in faba bean fields during 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons in Kafr EL–Shiekh. Egypt. Among four pest aphids detected. Aphis craccivora was the most dominant. followed by Acyrthosiphon pisum while Aphis gossypii and Myzus persicae were found in low densities throughout the season. Although A. craccivora was detected throughout the growing season. the density is notably high in the early growth stage of faba bean. Among the predators. Chrysoperla carnea and true spiders (Singa sp. and Dictyna sp. were most abundant. followed by Coccinella undecimpunctata. The other common predators were Scymnus spp.. Paederous alfierii. and Orius sp. A. craccivora was found to be parasitized by the parasitoid Aphidius spp.. and the percentages of parasitism were high in the beginning of growth season then declined to zero before the middle of the season.

Kyushu University,Postharvest loss is a serious problem in rice. and the loss during storage period can account for the majority of the postharvest loss. Traditional methods of storing paddy rice are vulnerable to insect and fungal infestations. leading to a considerable deterioration in rice quality. Here we focus on low–temperature storage to improve the storage efficacy of rice. Laboratory experiments were conducted to appraise the effects of storage temperature (traditional. cold and freeze storage) and period (6. 12. 18 and 24 months) on the storage efficacy such as pest and fungal infestations. germination success and physical quality of rice grains. using 11 paddy rice cultivars. Insect and fungal infestations significantly increased whereas germination success and rice quality were reduced. with increasing storage periods. Traditional storage of rice grains resulted in the highest levels of insect and fungal infestations caused by rice weevil. Alternaria sp.. Nigrospora oryzae and Fusarium spp.. while germination success and rice quality were relatively low. In contrast. cold storage satisfactorily lowered insect and fungal infestations while maximizing 1000–grain weight. germination success. hulling. milling and head rice. Although freeze storage of rice grains minimized the infestation levels. the other efficacy indices were inferior to those of cold storage. The impacts of the storage temperature and period were complicated depending on rice cultivars. which suggested that a further improvement of efficacy was possible by choosing the best cultivar suitable for storage.

Some fungi are capable of infecting and killing insects and. hence. are commonly known as entomopathogenic fungi (EPF). On the other hand. some insects can kill harmful fungal strains using their products such as peptides. Hence. the aim of this review article is to highlight the use of EPF as biocontrol tools against each other. EPF are generally characterized by having a wide range of hosts which made them the perfect candidate for biological control missions. They are existing in abundance in the environment and involved in plenty of environmental interactions. They have prestigious enzymatic machinery and toxins that contribute as killing tools. Moreover. after penetrating the insect. the expanded vegetative growth of hyphal bodies enabling the invasion of the fungi throughout the entire tissues of host insect cause physic. histolytic. and pathologic changes ultimately leading to the death of the host insect. On the other hand. some insects can kill harmful fungal strains using their secreted products such as peptides. In this review. the use of fungi and insects as biological control agents against each other was described. Furthermore. the history of using EPF for this purpose. their killing mechanism. host range. and the factors affecting EPF virulence were highlighted. Moreover. the role of insect’s immunology and some insect’s products as antifungal agents was presented focusing on peptides with biological activities against fungi.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of wax comb age on the morphological and biological characteristics of honeybee workers and their relationship with comb morphology and honey production. For this purpose. we used combs with different age ranging from new (0year old) to 7years old. The results revealed that hexagonal cell volume. inner cell diameter. etc.. significantly became smaller with increasing comb age. As the consequence. honeybee workers produced from older combs significantly had a lighter body weight. shorter proboscis. smaller tibia. tarsus and forewings. Also. the sizes of mandibular glands. hypopharyngeal glands. and second wax glands were significantly decreased when bees were emerged from older combs. However. the exuvium and wax weights. and the height of hexagonal cell base were significantly greater in older combs. Furhter. comb age had a significant impact on brood rearing; worker and drone brood areas were smaller in older combs. Finally. total honey yields were found to decrease significantly with increasing comb age.

Kyushu University,Sugar beet is attacked by many mischievous insect pests. To avoid too much reliance on pesticides. many studies have been conducted to search alternative methods of sugar beet pest control. In the present study. we evaluated whether pant fertilization and biological control could be efficacious techniques to suppress insect pests of sugar beet. In two successive growing seasons of 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. we investigated the impacts of Nutrimix® complete. a foliar fertilizer with concentrated micronutrients including nitrogen and sulfur. and also release of the common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea larvae. a generalist predator of insect herbivores. on insect pest infestation in the sugar beet fields. Applications of the foliar fertilizer significantly decreased the percentages of plants infested by cotton leaf worms or sugar beet beetles. while the infestations by sugar beet flies and the sugar beet moths were less influenced. Releasing the predator C. carnea in sugar beet fields was found to effectively reduce pest populations though the effectiveness depended on the seasons. The plants in lacewing–released plots were attacked by fewer aphids. sugar beet moths. leafhoppers and sugar beet flies than those in control plots. Aphid populations were the most influenced. and the reduction percentages reached 100% in the 2015–2016 season and 97.08% in 2016–2017 after 14 days of release. while the sugar beet flies were the least influenced with 64.84% and 49.88% reduction in the first and second seasons. respectively.

Faculty of Agriculture,Water stress and nitrogen deficiency are two constraints that negatively affect growth and productivity of wheat plants. Moreover. the interaction between these two stresses could affect the susceptibility of wheat plants to insect attack. In order to examine the influence of drought stress and nitrogen fertilization on piercing-sucking insect pests. the population abundance of four cereal aphid species; English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. wheat aphid Schizaphis graminum. Bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. and corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis has been monitored in two water treatments (water stress and well-watered) and two nitrogen levels (120 and 180 kg N ha-1). Results revealed that S. graminum was the most dominant specie in all treatments. followed by S. avenae. The population of all aphids tends to increase in the second half of the season coinciding with the emergence of wheat spikes. Stressed-wheat plants attracted more aphids. especially when water deficit synchronizes with an increase in N fertilization. Aphids vigorously thrive better on stressed plants amended with high nitrogen level. Contrary. the lower infestation rate was observed in well-watered plots with lower nitrogen rate. Plant characteristics. such as days to heading. plant height. and chlorophyll content were significantly decreased in drought-stressed plants. while higher N rates increased such parameters.

Sharma and Niraj Singh and Anjan Barman,1,Phytopathology Research,23,1-11,BioMed Central,Ralstonia solanacearum causes a lethal bacterial wilt disease in numerous plants including important vegetable crops such as eggplant and tomato. One of the difficulties in studying virulence of this bacterium in different host plants is the development of an easy and stable pathogenicity assay. Recently we described a leaf-clip inoculation method to study its pathogenicity at the cotyledon stage of tomato seedlings. Hereafter. we demonstrated the leaf-clip inoculation method to be equally efficient for studying R. solanacearum pathogenicity in the cotyledon stage of eggplant seedlings. Our study revealed eggplant seedlings to be highly susceptible to R. solanacearum as compared to tomato seedlings. illustrated by appearance of disease symptoms in significantly higher number of seedlings. We also tested the virulence of several global transcription regulator mutants of R. solanacearum including hrpB. hrpG and phcA in eggplant seedlings. The phcA mutant was found to be only moderately virulence deficient in eggplant seedlings but was significantly reduced in virulence in tomato. This is indicative of some host specific responses towards certain pathogenicity functions of R. solanacearum. which are markedly different in tomato and eggplant seedlings. Apart from being economical in requiring less labor. time and space. this simple gnotobiotic leaf-clip inoculation method is anticipated to be helpful in further exploring the interaction between R. solanacearum and eggplant seedlings at the cotyledon stage.,True,LuNoOxIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,3,https://phytopatholres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42483-019-0030-x,14194034778851233221,/scholar?cites=14194034778851233221,,https://phytopatholres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42483-019-0030-x,0,0,0

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). an essential armoury of plant innate immunity located in their plasma membranes. recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induce PRR-triggered immunity (PTI) within cells. Generally. plant PRRs include Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or Receptor-like Proteins (RLPs). which may associate with other regulatory kinases and readily phosphorylate target proteins during downstream signaling processes. As phosphorylation set off key events of immune signaling. tight regulation of RLK/RLP functions become crucial for plant’s own safety. for continued triggering of immune responses can severely injure host’s tissues.

1073334,Some Conspicuous Traits in Domesticated Rice Oryza Sativa. Due To Recessive Alleles,2016,Anjan Barman and Lingaraj Sahoo and Suvendra Kumar Ray,,,,,,Evolutionarily organisms are bestowed with salient morphological features which are considered to be an outcome of activity of functional gene products. However. there are several important features present in organisms owing to recessive alleles in specific gene loci. Interestingly. prevalence of such features due to recessive alleles of gene (s) raises intriguing questions in regard to evolution of the functional alleles in organisms! To have some understanding of this unique phenomenon. we examined four frequently confronted recessive traits in rice plant (Oryza sativa) such as (i) fragrance (ii) semi-dwarf height (iii) resistance to pathogens and (iv) non-seed shattering feature and discussed in brief the genetics. biochemistry and evolutionary significance of these traits in rice. These important traits in rice are due to mutations in genes such as BADH2. sd1. Xa13 and seed-shattering loci respectively. that otherwise encode essential functional attributes in plant systems. Genes with paralogs possibly attribute to recessive traits through their differential expression patterns.

A selected number of naïve T cells that recognize a specific antigen may proliferate into expanded clones. differentiate. and acquire an effector phenotype. Despite growing experimental knowledge. certain mechanistic aspects of T cell behavior in lymph nodes remain poorly understood. Computational modeling approaches may help in addressing such gaps. Here we introduce an agent-based model describing T cell movements and their interactions with DCs. leading to activation and expansion of cognate T cell clones. in a two-dimensional representation of the lymph node paracortex. The primary objective was to test the putative role of T cell chemotaxis towards DCs. and quantitatively assess the impact of chemotaxis with respect to T cell priming efficacy. Firstly. we evaluated whether chemotaxis of naïve T cells towards a nearest DC may accelerate the scanning process. by quantifying. through simulations. the number of unique T cell – DC contact events. We demonstrate that. in the presence of naïve T cell-to-DC chemoattraction. a higher total number of contacts occurs. as compared to a T cell random walk scenario. However. the forming swarm of naïve T cells. as these cells get attracted to the neighborhood of a DC. may then physically restrict access of additional T cells to the DC. leading to an actual decrease in the cumulative number of unique contacts between naïve T cells and DCs. Secondly. we investigated the potential role of chemotaxis in maintaining cognate T cell clone expansion …,True,eT28Zg4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01289/full,13188861463646654797,/scholar?cites=13188861463646654797,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01289/full,0,0,0

These influences are present from early stages of nursery development and throughout the life of the tree. Reduced root systems from root loss or constriction can reduce stability and increase stress. Natural infection of urban tree roots after severing has not been shown to lead to extensive decay development. Roots often conflict with infrastructure in urban areas because of proximity.

Although not lethal. these accidents are reported to be extremely painful. In order to understand the toxinology of the Brazilian urchins. a peptidomic approach was performed aiming to characterize the naturally occurring peptides in both the coelomic fluid and the spine.  Methods  Animals were collected without gender distinction and samples of the coelomic fluid and spines extracted were analyzed by RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry for peptide de novo sequencing.  Results  Several peptides were identified either in the coelomic fluid or the spine extract (except for E. lucunter). The peptide sequences were aligned with public deposited sequences and possible functions were inferred. Moreover. some peptides can be cryptides. since their sequences were identified within functional proteins. for example thymosin from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.  Conclusions  Although preliminary. the peptidomic approach presented here reports. for the first time. the abundance of novel biological molecules derived from these animals.
