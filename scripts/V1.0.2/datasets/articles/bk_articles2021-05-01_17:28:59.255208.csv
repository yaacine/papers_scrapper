The system extracts pyramid of histogram of gradients (PHOG) and local phase quantisation (LPQ) features for encoding the shape and appearance information. For selecting the key frames. K-means clustering is applied to the normalised shape vectors derived from constraint local model (CLM) based face tracking on the image sequences. Shape vectors closest to the cluster centers are then used to extract the shape and appearance features. We demonstrate the results on the SSPNET GEMEP-FERA dataset.

Global optimization algorithms address this problem. but at the cost of greatly increased training times. This work examines combining gradient descent with the global optimization technique of simulated annealing (SA). Simulated annealing in the form of noise and weight decay is added to resiliant backpropagation (RPROP). a powerful gradient descent algorithm for training feedforward neural networks. The resulting algorithm.

1277494,Fuzzy rule interpolation for multidimensional input spaces with applications: A case study,2005,Kok Wai Wong and Domonkos Tikk and Tamás D Gedeon and László T Kóczy,13,IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems,6,809-819,IEEE,Fuzzy rule based systems have been very popular in many engineering applications. However. when generating fuzzy rules from the available information. this may result in a sparse fuzzy rule base. Fuzzy rule interpolation techniques have been established to solve the problems encountered in processing sparse fuzzy rule bases. In most engineering applications. the use of more than one input variable is common. however. the majority of the fuzzy rule interpolation techniques only present detailed analysis to one input variable case. This paper investigates characteristics of two selected fuzzy rule interpolation techniques for multidimensional input spaces and proposes an improved fuzzy rule interpolation technique to handle multidimensional input spaces. The three methods are compared by means of application examples in the field of petroleum engineering and mineral processing.

Denoising is a crucial step to increase image quality and to improve the performance of all the tasks needed for quantitative imaging analysis. The method proposed in this paper is based on a 3-D optimized blockwise version of the nonlocal (NL)-means filter (Buades. . 2005). The NL-means filter uses the redundancy of information in the image under study to remove the noise. The performance of the NL-means filter has been already demonstrated for 2-D images. but reducing the computational burden is a critical aspect to extend the method to 3-D images. To overcome this problem. we propose improvements to reduce the computational complexity.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is subject to random noise yielding measures that are different from their real values. and thus biasing the subsequently estimated tensors. The Non-Local Means (NLMeans) filter has recently been proposed to denoise MRI with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This filter has been shown to allow the best restoration of image intensities for the estimation of diffusion tensors (DT) compared to state-of-the-art methods. However. for DW-MR images with high b-values (and thus low SNR). the noise. which is strictly Rician-distributed. can no longer be approximated as additive white Gaussian. as implicitly assumed in the classical formulation of the NLMeans. High b-values are typically used in high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) or q-space imaging (QSI). for which an optimal restoration is critical.

Several approaches have been developed to recover the unknown sparse vectors from the given observations. including thresholding. simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP). and convex relaxation based on a mixed matrix norm. Typically. worst case analysis is carried out in order to analyze conditions under which the algorithms are able to recover any jointly sparse set of vectors. However. such an approach is not able to provide insights into why joint sparse recovery is superior to applying standard sparse reconstruction methods to each channel individually. Previous work considered an average case analysis of thresholding and SOMP by imposing a probability model on the measured signals.

By exploiting sparsity in the delay-Doppler domain. CS-based channel estimation allows for an increase in spectral efficiency through a reduction of the number of pilot symbols. For combating leakage effects that limit the delay-Doppler sparsity. we propose a sparsity-enhancing basis expansion and a method for optimizing the basis with or without prior statistical information about the channel.

Many recovery algorithms are known to succeed when the restricted isometry constants of the sampling matrix are small. Many potential applications of compressed sensing involve a data-acquisition process that proceeds by convolution with a random pulse followed by (nonrandom) subsampling. At present. the theoretical analysis of this measurement technique is lacking.

Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes. as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a\textit {critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token. given the policy of an\textit {actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase. and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU.

1277532,Probabilistic model-agnostic meta-learning,2018,Chelsea Finn* and Kelvin Xu* and Sergey Levine,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.02817,,,,Meta-learning for few-shot learning entails acquiring a prior over previous tasks and experiences. such that new tasks be learned from small amounts of data. However. a critical challenge in few-shot learning is task ambiguity: even when a powerful prior can be meta-learned from a large number of prior tasks. a small dataset for a new task can simply be too ambiguous to acquire a single model (eg. a classifier) for that task that is accurate. In this paper. we propose a probabilistic meta-learning algorithm that can sample models for a new task from a model distribution. Our approach extends model-agnostic meta-learning. which adapts to new tasks via gradient descent. to incorporate a parameter distribution that is trained via a variational lower bound. At meta-test time. our algorithm adapts via a simple procedure that injects noise into gradient descent. and at meta-training time. the model is trained such that this stochastic adaptation procedure produces samples from the approximate model posterior.

In many real-world tasks. designing a reward function takes considerable hand engineering and often requires additional sensors to be installed just to measure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore. many interesting tasks consist of multiple implicit intermediate steps that must be executed in sequence.

In this paper we propose to generalize these recently proposed end-to-end active visual recognizers into a controller-recognizer framework. A model in the controller-recognizer framework consists of a controller. which interfaces with an external manipulator. and a recognizer which classifies the visual input adjusted by the manipulator. We describe two most recently proposed controller-recognizer models: recurrent attention model and spatial transformer network as representative examples of controller-recognizer models. Based on this description we observe that most existing end-to-end controller-recognizers tightly. or completely. couple a controller and recognizer. We ask a question whether this tight coupling is necessary. and try to answer this empirically by building a controller-recognizer model with a decoupled controller and recognizer. Our experiments revealed that it is not always necessary to tightly couple them and that by decoupling a controller and recognizer. there is a possibility of building a generic controller that is pretrained and works together with any subsequent recognizer.,True,GyoKzFwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06428,16034712265862757441,/scholar?cites=16034712265862757441,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06428,0,0,0

Several techniques have been proposed to counter face spoofing. however a robust solution that is computationally efficient is still unavailable. This paper presents a new approach for spoofing detection in face videos using motion magnification. Eulerian motion magnification approach is used to enhance the facial expressions commonly exhibited by subjects in a captured video. Next. two types of feature extraction algorithms are proposed:(i) a configuration of LBP that provides improved performance compared to other computationally expensive texture based approaches and (ii) motion estimation approach using HOOF descriptor. On the Print Attack and Replay Attack spoofing datasets. the proposed framework improves the state-of-art performance; especially HOOF descriptor yielding a near perfect half total error rate of 0% and 1.25% respectively.,True,okqK5UAAAAAJ:sfnaS5RM6jYC,230,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_workshops_2013/W02/html/Bharadwaj_Computationally_Efficient_Face_2013_CVPR_paper.html,5741243058834848337,/scholar?cites=5741243058834848337,,,https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_workshops_2013/W02/papers/Bharadwaj_Computationally_Efficient_Face_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key angiogenic factor. During tumor development. TAMs secrete VEGF and other factors to promote angiogenesis; thus. anti-treatment against TAMs and VEGF can repress cancer development. which has been demonstrated in clinical trials and on an experimental level. In the present work. we show that miR-150 is an oncomir because of its promotional effect on VEGF. MiR-150 targets TAMs to up-regulate their secretion of VEGF in vitro. With the utilization of cell-derived vesicles. named microvesicles (MVs). we transferred antisense RNA targeted to miR-150 into mice and found that the neutralization of miR-150 down-regulates miR-150 and VEGF levels in vivo and attenuates angiogenesis.

Within the system. only HSCs possess the ability of both multipotency and self‐renewal. Multipotency is the ability to differentiate into all functional blood cells. Self‐renewal is the ability to give rise to HSC itself without differentiation. Since mature blood cells (MBCs) are predominantly short‐lived. HSCs continuously provide more differentiated progenitors while properly maintaining the HSC pool size throughout life by precisely balancing self‐renewal and differentiation.

To directly test this. we quantified DNA damage in HSCs and downstream progenitors from young and old mice. revealing that strand breaks significantly accrue in HSCs during aging. DNA damage accumulation in HSCs was associated with broad attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways that was dependent upon HSC quiescence. Accordingly. cycling fetal HSCs and adult HSCs driven into cycle upregulated these pathways leading to repair of strand breaks.

In prior research. the natural tendency has been to assume that the behaviors of English users generalize to other language users. We studied 62 million tweets collected over a four-week period and found that more than 100 languages were used. Only half of the tweets were in English (51%). Other popular languages including Japanese. Portuguese. Indonesian. and Spanish together accounted for 39% of the tweets. Examining users of the top 10 languages. we discovered cross-language differences in adoption of features such as URLs. hashtags. mentions. replies. and retweets.

We present an approach to organizing a user's own feed into coherently clustered trending topics for more directed exploration. Our Twitter client. called Eddi. groups tweets in a user's feed into topics mentioned explicitly or implicitly. which users can then browse for items of interest. To implement this topic clustering. we have developed a novel algorithm for discovering topics in short status updates powered by linguistic syntactic transformation and callouts to a search engine. An algorithm evaluation reveals that search engine callouts outperform other approaches when they employ simple syntactic transformation and backoff strategies.

BD is a long-standing problem. but has attracted much attention recently. cumulating in several algorithms able to restore photos degraded by real camera motion in high quality. In this paper. we present a benchmark dataset for motion deblurring that allows quantitative performance evaluation and comparison of recent approaches featuring non-uniform blur models.

In this work. we deal with space-invariant nonblind deconvolution. Currently. the most successful methods involve a regularized inversion of the blur in Fourier domain as a first step. This step amplifies and colors the noise. and corrupts the image information. In a second (and arguably more difficult) step. one then needs to remove the colored noise. typically using a cleverly engineered algorithm. However. the methods based on this two-step approach do not properly address the fact that the image information has been corrupted. In this work. we also rely on a two-step procedure. but learn the second step on a large dataset of natural images. using a neural network.

However. although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist. they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers. multi-marker associations are often hard to detect. and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA. a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model. to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn’s Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis. identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn’s Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate.

1277595,Task clustering and gating for Bayesian multitask learning,2003,BJ Bakker and TM Heskes,,,,,,Modeling a collection of similar regression or classification tasks can be improved by making the tasks ‘learn from each other’. In machine learning. this subject is approached through ‘multitask learning’. where parallel tasks are modeled as multiple outputs of the same network. In multilevel analysis this is generally implemented through the mixed-effects linear model where a distinction is made between ‘fixed effects’. which are the same for all tasks. and ‘random effects’. which may vary between tasks. In the present article we will adopt a Bayesian approach in which some of the model parameters are shared (the same for all tasks) and others more loosely connected through a joint prior distribution that can be learned from the data. We seek in this way to combine the best parts of both the statistical multilevel approach and the neural network machinery. The standard assumption expressed in both approaches is that each task can learn equally well from any other task. In this article we extend the model by allowing more differentiation in the similarities between tasks. One such extension is to make the prior mean depend on higher-level task characteristics. More unsupervised clustering of tasks is obtained if we go from a single Gaussian prior to a mixture of Gaussians. This can be further generalized to a mixture of experts architecture with the gates depending on task characteristics.

For planning of personnel in large department stores. a reliable estimate of the expected number of clients can make significant savings. In addition to good prediction. it is crucial to assess the confidence of the prediction as well: From a cost saving perspective it is quite important to know. whether the predicted sales are 100±1 or±10.

The environment from which the network learns is defined as a set of input stimuli. At discrete points in time. one of these stimuli is presented and an incremental learning step takes place. If the time between learning steps is drawn from a Poisson distribution. the dynamics of an ensemble of learning processes is described by a continuous-time master equation. A learning algorithm that enables a neural network to adapt to a changing environment must have a nonzero learning parameter. This constant adaptability. however. goes at cost of fluctuations in the plasticities. such as synapses and thresholds.

However. training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference. vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings. these issues are tightly coupled with the large. sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph.

1277625,Energy-aware scheduling in virtualized datacenters,2010,Inigo Goiri and Ferran Julia and Ramon Nou and Josep Ll Berral and Jordi Guitart and Jordi Torres,,,,58-67,IEEE,The reduction of energy consumption in large-scale datacenters is being accomplished through an extensive use of virtualization. which enables the consolidation of multiple workloads in a smaller number of machines. Nevertheless. virtualization also incurs some additional overheads (e.g. virtual machine creation and migration) that can influence what is the best consolidated configuration. and thus. they must be taken into account. In this paper. we present a dynamic job scheduling policy for power-aware resource allocation in a virtualized datacenter. Our policy tries to consolidate workloads from separate machines into a smaller number of nodes. while fulfilling the amount of hardware resources needed to preserve the quality of service of each job. This allows turning off the spare servers. thus reducing the overall datacenter power consumption. As a novelty. this policy incorporates all the virtualization …,True,waODsw0AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,137,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5600320/,11015280655369020252,/scholar?cites=11015280655369020252,,,https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/9957/05600320.pdf%3Bjsessionid%3D52D71301F589CCDC8011953421331D76?sequence%3D1,0,0,0
1277626,Using virtualization to improve software rejuvenation,2009,Luis Moura Silva and Javier Alonso and Jordi Torres,58,IEEE Transactions on Computers,11,1525-1538,IEEE,In this paper. we present an approach for software rejuvenation based on automated self-healing techniques that can be easily applied to off-the-shelf application servers. Software aging and transient failures are detected through continuous monitoring of system data and performability metrics of the application server. If some anomalous behavior is identified. the system triggers an automatic rejuvenation action. This self-healing scheme is meant to disrupt the running service for a minimal amount of time. achieving zero downtime in most cases. In our scheme. we exploit the usage of virtualization to optimize the self-recovery actions. The techniques described in this paper have been tested with a set of open-source Linux tools and the XEN virtualization middleware.

A core technology for making the Semantic Web happen. but also to leverage application areas like Knowledge Management and E-Business. is the field of Semantic Annotation. which turns human-understandable content into a machine understandable form. This book reports on the broad range of technologies that are used to achieve this translation and nourish 3rd millennium applications.

It continues with several techniques for the explicit construction of semantic annotations. including approaches for collaboration and Semantic Web metadata. One of the major means for improving the semantic annotation task is information extraction and much can be learned from the semantic tagging of linguistic corpora.

Impressive examples of this development can be found in domains such as image classification. sentiment analysis. speech understanding or strategic game playing.

The non-stationarities in the signal may come from many different sources. for instance. electrode artefacts. muscular activity or changes of task involvement. and often deteriorate classification performance. This is mainly because features extracted by standard methods like common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant to variations of the signal properties. thus should also change over time.

1277646,Explainable AI: Interpreting. explaining and visualizing deep learning,2019,Wojciech Samek and Grégoire Montavon and Andrea Vedali and Lars Kai Hansen and Klaus-Robert Müller,11700,,,,Springer Nature,The development of “intelligent” systems that can take decisions and perform autonomously might lead to faster and more consistent decisions. A limiting factor for a broader adoption of AI technology is the inherent risks that come with giving up human control and oversight to “intelligent” machines. For sensitive tasks involving critical infrastructures and affecting human well-being or health. it is crucial to limit the possibility of improper. non-robust and unsafe decisions and actions. Before deploying an AI system. we see a strong need to validate its behavior. and thus establish guarantees that it will continue to perform as expected when deployed in a real-world environment. In pursuit of that objective. ways for humans to verify the agreement between the AI decision structure and their own ground-truth knowledge have been explored. Explainable AI (XAI) has developed as a subfield of AI. focused on exposing complex AI models to humans in a systematic and interpretable manner. The 22 chapters included in this book provide a timely snapshot of algorithms. theory. and applications of interpretable and explainable AI and AI techniques that have been proposed recently reflecting the current discourse in this field and providing directions of future development.

The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious ‘black boxes’ do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions.We propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's relevance for the outcome of the decision.DNN achieves classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA.

Machine learning (ML) models have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts. allowing to annotate very large text collections. more than could be processed by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text’s category very accurately. it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the categorization process takes place. In this paper. we demonstrate that such understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). a recently developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear classifiers. We train two word-based ML models. a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier. on a topic categorization task and adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words. Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these document vectors. we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show that. although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of classification accuracy. the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially …,True,7aQwO08AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC,206,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181142,1499598663579284939,/scholar?cites=1499598663579284939,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181142,0,0,0

Although state-of-the-art human detectors have demonstrated good performance. small errors in localization and recognition are inevitable. These errors can cause failures for a single-person pose estimator (SPPE). especially for methods that solely depend on human detection results. In this paper. we propose a novel regional multi-person pose estimation (RMPE) framework to facilitate pose estimation in the presence of inaccurate human bounding boxes. Our framework consists of three components: Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN). Parametric Pose Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS). and Pose-Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG).

While their performance increases with the increasing number of layers and neurons. it is crucial to design an efficient deep architecture in order to reduce computational and memory costs. Designing an efficient neural network. however. is labor intensive requiring many experiments. and fine-tunings. In this paper. we introduce network trimming which iteratively optimizes the network by pruning unimportant neurons based on analysis of their outputs on a large dataset. Our algorithm is inspired by an observation that the outputs of a significant portion of neurons in a large network are mostly zero. regardless of what inputs the network received. These zero activation neurons are redundant. and can be removed without affecting the overall accuracy of the network. After pruning the zero activation neurons. we retrain the network using the weights before pruning as initialization. We alternate the pruning and retraining to further reduce zero activations in a network. Our experiments on the LeNet and VGG-16 show that we can achieve high compression ratio of parameters without losing or even achieving higher accuracy than the original network.,True,nFhLmFkAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,429,https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03250,6940912612242167520,/scholar?cites=6940912612242167520,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.03250,0,0,0

The proposed algorithm estimates the multi-view stereo correspondences with sub-pixel accuracy using the cost volume. The foundation for constructing accurate costs is threefold. First. the sub-aperture images are displaced using the phase shift theorem. Second. the gradient costs are adaptively aggregated using the angular coordinates of the light field. Third. the feature correspondences between the sub-aperture images are used as additional constraints. With the cost volume. the multi-label optimization propagates and corrects the depth map in the weak texture regions. Finally. the local depth map is iteratively refined through fitting the local quadratic function to estimate a non-discrete depth map. Because micro-lens images contain unexpected distortions. a method is also proposed that corrects this error.

They have demonstrated superior results over previous works that utilize hand-crafted low level features for saliency detection. In this paper. we demonstrate that the hand-crafted features can provide complementary effects to enhance performance of saliency detection that utilizes only high level features. Our method utilizes both high level and low level features for saliency detection under a unified deep learning framework. The high level features are extracted using the VGG-net. and the low level features are compared with other parts of an image to form a low level distance map. The low level distance map is then encoded using a CNN with multiple 1* 1 convolutional and ReLU layers. We concatenate the encoded low level distance map and the high level features. and connect them to a fully connected neural network classifier to evaluate the saliency of a query region.

Under large magnification. however. textured regions become blurred and appear homogenous. resulting in a super-resolution image that looks unnatural. Alternatively. learning-based SR approaches use a large database of exemplar images for “hallucinating” detail. The quality of the upsampled image. especially about edges. is dependent on the suitability of the training images. This paper aims to combine the benefits of edge-directed SR with those of learning-based SR. In particular. we propose an approach to extend edge-directed super-resolution to include detail from an image/texture example provided by the user (e.g.. from the Internet). A significant benefit of our approach is that only a single exemplar image is required to supply the missing detail - strong edges are obtained in the SR image even if …,True,nFhLmFkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,331,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5539933/,4630902319735797357,/scholar?cites=4630902319735797357,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.187.5872&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This projective motion path blur model is more effective at modeling the spatially varying motion blur exhibited by ego motion than conventional methods based on space-invariant blur kernels. To correct the blurred image. we describe how to modify the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm to incorporate this new blur model.

Our main idea is to represent a saliency map of an image as a linear combination of high-dimensional color space where salient regions and backgrounds can be distinctively separated. This is based on an observation that salient regions often have distinctive colors compared to the background in human perception. but human perception is often complicated and highly nonlinear. By mapping a low dimensional RGB color to a feature vector in a high-dimensional color space. we show that we can linearly separate the salient regions from the background by finding an optimal linear combination of color coefficients in the high-dimensional color space. Our high dimensional color space incorporates multiple color representations including RGB. CIELab. HSV and with gamma corrections to enrich its representative power.

The method is based on a two stages pipeline. First. a general activity recognition classifier is personalized for an specific user using a small sample of her/his walking pattern. As a result. the system is much more selective with respect to the new walking pattern. A second stage verifies whether the user is an authorized one or not. This stage is defined as a one-class classification problem. In order to solve this problem. a four-layer architecture is built around the geometric concept of convex hull. This architecture allows to improve robustness to outliers. modeling non-convex shapes. and to take into account temporal coherence information.

Given a multiclass problem. the ECOC technique designs a code word for each class. where each position of the code identifies the membership of the class for a given binary problem. A classification decision is obtained by assigning the label of the class with the closest code. One of the main requirements of the ECOC design is that the base classifier is capable of splitting each subgroup of classes from each binary problem. However. we cannot guarantee that a linear classifier model convex regions. Furthermore. nonlinear classifiers also fail to manage some type of surfaces.

And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch. which means it's as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference. only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed. therefore our models are nearly 16x smaller than full-precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks. which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit.

The situation gets even worse with distributed training on mobile devices (federated learning). which suffers from higher latency. lower throughput. and intermittent poor connections. In this paper. we find 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD is redundant. and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to greatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during compression. DGC employs four methods: momentum correction. local gradient clipping. momentum factor masking. and warm-up training. We have applied Deep Gradient Compression to image classification. speech recognition. and language modeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10. ImageNet. Penn Treebank. and Librispeech Corpus. On these scenarios. Deep Gradient Compression achieves a gradient compression ratio from 270x to 600x without losing accuracy. cutting the gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35 MB. and for DeepSpeech from 488MB to 0.74 MB.

In this paper. we analyze the object detection from video and point out that mAP alone is not sufficient to capture the temporal nature of video object detection. To tackle this problem. we propose a comprehensive metric. Average Delay (AD). to measure and compare detection delay. To facilitate delay evaluation. we carefully select a subset of ImageNet VID. which we name as ImageNet VIDT with an emphasis on complex trajectories. By extensively evaluating a wide range of detectors on VIDT. we show that most methods drastically increase the detection delay but still preserve mAP well.

However. the presence of inaccurate class labels is known to deteriorate the performance of even the best classifiers in a broad range of classification problems. Noisy labels also tend to be more harmful than noisy attributes. When the observed label is noisy. we can view the correct label as a latent random variable and model the noise processes by a communication channel with unknown parameters. Thus we can apply the EM algorithm to find the parameters of both the network and the noise and to estimate the correct label. In this study we present a neural-network approach that optimizes the same likelihood function as optimized by the EM algorithm. The noise is explicitly modeled by an additional softmax layer that connects the correct labels to the noisy ones. This scheme is then extended to the case where the noisy labels are dependent on the features in addition to the correct labels.

Like rectified linear units (ReLUs). leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs). ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However. ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs. ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values. too. they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore. ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input. while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments. ELUs lead not only to faster learning. but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers.

The activation function of SNNs are"" scaled exponential linear units""(SELUs). which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem. we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance--even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers.(2) employ strong regularization. and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore. for activations not close to unit variance. we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance. thus. vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository. on (b) drug discovery benchmarks. and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines.

This challenge comprised 12.000 environmental chemicals and drugs which were measured for 12 different toxic effects by specifically designed assays. We participated in this challenge to assess the performance of Deep Learning in computational toxicity prediction. Deep Learning has already revolutionized image processing. speech recognition. and language understanding but has not yet been applied to computational toxicity. Deep Learning is founded on novel algorithms and architectures for artificial neural networks together with the recent availability of very fast computers and massive datasets. It discovers multiple levels of distributed representations of the input. with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. We hypothesized that the construction of a hierarchy of chemical features gives Deep Learning the edge over other toxicity prediction methods. Furthermore. Deep Learning naturally enables multi-task learning. that is. learning of all toxic effects in one neural network and thereby learning of highly informative chemical features. In order to utilize Deep Learning for toxicity prediction. we have developed the DeepTox pipeline. First. DeepTox normalizes the chemical representations of the compounds. Then it computes a large number of chemical descriptors that are used as input to machine learning methods. In its next step. DeepTox trains models. evaluates them. and combines the best of them to ensembles. Finally. DeepTox predicts the toxicity of new compounds.

Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks.

One recent popular approach is to train end-to-end models on a large amount of real dialog transcripts between humans (Sordoni et al.. 2015; Vinyals & Le. 2015; Shang et al.. 2015). However. this approach leaves many questions unanswered as an understanding of the precise successes and shortcomings of each model is hard to assess. A contrasting recent proposal are the bAbI tasks (Weston et al.. 2015b) which are synthetic data that measure the ability of learning machines at various reasoning tasks over toy language. Unfortunately. those tests are very small and hence may encourage methods that do not scale. In this work. we propose a suite of new tasks of a much larger scale that attempt to bridge the gap between the two regimes. Choosing the domain of movies. we provide tasks that test the ability of models to answer factual questions (utilizing OMDB). provide personalization (utilizing MovieLens). carry short conversations about the two. and finally to perform on natural dialogs from Reddit. We provide a dataset covering 75k movie entities and with 3.5 M training examples.

Some conclusions from these results include that byte-level one-hot encoding based on UTF-8 consistently produces competitive results for convolutional networks. that word-level n-grams linear models are competitive even without perfect word segmentation. and that fastText provides the best result using character-level n-gram encoding but can overfit when the features are overly rich.,True,n4QjVfoAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C,41,https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02657,4743439774711062635,/scholar?cites=4743439774711062635,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02657,0,0,0

This task is ill-posed in the sense that assigning the colors to a grayscale image without any prior knowledge is ambiguous. Most of the previous methods require some amount of user interventions. making colorization a hard work. Motivated by this. a novel automatic grayscale image colorization method based on histogram regression is presented in this paper. A source image is adopted to provide the color information. Locally weighted regression is performed on both the grayscale image and the source image. Thus. the feature distributions of two images can be obtained. Then. a new matching method is proposed to align these features by finding and adjusting the zero-points of the histogram.

Sentences in reviews. however. are usually classified independently. even though they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively. sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the review structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification of each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review with a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM.

We focus on the two most common forms of adaptation. feature extraction (where the pretrained weights are frozen). and directly fine-tuning the pretrained model.

Lample et al.(2018) recently proposed a fully unsupervised machine translation (MT) model. The model relies heavily on an adversarial. unsupervised alignment of word embedding spaces for bilingual dictionary induction (Conneau et al.. 2018). which we examine here. Our results identify the limitations of current unsupervised MT: unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction performs much worse on morphologically rich languages that are not dependent marking. when monolingual corpora from different domains or different embedding algorithms are used. We show that a simple trick. exploiting a weak supervision signal from identical words. enables more robust induction. and establish a near-perfect correlation between unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction performance and a previously unexplored graph similarity metric.,True,8ONXPV8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,147,https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03620,1427533216601294786,/scholar?cites=1427533216601294786,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03620,0,0,0
1277744,Sluice networks: Learning what to share between loosely related tasks,2017,Sebastian Ruder and Joachim Bingel and Isabelle Augenstein and Anders Søgaard,2,arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.08142,,,,Multi-task learning is partly motivated by the observation that humans bring to bear what they know about related problems when solving new ones. Similarly. deep neural networks can profit from related tasks by sharing parameters with other networks. However. humans do not consciously decide to transfer knowledge between tasks (and are typically not aware of the transfer). In machine learning. it is hard to estimate if sharing will lead to improvements; especially if tasks are only loosely related. To overcome this. we introduce SLUICE NETWORKS. a general framework for multi-task learning where trainable parameters control the amount of sharing–including which parts of the models to share. Our framework goes beyond and generalizes over previous proposals in enabling hard or soft sharing of all combinations of subspaces. layers. and skip connections. We perform experiments on three task pairs from natural language processing. and across seven different domains. using data from OntoNotes 5.0. and achieve up to 15% average error reductions over common approaches to multi-task learning. We analyze when the architecture is particularly helpful. as well as its ability to fit noise. We show that a) label entropy is predictive of gains in sluice networks. confirming findings for hard parameter sharing. and b) while sluice networks easily fit noise. they are robust across domains in practice.,True,8ONXPV8AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,125,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14807483061924363954&hl=en&oi=scholarr,14807483061924363954,/scholar?cites=14807483061924363954,,,,0,0,0

This generalization ability has been attributed to the use of a shared subword vocabulary and joint training across multiple languages giving rise to deep multilingual abstractions. We evaluate this hypothesis by designing an alternative approach that transfers a monolingual model to new languages at the lexical level. More concretely. we first train a transformer-based masked language model on one language. and transfer it to a new language by learning a new embedding matrix with the same masked language modeling objective. freezing parameters of all other layers. This approach does not rely on a shared vocabulary or joint training. However. we show that it is competitive with multilingual BERT on standard cross-lingual classification benchmarks and on a new Cross-lingual Question Answering Dataset (XQuAD). Our results contradict common beliefs of the basis of the generalization ability of multilingual models and suggest that deep monolingual models learn some abstractions that generalize across languages.

However. these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English. and despite an increasing interest in multilingual models. a benchmark that enables the comprehensive evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of languages and tasks is still missing. To this end. we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark. a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks.

However. given a data set. it is a tedious task to optimize the performance of kNN by tuning k. Moreover. the performance of kNN degrades in the presence of class imbalance. a situation characterized by disparate representation from different classes. We aim to address both the issues in this paper and propose a variant of kNN called the Adaptive kNN (Ada-kNN). The Ada-kNN classifier uses the density and distribution of the neighborhood of a test point and learns a suitable point-specific k for it with the help of artificial neural networks. We further improve our proposal by replacing the neural network with a heuristic learning method guided by an indicator of the local density of a test point and using information about its neighboring training points.

Firefly Algorithm (FA) has attracted the attention of many researchers by virtue of its capability of solving complex real-world optimization problems. The only factor restricting the efficiency of this FA algorithm is the need of having balanced exploration and exploitation while searching for the global optima in the search-space.

1277771,Session-based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks,2015,Balázs Hidasi and Alexandros Karatzoglou and Linas Baltrunas and Domonkos Tikk,,International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2016,,,,We apply recurrent neural networks (RNN) on a new domain. namely recommender systems. Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (eg a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations. ie recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session. more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches.,True,j5u5iiYAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC,1052,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06939,10894551747136395106,/scholar?cites=10894551747136395106,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06939,0,0,0

However. most model-based Collaborative Filtering approaches such as Matrix Factorization do not provide a straightforward way of integrating context information into the model. In this work. we introduce a Collaborative Filtering method based on Tensor Factorization. a generalization of Matrix Factorization that allows for a flexible and generic integration of contextual information by modeling the data as a User-Item-Context N-dimensional tensor instead of the traditional 2D User-Item matrix. In the proposed model. called Multiverse Recommendation. different types of context are considered as additional dimensions in the representation of the data as a tensor. The factorization of this tensor leads to a compact model of the data which can be used to provide context-aware recommendations.,True,j5u5iiYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,851,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1864708.1864727,480757109279344916,/scholar?cites=480757109279344916,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34471519/tensorcofi-recsys10.pdf,0,0,0

To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach. Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). which is a well-known information retrieval metric for measuring the performance of top-k recommendations.

Methods that rely on user profiles--such as matrix factorization--perform very poorly in this setting. thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items.

Sweden,Catastrophic forgetting occurs when a neural network loses the information learned in a previous task after training on subsequent tasks. This problem remains a hurdle for artificial intelligence systems with sequential learning capabilities. In this paper. we propose a task-based hard attention mechanism that preserves previous tasks’ information without affecting the current task’s learning. A hard attention mask is learned concurrently to every task. through stochastic gradient descent. and previous masks are exploited to condition such learning. We show that the proposed mechanism is effective for reducing catastrophic forgetting. cutting current rates by 45 to 80%. We also show that it is robust to different hyperparameter choices. and that it offers a number of monitoring capabilities. The approach features the possibility to control both the stability and compactness of the learned knowledge. which we believe makes it also attractive for online learning or network compression applications.,True,j5u5iiYAAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC,231,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a.html?source=post_page---------------------------,11086231050694477723,/scholar?cites=11086231050694477723,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a/serra18a.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we survey a range of online data sets (Twitter feeds. news headlines. and volumes of Google search queries) and sentiment tracking methods (Twitter Investor Sentiment. Negative News Sentiment and Tweet & Google Search volumes of financial terms). and compare their value for financial prediction of market indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. trading volumes. and market volatility (VIX). as well as gold prices. We also compare the predictive power of traditional investor sentiment survey data. ie Investor Intelligence and Daily Sentiment Index. against those of the mentioned set of online sentiment indicators. Our results show that traditional surveys of Investor Intelligence are lagging indicators of the financial markets. However. weekly Google Insight Search volumes on financial search queries do have predictive value. An indicator of Twitter Investor Sentiment and the frequency of occurrence of financial terms on Twitter in the previous 1-2 days are also found to be very statistically significant predictors of daily market log return.

The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios. but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper. we present SRGAN. a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge. it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this. we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition. we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks.

Given this wide range of applications. it is not surprising that a lot of heterogeneity exists in the way these models are formulated. trained. and evaluated. As a consequence. direct comparison between models is often difficult. This article reviews mostly known but often underappreciated properties relating to the evaluation and interpretation of generative models with a focus on image models. In particular. we show that three of the currently most commonly used criteria---average log-likelihood. Parzen window estimates. and visual fidelity of samples---are largely independent of each other when the data is high-dimensional. Good performance with respect to one criterion therefore need not imply good performance with respect to the other criteria. Our results show that extrapolation from one criterion to another is not warranted and generative models need to be evaluated directly with respect to the application (s) they were intended for.

New media formats. changing hardware technology. as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need. but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture. which makes it suitable for high-resolution images.

1277806,Amortised MAP inference for image super-resolution,2016,Casper Kaae Sønderby and Jose Caballero and Lucas Theis and Wenzhe Shi and Ferenc Huszár,,International Conference on Learning Representations,,,,Image super-resolution (SR) is an underdetermined inverse problem. where a large number of plausible high-resolution images can explain the same downsampled image. Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk minimisation. often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. However. the outputs from such methods tend to be blurry. over-smoothed and generally appear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference. preferring solutions that always have a high probability under the image prior. and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR is non-trivial. as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from samples. Furthermore. MAP inference is often performed via optimisation-based iterative algorithms which don't compare well with the efficiency of neural-network-based alternatives. Here we introduce new methods for amortised MAP inference whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a convolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network architecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR solutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always consistent with the low resolution input. We show that. using this architecture. the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the cross-entropy between two distributions. similar to training generative models.

This lack in performance has been attributed to an inability to model the influence of high-level image features such as objects. Recent seminal advances in applying deep neural networks to tasks like object recognition suggests that they are able to capture this kind of structure. However. the enormous amount of training data necessary to train these networks makes them difficult to apply directly to saliency prediction. We present a novel way of reusing existing neural networks that have been pretrained on the task of object recognition in models of fixation prediction. Using the well-known network of Krizhevsky et al.(2012). we come up with a new saliency model that significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models on the MIT Saliency Benchmark.

1277812,HoloGAN: Unsupervised learning of 3D representations from natural images,2019,Thu Nguyen-Phuoc and Chuan Li and Lucas Theis and Christian Richardt and Yong-Liang Yang,,,,7588-7597,,We propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for the task of unsupervised learning of 3D representations from natural images. Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding. such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world. and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs. HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity. which is further decomposed into shape and appearance. while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly. we do not require pose labels. 3D shapes. or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner.,True,dgVYYngAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,126,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Nguyen-Phuoc_HoloGAN_Unsupervised_Learning_of_3D_Representations_From_Natural_Images_ICCV_2019_paper.html,3543213883413950062,/scholar?cites=3543213883413950062,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Nguyen-Phuoc_HoloGAN_Unsupervised_Learning_of_3D_Representations_From_Natural_Images_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

To combat this problem. smoothness constraints. post processing and different architecture designs have been proposed. Odena et al. highlight three sources of checkerboard artifacts: deconvolution overlap. random initialization and loss functions. In this note. we proposed an initialization method for sub-pixel convolution known as convolution NN resize. Compared to sub-pixel convolution initialized with schemes designed for standard convolution kernels. it is free from checkerboard artifacts immediately after initialization. Compared to resize convolution. at the same computational complexity. it has more modelling power and converges to solutions with smaller test errors.,True,dgVYYngAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,95,https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02937,1048267473996980004,/scholar?cites=1048267473996980004,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02937,0,0,0

Furthermore. there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools. to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework. based on unbiased. robust. within-subject template creation. for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points.

In computational neuroimaging where the automated segmentation of brain structures is frequently used to quantify change. a highly accurate registration is necessary for motion correction of images taken in the same session. or across time in longitudinal studies where changes in the images can be expected. This paper. inspired by Nestares and Heeger (2000). presents a method based on robust statistics to register images in the presence of differences. such as jaw movement. differential MR distortions and true anatomical change. The approach we present guarantees inverse consistency (symmetry). can deal with different intensity scales and automatically estimates a sensitivity parameter to detect outlier regions in the images. The resulting registrations are highly accurate due to their ability to ignore outlier regions …,True,CbdJk1wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,916,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910009717,14440734604367765692,/scholar?cites=14440734604367765692,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946852/,0,0,0

Employing the Laplace–Beltrami spectra (not the spectra of the mesh Laplacian) as fingerprints of surfaces and solids is a novel approach. Since the spectrum is an isometry invariant. it is independent of the object's representation including parametrization and spatial position. Additionally. the eigenvalues can be normalized so that uniform scaling factors for the geometric objects can be obtained easily. Therefore. checking if two objects are isometric needs no prior alignment (registration/localization) of the objects but only a comparison of their spectra. In this paper. we describe the computation of the spectra and their comparison for objects represented by NURBS or other parametrized surfaces …,True,CbdJk1wAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,790,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448505001867,591994173813246426,/scholar?cites=591994173813246426,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/35840852/reuter.pdf,0,0,0

The PWM converter is controlled with feedback loops of filter input currents and their derivatives to suppress the transient oscillations caused by the LC filters without inserting damping resistors. Optimum values of feedback gains are investigated. The cut-off frequency of the optimum design is about one seventh of the PWM carrier frequency. and the compensation delay time is two times as large as the carrier period. The performance of the active power filter with the proposed control strategy was confirmed by experiments in which the harmonic currents generated by a phase-controlled bridge converter were compensated.

In the molecular sciences. only a small number of experts with specialized know-how are able to design interactive visualization applications. typically static computer programs that cannot easily be modified.

However. as latencies increase. the size of the instruction window must increase even faster if we are to continue to tolerate these latencies. We have already reached the point where the size of an instruction window that can handle these latencies is prohibitively large in terms of both design complexity and power consumption. And. the problem is getting worse. This paper proposes runahead execution as an effective way to increase memory latency tolerance in an out-of-order processor without requiring an unreasonably large instruction window. Runahead execution unblocks the instruction window blocked by long latency operations allowing the processor to execute far ahead in the program path.

However. reducing voltage in the context of manufacturing-induced parameter variations cancause many types of memory circuits to fail. As a result. voltage scaling is limited by a minimum voltage. often called Vccmin. beyond which circuits may not operate reliably. Large memory structures (e.g.. caches) typically set Vccmin for the whole processor. In this paper. we propose two architectural techniques that enable microprocessor caches (L1and L2). to operate at low voltages despite very high memory cell failure rates. The Word-disable scheme combines two consecutive cache lines. to form a single cache line where only non-failing words are used.

This charge leaks off over time. eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring. DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately. DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases.The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's retention time. In current systems. all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time. resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however. such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's …,True,lqsQH6QAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,304,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2508148.2485928,10686159239871420882,/scholar?cites=10686159239871420882,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.357.7367&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Many multithreaded programs provide opportunities for constructive cache sharing. in which concurrently scheduled threads share a largely overlapping working set. In this paper. we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art schedulers proposed for fine-grained multithreaded programs: Parallel Depth First (PDF). which is specifically designed for constructive cache sharing. and Work Stealing (WS). which is a more traditional design. Our experimental results indicate that PDF scheduling yields a 1.3--1.6 X performance improvement relative to WS for several fine-grain parallel benchmarks on projected future CMP configurations; we also report several issues that may limit the advantage of PDF in certain applications.

We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each round. each client independently computes an update to the current model based on its local data. and communicates this update to a central server. where the client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones. and communication efficiency is of the utmost importance.In this paper. we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates. where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables. eg either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates. where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization. random rotations. and subsampling before sending it to the server.

We propose two single-unit and two block optimization formulations of the sparse PCA problem. aimed at extracting a single sparse dominant principal component of a data matrix. or more components at once. respectively. While the initial formulations involve nonconvex functions. and are therefore computationally intractable. we rewrite them into the form of an optimization program involving maximization of a convex function on a compact set. The dimension of the search space is decreased enormously if the data matrix has many more columns (variables) than rows. We then propose and analyze a simple gradient method suited for the task. It appears that our algorithm has best convergence properties in the case when either the objective function or the feasible set are strongly convex. which is the case with our single-unit formulations and can be enforced in the block case.

The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting. communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal.A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation. the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network---as many as the number of users of a given service. each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular. we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices.

The total work needed for the method to output an epsilon-accurate solution in expectation. measured in the number of passes over data. is proportional to the condition number of the problem and inversely proportional to the number of functions forming the average. This is achieved by running the method with number of stochastic gradient evaluations per epoch proportional to conditioning of the problem. The SVRG method of Johnson and Zhang arises as a special case. To illustrate our theoretical results.

1277869,Generative image inpainting with contextual attention,2018,Jiahui Yu and Zhe Lin and Jimei Yang and Xiaohui Shen and Xin Lu and Thomas S Huang,,,,5505-5514,,Recent deep learning based approaches have shown promising results for the challenging task of inpainting large missing regions in an image. These methods can generate visually plausible image structures and textures. but often create distorted structures or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas. This is mainly due to ineffectiveness of convolutional neural networks in explicitly borrowing or copying information from distant spatial locations. On the other hand. traditional texture and patch synthesis approaches are particularly suitable when it needs to borrow textures from the surrounding regions. Motivated by these observations. we propose a new deep generative model-based approach which can not only synthesize novel image structures but also explicitly utilize surrounding image features as references during network training to make better predictions. The model is a feed-forward. fully convolutional neural network which can process images with multiple holes at arbitrary locations and with variable sizes during the test time.

Existing feed-forward based methods. while enjoying the inference efficiency. are mainly limited by inability of generalizing to unseen styles or compromised visual quality. In this paper. we present a simple yet effective method that tackles these limitations without training on any pre-defined styles. The key ingredient of our method is a pair of feature transforms. whitening and coloring. that are embedded to an image reconstruction network. The whitening and coloring transforms reflect a direct matching of feature covariance of the content image to a given style image. which shares similar spirits with the optimization of Gram matrix based cost in neural style transfer.

1277877,Decomposing motion and content for natural video sequence prediction,2017,Ruben Villegas and Jimei Yang and Seunghoon Hong and Xunyu Lin and Honglak Lee,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.08033,,,,We propose a deep neural network for the prediction of future frames in natural video sequences. To effectively handle complex evolution of pixels in videos. we propose to decompose the motion and content. two key components generating dynamics in videos. Our model is built upon the Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional LSTM for pixel-level prediction. which independently capture the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content. predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features into the next frame content by the identified motion features. which simplifies the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time steps. and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate training. We evaluate the proposed network architecture on human activity videos using KTH. Weizmann action. and UCF-101 datasets. We show state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches. To the best of our knowledge. this is the first end-to-end trainable network architecture with motion and content separation to model the spatiotemporal dynamics for pixel-level future prediction in natural videos.,True,GwKF9rMAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC,348,https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08033,10892353807026411567,/scholar?cites=10892353807026411567,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.08033,0,0,0
1277878,Weakly-supervised disentangling with recurrent transformations for 3d view synthesis,2015,Jimei Yang and Scott Reed and Ming-Hsuan Yang and Honglak Lee,,,,,,An important problem for both graphics and vision is to synthesize novel views of a 3D object from a single image. This is in particular challenging due to the partial observability inherent in projecting a 3D object onto the image space. and the ill-posedness of inferring object shape and pose. However. we can train a neural network to address the problem if we restrict our attention to specific object classes (in our case faces and chairs) for which we can gather ample training data. In this paper. we propose a novel recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network that is trained end-to-end on the task of rendering rotated objects starting from a single image. The recurrent structure allows our model to capture long-term dependencies along a sequence of transformations. and we demonstrate the quality of its predictions for human faces on the Multi-PIE dataset and for a dataset of 3D chair models. and also show its ability of disentangling latent data factors without using object class labels.,True,GwKF9rMAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC,291,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5639-weakly-supervised-disentangling-with-recurrent-transformations-for-3d-view-synthesis,11380514329548114340,/scholar?cites=11380514329548114340,,,http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5639-decoupled-variational-gaussian-inference.pdf,0,0,0

Different from previous low-level edge detection. our algorithm focuses on detecting higher-level object contours. Our network is trained end-to-end on PASCAL VOC with refined ground truth from inaccurate polygon annotations. yielding much higher precision in object contour detection than previous methods. We find that the learned model generalizes well to unseen object classes from the same supercategories on MS COCO and can match state-of-the-art edge detection on BSDS500 with fine-tuning. By combining with the multiscale combinatorial grouping algorithm. our method can generate high-quality segmented object proposals. which significantly advance the state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC (improving average recall from 0.62 to 0.67) with a relatively small amount of candidates (1660 per image).,True,GwKF9rMAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC,263,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Yang_Object_Contour_Detection_CVPR_2016_paper.html,16237790414276114850,/scholar?cites=16237790414276114850,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Yang_Object_Contour_Detection_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Upton. NY (United States). Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.(LBNL). Berkeley. CA (United States),The extreme energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic collisions between heavy atomic nuclei produce a state of matter that behaves surprisingly like a fluid. with exceptionally high temperature and low viscosity. Non-central collisions have angular momenta of the order of 1.000 ћ. and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that must be understood to describe the fluid properly. The vortical structure is also of particular interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of strong vorticity. But. no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in heavy ion collisions have yet been found. Since vorticity represents a local rotational structure of the fluid. spin–orbit coupling can lead to preferential orientation of particle spins along the direction of rotation. Here we present measurements of an alignment between the global angular momentum of a non-central collision and the spin of emitted particles (in this case the collision occurs between gold nuclei and produces Λ baryons). revealing that the fluid produced in heavy ion collisions is the most vortical system so far observed.(At high energies. this fluid is a quark–gluon plasma.)

This formulation reflects the behavior of the ordered queue-based watershed algorithm. This algorithm is compared with our proposed shortest-path forest (IFT-Image Foresting Transform). concluding that the watershed is a special case of that. Recently many different watershed approaches are being used. We point out that in some cases the watershed algorithm does not keep the optimality of the shortest-path forest solution unless the IFT algorithm is used. The main difference between the algorithms is related to permanently labeling a pixel when inserting or removing it from the queue. The watershed based on the pixel dissimilarity using IFT can segment one-pixel width regions while keeping the optimality of the shortest-path forest solution.,True,IQt4hvoAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,184,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-47025-X_37,9299604611263408614,/scholar?cites=9299604611263408614,,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/61026/1/34.pdf#page=352,0,0,0

This estimation is crucial for the problem of crowd monitoring and control. The assessment is carried out on a set of nearly 300 real images captured from Liverpool Street Train Station. London. UK. using texture measures extracted from the images through the following four different methods: gray level dependence matrices. straight line segments. Fourier analysis. and fractal dimensions. The estimations of crowd densities are given in terms of the classification of the input images in five classes of densities (very low. low. moderate. high and very high). Three types of classifiers are used: neural (implemented according to the Kohonen model). Bayesian. and an approach based on fitting functions.

Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments. these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed. there is still room for improvement. Here. we present Enrichr. an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries. an alternative approach to rank enriched terms. and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library. Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines. as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells.

While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for their success. there are indications that these architectures defy a popular view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract features at each layer.In this report. we argue that this view is incomplete and does not adequately explain several recent findings. We propose an alternative viewpoint based on unrolled iterative estimation--a group of successive layers iteratively refine their estimates of the same features instead of computing an entirely new representation. We demonstrate that this viewpoint directly leads to the construction of Highway and Residual networks.

AP jointly learns a similarity measure over projected segments (eg trigrams) of the pair. and subsequently. derives the corresponding attention vector for each input to guide the pooling. Our two-way attention mechanism is a general framework independent of the underlying representation learning. and it has been applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in our studies. The empirical results. from three very different benchmark tasks of question answering/answer selection. demonstrate that our proposed models outperform a variety of strong baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks.,True,A6yjdJAAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,315,https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03609,8659717246292055520,/scholar?cites=8659717246292055520,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03609,0,0,0
1277940,Improved representation learning for question answer matching,2016,Ming Tan and Cicero Dos Santos and Bing Xiang and Bowen Zhou,,,,464-473,,Passage-level question answer matching is a challenging task since it requires effective representations that capture the complex semantic relations between questions and answers. In this work. we propose a series of deep learning models to address passage answer selection. To match passage answers to questions accommodating their complex semantic relations. unlike most previous work that utilizes a single deep learning structure. we develop hybrid models that process the text using both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. combining the merits on extracting linguistic information from both structures. Additionally. we also develop a simple but effective attention mechanism for the purpose of constructing better answer representations according to the input question. which is imperative for better modeling long answer sequences. The results on two public benchmark datasets. InsuranceQA and TREC-QA. show that our proposed models outperform a variety of strong baselines.,True,A6yjdJAAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,211,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1044.pdf,12268511895951931058,/scholar?cites=12268511895951931058,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1044.pdf,0,0,0
1277941,Combining outputs from multiple machine translation systems,2007,Antti-Veikko Rosti and Necip Fazil Ayan and Bing Xiang and Spyros Matsoukas and Richard Schwartz and Bonnie Dorr,,,,228-235,,Currently there are several approaches to machine translation (MT) based on different paradigms; eg. phrasal. hierarchical and syntax-based. These three approaches yield similar translation accuracy despite using fairly different levels of linguistic knowledge. The availability of such a variety of systems has led to a growing interest toward finding better translations by combining outputs from multiple systems. This paper describes three different approaches to MT system combination. These combination methods operate on sentence. phrase and word level exploiting information from.-best lists. system scores and target-to-source phrase alignments. The word-level combination provides the most robust gains but the best results on the development test sets (NIST MT05 and the newsgroup portion of GALE 2006 dry-run) were achieved by combining all three methods.,True,A6yjdJAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,203,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N07-1029.pdf,6081226726953310638,/scholar?cites=6081226726953310638,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N07-1029.pdf,0,0,0
