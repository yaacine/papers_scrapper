The method seeks an optimum combination of protective actions in the presence of a multitude of conflicting objectives and under uncertainty. Conflicting objectives arise in the attempt to minimize simultaneously the potential adverse effects of an accident and the associated socioeconomic impacts. Additional conflicting objectives arise whenever an emergency plan tends to decrease a particular health effect. such as acute deaths. while it increases another. such as latent deaths. The uncertainty is due to the multitude of possible accident scenarios and their respective probability of occurrence. the stochastic variability in the weather conditions. and the variability and/or lack of knowledge of the parameters of the risk assessment models.

Ionic diffusion within the electrochemically active particles generally represents a fundamental limitation to the rate at which a battery can be charged and discharged. To compensate for the relatively slow solid-state ionic diffusion and to enable high power and rapid charging. the active particles are frequently reduced to nanometre dimensions. to the detriment of volumetric packing density. cost. stability and sustainability. As an alternative to nanoscaling. here we show that two complex niobium tungsten oxides—Nb 16 W 5 O 55 and Nb 18 W 16 O 93. which adopt crystallographic shear and bronze-like structures. respectively—can intercalate large quantities of lithium at high rates. even when the sizes of the niobium tungsten oxide particles are of the order of micrometres.

Lithium diffusion within these materials is studied in this work using density functional theory calculations. specifically nudged elastic band calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Lithium diffusion is found to occur through jumps between 4-fold coordinated window sites with low activation barriers (80–300 meV) and is constrained to be effectively one-dimensional by the crystallographic shear planes of the structures. We identify a number of other processes. including rattling motions with barriers on the order of the thermal energy at room temperature. and intermediate barrier hops between 4-fold and 5-fold coordinated lithium sites.

1265318,Pair-Instability Supernovae via Collision Runaway in Young Dense Star Clusters,2012,Tony Pan and Abraham Loeb and Daniel Kasen,423,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,3,2203-2208,,             Stars with helium cores between ∼64 and 133 M             ⊙              are theoretically predicted to die as pair-instability supernovae. This requires very massive progenitors. which are theoretically prohibited for Pop II/I stars within the Galactic stellar mass limit due to mass-loss via line-driven winds. However. the runaway collision of stars in a dense. young star cluster could create a merged star with sufficient mass to end its life as a pair-instability supernova. even with enhanced mass-loss at non-zero metallicity. We show that the predicted rate from this mechanism is consistent with the inferred volumetric rate of roughly ∼2 × 10             −9              Mpc             −3              yr             −1              of the two observed pair-instability supernovae.

The new Italian regulations strongly suggest the installation of centralized boilers in renovated buildings with more than four apartments. This work aims to investigate the differences in primary energy consumption and efficiency among several independent and centralized heating systems installed in Northern Italy. The analysis is carried out through the following approach: firstly building heating loads are evaluated using the software TRNSYS® and. then. heating system performances are estimated through a simplified model based on the European Standard EN 15316. Several heating systems have been analyzed. evaluating: independent and centralized configurations. condensing and traditional boilers. radiator and radiant floor emitters and solar plant integration. The heating systems are applied to four buildings dating back to 2010. 2006. 1960s and 1930s. All the combinations of heating systems and buildings are analyzed in detail. evaluating efficiency and primary energy consumption. In most of the cases the choice between centralized and independent heating systems has minor effects on primary energy consumption. less than 3%: the introduction of condensing technology and the integration with solar heating plant can reduce energy consumption by 11% and 29%. respectively.

A high degree of accuracy in measuring and controlling the aforementioned temperature is therefore required. In almost the totality of WTE plants this measurement process is carried out by using practical industrial thermometers. such as bare thermocouples and infrared radiation (IR) pyrometers. even if affected by different physical contributions which can make the gas temperature measurements incorrect. The objective of this paper is to analyze errors and uncertainties that can arise when using a bare thermocouple or an IR pyrometer in a WTE plant and to provide a method for the in situ calibration of these industrial sensors through the use of suction pyrometers. The paper describes principle of operation. design. and uncertainty contributions of suction pyrometers. it also provides the best estimation of the flue-gas temperature in the post combustion zone of a WTE plant and the estimation of its expanded uncertainty.

The performance of the system under fuel partialization strategy is first studied and the thermal and electrical efficiencies of the plant at different partial loads are determined. It was found that due to partialization of the fuel down to 50% of the initial value. the electrical efficiency increases from 29.3% to 33.6% while the thermal efficiency decreases from 53.0% to 47.6%. Power to heat shifting strategy. as a faster approach. is then employed in which. by altering the anodic stoichiometric ratio. the electrical generation is decreased while higher thermal power is produced.

Biomass is one of these. and it represents. in the form of sugarcane. a strategic source in Colombia. especially in the Valle del Cauca. In this region. the sugarcane industry is able to convert the energy content of the cane into different energy products. such as ethanol. electricity. and high-pressure steam. which are cogenerated via bagasse combustion. In this work. the case of a sucrose and ethanol production plant. which mills ten thousand tons of sugarcane per day. is considered. A tailor-made computational model was developed to assess the energy and material process balances in order to estimate the effect of different operating conditions on cogeneration boilers and turbines. and to optimize the overall process efficiency. The current situation was modeled with good precision from the developed model. Likewise. the concept of “Renewable Efficiency” was introduced to explain the degree of green power. which a process plant is able to produce. Consequently. new innovative solutions and process layouts were proposed in order to increase their renewable efficiency. With the new configurations. a convenient energy surplus of up to 33 MW can be reached. which could be sold in the national electricity grid. representing long-term interesting economic benefits for the company.

1265362,Machine learning-based short-term prediction of air-conditioning load through smart meter analytics,2017,Manoj Manivannan and Behzad Najafi and Fabio Rinaldi,10,Energies,11,1905,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The present paper is focused on short-term prediction of air-conditioning (AC) load of residential buildings using the data obtained from a conventional smart meter. The AC load. at each time step. is separated from smart meter’s aggregate consumption through energy disaggregation methodology. The obtained air-conditioning load and the corresponding historical weather data are then employed as input features for the prediction procedure. In the prediction step. different machine learning algorithms. including Artificial Neural Networks. Support Vector Machines. and Random Forests. are used in order to conduct hour-ahead and day-ahead predictions. The predictions obtained using Random Forests have been demonstrated to be the most accurate ones leading to hour-ahead and day-ahead prediction with R 2 scores of 87.3% and 83.2%. respectively. The main advantage of the present methodology is separating the AC consumption from the consumptions of other residential appliances. which can then be predicted employing short-term weather forecasts. The other devices’ consumptions are largely dependent upon the occupant’s behaviour and are thus more difficult to predict. Therefore. the harsh alterations in the consumption of AC equipment. due to variations in the weather conditions. can be predicted with a higher accuracy; which in turn enhances the overall load prediction accuracy.

1265366,Natural gas prices. LNG transport costs. and the dynamics of LNG imports,2011,Don Maxwell and Zhen Zhu,33,Energy Economics,2,217-226,North-Holland,According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. LNG is projected to become a much larger share of U.S. natural gas consumption. rising from current levels of around 2.5% of total natural gas consumption to 12.4% by 2030. Because natural gas and LNG are substitutes. natural gas prices are expected to be an important determinant of LNG imports. Furthermore. an increasing share of LNG is traded under short-term contracts with spot shipments being diverted to markets offering the highest returns (netbacks). Relative natural gas prices as well as LNG transportation costs are important determinants of LNG netbacks. This paper examines the empirical relationship between U.S. LNG imports. the Henry Hub price of natural gas relative to U.K. and Asia gas prices. and a proxy for LNG transportation costs using monthly data from 1997 to 2007.

Aggregate measures of real wages are used along with various measures of imports. No long-run comovement is found for real wages and imports.

1265389,Price dispersion in a model with middlemen and oligopolistic market makers: A theory and an application to the North American natural gas market,2004,Jiandong Ju and Scott C Linn and Zhen Zhu,,Available at SSRN 632287,,,,We develop a microstructure model of a market for a homogeneous good in which trade amongst heterogeneous consumers and producers is intermediated by middlemen and oligopolistic market makers (gatekeepers). Market makers post bid and ask prices which are freely observable. Middlemen stand ready to trade at bid and ask prices they quote on a private basis to consumers or producers who identify these intermediaries via a costly search process. We model competition between market makers as a two-stage game: capacity setting in the first stage and bid and ask price setting in the second stage. We characterize the equilibrium market structure of intermediaries and the distribution of prices in equilibrium. Our main focus is the effect on prices that emerges following a change in the market structure of intermediation. specifically through the exit of a market maker. Exit of a market maker initially results in a shift of trade from market makers as a whole to middlemen resulting in an increase in price dispersion. Following transition to the new market structure with fewer market makers. price dispersion returns to its pre-exit level when total trade passing through the remaining market makers is roughly equal to the pre-exit level. We present an empirical study of price dispersion in the North American natural gas market for the period before and following the exit of Enron. a major market maker in late 2001. The empirical evidence supports the main propositions of our theory: price dispersion jumped 4-fold immediately following Enron's exit but returned to its pre-exit level within roughly 2 months following the exit date.,True,9yJghFYAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,9,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=632287,14870699064512839714,/scholar?cites=14870699064512839714,,,,0,0,0

We show in this work that Umklapp scatterings are not necessarily resistive—no thermal resistance is induced if the projected momentum is conserved in the direction of heat flow. This distinction is especially important in anisotropic materials such as graphite and black phosphorous. By introducing a direction-dependent definition of normal and Umklapp scattering. we can model thermal transport in anisotropic materials using the Callaway model accurately.

While much progress has been made in uncovering how phonons affect electron dynamics. it remains a challenge to directly observe the impact of electrons on phonon transport. especially at environmental temperatures. Here. we probe the effect of charge carriers on phonon heat transport at room temperature. using a modified transient thermal grating technique. By optically exciting electron-hole pairs in a crystalline silicon membrane. we single out the effect of the phonon–carrier interaction.

Precursor films 1. 3 and 5 μm thick were processed in an atmospheric pressure reactor using a gas mixture of oxygen. nitrogen and water vapor.

In contrast to the melt-textured samples. the J c (θ) dependencies for the twinned single crystals reveal a minimum in the H∥ c configuration (θ= 0). The nonmonotonic J c (H) behavior (fishtail effect) appeared to be much more pronounced in tilted magnetic fields. The fishtail as well as the J c (θ) minimum at H∥ c were shown to depend strongly on the E c criterion for J c definition. An E c increase by two orders of magnitude suppresses the fishtail and transforms the J c (θ) minimum to a maximum.

We introduce a modified concept of the dimensional crossover which includes three scenarios of the phenomenon: (i) the vortex lattice softening due to the wave vector dependent dispersion of the elastic tilt modulus C44(k); (ii) the interference between random isotropic point-like and correlated 2D …,True,fJbr3mkAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921453497001147,2935296668334207706,/scholar?cites=2935296668334207706,,,,0,0,0

To identify the nature of the nucleation centers. we compare nucleation kinetics and performance of YBCO layers deposited by the metal–organic process on a standard RABiTS tape to YBCO on ceria buffers with well-controlled structure and surface morphology. The structure of the YBCO layer at the early stage of nucleation and growth is determined by high-flux synchrotron x-ray diffraction. It is shown that the best buffers exhibit high YBCO nucleation rates and produce YBCO nuclei with the least cation disorder.

The new Italian regulations strongly suggest the installation of centralized boilers in renovated buildings with more than four apartments. This work aims to investigate the differences in primary energy consumption and efficiency among several independent and centralized heating systems installed in Northern Italy. The analysis is carried out through the following approach: firstly building heating loads are evaluated using the software TRNSYS® and. then. heating system performances are estimated through a simplified model based on the European Standard EN 15316. Several heating systems have been analyzed. evaluating: independent and centralized configurations. condensing and traditional boilers. radiator and radiant floor emitters and solar plant integration.

1265498,CO2 and its correlation with CO at a rural site near Beijing: implications for combustion efficiency in China,2010,Y Wang and JW Munger and S Xu and Michael Brendon McElroy and J Hao and CP Nielsen and H Ma,10,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,18,8881-8897,Copernicus GmbH, Although China has surpassed the United States as the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter. in situ measurements of atmospheric CO2 have been sparse in China. This paper analyzes hourly CO2 and its correlation with CO at Miyun. a rural site near Beijing. over a period of 51 months (Dec 2004 through Feb 2009). The CO2-CO correlation analysis evaluated separately for each hour of the day provides useful information with statistical significance even in the growing season. We found that the intercept. representing the initial condition imposed by global distribution of CO2 with influence of photosynthesis and respiration. exhibits diurnal cycles differing by season. The background CO2 (CO2.b) derived from Miyun observations is comparable to CO2 observed at a Mongolian background station to the northwest. Annual growth of overall mean CO2 at Miyun is estimated at 2.7 ppm yr−1 while that of CO2.b is only 1.7 ppm yr−1 similar to the mean growth rate at northern mid-latitude background stations. This suggests a relatively faster increase in the regional CO2 sources in China than the global average. consistent with bottom-up studies of CO2 emissions. For air masses with trajectories through the northern China boundary layer. mean winter CO2/CO correlation slopes (dCO2/dCO) increased by 2.8 ± 0.9 ppmv/ppmv or 11% from 2005–2006 to 2007–2008. with CO2 increasing by 1.8 ppmv. The increase in dCO2/dCO indicates improvement in overall combustion efficiency over northern China after winter 2007. attributed to pollution reduction measures associated with the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Koutecky-Levich (K-L) analysis provides a simple and effective method to extract electrokinetic information by correcting for mass transport effects. We propose extensions to the K-L analysis to address some of the simplifying assumptions made during its derivation.

Existing continuous glucose monitoring systems are unsuitable for long‐term clinical glycemic management due to poor long‐term stability. Polymer dot (Pdot) glucose transducers are implantable optical nanosensors that exhibit excellent brightness. sensitivity. selectivity. and biocompatibility. Here. it is shown that hydrogen peroxide—a product of glucose oxidation in Pdot glucose sensors—degrades sensor performance via photobleaching. reduces glucose oxidase activity. and generates cytotoxicity.

The results show that. the true pressure distribution in the percolation flow field of the low-permeability well possesses two regional features; in the low-permeability reservoir of deformation medium. the productivity of the stimulated well decreases with the increases of start-up pressure gradient and medium deformation factor. increases with the increases of the active radius and the active factor of the well. and increases with the increase of production pressure difference; the productivity index of the well presents a non-monotone increasing curve with the increase of production pressure difference. therefore there are not only a rational production pressure difference but also a minimum production pressure difference. The effective approaches to develop super-low permeability reservoirs are discussed using the same thinking. It is held that increasing the active radius of the stimulated well is an effective approach to enhance the productivity of super-low permeability wells. The theoretical calculation results show that. the productivity of the well is greatly enhanced only when the active radius of the well is greater than 60 m.

Stratum interface is the key element which affect the form of fracture network. This paper proposed a numerical study based on finite-discrete element method to investigate the influence of bedding plane on fracture propagation. A hydraulic fracture would cross the beddings under the high vertical stress difference between a vertical stress and horizontal minimum stress. while a hydraulic fracture propagates along the beddings under a low vertical stress difference. The complex fracture network is more easily generated under the low net pressure. the fracturing fluid leaking into the beddings can act as a lubricant. thus reducing or eliminating the shear strength of the fractures. it is easier for hydraulic fractures to deviate than to cross the weakly cemented and large-aperture bedding plane.

The key point to the application of this technology is to ensure that the oxygen injected with the air can be fully dissipated inside the reservoir to lower the explosion risk in production wells and reduce the oxidation of the pipeline. It is generally believed that the oxygen and crude oil can react more in low-temperature-oxidation (LTO) reactions above 80 °C. As a large amount of oxygen would be spontaneously consumed at this temperature. this technology is mainly used in reservoirs where the temperature is greater than 80 °C. In the fractured low-permeability reservoir of China's Yanchang oilfield. where the reservoir temperature is only approximately 30 °C. a wide range of crude oil LTO would not be triggered theoretically.

This paper analyses current understanding of motivations and barriers that affect microgeneration adoption with the aim of identifying opportunities for improving the uptake.

1265636,Nonlinear adaptive backstepping control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM),2011,A Lagrioui and H Mahmoudi,29,Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology,1,,,In this paper. a nonlinear adaptive speed controller for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) based on a newly developed adaptive backstepping approach is presented. The exact. input-output feedback linearization control law is first introduced without any uncertainties in the system. However. in real applications. the parameter uncertainties such as the stator resistance and the rotor flux linquage and load torque disturbance have to be considered. In this case. the exact input-output feedback linearization approach is not very effective. because it is based on the exact cancellation of the nonlinearity. To compensate the uncertainties and the load torque disturbance. the input-output feedback linearization approach is first used to compensate the nonlinearities in the nominal system. Then. nonlinear adaptive backstepping control law and parameter uncertainties. and load torque disturbance adaptation laws. are derived systematically by using adaptive backstepping technique. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed adaptive scheme can track the speed reference s the signal generated by a reference model. successfully. and that scheme is robust to the parameter uncertainties and load torque disturbance.,True,BloEQfIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,16,https://jatit.org/volumes/twentyninth_volume_1_2011.php,8956855707019060524,/scholar?cites=8956855707019060524,,,https://jatit.org/volumes/twentyninth_volume_1_2011.php,0,0,0

1265676,Performance and emission studies of a compression ignition engine on blends of calophyllum oil and diesel,2012,Chinmaya Mishra and Naveen Kumar and Chauhan BS Sidharth,3,Journal of biofuels,1,,,In the present scenario of energy crisis and global warming. the use of eco-friendly renewable fuels is gaining worldwide attention. Amongst the variety of such fuels. biofuels from energy crops form an important solution. In this context. fuels derived from non-edible vegetable oil have a major role to provide energy security and mitigate environmental degradation. Despite extensive work carried out by large number of researchers. a huge number of non-edible vegetable oils are yet to be explored as a feedstock for small energy requirements. So. there is an urgent need to assess the potential of such underutilised feed stocks. It has been found that chemical processing of vegetable oil should be carried to bring out its properties similar to diesel fuel. However. the chemical processing requires capital investment and technical experience. which is not feasible in rural areas. Therefore. the vegetable oil in neat form without any chemical treatment presents a sustainable solution. The present study aims at evaluation of one such underutilised species ‘Calophyllum’. This plant is abundantly available in coastal India. Bangladesh. South America. African coast and Australia. The oil in raw form and blended with diesel (10% and 20% by volume) were used to fuel a single-cylinder diesel engine. and the results compared with baseline data of diesel. The results suggest a reduction of 6.97 and 12.4% in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) on 10 and 20% blends. respectively. as compared to mineral diesel operation.

The present investigation evaluates methanol as a diesel engine fuel. Methanol and diesel are immiscible at room temperature and formulation of micro-emulsion using surfactants has been a prescribed technique for diesel engine applications. However. preparation of micro-emulsion requires technical expertise. Therefore. macro-emulsion using a simple on board stirrer with predetermined rpm is a promising solution. The test fuels were prepared with 5% and 10%(v/v) of methanol in the emulsion and experiments were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine. The results showed that for 5% methanol in the emulsion. full load brake thermal efficiency was reduced by nearly 10% and for 10% methanol. 28% reduction was observed as compared to diesel baseline. Consequently. brake specific fuel consumption was increased with increase in methanol percentage in the emulsion. Emission of carbon monoxide was insignificant at part loads but at higher loads these emissions were reduced with rising percentage of methanol in the emulsion. For 10% emulsion. emission of hydrocarbons was reduced by nearly 20% at full load. but a little variation was observed for neat diesel and 5% emulsion.

Detailed studies on electrical conductivity as a function of temperature up to 500 °C are carried out for films in the 20–100 nm thickness range. Free-standing thin film micro-solid oxide fuel cells utilizing nanostructured Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 cathodes are fabricated and tested for the first time. A maximum power density of 35 mW cm−2 at 520 °C was obtained with Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3/(Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92/Pt micro-solid oxide fuel cells.

The LSCF thin films crystallise in the 400–450 °C range; however. after annealing in the 600–700 °C range. cracks are observed. The formation of cracks is also thickness‐dependent. High electrical conductivity. ∼520 Scm–1 at 600 °C. and low activation energy. ∼0.13 eV. in the 400–600 °C range. are still maintained for LSCF films as thin as 27 nm.

The high k is attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation between semiconducting TiOx and insulating Al2O3 nanolayers. while low losses and leakage current densities are due to blockage of charged carriers transport through the Al2O3 interfacial layer. Additionally. a high-capacitance capacitor based on the Al2O3/TiOx NL structure is demonstrated on 16 μm deep Si trenches. which can be used to enable the next generation of nanoscale energy storage and memory devices.,True,KeXcF2UAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,21,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4811810,1525726149717376001,/scholar?cites=1525726149717376001,,,,0,0,0

TiNi thin films with compositions of 50.1. 51.1. and 51.7 at.% Ti all exhibited transformation temperatures between 65 and 100 °C. low residual stresses at room temperature (RT). and high recoverable stresses. thus making them suitable for microactuators in microelectromechanical systems. Low residual stresses at RT. less than 50 MPa. can be obtained even when only a small quantity of martensite. less than 30%. is present. Phase fraction evolution during complete thermal cycles (heating and cooling) was studied using elevated temperature x-ray diffraction. combined with quantitative Rietveld analysis.

Crystalline zirconia films with grain size of ∼5 nm were successfully grown at room temperature by oxidation under ultra-violet (UV) photon irradiation. Microstructure of the films was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical conductivity of UV grown YDZ electrolytes was investigated over a broad range of temperatures using Pt electrodes as a function of yttria doping concentration. The slightly lower electrical conductivity in UV grown films at intermediate temperature range (400–550 °C) is consistent with previous reports on oxygen defect annihilation under photo-excitation. Micro-fuel cells utilizing such ultra-thin YDZ membranes yielded ∼12 mW cm−2 power density at 550 °C.

The advantages of PZT-based microactuation include large actuation forces and high operating frequencies. leading to high operating pressures and flow rates. Disadvantages include high operating voltages and low strains. TiNi SMA-based microactuators can achieve high flow rates at low operating voltages. due to their high recoverable strains; however. they suffer from low operating frequencies and high power consumption. For both microactuation schemes. additional structures are usually required to realize the reciprocating motion required for MEMS devices.When used in MEMS. the thicknesses of PZT and TiNi SMA films range up to several microns.
