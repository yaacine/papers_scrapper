1115393,The energy-efficiency gap What does it mean?,1994,Adam B Jaffe and Robert N Stavins,22,Energy policy,10,804-810,Elsevier,As renewed attention has been given by policy makers to energy conservation issues. it has frequently been asserted that an energy-efficiency gap exists between actual and optimal energy use. The critical questions is how to define the optimal level of energy efficiency. This paper seeks to disentangle some confusing strands of argument that are frequently brought to bear on this question. by identifying the major conceptual issues that determine the set of feasible answers. We identify five separate and distinct notions of optimality: the economists' economic potential. the technologists' economic potential. hypothetical potential. the narrow social optimum and the true social optimum. Each of these has associated with it a corresponding definition of the energy-efficiency gap.

These combined market failures provide a strong rationale for a portfolio of public policies that foster emissions reduction as well as the development and adoption of environmentally beneficial technology. Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that the rate and direction of technological advance is influenced by market and regulatory incentives. and can be cost-effectively harnessed through the use of economic-incentive based policy. In the presence of weak or nonexistent environmental policies. investments in the development and diffusion of new environmentally beneficial technologies are very likely to be less than would be socially desirable.

For the products we explored. the evidence suggests that (i) the rate of overall innovation was independent of energy prices and regulations; (ii) the direction of innovation was responsive to energy price changes for some products but not for others; (iii) energy price changes induced changes in the subset of technically feasible models that were offered for sale; (iv) this responsiveness increased substantially during the period after energy-efficiency product labeling was required; and (v) nonetheless. a sizable portion of efficiency improvements were autonomous.,True,TcoarRAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1194,https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/114/3/941/1848170,1011317740363210151,/scholar?cites=1011317740363210151,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6437/w6437.pdf,0,0,0

1115398,Valuing climate change: the economics of the greenhouse,2013,Samuel Fankhauser,,,,,Routledge,Within only a few years. global warming has emerged from scientific speculation into an environmental threat of worldwide concern. Yet the scientific community remains uncertain as to the long-term trends and effects of climate change. and this uncertainty has been seized on as justification for inaction by an international community reluctant to bear the costs of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Valuing Climate Change presents concrete. economic evidence of the need for action. Fankhauser assesses the costs of a doubling of GHG emissions to be a significant percentage of gross world product; a figure which he then compares to the costs of reducing emissions. In his comparison. he looks at regional as well as global estimates of damage. and takes account of the non-climate change benefits of GHG reductions. such as a switch in the energy sector to cleaner technologies or renewable fuels. and the impacts on transport. with reduced congestion and improved air quality. It is clear that the stakes are high. and Fankhauser believes that tougher targets may be needed than those set out in the Framework Convention on Climate Change. He assesses the optimum policy responses to GHG reduction. the likely instruments for achieving it and the potential for international cooperation in dealing with the problems.

Our analysis provides some keys to understanding why this technology-diffusion process is gradual. and focuses attention on the factors that cause this to be the case. including those associated with potential market failures — information problems. principal/agent slippage. and unobserved costs — and those explanations that do not represent market failures — private information costs. high discount rates. and heterogeneity among potential adopters.

Dales (1968) showed how the introduction of transferable property rights could work to promote environmental protection at lower aggregate cost than conventional standards. From these two seminal ideas-corrective taxes and transferable property rights-a substantial body of research has developed. Both environmental taxes and marketable permits are coming of age in the policy arena. Examples include the introduction of marketable permits in the United States to control acid rain. the use of charges in Europe to limit air and water pollution. and the employment of deposit-refund schemes for products ranging from beverage …,True,TcoarRAAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,441,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117445,2366869666410568307,/scholar?cites=2366869666410568307,,https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/disc_paper_91_15.pdf,0,0,0

1115415,Comparing price and nonprice approaches to urban water conservation,2009,Sheila M Olmstead and Robert N Stavins,45,Water Resources Research,4,,,Urban water conservation is typically achieved through prescriptive regulations. including the rationing of water for particular uses and requirements for the installation of particular technologies. A significant shift has occurred in pollution control regulations toward market‐based policies in recent decades. We offer an analysis of the relative merits of market‐based and prescriptive approaches to water conservation. where prices have rarely been used to allocate scarce supplies. The analysis emphasizes the emerging theoretical and empirical evidence that using prices to manage water demand is more cost effective than implementing nonprice conservation programs. similar to results for pollution control in earlier decades. Price‐based approaches may also compare favorably to prescriptive approaches in terms of monitoring and enforcement.

Although most of the debate on global climate change policy has focused on quantity controls due to their political appeal. this paper argues that price controls are more efficient. Simulations based on a stochastic computable general equilibrium model indicate that the expected welfare gain from the optimal price policy is five times higher than the expected gain from the optimal quantity policy. An alternative hybrid policy combines both the political appeal of quantity controls with the efficiency of prices. using an initial distribution of tradeable permits to set a quantitative target. but allowing additional permits to be purchased at a fixed “trigger” price.

We then use two centuries of US interest rate data to quantify this effect. Using both random walk and mean-reverting models. we compute the “certainty-equivalent rate” that summarizes the effect of uncertainty and measures the appropriate forward rate of discount in the future. Under the random walk model we find that the certainty-equivalent rate falls continuously from 4% to 2% after 100 years. 1% after 200 years. and 0.5% after 300 years. At horizons of 400 years. the discounted value increases by a factor of over 40.000 relative to conventional discounting.

Yet. there have been few attempts to factor such uncertainty into current policy decisions concerning stringency and instrument choice. This paper presents a framework for determining optimal climate change policy under uncertainty and compares the resulting prescriptions to those derived from a more typical analysis with best-guess parameter values.

This article presents a simple modification to the idea of a safety valve: a quantitative limit that we call the allowance reserve.

Europe. and Japan,2007,Richard D Morgenstern and William Aaron Pizer,,,,,Resources for the Future,"Publisher description: Since the early 1990s. voluntary programs have played an increasingly prominent role in environmental management in the US and other industrialized countries. Programs have attempted to address problems ranging from climate change and energy efficiency to more localized air and water pollution problems. But do they work? Despite a growing theoretical literature about how and why voluntary programs might be effective. there is limited empirical evidence on their success or the situations most conducive to their approaches. Even less is known about their cost-effectiveness. Getting credible answers to these questions is important. Research to date has been largely limited to individual programs. and protagonists and antagonists to the trend are at ever greater disagreement. sometimes drawing opposite conclusions about the same program. This innovative book seeks to clarify what is known by looking at a range of program types. including different approaches adopted in different nations. The focus is on assessing actual performance via seven case studies. including the US Climate Wise program. the US EPA's 33/50 program on toxic chemicals. the UK Climate Change Agreements. and the Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan in Japan. The central goals of Reality Check are understanding outcomes and the relationship between outcomes and design.

1115433,Prices vs. quantities revisited: the case of climate change,1997,William A Pizer,,,1318-2016-103316,,,Uncertainty about compliance costs causes otherwise equivalent price and quantity controls to behave differently. Price controls–in the form of taxes–fix the marginal cost of compliance and lead to uncertain levels of compliance. Meanwhile quantity controls–in the form of tradable permits or quotas–fix the level of compliance but result in uncertain marginal costs. This fundamental difference in the face of cost uncertainty leads to different welfare outcomes for the two policy instruments. Seminal work by Weitzman (1974) clarified this point and derived theoretical conditions under which one policy is preferred to the other. This paper applies this principal to the issue of worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) control. using a global integrated climate economy model to simulate the consequences of uncertainty and to compare the efficiency of taxes and permits empirically. The results indicate that an optimal tax policy generates gains which are five times higher than the optimal permit policy–a $337 billion dollar gain versus $69 billion at the global level. This result follows from Weitzman’s original intuition that relatively flat marginal benefits/damages favor taxes. a feature that drops out of standard assumptions about the nature of climate damages. A hybrid policy. suggested by Roberts and Spence (1976). is also explored. Such a policy uses an initial distribution of tradeable permits to set a target emission level. but then allows additional permits to be purchased at a fixed “trigger” price. The optimal hybrid policy leads to welfare benefits only slightly higher than the optimal tax policy.

The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has some distinctive features that differentiate it from the more standard model of emissions trading.

1115435,Managing permit markets to stabilize prices,2005,Richard Newell and William Pizer and Jiangfeng Zhang,31,Environmental and Resource Economics,2,133-157,Kluwer Academic Publishers,The political economy of environmental policy favors the use of quantity-based instruments over price-based instruments (e.g.. tradable permits over green taxes). at least in the United States. With cost uncertainty. however. there are clear efficiency advantages to prices in cases where the marginal damages of emissions are relatively flat. such as with greenhouse gases. The question arises. therefore. of whether one can design flexible quantity policies that mimic the behavior of price policies. namely stable permit prices and abatement costs. We explore a number of “quantity-plus” policies that replicate the behavior of a price policy through rules that adjust the effective permit cap for unexpectedly low or high costs. They do so without necessitating any monetary exchanges between the government and the regulated firms. which can be a significant political barrier to the use of price instruments.,True,Im8TwrIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,166,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10640-005-1761-y.pdf,15885551255575226918,/scholar?cites=15885551255575226918,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10524/files/dp030034.pdf,0,0,0

Resources for the future discussion paper",12-53,,,In September 2011. the US Environmental Protection Agency asked 12 economists how the benefits and costs of regulations should be discounted for projects that affect future generations. This paper summarizes the views of the panel on three topics: the use of the Ramsey formula as an organizing principle for determining discount rates over long horizons. whether the discount rate should decline over time. and how intra-and intergenerational discounting practices can be made compatible. The panel members agree that the Ramsey formula provides a useful framework for thinking about intergenerational discounting. We also agree that theory provides compelling arguments for a declining certainty-equivalent discount rate. In the Ramsey formula. uncertainty about the future rate of growth in per capita consumption can lead to a declining consumption rate of discount. assuming that shocks to consumption are positively correlated. This uncertainty in future consumption growth rates may be estimated econometrically based on historic observations. or it can be derived from subjective uncertainty about the mean rate of growth in mean consumption or its volatility. Determining the remaining parameters of the Ramsey formula is. however. challenging.,True,Im8TwrIAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,154,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199511,5103197781165317707,/scholar?cites=5103197781165317707,,https://www.rff.org/documents/1564/RFF-DP-12-53.pdf,0,0,0

After years of negotiation. this effort led to the 1997 signing of the Kyoto Protocol. a binding commitment by industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to slightly below 1990 recorded levels. Without approving or disapproving of the response effort embodied in the Kyoto Protocol. I believe that an important element has been ignored. Namely. should we specify our response to climate change in terms of a quantitative target?The appeal of a quantitative target is obvious. A commitment to a particular emissions level provides a straightforward measure of environmental progress as well as compliance. Commitment to an emissions tax. for example. offers neither a guarantee that emissions will be limited to a certain level nor an obvious way to measure a country’s compliance (when other taxes and subsidies already exist).

Lower prices have two main effects: increasing overall energy consumption. and encouraging substitution away from sources such as coal. nuclear. renewables. and electricity. We examine the evidence and analyze modeling projections to understand how these two dynamics affect greenhouse gas emissions. Most evidence indicates that natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity production. gasoline in transport. and electricity in buildings decreases greenhouse gases. although as an electricity substitute this depends on the electricity mix displaced.

These governments tend to experience increased revenue from a variety of sources. such as severance taxes distributed by the state government. local property taxes and sales taxes. direct payments from oil and gas companies. and in-kind contributions from those companies. Local governments also tend to face increased demand for services such as road repairs due to heavy truck traffic and from population growth associated with the oil and gas sector. This paper describes the major oil-and gas related revenues and service demands (ie. costs) that county and municipal governments have experienced in Arkansas. Colorado. Louisiana. Montana.

Based on extensive interviews with officials in the most heavily affected parts of these states. along with analysis of financial data. it appears that most county and municipal governments have experienced net financial benefits. though some in western North Dakota and eastern Montana appear to have experienced net negative fiscal impacts.

Despite the heated debate. neither side has a monopoly on the facts. In this book. Daniel Raimi gives a balanced and accessible view of oil and gas development. clearly and thoroughly explaining the key issues surrounding the shale revolution. The Fracking Debate directly addresses the most common questions and concerns associated with fracking: What is fracking? Does fracking pollute the water supply? Will fracking make the United States energy independent? Does fracking cause earthquakes? How is fracking regulated? Is fracking good for the economy? Coupling a deep understanding of the scholarly research with lessons from his travels to every major US oil-and gas-producing region.

We find partisan affiliation correlates very strongly with support for oil and gas development. that voters in precincts with higher levels of oil and gas activity are modestly more supportive of the industry. but that this support weakens in precincts where development has grown most rapidly.,True,dYJEO6YAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620300189,15952153172419491583,/scholar?cites=15952153172419491583,,,0,0,0

1115464,Coal Communities in Transition: A Case Study of Colstrip. Montana,2021,Kelli Roemer and Daniel Raimi and Rebecca Glaser,,,,,,Colstrip. Montana. is a small. isolated community that was established in the 1920s for the express purpose of mining coal. Later in the 20th century. the town became home to a large coal-fired power plant. which has since been the bedrock of the local economy. In 2020. however. two of the plant’s four units were retired. the future of the remaining two units is highly uncertain. and a history of groundwater contamination caused by coal ash poses additional challenges for future economic development. These issues. particularly the uncertainty over the plant’s future. have been exacerbated by the complex ownership structure of the plant. which has made it difficult for local leaders to establish a clear transition plan. Although state and federal policymakers have attempted to intervene. transition planning efforts to date have been ad hoc and not well coordinated. Colstrip’s experience highlights the importance of providing more certainty for communities in transition. It also suggests the need for more coordination among local. state. and federal stakeholders while providing more robust planning and transition support. Looking forward. isolated. resource-dependent communities like Colstrip will face considerable challenges in an energy transition. Federal and state policymakers can help create better outcomes by striving to provide more certainty along with technical and financial support to facilitate locally driven transition efforts.,True,dYJEO6YAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C,0,https://www.ktrpac.com/documents/2805/RFF_Report_21-01_Colstrip_Case_Study.pdf,,,,https://www.ktrpac.com/documents/2805/RFF_Report_21-01_Colstrip_Case_Study.pdf,0,0,0

More comprehensive data show that. while the water intensity of production may have increased in regions such as the Permian basin. it has decreased by 74% in the Marcellus and by 19% in the Eagle Ford region. This error likely stems from an improper method for estimating energy production from wells: The authors use the median well to represent regional production. which systematically underestimates aggregate production volumes.

1115474,Rebating environmental policy revenues: Output-based allocations and tradable performance standards,2001,Carolyn Fischer,,,1318-2016-103366,,,Political pressure often exists to earmark environmental tax revenues or permit rents to the industry affected by the regulation. This paper analyzes schemes that rebate revenues based on output shares: tradable performance standards. an emissions tax with market-share rebates. and tradable permits with output-based allocation. All three policies effectively combine a tax on emissions with a subsidy to output. The result is a shifting of emissions control efforts toward greater emissions rate reduction and less output contraction. with higher marginal costs of control and lower output prices compared to the social optimum. given any targeted level of abatement. These welfare costs depend on the degree of output substitutability and are likely to be much larger in the long run. While some political and market-failure justifications may exist. policy makers should carefully consider industry characteristics before engaging in output-based rebating.,True,gHOLFRkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,251,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10709/,7029496498110667261,/scholar?cites=7029496498110667261,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10709/files/dp010022.pdf,0,0,0

For the same expected emissions. however. the economic responses to unexpected productivity shocks differ. Using a real business cycle model. we find that a cap dampens the effects of productivity shocks in the economy on all variables except for the shadow value of the emissions constraint.

1115476,Renewable portfolio standards: when do they lower energy prices?,2010,Carolyn Fischer,31,The Energy Journal,1,,International Association for Energy Economics,Some studies of renewable portfolio standards find that regulations increase electricity generation costs; others find that the reduced demand for nonrenewable energy sources lowers natural gas prices and that electricity prices follow. This paper presents reasons for why these predictions can vary in the direction as well as the magnitude of their effects. The two driving factors are the elasticity of electricity supply from renewable energy sources relative to nonrenewable ones and the effective stringency of the target. The availability of other baseload generation helps to determine that stringency. and demand elasticity influences only the magnitude of the price effects. not the direction of those effects. The paper also evaluates circumstances under which higher standards can decrease both certificate prices and renewable energy supply.

We compare different rules for allocating carbon allowances within sectors (lump-sum grandfathering. output-based allocation (OBA). auctioning) and among sectors (historical emissions or value-added shares). The output subsidies implicit in OBA mitigate tax interactions. unlike grandfathering. OBA with sectoral distributions based on value added is similar to revenue recycling with auctioning. OBA based on historical emissions supports heavier polluters. more effectively counteracting carbon leakage. but at higher welfare costs.

This paper uses a simple model to demonstrate the interaction between environmental policies. R&D externalities. and the social return to innovation. The results indicate that strong public support for innovation in abatement technologies is only justified if at least a moderate emissions policy is in place and spillover effects are significant. If emissions policy can adjust to cost changes. the public role may be enhanced. since private actors will prefer to avoid ratcheting.

A range of combinations of tighter allocations could improve situations in both sectors with trade while holding emissions constant.© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

1115481,The global effects of subglobal climate policies,2010,Christoph Böhringer and Carolyn Fischer and Knut Einar Rosendahl,,Resources for the Future Discussion Paper,10-48,,,Individual countries are in the process of legislating responses to the challenges posed by climate change. The prospect of rising carbon prices raises concerns in these nations about the effects on the competitiveness of their own energy-intensive industries and the potential for carbon leakage. particularly leakage to emerging economies that lack comparable regulation. In response. certain developed countries are proposing controversial trade-related measures and allowance allocation designs to complement their climate policies. Missing from much of the debate on trade-related measures is a broader understanding of how climate policies implemented unilaterally (or subglobally) affect all countries in the global trading system. Arguably. the largest impacts are from the targeted carbon pricing itself. which generates macroeconomic effects. terms-of-trade changes. and shifts in global energy demand and prices; it also changes the relative prices of certain energy-intensive goods. This paper studies how climate policies implemented in certain major economies (the European Union and the United States) affect the global distribution of economic and environmental outcomes. and how these outcomes may be altered by complementary policies aimed at addressing carbon leakage.,True,gHOLFRkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,154,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1694104,164811579828127099,/scholar?cites=164811579828127099,,https://ssb.brage.unit.no/ssb-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/178124/2010_global%20effects%20of%20subglobal%20climate.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Controlling for policy regimes we use meta-analysis to examine the importance of structural modeling choices in explaining differences in estimates. The analysis indicates that particular assumptions about perfectly foresighted consumers and Armington trade elasticities generate lower estimates of marginal abatement costs. Other choices are associated with higher cost estimates. including perfectly mobile capital. inclusion of a backstop technology. and greater disaggregation among regions and sectors. Some features. such as greater technological detail. seem less significant.

Participation is voluntary. so it will not occur without sufficient credits. Evaluating reductions requires assigning an emissions baseline for a counterfactual that cannot be measured. Some investments have both economic and environmental benefits and might occur anyway. Uncertainty surrounds both emissions and investment returns. and parties to the project are likely to have more information than the certifying authority. The certifying agent is limited in its ability to design a contract that would reveal investment intentions. As a result. rules for benchmarking emissions may be systematically biased to overallocate. and they also risk creating inefficient investment incentives.

Most species are brought to their new homes unintentionally. which constitutes a market failure rooted in international trade. Unless it is practical to drive invasion risk to zero. the external costs may justify a tariff. In this paper. we analyze the political process likely to govern the formation of tariffs so justified using a straightforward incorporation of an invasive species externality into Grossman and Helpman's (GH) well-known political economy model. We show that our measure of disguised protectionism—the gap between the optimal tariff and that set in the equilibrium of the political economy game—is equal to the tariff that would be set if there were no invasive species and no international disciplines on trade policy.

When a finite work requirement must be completed by a deadline. the remaining time for leisure is an exhaustible resource. With a positive rate of time preference. the optimal allocation of this resource results in more hours spent working (and fewer in leisure) the closer the deadline. Key qualitative findings of psychological studies of academic procrastination are consistent with the standard natural resource management principles implied by the model. when suitably adapted to task aversiveness. uncertainty. and multiple deadlines.

It also reflects some of the challenges of disseminating codes of conduct in developing countries and ensuring market benefits from certification. We describe the emergence of forest certification standards. outline current certification schemes. and discuss the role of major corporations in creating demand for certified products. We also discuss the limited success of certification and some of the obstacles to its adoption in developing countries. The current diversity of forest certification programs and ecolabeling schemes has created a costly. less-than-transparent system that has been largely ineffective in terms of the initial goals of reducing tropical deforestation and illegal logging. Some steps have been taken toward harmonization of different certification criteria as well as endorsement and mutual recognition among existing forest certification programs.

The relative welfare gains from innovation depend on three key factors—the initially optimal level of abatement. the speed at which innovation reduces future abatement costs. and the discount rate. We calculate the welfare gains from innovation under a variety of different scenarios. Mostly they are less than the Pigouvian welfare gains.

The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers. several of which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper). the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8%.

This paper addresses two issues critical for designing restoration projects for coastal protection: (i) a synthesis of the costs and benefits of projects designed for coastal protection (nature-based defences) and (ii) analyses of the effectiveness of coastal habitats (natural defences) in reducing wave heights and the biophysical parameters that influence this effectiveness. We (i) analyse data from sixty-nine field measurements in coastal habitats globally and examine measures of effectiveness of mangroves. salt-marshes. coral reefs and seagrass/kelp beds for wave height reduction; (ii) synthesise the costs and coastal protection benefits of fifty-two nature-based defence projects and; (iii) estimate the benefits of each restoration project by combining information on restoration costs with data from nearby field measurements. The analyses of field measurements show that coastal habitats have significant potential for reducing wave heights that varies by habitat and site. In general. coral reefs and salt-marshes have the highest overall potential.

The bioeconomic system is depicted with a metapopulation model where the subpopulations are connected by dispersal processes and are affected by the spatial distribution of harvesting effort. We characterize the optimal way to distribute harvesting effort over space and time in order to optimize returns from this spatial/dynamic system. We also investigate how the optimal spatial allocation of effort. harvesting. and biomass compare with second-best allocations that ignore spatial processes in this system. We find that optimal instruments reflect the interplay between the spatial gradient of rents and the spatial gradient of biological dispersal.

We find that reserve creation can produce win‐win situations where aggregate biomass and the common license (lease) price increase. These situations arise in biological systems where dispersal processes are prevalent and the fishery prior to reserve creation is operating at effort levels in a neighborhood of open‐access levels. We also illustrate that using strictly biological criteria for siting reserves (e.g.. setting aside the most biological productive areas) will likely induce the most vociferous objections from the fishing industry.

At the heart of the controversy is whether there is an “energy efficiency gap.” whereby consumers and firms fail to make seemingly positive net present value energy saving investments.

Is there any validity to the claims that energy efficiency improvements can actually lead to an increase in energy use (known as backfire)? This article clarifies what the rebound effect is and provides a guide for economists and policymakers interested in its existence and magnitude. We discuss how some studies in the literature consider a rebound effect that results from a costless exogenous increase in energy efficiency. whereas others examine the effects of a specific energy efficiency policy—a distinction that leads to very different welfare and policy implications.

Congestion is likely to worsen in the future with continued growth in vehicle miles; for example. in the Metropolitan Washington DC area. vehicle miles are projected to increase by more than 40% over the next 20 years (National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board. 2002).

Consequently. transport planners and policy analysts are looking to novel approaches for bringing expanding demand for driving in line with available road capacity. One such approach is time-of-day congestion pricing. which economists have long advocated as an effective way of allocating scarce roadway capacity to the highest valued users (Pigou. 1920; Vickrey. 1969; Walters. 1961).,True,N3MqsukAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,81,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5xeyHveMZ78C&oi=fnd&pg=PA179&dq=info:VvMHWta5XL0J:scholar.google.com&ots=8BQDKywDHo&sig=PAFe-kEwvQZjWK88vusJg6Bq2Uw,13644985301310370646,/scholar?cites=13644985301310370646,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10697/files/dp030057.pdf,0,0,0

Using detailed characteristics of 42.611 small-scale (<15 kW) PV systems installed in 15 U.S. states during 2013. we identify the most important factors that make a system likely to be low-priced (LP). Comparing LP and non-LP systems. we find statistically significant differences in nearly all characteristics for which we have data.

According to Malthus. a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land. forcing the cultivation of land of poorer and poorer quality. This environ-mental degradation (broadly defined) lowers the marginal product of labor and. through its effect on income. reduces the rate of population growth. The result is an equilibrium population that enjoys low levels of both income and environmental quality. The modern statement of this view replaces agricultural land with nonrenewable resources. In this model. natural resources impose a limit to economic growth. with population pressures reducing the marginal product of labor as scarce natural resources are exploited more intensively. A more recent theme in discussions of population growth and the environment is the importance of environmental quality per se. where …,True,wi4_jTIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1031,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117838,10480548585123501465,/scholar?cites=10480548585123501465,,,0,0,0

This market offers firms facing high marginal abatement costs the opportunity to purchase the right to emit SO2 from firms with lower costs. and this is expected to yield cost savings compared to a command‐and‐control approach to environmental regulation. This paper uses econometrically estimated marginal abatement cost functions for power plants affected by Title IV of the CAAA to evaluate the performance of the SO2 allowance market.

1115558,Hidden costs of energy: unpriced consequences of energy production and use,2010,National Research Council,,,,,National Academies Press,Despite the many benefits of energy. most of which are reflected in energy market prices. the production. distribution. and use of energy causes negative effects. Many of these negative effects are not reflected in energy market prices. When market failures like this occur. there may be a case for government interventions in the form of regulations. taxes. fees. tradable permits. or other instruments that will motivate recognition of these external or hidden costs. The Hidden Costs of Energy defines and evaluates key external costs and benefits that are associated with the production. distribution. and use of energy. but are not reflected in market prices. The damage estimates presented are substantial and reflect damages from air pollution associated with electricity generation. motor vehicle transportation. and heat generation. The book also considers other effects not quantified in dollar amounts. such as damages from climate change. effects of some air pollutants such as mercury. and risks to national security. While not a comprehensive guide to policy. this analysis indicates that major initiatives to further reduce other emissions. improve energy efficiency. or shift to a cleaner electricity generating mix could substantially reduce the damages of external effects. A first step in minimizing the adverse consequences of new energy technologies is to better understand these external effects and damages.

Taking issue with the Brundtland Report's optimistic and widely accepted assumptions. the authors show that the positive effects of recycling. increased fuel-efficiency. and other technological adjustments will not go far enough to provide for truly sustainable development in the long term. Through a new. broad-based empirical analysis. they argue that unless there are significant changes in lifestyles and the use of technologies. continued environmental degradation cannot be avoided. They warn that the trend of making only slight adjustments in the use of technologies. while feasible from an economic point of view for industrialized nations. will undoubtedly lead to further environmental damage. In addition to offering a clear and unflinching look at what development is really doing to the global environment. the unique conceptual framework developed for this analysis provides an invaluable basis for analysis for the new. multidisciplinary field of ecological economics.

The primary purpose of cleanups at hazardous-waste disposal sites. for example. is often to prevent the contamination of groundwater that could pose risks to future residents at these sites. Such cleanups typically involve considerable capital and other costs. which are incurred at the front end of the project. and yield a stream of health benefits. often in the form of cancer cases avoided. that may not be recognized for many years. This would not pose unusual problems for program evaluation if everyone were comfortable with the assignment of dollar values to these reductions in future risk (see Cropper and Port-ney. 1990).

Two types of catastrophe are analyzed. In one case catastrophe results in a temporary reduction in utility; in the other. catastrophe is irreversible and is tantamount to truncating the planning horizon. The first case characterizes certain types of pollution problems such as radioactive pollution produced by a nuclear power plant.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated. and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates. then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. There is a growing empirical literature that estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the DDR schedule. However. this literature has been criticized because it lacks a connection to the theory of project evaluation.

Given this view. the appropriate way to measure the morbidity benefits of a reduction in pollution is to estimate a damage function and then assign a dollar value to the predicted decrease in illness. This. together with any reduction in medical costs. is what an individual would pay for a decrease in pollution if. he treated his health as exogenous. Unfortunately. this approach is inconsistent with the view. widely held in health economics. that individuals can affect the time they spend ill by investing in preventive health care.

Why have traditional economic models of investment failed to explain the behavior of investment spending in the United States and other countries? In this book. Avinash Dixit and Robert Pindyck provide the first detailed exposition of a new theoretical approach to the capital investment decisions of firms. stressing the irreversibility of most investment decisions. and the ongoing uncertainty of the economic environment in which these decisions are made. In so doing. they answer important questions about investment decisions and the behavior of investment spending. This new approach to investment recognizes the option value of waiting for better (but never complete) information. It exploits an analogy with the theory of options in financial markets. which permits a much richer dynamic framework than was possible with the traditional theory of investment. The authors present the new theory in a clear and systematic way. and consolidate. synthesize. and extend the various strands of research that have come out of the theory. Their book shows the importance of the theory for understanding investment behavior of firms; develops the implications of this theory for industry dynamics and for government policy concerning investment; and shows how the theory can be applied to specific industries and to a wide variety of business problems.,True,RiJSLsoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,18800,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VahsELa_qC8C&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:-AtGSHAaFacJ:scholar.google.com&ots=FDzYnAWahM&sig=7F3D2_UNzOGbxeKi-5l5bICoMMk,12039558248396098552,/scholar?cites=12039558248396098552,,,0,0,0

First. the expenditures are largely irreversible; the firm cannot disinvest. so the expenditures must be viewed as sunk costs. Second. the investments can be delayed. giving the firm an opportunity to wait for new information about prices. costs. and other market conditions before it commits resources. Irreversibility usually arises because capital is industry or firm specific. ie. it cannot be used productively in a different industry or by a different firm. A steel plant. for example. is industry specific. It can only be used to produce steel. so if the demand for steel falls. the market value of the plant will fall.

Investment requires the full value of a marginal unit of capacity to be at least as large as its full cost. The former includes the value of the firms option not to utilize the unit. and the latter includes the opportunity cost of exercising the investment option. We show that for moderate amounts of uncertainty. the firm's optimal capacity is much smaller than it would be if investment were reversible. and a large fraction of the firm's value is due to the possibility of future growth.

MIT Press, Cambridge",,,,"Recent studies of the practice of corporate management verify that there continues to be a discrepancy between traditional finance theory and corporate practice. Many managers. dissatisfied with the current state of capital budgeting. are often willing to overrule conventional net present value (NPV) analysis or other discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques because they see additional value in projects beyond that resulting from directly measurable cash flows.Specifically. many practitioners recognize two aspects of extra value that are not adequately addressed in a conventional NPV analysis:(1) the"" operating flexibility"" of a project that is simply a collection of options enabling management to make or revise decisions at some future time (eg. to defer. expand. or abandon a project early). and (2) the"" strategic value"" of a project resulting from its interdependencies with future. follow-up investments and from competitive interaction. Several academics have also recognized that traditional capital budgeting techniques may often misvalue projects due to the presence of such strategic interactions and managerial operating options. For example. Myers [20] notes the inability of conventional DCF techniques to capture the time-series interactions among contingent investments. Kester [12] uses Myers' initial concept of looking at growth investment opportunities as options on real assets to explore qualitatively the"" strategic"" and competitive interaction aspects of real projects.

1115591,The structure of world energy demand,1979,Robert S Pindyck,22,,,,MIT press,"Engineers. scientists. and policy makers (let alone the general public) have been thoroughly confused as to certain key facts essential to formulating sound national energy policy. In particular. they have lacked reliable information needed to decide whether energy shortages should be alleviated by mandatory controls. including rationing. or whether market forces. ie. the price mechanism. can or should be relied on to do the job. The issue subdivides further into questions of efficiency versus equity. with various parties assigning quite different weights to these two objectives. Pindyck concentrates on the former issue. ie. the ability of prices to effect the adjustment process. leaving matters of fairness aside (presumably to be considered in the context of taxation and welfare programs). The study was supported by a grant from the RANN Division of the National Science Foundation and the Center for Energy Policy Research of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Energy Laboratory. and forms part of a larger project at MIT to develop analytical models of the world oil market. It summarizes the results of econometric studies of world energy demand. principally in the residential and industrial sectors for selected industrialized countries. although some work was also included on transportation and a few developing nations. Among the important questions the author examines are: To what extent does energy demand respond to changes in energy prices in the long run. when users have time to change the stock of capital (buildings. cars. appliances. etc.)?

Thus. producers always know current demand and reserves but do not know what demand and reserves will be in the future. I show that demand uncertainty has no effect on the expected dynamics of market price. while reserve uncertainty shifts the expected rate of change of price only if extraction costs are nonlinear in reserves. However. if the demand function is nonlinear. both demand. and reserve uncertainty affect the dynamics of production. whatever the character of extraction costs.

Indeed. looking at the historical success record of various cartels (or attempts at cartelization). a case could be made that those cartels were most successful for which potential monopoly profits were the greatest.'After all. there are significant costs associated with cartelization-political costs. cost of coordination of output and price. and. for each producer. costs associated with the risk of being undercut and losing significant short-term profits.

1115596,Irreversibilities and the timing of environmental policy,2000,Robert S Pindyck,22,Resource and energy economics,3,233-259,North-Holland,The standard framework in which economists evaluate environmental policies is cost–benefit analysis. so policy debates usually focus on the expected flows of costs and benefits. or on the choice of discount rate. But this can be misleading when there is uncertainty over future outcomes. when there are irreversibilities. and when policy adoption can be delayed.

1115599,The economics of risk and time,2001,Christian Gollier,,,,,MIT press,This book updates and advances the theory of expected utility as applied to risk analysis and financial decision making. Von Neumann and Morgenstern pioneered the use of expected utility theory in the 1940s. but most utility functions used in financial management are still relatively simplistic and assume a mean-variance world. Taking into account recent advances in the economics of risk and uncertainty. this book focuses on richer applications of expected utility in finance. macroeconomics. and environmental economics. The book covers these topics: expected utility theory and related concepts; the standard portfolio problem of choice under uncertainty involving two different assets; P the basic hyperplane separation theorem and log-supermodular functions as technical tools for solving various decision-making problems under uncertainty; s choice involving multiple risks; the Arrow-Debreu portfolio problem; consumption and saving; the equilibrium price of risk and time in an Arrow-Debreu economy; and dynamic models of decision making when a flow of information on future risks is expected over time.

This concept is called risk vulnerability. It is equivalent to the condition that an undesirable risk can never be made desirable by the presence of an independent. unfair risk. Moreover. under risk vulnerability. adding an unfair background risk reduces the demand for risky assets. Risk vulnerability generalizes the concept of properness (individually undesirable. independent risks are always jointly undesirable) introduced by Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987). It implies that the two first derivatives of the utility function are concave transformations of the original utility function.

Whether liability litigation for pharmaceutical firms or an individual's having insufficient wealth to retire. risk is something that can be recognized. quantified. analyzed. treated--and incorporated into our decision-making processes. This book represents a concise summary of basic multiperiod decision-making under risk. Its detailed coverage of a broad range of topics is ideally suited for use in advanced undergraduate and introductory graduate courses either as a self-contained text. or the introductory chapters combined with a selection of later chapters can represent core reading in courses on macroeconomics. insurance. portfolio choice. or asset pricing. The authors start with the fundamentals of risk measurement and risk aversion. They then apply these concepts to insurance decisions and portfolio choice in a one-period model. After examining these decisions in their one-period setting. they devote most of the book to a multiperiod context. which adds the long-term perspective most risk management analyses require.

We consider an exchange economy with two periods and complete markets in which households with log utility invest in the first period and consume in the second period.

We suppose that there is an exogenous process for the growth of consumption per capita. which is stochastic. We first evaluate the determinants of the discount rate for a specific horizon when the representative agent has a recursive utility. We then explore the influence of the time horizon in the expected utility model. Under various conditions on preferences. as positive prudence. decreasing relative risk aversion or decreasing absolute risk aversion. we prove that (1) the fact that growth is uncertain reduces the efficient discount rate at any horizon. and that (2) this discount rate should be smaller for more distant futures.

1115608,Peer group formation in an adverse selection model,2000,Beatriz Armendariz and Christian Gollier,110,Economic Journal,465,632-643,Royal Economic Society,This paper develops an adverse selection model where peer group systems are shown to trigger lower interest rates and remove credit rationing in the case where borrowers are uninformed about their potential partners and ex post state verification (or auditing) by banks is costly. Peer group formation reduces interest rates due to a'collateral effect'. namely. cross subsidisation amongst borrowers acts as collateral behind a loan. By uncovering such a collateral effect. this paper shows that peer group systems can be viewed as an effective risk pooling mechanism. and thus enhance efficiency. notjust in the full information set up.A well-known family of adverse selection models in the Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) tradition demonstrates that when banks are imperfectly informed about the riskiness of borrowers' projects and therefore cannot discriminate against risky borrowers. interest rates become inefficiently high. and worthy borrowers are driven out of the credit market. The extent of this problem is substantially magnified when borrowers do not have adequate collateral to secure a loan. Typically. adverse selection combined with lack of collateral leads to prohibitively high interest rates. Poorly endowed individuals (eg students. immigrants. the unemployed. and a vast majority of poor individuals in developing countries) often face such high rates. and therefore cannot take advantage of profitable investment opportunities. A peer group formation system represents a possible solution to the above problem. Under this system a bank lends to borrowers without collateral on condition that the borrowers organise themselves into groups. and that participant …,True,pZOhHT4AAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC,379,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.888.7871&rep=rep1&type=pdf,14320470939443655858,/scholar?cites=14320470939443655858,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.888.7871&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1115609,Pricing the planet's future: the economics of discounting in an uncertain world,2013,Christian Gollier,,,,,Princeton University Press,Our path of economic development has generated a growing list of environmental problems including the disposal of nuclear waste. exhaustion of natural resources. loss of biodiversity. climate change. and polluted land. air. and water. All these environmental problems raise the crucial challenge of determining what we should and should not do for future generations. It is also central to other policy debates. including. for example. the appropriate level of public debt. investment in public infrastructure. investment in education. and the level of funding for pension benefits and for research and development. Today. the judge. the citizen. the politician. and the entrepreneur are concerned with the sustainability of our development. The objective of Pricing the Planet's Future is to provide a simple framework to organize the debate on what we should do for the future. A key element of analysis by economists is the discount rate--the minimum rate of return required from an investment project to make it desirable to implement. Christian Gollier outlines the basic theory of the discount rate and the various arguments that favor using a smaller discount rate for more distant cash flows.

In addition to the primary benefit of improved time-diversification. this form of risk allocation affords the additional benefit of allowing these funds to take better advantage of the equity premium. which also favors the consumers. In this paper. our aim is twofold. First. we characterize the socially efficient policy rules of a collective pension plan in terms of portfolio management. capital payments to retirees. and dividend payments to shareholders. We examine both the first-best rules and the second-best rules. where. in the latter case. the fund is constrained by a solvency constraint and by a guaranteed minimum return to workers' contributions.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated. and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates. then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. There is a growing empirical literature that estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the DDR schedule. However. this literature has been criticized because it lacks a connection to the theory of project evaluation.

While it is intuitive that more ambiguity aversion would reduce demand for the uncertain asset. this is not necessarily the case. We derive sufficient conditions for a reduction in the demand for the uncertain asset and for an increase in the equity premium. An example that meets the sufficient conditions is when the set of plausible distributions for returns on the uncertain asset can be ranked according to their monotone likelihood ratio.

The audience for this chapter (indeed for this entire volume) is decision makers at many different levels.  The significance of the social dimension and the role of ethics and economics is underscored by Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). which indicates that the ultimate objective of the Convention is to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Two main issues confronting society are: what constitutes  dangerous interference  with the climate system and how to deal with that interference (see box 3.1). Providing information to answer these inter-related questions is a primary purpose of the IPCC. Although natural science helps us understand how emissions can change the climate. and. in turn. generate physical impacts on ecosystems. people. and the physical environment. determining what is dangerous involves judging the level of adverse consequences. the steps necessary to mitigate these consequences. and the risk that humanity is willing to tolerate.

Of course economic development has always been the grand theme of historically minded scholars of large mind and bold concept. notably Marx. Schumpeter. Kuznets. But the mainstream of economic analysis was not comfortable with phenomena of change and progress. The stationary state was the long-run equilibrium of classical and neoclassical theory. and comparison of alternative static equilibriums was the most powerful theoretical tool.

Using language accessible to any concerned citizen and taking care to present different points of view fairly. he discusses the problem from start to finish: from the beginning. where warming originates in our personal energy use. to the end. where societies employ regulations or taxes or subsidies to slow the emissions of gases responsible for climate change. Nordhaus offers a new analysis of why earlier policies. such as the Kyoto Protocol. failed to slow carbon dioxide emissions. how new approaches can succeed. and which policy tools will most effectively reduce emissions.

In any given economy there must be a number of commodities that enter into production and which are used up. and whose available stock cannot be increased. Examples like fossil fuels come readily to mind. It would seem reasonable to argue that in the long run the limited availability of these commodities. together with their technological importance. would begin to act as a constraint on the economy's growth potential. In fact several recent studies have laid great emphasis on this possibility. 3 Although the point is an obvious one. most economic studies of the properties of long-run plans neglect it. 4 In this paper. therefore. we explore in a rather preliminary way the problems that appear to arise naturally when the existence of exhaustible resources is incorporated into the study of intertemporal plans.It appears that questions in this area are hard to answer.

We consider two criteria for the possible excessiveness (or insufficiency) of current consumption. One is an intertemporal utility-maximization criterion: actual current consumption is deemed excessive if it is higher than the level of current consumption on the consumption path that maximizes the present discounted value of utility. The other is a sustainability criterion. which requires that current consumption be consistent with non-declining living standards over time.

1115658,Valuing the future: economic theory and sustainability,1998,Geoffrey Martin Heal,,,,,Columbia University Press,"With issues like global warming and the loss of biodiversity becoming increasingly important to policymakers and scientists worldwide. the issue of sustainability cannot be ignored as we move toward the twenty-first century. Not surprisingly. the sustainable management of the biosphere has in recent years been the subject of much attention among ecologists. environmental engineers. and other members of the scientific community. Yet although these issues are clearly rooted in economic behavior and organization. the question of sustainability is not one that has been addressed directly by economists. Now. with Valuing the Future. economist Geoffrey Heal presents a coherent framework for understanding the earth's future from an economic perspective. Heal's model begins with a reconciliation of the economist's and environmentalist's time horizon: in economics. discussions of"" the long run"" generally refer to a much shorter timeline than do those of the earth sciences. The book shows the benefits of viewing the environment as an economic asset that should be understood as a part of a nation's income and explains how this approach can lead to more conservative patterns of resource use. Stepping beyond merely theoretical generalities. Valuing the Future offers a dynamic new blueprint for comprehending sustainability. Chapters provide complete mathematical templates for the valuation of a depletable stock and of renewable resources. the proper calculation of national income. and the conduct of cost-benefit analysis.

1115659,Nature and the marketplace: capturing the value of ecosystem services,2000,Geoffrey Heal,,,,,Island Press,"In recent years. scientists have begun to focus on the idea that healthy. functioning ecosystems provide essential services to human populations. ranging from water purification to food and medicine to climate regulation. Lacking a healthy environment. these services would have to be provided through mechanical means. at a tremendous economic and social cost. Nature and the Marketplace examines the controversial proposition that markets should be designed to capture the value of those services. Written by an economist with a background in business. it evaluates the real prospects for various of nature's marketable services to"" turn profits"" at levels that exceed the profits expected from alternative. ecologically destructive. business activities. The author: describes the infrastructure that natural systems provide. how we depend on it. and how we are affecting it explains the market mechanism and how it can lead to more efficient resource use looks at key economic activities--such as ecotourism. bioprospecting. and carbon sequestration--where market forces can provide incentives for conservation examines policy options other than the market. such as pollution credits and mitigation banking considers the issue of sustainability and equity between generations.

We model explicitly (with the model in Chichilnisky. 1993b) the fact that the atmosphere is a public good. Within this framework we establish conditions for it to be necessary for optimality that the marginal cost of abatement be the same in all countries. These conditions are quite restrictive. and amount to either ignoring distributional issues between countries or operating within a framework within which lump-sum transfers can be made between countries. These results have implications for the use of tradeable emission permits. which as normally advocated will lead to the equalization of marginal abatement costs across countries. The observation that the atmosphere is a public good implies that we may need to look at a Lindahl equilibrium rather than a Walrasian equilibrium in tradeable permits.,True,XsCunYgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,300,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165176594901198,2690665742370928691,/scholar?cites=2690665742370928691,,https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D88K7HHZ/download,0,0,0

Yet some of the worst lenders are now bankrupt. and Toyota has enjoyed phenomenal success by positioning itself as the green car company par excellence. These trends suggest that antisocial corporate behavior has its costs. especially in terms of the stock market. which penalizes companies that have poor environmental track records and rewards more socially conscious brands. The political context of our economy is rapidly changing. particularly in regard to incentives that operate outside the marketplace in a strict and narrow sense and involve interactions between corporations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). activist groups. regulatory bodies. consumers. and civil society. These interactions can significantly color a corporation's alternatives. making socially or environmentally harmful behavior much less attractive.

United Kingdom. SW11 3UE,Prescriptive economics requires that. unless there are very good reasons to the contrary. economic policy should be based on the principle that individuals’ preferences should count. Indeed. the entire body of ‘welfare economics’ centres round the formal identity of the statement “X prefers A to B” and the statement “X has higher welfare in A rather than B”. This combination of a seemingly innocuous and democratic value judgement—preferences should count—and a formal definition about the meaning of welfare improvement involves many complications. The entire history of policy analysis focuses on those complications. Whose preferences should count? Over what time period? What constitutes a legitimate attenuation of the basic value judgement? One of the problem areas concerns timediscounting—the process whereby society places a lower value on a future gain or loss than on the same gain or loss occurring now. The rationale for time-discounting follows logically from the basic value judgement of welfare economics. If people’s preferences count and if people prefer now to the future. those preferences must be integrated into social policy formulation. Time-discounting is thus universal in economic analysis. but it remains. as it always has. controversial. The controversy has a parallel in another form of discounting—spatial discounting.

We show that the majority of experts do not follow the simple Ramsey Rule. a widely used theoretical discounting framework. when recommending SDRs. Despite disagreement on discounting procedures and point values. we obtain a surprising degree of consensus among experts. with more than three-quarters finding the median risk-free SDR of 2 percent acceptable.

Resources for the future discussion paper",12-53,,,In September 2011. the US Environmental Protection Agency asked 12 economists how the benefits and costs of regulations should be discounted for projects that affect future generations. This paper summarizes the views of the panel on three topics: the use of the Ramsey formula as an organizing principle for determining discount rates over long horizons. whether the discount rate should decline over time. and how intra-and intergenerational discounting practices can be made compatible. The panel members agree that the Ramsey formula provides a useful framework for thinking about intergenerational discounting. We also agree that theory provides compelling arguments for a declining certainty-equivalent discount rate. In the Ramsey formula. uncertainty about the future rate of growth in per capita consumption can lead to a declining consumption rate of discount. assuming that shocks to consumption are positively correlated. This uncertainty in future consumption growth rates may be estimated econometrically based on historic observations. or it can be derived from subjective uncertainty about the mean rate of growth in mean consumption or its volatility. Determining the remaining parameters of the Ramsey formula is. however. challenging.,True,TV_spNIAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,154,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199511,5103197781165317707,/scholar?cites=5103197781165317707,,https://www.rff.org/documents/1564/RFF-DP-12-53.pdf,0,0,0

Using plot-level data from a specifically designed survey conducted in Pakistan. we investigate the productive benefits for farmers who adapt to climate change. The impact of implementing on-farm adaptation strategies is estimated separately for two staple crops: wheat and rice. We employ propensity score matching and endogenous switching regressions to account for the possibility that farmers self-select into adaptation. Estimated productivity gains are positive and significant for rice farmers who adapted. but negligible for wheat. Counterfactual gains for non-adapters were significantly positive. which is potentially a sign of transactions costs to adaptation. Other factors associated with adaptation were formal credit and extension. underscoring the importance of addressing institutional and informational constraints that inhibit farmers from improving their farming practices.

We first clarify the theoretical basis of the ENPV approach. Then. rather than following previous work which used a single series of U.S. Treasury bond returns. we treat nominal interest rates and inflation as co-integrated series and estimate the empirical term structure of discount rates via the ‘Fisher Effect’.

However. when eco-entrepreneurs face non-price rationing in input or output markets. as is typical for credit in developing countries for example. we show that interventions which relax constraints can be more cost-effective than PES. One corollary of this is that such indirect approaches are preferred to PES by interveners (e.g.. donors) and eco-entrepreneurs alike.

In this survey we classify studies by data type and by ten different categories of model and with the exception of estimates on seasonal data. which tend to be unstable. and of certain inappropriate model formulations. we find a fair degree of agreement concerning average short-run and even long-run income and price elasticities.,True,QPcgMqwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,716,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014098839190021Q,11316752429389348424,/scholar?cites=11316752429389348424,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1050.9455&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Not surprisingly. severe criticism has been levied against the report. especially by those who claim that the Stern Review's results hinge mainly on a discount rate that is too low. While we have no strong objections to the discounting assumptions adopted in the Stern Review. our main point in this article is that the conclusions reached in the Stern Review can be justified without using a low discount rate. We argue that nonmarket damages from climate change are probably underestimated and that future scarcities caused by the changing composition of the economy and climate change should lead to rising relative prices for certain goods and services.

1115706,Fuel taxes: An important instrument for climate policy,2007,Thomas Sterner,35,Energy policy,6,3194-3202,Elsevier,This article shows that fuel taxes serve a very important role for the environment and that we risk a backlash of increased emissions if they are abolished. Fuel taxes have restrained growth in fuel demand and associated carbon emissions. Although fuel demand is large and growing. our analysis shows that it would have been much higher in the absence of domestic fuel taxes. People often assert that fuel demand is inelastic but there is strong research evidence showing the opposite. The price elasticity is in fact quite high but only in the long-run: in the short run it may be quite inelastic which has important implications for policy makers. Had Europe not followed a policy of high fuel taxation but had low US taxes. then fuel demand would have been twice as large. Hypothetical transport demand in the whole OECD area is calculated for various tax scenarios and the results show that fuel taxes are the single most …,True,QPcgMqwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,448,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421506004113,2879103911996332671,/scholar?cites=2879103911996332671,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.208.9099&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Both of these factors depend on the assumptions made concerning the underlying utility and welfare functions. It is common to aggregate welfare gains and losses across generations and countries as if the utility of money were constant. but it is not. If we assume that a e CO2-equivalent dlubling implies costs equal to 1.5% of the income in both high and low income countries. a pure rate of time preference equal to zero. and a utility function which is logarithmic in income. then the marginal cost of CO2 emissions is estimated at 260–590 USD/ton C for a time horizon in the range 300–1000 years. an estimate which is large enough to justify significant reductions of CO2 emissions on purely economic grounds.

In 1994. Varberg introduced a weight-based billing system for household waste charging 1 kr/kg of waste and at the same time recycling centers were set up and a ‘green shopping’ campaign was launched. This led to a significant reduction in waste collected and increased recycling. This study had access to actual measured data on waste disposal at the household level for a residential area called Tvååker. in addition to survey data for the same households. This makes it possible to carry out a more reliable and more detailed analysis than has been previously possible. particularly with respect to attitudinal variables.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated. and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates. then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. There is a growing empirical literature that estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the DDR schedule. However. this literature has been criticized because it lacks a connection to the theory of project evaluation.

To economists this should be no surprise yet it seems that the role of fuel taxation as an instrument of climate policy has not been fully appreciated. It is however one of the few policy instruments that. since several decades. has actually reduced fuel consumption appreciably. Thanks to taxation (mainly in Europe and Japan). carbon emissions are considerably lower than they would have been otherwise. In future where carbon emissions are to be cut drastically. this instrument will be crucial. There is however much opposition to the instrument. This opposition uses various arguments. for instance that fuel taxes hurt the poor since they are strongly regressive.

1115721,Fuel taxes and the poor: the distributional effects of gasoline taxation and their implications for climate policy,2012,Thomas Sterner,,,,,Routledge,Fuel Taxes and the Poor challenges the conventional wisdom that gasoline taxation. an important and much-debated instrument of climate policy. has a disproportionately detrimental effect on poor people. Increased fuel taxes carry the potential to mitigate carbon emissions. reduce congestion. and improve local urban environment. As such. higher gasoline taxes could prove to be a fundamental part of any climate action plan. However. they have been resisted by powerful lobbies that have persuaded people that increased fuel taxation would be regressive. Reporting on examples of over two dozen countries. this book sets out to empirically investigate this claim. The authors conclude that while there may be some slight regressivity in some high-income countries. as a general rule. fuel taxation is a progressive policy particularly in low income countries. Rich countries can correct for regressivity by cutting back on other taxes that adversely affect poor people. or by spending more money on services for the poor. Meanwhile. in low-income countries. poor people spend a very small share of their money on fuel for transport. Some costs from fuel taxes may be passed on to poor people through more expensive public transportation and food transport. Nevertheless. in general the authors find that gasoline taxes become more progressive as the income of the country in question decreases. This book provides strong arguments for the proponents of environmental taxation. It has immediate policy implications at the intersection of multiple subject areas. including transportation. environmental regulation. development studies. and climate change …,True,QPcgMqwAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,149,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iurFBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT10&dq=info:mFUe4uT6eLUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=FGTA-UT2Sn&sig=P0t4SioIKqK7RhFdJzmYrt0bujY,13076477379023361432,/scholar?cites=13076477379023361432,,,0,0,0

PROPER. the first major public disclosure program in the developing world. was launched in June 1995; though it collapsed in 1998 with the Asian financial crisis. it is currently being revived. There have been claims of success for this pioneering scheme. yet little formal and conclusive analysis has been undertaken. We analyze changes in emissions concentrations (mg/L) using panel data techniques with plant-level data for participating firms and a control group.

There has been a marked increase in national policies and legislation on climate change since the AR4 with a diversity of approaches and a multiplicity of objectives (see Section 15.2). However. Figure 1.9 of Chapter 1 suggests that these policies. taken together. have not yet achieved a substantial deviation in emissions from the past trend. Limiting concentrations to levels that would be consistent with a likely probability of maintaining temperature increases below 2 degrees C this century (scenarios generally in the range of 430-480 ppmv CO2eq) would require that emissions break from these trends and be decreased substantially. In contrast. concentrations exceed 1000 ppmv CO2eq by 2100 in many baseline scenarios (that is. scenarios without additional efforts to reduce emissions).   The literature on mitigation scenarios provides a wide range of CO2 shadow price levels consistent with these goals. with estimates of less than US$50/tCO2 in 2020 in many studies and exceeding US$100/tCO2 in others. assuming a globally-efficient and immediate effort to reduce emissions. These shadow prices exhibit a strongly increasing trend thereafter. Policies and instruments are assessed in this light.   Section 15.2 assesses the role of institutions and governance. Section 15.3 lays out the classification of policy instruments and packages. while 15.4 discusses the methodologies used to evaluate policies and institutions.

Another approach views the underemployed economy as being in a state of temporary fixed price disequilibrium. in which case. aside from having to repress suspicions that the essence of effective demand failure might not have to do with prices fixed at'wrong'values. there is a lot of rationalising to be done about why profitable adjustments are so slow. This paper argues that something like an internally consistent theory of steady state involuntary unemployment is possible. and even plausible.

But because of parameter uncertainty the thin-tailed normal distribution conditioned on realized data becomes a thick-tailed Student-t distribution. which changes the entire nature of what is considered “puzzling” by reversing every inequality discrepancy needing to be explained. This paper shows that Bayesian updating of unknown structural parameters inevitably adds a permanent tail-thickening effect to posterior expectations.

1115752,Nature’s Numbers,1999,William D Nordhaus and Edward C Kokkelenberg,,,,,National Academy Press Washington. DC,This report addresses the question of whether the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) should be broadened to include activities involving natural resources and the environment. The NIPA are the most important measures of overall economic activity for a nation. They measure the total income and output of the nation; their purpose is to provide a coherent and comprehensive picture of the nation’s economy. A central principle underlying the national accounts is to measure production and income that arise primarily from the market economy. However. the NIPA’s focus on market activities has raised concerns that the accounts are incomplete and misleading because they omit important nonmarket activities. such as nonmarket work. the services of the environment. and human capital. In response to these concerns about standard measures of economic activity. private scholars and governments have endeavored to broaden the national accounts in many directions. Most recently. attention has focused on extending the accounts to include natural resources and the environment. The guiding principle in extended national accounts is to measure as much economic activity as is feasible. whether that activity takes place inside or outside the boundaries of the marketplace. Intensive work on environmental accounting began in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1992.

Different types of policy instruments are effective for different renewable energy sources.

Because the social returns to R&D investments are typically higher than the social returns to other types of investment. any new climate mitigation R&D that comes at the expense of other R&D investment may dampen the overall gains from induced technological change. Unfortunately. there has been little empirical work to guide modelers as to the potential magnitude of such crowding out effects.

1115770,R&D subsidies and climate policy: is there a “free lunch”?,2006,David Popp,77,Climatic Change,3,311-341,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Because of the long-term nature of the climate problem. technological advances are often seen as an important component of any solution. However. when considering the potential for technology to help solve the climate problem. two market failures exist which lead to underinvestment in climate-friendly R&D: environmental externalities and the public goods nature of new knowledge. As a result. government subsidies to climate-friendly R&D projects are often proposed as part of a policy solution. Using the ENTICE model. I analyze the effectiveness of such subsidies. both with and without other climate policies. such as a carbon tax. While R&D subsidies do lead to significant increases in climate-friendly R&D. this R&D has little impact on the climate itself. Subsidies address the problem of knowledge as a public good. but they do not address the environmental externality. and thus offer no additional …,True,xg7HYeUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,182,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-006-9056-z,14108577653474387121,/scholar?cites=14108577653474387121,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-006-9056-z.pdf,0,0,0
1115771,ENTICE-BR: The effects of backstop technology R&D on climate policy models,2006,David Popp,28,Energy Economics,2,188-222,North-Holland,Recent attempts to endogenize technology in climate policy models have produced mixed results. Models finding large gains from induced technological change (ITC) consider alternative energy technologies. but assume learning-by-doing. which ignores the opportunity costs of technological change. Models representing ITC through R&D spending consider opportunity costs. but typically include only a single representative energy technology. I address these shortcomings by including policy-induced energy R&D in a model with a backstop energy technology. While ITC is important. larger welfare gains come from simply adding an alternative technology to the model. as opportunity costs limit the role ITC can play. Moreover. since the backstop technology improves welfare even without climate policy. accurate policy analysis depends on a carefully constructed baseline simulation.,True,xg7HYeUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,176,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988305001052,8681055286870146657,/scholar?cites=8681055286870146657,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w10285/w10285.pdf,0,0,0
1115772,The transition to endogenous technical change in climate-economy models: a technical overview to the innovation modeling comparison project,2006,Jonathan Kohler and Michael Grubb and David Popp and Ottmar Edenhofer,,,Special Issue# 1,,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper assesses endogenous technical change (ETC) in climate-economy models. using the models in the Innovation Modeling Comparison Project (IMCP) as a representative cross-section. ETC is now a feature of most leading models. Following the new endogenous growth literature and the application of learning curves to the energy sector. there are two main concepts employed: knowledge capital and learning curves. The common insight is that technical change is driven by the development of knowledge capital and its characteristics of being partly non-rival and partly non-excludable. There are various different implementations of ETC. Recursive CGE models face particular difficulties in incorporating ETC and increasing returns. The main limitations of current models are: the lack of uncertainty analysis; the limited representation of the diffusion of technology; and the homogeneous nature of agents in the models including the lack of representation of institutional structures in the innovation process.,True,xg7HYeUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,175,https://www.iaee.org/en/Publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=2133,6976175235335701363,/scholar?cites=6976175235335701363,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2133,0,0,0
1115773,International technology transfer. climate change. and the clean development mechanism,2011,David Popp,5,,1,131-152,Oxford University Press,As the developed world begins efforts to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases. economic growth in developing countries is causing increased emissions from the developing world. Reducing these emissions while still enabling developing countries to grow requires the use of climate-friendly technologies in these countries. In most cases. these technologies are first created in high-income countries. Thus. the challenge for climate policy is to encourage the transfer of these climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. This article reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer and discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy. focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A key point is that technology diffusion is gradual.

Advances (and expected advances) in a single technology should affect both its adoption rate and the adoption of alternative technologies. This paper combines plant-level data on US coal-fired electric power plants with patent data pertaining to NOX pollution control techniques to study this link. As in other studies of environmental technologies. the effect of other explanatory variables is dominated by the effect of environmental regulations. demonstrating that the mere presence of environmental technologies is not enough to encourage its usage.

Using data on life expectancy. I develop two tests for altruism towards future generations.

In addition. the dye sensitizer can influence many of the key electron transfer processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface which also determine efficiency. Dye structure can influence and drive forward electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2. Conversely. dye structure can help retard loss electron transfer processes such as charge recombination of injected electrons in the TiO2 with dye cations and also recombination of these electrons with the electrolyte. Therefore tuning dye sensitizer light absorbing properties and control of the aforementioned electron transfer processes through structural design of the dye sensitizer is an important avenue through which optimization of DSSC efficiency should be pursued.

The introduction of nitrogen into the anatase structure starts at 500 °C. with N bonding to titanium via oxygen substitution. Increasing the treatment temperature leads to the formation of TiN (TiN1–xOx) and N‐doped rutile showing mixed‐valence Ti states. Microstructural characterization shows that the ordered mesoporosity is maintained until 700 °C. where TiN (TiN1–xOx) begins to form. Optical characterization shows that the discrete introduction of N is able to shift the titania absorption edge. The photocatalytic tests give the best results under visible light excitation for the film nitrided at 500 °C.

This effect is a result of the increased spatial proximity of the fluorescent molecules. which is induced by pore confinement that makes the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl moieties of the …,True,vGPKqLgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,46,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.200800606,9186184727889206885,/scholar?cites=9186184727889206885,,,0,0,0

There is a current tendency to transform homogeneous into heterogeneous catalysis. that will even be accelerated in the near future. Starting from a successful homogeneous catalyst. one general methodology allowing its recovery and reuse is to immobilize a suitable derivative of the active catalyst on an insoluble solid support. When the catalyst does not deactivate and is sufficiently stable under the reaction conditions. the ultimate immobilization methodology is to attach covalently the catalytically active species to the support.

The use of PIT-PV (photoinduced transient photovoltage) and L-TAS (laser transient absorption spectroscopy) showed that for devices that cannot reach efficiencies close to 19% there is a slow component of the photovoltage decay that corresponds to a charge recombination pathway for carrier losses responsible for the lower device efficiency.

The compounds were designed to exhibit maximal solubility in organic solvents. and reduced aggregation in the solid state. In order to achieve this. diphenylphenoxy groups were used to functionalize a monomeric PDI core. and two PDI dimers were bridged with either one or two thiophene units. In photovoltaic devices prepared using PDI dimers and a monomer in conjunction with PTB7. it was found that the formation of crystalline domains in either the acceptor or donor was completely suppressed. Atomic force microscopy. X-ray diffraction. charge carrier mobility measurements and recombination kinetics studies all suggest that the lack of crystallinity in the active layer induces a significant drop in electron mobility. Significant surface recombination losses associated with a lack of segregation in the material were also identified as a significant loss mechanism. Finally. the monomeric PDI was found to have sub-optimum LUMO energy matching the cathode contact. thus limiting charge carrier extraction. Despite these setbacks. all PDIs produced high open circuit voltages. reaching almost 1 V in one particular case.

The structure includes a control gate on one side of a Mylar foil (on which gold drain/source contacts are photolithographically patterned and a pentacene active layer deposited) and a gold floating-gate on the opposite side of the foil.

Moreover. isomer 7−21. which represents 13% of monoadducts under classical heating. is not formed under microwave irradiation and with ODCB as solvent.

Comparison of the oxidation of water to the oxidation of a fast redox shuttle allowed for new insight in determining the rate limiting processes of water oxidation at hematite electrodes.

The UV–vis spectra. photoluminescence spectra. electrochemical data and DFT calculations show lowering of LUMO energies and red-shift of absorption into the visible as the thiophene chain length increases. TiO2/P3HT solar cells were prepared with prior functionalization of the TiO2 surface by 1T–5T and studies include cells using undoped P3HT and using P3HT doped with H-TFSI.

Here. we report two ‘donor-free’ cyanoacrylic end-functionalized oligo(3-hexylthiophene) dyes (5T and 6T). Despite having no donor group. both dyes show reversible first oxidation process.

The combination of electron‐donating oligothiophene building blocks with an electron‐accepting fluorenone unit results in the emergence of a new band assigned to an intramolecular charge transfer transition that gives rise to the extension of the absorption spectral range of the resulting molecules. Detailed spectroscopic and voltammetric investigations show that all studied molecules have highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level positions. which make them good candidates for the application as electron‐donors in bulk‐heterojunction photovoltaic cells. with (6.6)‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl …,True,CTxucd8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,100,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.200800366,918648619143468703,/scholar?cites=918648619143468703,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49533446/Fluorenone_Based_Molecules_for_Bulk_Hete20161011-13467-639f24.pdf,0,0,0

However. the PV measurements of PSCs have been widely recognized to depend on voltage scanning condition (hysteretic current density–voltage [J–V] behavior). as well as on voltage treatment history. In this study. we find that varied PSC responses are attributable to two causes. First. capacitive effect associated with electrode polarization provides a slow transient non-steady-state photocurrent that modifies the J–V response. Second. modification of interfacial barriers induced by ion migration can modulate charge-collection efficiency so that it causes a pseudo-steady-state photocurrent. which changes according to previous voltage conditioning.

We report a new approach for creating hydrogels using the amine-containing polysaccharide chitosan. Specifically. electrodes are immersed into a slightly acidic chitosan solution and a voltage is applied to promote the proton-consuming hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode surface. This reaction leads to a high localized pH in the vicinity of the cathode surface. and if this localized pH exceeds about 6.3. then chitosan becomes insoluble and deposits at the cathode surface.

In this study. we characterized physiological changes due to the genomic deletion of lsrR and lsrK. We discovered that many genes were coregulated by lsrK and lsrR but in a distinctly different manner than that for the lsr operon (where LsrR serves as a repressor that is derepressed by the binding of phospho-AI-2 to the LsrR protein).

Chitosan is positively charged and water soluble under mildly acidic conditions and is uncharged and insoluble under basic conditions. We observed that chitosan is deposited from acidic solution onto the surface of a negative electrode and the thickness of the deposited layer is on the order of a micron. The thickness of the deposited layer was observed to be dependent upon the deposition time. the applied voltage. and the chitosan concentration. No deposition was observed on the positive electrode or on an “electrode” that had no applied voltage. Once deposited and neutralized. the chitosan layer can be retained on the electrode surface without the need for an applied voltage.

We report a new approach for creating hydrogels using the amine-containing polysaccharide chitosan. Specifically. electrodes are immersed into a slightly acidic chitosan solution and a voltage is applied to promote the proton-consuming hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode surface. This reaction leads to a high localized pH in the vicinity of the cathode surface. and if this localized pH exceeds about 6.3. then chitosan becomes insoluble and deposits at the cathode surface. As the current density is increased. the region of high pH is expected to extend further from the cathode surface into the bulk solution. Using moderately high current densities (50 A/m2). we observed that chitosan deposited as a thick hydrogel.

We report that the pH-responsive aminopolysaccharide chitosan can mediate the electrodeposition of model nanoparticles. Chitosan is known to electrodeposit at the cathode surface in response to a high localized pH. To demonstrate that chitosan can mediate nanoparticle deposition. we suspended fluorescently labeled latex nanoparticles (100 nm diameter spheres) in a chitosan solution (1%) and performed electrodeposition (0.05 mA/cm2 for several minutes).

We demonstrated the value of this internal electrolyte reservoir by comparing a series of hierarchical hybrid supercapacitor electrodes based on homemade cellulose paper or polyester textile integrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by simple solution dip and electrodeposited with MnO2.

At low pH. where both the amino and carboxyl groups of the cysteine are protonated. these membranes preferentially reject cations and transport anions. At high pH. where both the amino and carboxyl groups are deprotonated. these membranes preferentially reject anions and transport cations. At pH = 6.0. near the isoelectric point of the chemisorbed cysteine. these membranes show neither cation nor anion transport selectivity. In addition to this electrostatically based selectivity. because of the small inside diameter of the Au nanotubules (as small as 0.9 nm). these membranes show molecular-size-based selectivity. ,True,B7JILz0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,218,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac0008901,12579395949498413633,/scholar?cites=12579395949498413633,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49911086/ac000890120161027-6630-r9lafc.pdf,0,0,0

Ion channel mimics based on both microporous alumina and Au nanotube membranes were investigated. The off state was obtained by making the membranes hydrophobic by chemisorbing either a C18 silane (alumina membrane) or a C18 thiol (Au nanotube membrane). Water and electrolyte are forbidden from entering these very hydrophobic pores/nanotubes.

Subsequent cycling indicates that this SEI layer is very stable in terms of both chemistry and morphology. even after extensive cycling. preserving reversibility at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Remarkably. even after cell failure. replacement of the lithium anode resulted in recovery of the cycling behavior with the same cathode. These results demonstrate that chemical stabilization of the cathode/electrolyte interface promotes long-term operation of DMSO-based Li–O2 Ru-catalyzed batteries. Characterization of the Li anode surface reveals electrolyte decomposition. and a partial mechanism is proposed for the observed chemical composition of the cathode SEI.

However. as thin film SSBs are typically fabricated only on planar substrates by line-of-sight deposition techniques (e.g. RF sputtering or evaporation). their areal energy storage capacity (< 1 mWh/cm2) and application space is highly limited. Moving to three dimensional architectures provides fundamentally new opportunities in power/energy areal density scaling. but requires a new fabrication process. In this thesis. we describe the development of the first solid state battery chemistry which is grown entirely by atomic layer deposition (ALD). a conformal. vapor-phase deposition technique.   We first show the importance of full self-alignment of the active battery layers by measuring and modelling the effects of nonuniform architectures (i.e. does not reduce to a one-dimensional system) on the internal reaction current distribution. By fabricating electrochemical test structures for which generated electrochemical gradients are parallel to the surface. we directly quantify the insertion of lithium into a model cathode material (V2O5) using spatially-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Using this new technique. we show that poorly electrically contacted high aspect ratio structures show highly nonuniform reaction current distributions. which we describe using an analytical mathematical model incorporating nonlinear Tafel kinetics.

A sensitivity of 1394 nm/riu was achieved when the diameter of the grating core was 3.4 /spl mu/m and the index of the surrounding medium was close to the index of the core of the fiber. Assuming a detectable spectral resolution of 0.01 nm realized in the experiment. the sensor achieves a minimum detectable index resolution of 7.2/spl times/10/sup -6/.

Two laminar flows of a photocurable fluid and a liquid template (nonpolymerizing fluid) spontaneously form jet streams in equilibrium states in microfluidic channels because of the minimization of the interfacial energy between the two fluids. The formation of the jet streams strongly depends on the spreading coefficients and the evolution time along the downstream of the microfluidic system. Thus. the simple control of the spreading coefficients can guide microfibers into various shapes.

However. there remain few examples in which biology and electronics have been interfaced to create synergistic capabilities. We believe there are two major challenges to the integration of biological components into microelectronic systems:(i) assembly of the biological components at an electrode address. and (ii) communication between the assembled biological components and the underlying electrode. Chitosan possesses a unique combination of properties to meet these challenges and serve as an effective bio-device interface material. For assembly. chitosan’s pH-responsive film-forming properties allow it to “recognize” electrode-imposed signals and respond by self-assembling as a stable hydrogel film through a cathodic electrodeposition mechanism. A separate anodic electrodeposition mechanism was recently reported and this also allows chitosan hydrogel films to be assembled at an electrode address. Protein-based biofunctionality can be conferred to electrodeposited films through a variety of physical. chemical and biological methods. For communication. we are investigating redox-active catechol-modified chitosan films as an interface to bridge redox-based communication between biology and an electrode. Despite significant progress over the last decade. many questions still remain which warrants even deeper study of chitosan’s structure. properties. and functions.

On the behavior of CDI cells comprising two activated carbon electrodes,2009,Eran Avraham and Malachi Noked and Yaniv Bouhadana and Abraham Soffer and Doron Aurbach,156,Journal of the Electrochemical Society,10,P157,IOP Publishing,The charge efficiency of electrochemical capacitive deionization (CDI) of salty-brackish water in symmetric cells comprising activated highly porous carbon electrodes was investigated as a function of the applied potential during charging (deionization) and discharging. The charge efficiency of water CDI in such cells is highly affected by the fact that the potential applied drives always simultaneously adsorption of counterions and desorption of co-ions. A previous stage of this work concentrated in the study of single activated carbon electrodes in processes. In this study. we demonstrated that it is possible to estimate the charge efficiency of symmetric CDI cells from measurements of single electrodes.

An important parameter that may have pronounced effect on the desalination performance in CDI processes is the potential of zero charge (PZC) of the carbon electrodes in the cell. In this work we examined the influence of the relation between the electrodes' PZC and the electrodes' potential (Vs. Ref. electrode) when the cell is being short-circuited (E 0) at dynamic steady state. on the salt removal effectiveness.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies reveal the formation of a thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on a Li–O2 cathode after the first cycle. Subsequent cycling indicates that this SEI layer is very stable in terms of both chemistry and morphology. even after extensive cycling. preserving reversibility at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Remarkably. even after cell failure. replacement of the lithium anode resulted in recovery of the cycling behavior with the same cathode. These results demonstrate that chemical stabilization of the cathode/electrolyte interface promotes long-term operation of DMSO-based Li–O2 Ru-catalyzed batteries.

Most polysaccharide electroaddressing mechanisms use electrochemical reactions to generate pH gradients that can locally neutralize the polysaccharide and induce its reversible sol–gel transition to form a hydrogel film adjacent to the electrode surface. The calcium-responsive polysaccharide alginate is an exception; it may electrodeposit without requiring extreme pH gradients and thus may provide a means to electroaddress pH-sensitive biological components.

While promising as a methodology to replicate metabolic pathways and search for inhibitors as drug candidates. these investigations also revealed unintended (or parasitic) effects. including products generated by the enzyme either (1) in the homogeneous phase (in the liquid). or (2) nonspecifically bound to microchannel surfaces.

1116638,Perspectives in flow-based microfluidic gradient generators for characterizing bacterial chemotaxis,2016,Christopher J Wolfram and Gary W Rubloff and Xiaolong Luo,10,Biomicrofluidics,6,061301,AIP Publishing,Chemotaxis is a phenomenon which enables cells to sense concentrations of certain chemical species in their microenvironment and move towards chemically favorable regions. Recent advances in microbiology have engineered the chemotactic properties of bacteria to perform novel functions. but traditional methods of characterizing chemotaxis do not fully capture the associated cell motion. making it difficult to infer mechanisms that link the motion to the microbiology which induces it. Microfluidics offers a potential solution in the form of gradient generators. Many of the gradient generators studied to date for this application are flow-based. where a chemical species diffuses across the laminar flow interface between two solutions moving through a microchannel. Despite significant research efforts. flow-based gradient generators have achieved mixed success at accurately capturing the highly subtle chemotactic …,True,iqD7Yy4AAAAJ:5LPo_wSKItgC,11,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4967777,14368074336126030703,/scholar?cites=14368074336126030703,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4967777,0,0,0

However. there remain few examples in which biology and electronics have been interfaced to create synergistic capabilities. We believe there are two major challenges to the integration of biological components into microelectronic systems:(i) assembly of the biological components at an electrode address. and (ii) communication between the assembled biological components and the underlying electrode. Chitosan possesses a unique combination of properties to meet these challenges and serve as an effective bio-device interface material. For assembly. chitosan’s pH-responsive film-forming properties allow it to “recognize” electrode-imposed signals and respond by self-assembling as a stable hydrogel film through a cathodic electrodeposition mechanism. A separate anodic electrodeposition mechanism was recently reported and this also allows chitosan hydrogel films to be assembled at an electrode address. Protein-based biofunctionality can be conferred to electrodeposited films through a variety of physical. chemical and biological methods. For communication. we are investigating redox-active catechol-modified chitosan films as an interface to bridge redox-based communication between biology and an electrode.

Its role in mediating infectious disease has led to the elucidation of numerous autoinducers and their corresponding QS signaling pathways. Among them. the Lsr (LuxS-regulated) QS system is conserved in scores of bacteria. and its signal molecule. autoinducer-2 (AI-2). is synthesized as a product of 1-carbon metabolism. Lsr signal transduction processes. therefore. may help organize population scale activities in numerous bacterial consortia. Conceptions of how Lsr QS organizes population scale behaviors remain limited. however. Using mathematical simulations. we examined how desynchronized Lsr QS activation. arising from cell-to-cell population heterogeneity. could lead to bimodal Lsr signaling and fractional activation. This has been previously observed experimentally. Governing these processes are an asynchronous AI-2 uptake. where positive intracellular feedback in Lsr expression is combined with negative feedback between cells. The resulting activation patterns differ from that of the more widely studied LuxIR system. the topology of which consists of only positive feedback. To elucidate differences. both QS systems were simulated in 2D. where cell populations grow and signal each other via traditional growth and diffusion equations. Our results demonstrate that the LuxIR QS system produces an ‘outward wave’ of autoinduction. and the Lsr QS system yields dispersed autoinduction from spatially-localized secretion and uptake profiles.

It is demonstrated that these nano-architectures can be created either by electrodeposition or by the electrochemical transformation of materials. Electrochemical synthesis is presented here as it provides intimate contact between the electrode and current collector and also promotes an electronic pathway for all materials to be connected to the circuit. Although still in their infancy. electrosynthesized nano-architectures show promise to be used in future electrochemical energy storage devices as utilization of this method bypasses the need for bulky conductive additives and electrochemically inactive binders.

In this study. the QS system based on the interspecies signaling molecule autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is targeted because of its prevalence among prokaryotes (it functions in over 80 bacterial species). We demonstrate that the Escherichia coli AI-2 kinase.

Its role in mediating infectious disease has led to the elucidation of numerous autoinducers and their corresponding QS signaling pathways. Among them. the Lsr (LuxS-regulated) QS system is conserved in scores of bacteria. and its signal molecule. autoinducer-2 (AI-2). is synthesized as a product of 1-carbon metabolism. Lsr signal transduction processes. therefore. may help organize population scale activities in numerous bacterial consortia. Conceptions of how Lsr QS organizes population scale behaviors remain limited. however. Using mathematical simulations. we examined how desynchronized Lsr QS activation. arising from cell-to-cell population heterogeneity. could lead to bimodal Lsr signaling and fractional activation. This has been previously observed experimentally. Governing these processes are an asynchronous AI-2 uptake. where positive intracellular feedback in Lsr expression is combined with negative feedback between cells. The resulting activation patterns differ from that of the more widely studied LuxIR system. the topology of which consists of only positive feedback. To elucidate differences. both QS systems were simulated in 2D. where cell populations grow and signal each other via traditional growth and diffusion equations. Our results demonstrate that the LuxIR QS system produces an ‘outward wave’ of autoinduction. and the Lsr QS system yields dispersed autoinduction from spatially-localized secretion and uptake profiles.

One of the main challenges for garnet solid state batteries is the poor solid–solid contact between the garnet and electrodes. which results in high interfacial resistance. large polarizations. and low efficiencies in batteries. To address this challenge. in this work gel electrolyte is used as an interlayer between solid electrolyte and solid electrodes to improve their contact and reduce their interfacial resistance. The gel electrolyte has a soft structure. high ionic conductivity. and good wettability. Through construction of the garnet/gel interlayer/electrode structure. the interfacial resistance of the garnet significantly decreased from 6.5 × 104 to 248 Ω cm2 for the cathode and from 1.4 × 103 to 214 Ω cm2 for the Li-metal anode. successfully demonstrating a full …,True,GSWg494AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC,139,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.7b03887,8638156412884262971,/scholar?cites=8638156412884262971,,,0,0,0

Many prior reports have noted that the addition of ethanol to an aqueous solution of gold nanoparticles causes their aggregation into linear assemblies. It was therefore believed that ethanol plays the determining role during the assembly process. In this work. we carried out systematic studies which indicate that residual salt in conjunction with ethanol. instead of ethanol itself. induces the assembly of gold nanoparticles in ethanol. In the absence of salt. gold nanoparticles can be well dispersed in an ethanol solution. Furthermore. we find that the chainlike assemblies can disassemble upon dilution of the salt or the evaporation of ethanol if the gold nanoparticles are protected with a sufficiently strong ligand.,True,GSWg494AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,104,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la200459t,12371790923324086363,/scholar?cites=12371790923324086363,,,0,0,0

We report a new approach for creating hydrogels using the amine-containing polysaccharide chitosan. Specifically. electrodes are immersed into a slightly acidic chitosan solution and a voltage is applied to promote the proton-consuming hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode surface. This reaction leads to a high localized pH in the vicinity of the cathode surface. and if this localized pH exceeds about 6.3. then chitosan becomes insoluble and deposits at the cathode surface. As the current density is increased. the region of high pH is expected to extend further from the cathode surface into the bulk solution.

However. in vitro analysis of the biochemical correlates of ICD (ATP. high‐motility group box 1. and calreticulin) elicited by PBNP‐PTT demonstrates that PBNP‐PTT triggers a thermal window of ICD.

We begin by coating a reactive film of the polysaccharide chitosan onto an inorganic surface (glass or silicon wafer). Chitosan's pH-responsive solubility facilitates film deposition. while the nucleophilic properties of this polysaccharide allow simple chemistries or biochemistries to be used to covalently attach species to the film. The thermally responsive protein gelatin is then cast on top of the chitosan film. and the gelatin gel serves as a sacrificial “thermoresist”. Pattern transfer is accomplished by applying a heated stamp to melt specific regions of the gelatin thermoresist and selectively expose the underlying chitosan.

Small islands are pyramidal in shape. whereas larger islands are dome-shaped. During growth. the transition from pyramids to domes occurs through a series of asymmetric transition states with increasing numbers of highly inclined facets. Postgrowth annealing of pyramids results in a similar shape change process. The transition shapes are temperature dependent and transform reversibly to the final dome shape during cooling.

When there is an intrinsic tendency of a heterolayer to either island or interdiffuse. a common strategy is to lower the growth temperature and increase the growth rate to reduce surface mobility. An alternative strategy is to introduce a surface-active species (surfactant) that modifies the growth mode without significant levels of incorporation.

On March 23. 1989. these two Utah scientists held an astonishing press conference. maintaining that they had succeeded. working in secret. in harnessing atomic fusion. What was the basis for their claims to have achieved cold fusion in a test tube in a basement laboratory. while other scientists--using magnets as big as houses and temperatures hotter than those in the center of the sun--were failing to produce as much power as they were using? Why did Fleischmann and Pons proclaim their"" discovery"" at a news conference. when first announcements of scientific results are almost always made within the scientific community? Why did the full-blown media event inspired by their initial report cause governments to reorient their research programs in hopes of cornering the"" new technology""? And why did some scientists recklessly abandon their traditional painstaking methods in haste to be first to prove or discredit the experiment?

The soft nature of wood fibers effectively releases the mechanical stresses associated with the sodiation process. and the mesoporous structure functions as an electrolyte reservoir that allows for ion transport through the outer and inner surface of the fiber. These properties are confirmed experimentally and computationally.

Pure and stable M-MoS 2 has not been previously prepared by chemical synthesis. to the best of our knowledge.

The metal–metal Raman stretching mode at 146 cm− 1 in the M-MoS 2 structure. as predicted by theoretical calculations. is experimentally observed. The stability of the M-MoS 2 is associated with the adsorption of a monolayer of water molecules on both sides of the nanosheets. which reduce restacking and prevent aggregation in water.

The underlying science of transparency of nanopaper is that the diameter of these fibers is much smaller than the light wavelength. which significantly decreases the light scattering as compared to regular fibers. Cellulose fibers have a hierarchical structure. which consists of numerous smaller fibers. In this manuscript. we demonstrate a nanopaper design with different fiber diameters. and conclude that the light transmittance and scattering depend on the fiber diameter and packing density. The optical properties of the nanopaper and their dependence on the cellulose fiber diameter are thoroughly explained through Chandrasekhar's radiative-transfer theory and multiple scattering method simulations.

Biodegradation of SWCNTs is higher in the presence of NaBr. but neither EPO alone nor H2O2 alone caused the degradation of nanotubes. Molecular modeling reveals two binding sites for SWCNTs on EPO. one located at the proximal side (same side as the catalytic site) and the other on the distal side of EPO. The oxidized groups on SWCNTs in both cases are stabilized by electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues. Biodegradation of SWCNTs can also be executed in an ex vivo culture system using primary murine eosinophils stimulated to undergo degranulation. Biodegradation is proven by a range of methods including transmission electron …,True,i0_DddkAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC,143,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smll.201202508,2933091477353211859,/scholar?cites=2933091477353211859,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4039041/,0,0,0

The first approach consists of preparation of SPION by controlled chemical coprecipitation in the presence of BSA solution. whereas the second approach includes preliminary surface modification of SPION with an amine group using a coupling agent of 3-aminepropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS). Both procedures are followed by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminepropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) activation with sequential immobilization of the layer of BSA.

A remarkable improvement in both crystallinity and alignment has been observed in BNW films quenched from processing temperatures ⩾1100 °C. Without quench. the BNWs formed in the temperature range of 900–1100 °C are heavily tangled with either an amorphous or polycrystalline structure. If higher-temperature (⩾1100 °C) processing is followed by a quench. predominantly single-crystalline BNWs of a rhombohedral structure (a=10.94 Å and c=23.83 Å) and (031) orientation aligned along the normal of the substrates can be obtained. We speculate that the strain induced along the BNW at large temperature gradient is responsible for the …,True,Dmvjb5wAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,33,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1705720,8252526950680904804,/scholar?cites=8252526950680904804,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Do_Kyung_Kim/publication/224427424_Effect_of_quench_on_crystallinity_and_alignment_of_boron_nanowires/links/5514da1d0cf260a7cb2dafb0.pdf,0,0,0

The presence of Au NPs also induces long-term degradation of the photostability (photobleaching) of Rhodamine 6G used as gain medium in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity. We found that the degradation gets profound when the Au NPs concentration is significantly increased. Calculation of the radiative rate and direct time-resolved measurement of the fluorescence decay indicates that both the decrease of radiative decay rate and increase of non-radiative decay rate are responsible for the fluorescence quenching and photostability degradation. An energy transfer from the dye molecules to gold nanoparticles is dominating within the small distance between them and suppresses the quantum efficiency of Rhodamine 6G drastically.

This study demonstrates the degradation of fragmented microplastics particularly low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film in water. through visible light-induced plasmonic photocatalysts comprising of platinum nanoparticles deposited on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (ZnO-Pt). The ZnO-Pt nanocomposite photocatalysts were observed to have better degradation kinetics for a model organic dye (methylene blue) compared to bare ZnO nanorods. attributed to the plasmonic effects leading to better interfacial exciton separation and improved hydroxyl radical activity along with a 78% increase in visible light absorption. These demonstrations of the plasmonically enhanced photocatalyst enabled it to effectively degrade microplastic fragments as confirmed following the changes in carbonyl and vinyl indices in infrared absorption. In addition. visual proof of physical surface damage of the LDPE film establishes the efficacy of using plasmonically enhanced nanocomposite photocatalytic materials to tackle the microplastic menace using just sunlight for a clean and green approach towards mitigation of microplastics in the ecosystem.

Several SeCs have been reported to have albumin-binding ability. which is an important factor in determining the treatment efficacy of drugs. In the present investigation. we hypothesized that extracellular albumin might orchestrate SeCs efficacy. Four SeCs representing distinct categories were selected to investigate their cytotoxicity. cellular uptake. and species transformation. Concomitant treatment of albumin greatly decreased cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of SeCs. Using both X-ray absorption spectroscopy and hyphenated mass spectrometry. we confirmed the formation of macromolecular conjugates between SeCs and albumin. Although the conjugate was still internalized. possibly via albumin scavenger receptors expressed on the cell surface. the uptake was strongly inhibited by excess albumin. In summary. the present investigation established the importance of extracellular albumin binding in determining SeCs cytotoxicity. Due to the fact that albumin content is higher in humans and animals than in cell cultures. and varies among many patient categories. our results are believed to have high translational impact and clinical implications.

Heat transfer coefficients were measured for saturated boiling of R134a in vertical circular tubes with internal diameters of 1.7. 1.224 and 0.826 mm. and a uniformly heated length of 220 mm. Heat transfer coefficients were obtained for a heat flux range of 3–34 kW/m2. a mass flux range of 50–400 kg/m2 s. and vapour qualities up to 0.6. Experiments were conducted at two different pressures. 8.626 and 6.458 bars. Heat transfer coefficients were found to be a strong function of the wall heat flux and system pressure. while being fairly independent upon mass flux and vapour quality. This suggests that the heat transfer mechanism is strongly related to that in nucleate boiling.,True,YTlTjdYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,108,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431104000249,2274835680488919258,/scholar?cites=2274835680488919258,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:11695,0,0,0

This paper discusses the possibility of such reductions. both at the systems- and the component level. It is shown that a move towards indirect systems. using secondary refrigerants. on both the cold and the hot side of the system may result in considerable reduction of charge. However. this reduction may come at the cost of slightly reduced system performance. which in itself is detrimental from an environmental point of view. At the component level. it may be shown that the main contents of refrigerant is usually contained in the heat exchangers.

It was found that the energy consumption is insensitive to varied EDC and charge within a wide range of settings. For the charge this is explained by the low side accumulator. which buffers over- and undercharge. It was also found that the optimum charge increased at lower ambient temperature.

This type of heat exchanger offers very good heat transfer performance in single-phase flow as well as in evaporation and condensation. Part of the reason is the small hydraulic diameters. typically being less than 5 mm. Other advantages of plate heat exchangers are the extremely compact design and the efficient use of the construction material. In spite of their long use. the calculation methods for predicting heat transfer and pressure drop are not widely known.

The design of a system requires estimates of the ground thermal conductivity and the borehole thermal resistance. which are usually determined by an in situ thermal response test on a completed borehole. The usual test interpretation methods average the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures and use this mean temperature as the average temperature along the borehole length. This assumption is convenient but does not strictly apply. For a coaxial heat exchanger this paper develops an analytical model for the vertical temperature profiles. which can be used instead of the mean temperature approximation to estimate borehole resistance.

In detail it is shown how the charge is displaced at compressor start-up and shut-down. At start-up it was found that the charge was temporarily displaced towards the condenser before returning to a steady state distribution in the latter part of the on-period. As a result. initially the evaporator was starved with a lowered evaporation temperature and a peak 10 °C superheat. The superheat disappeared within 3 min as the evaporator was gradually refilled with refrigerant. At shut-down the pressure equalised within 3 min as refrigerant was pushed into the evaporator from the condenser.

Natural and forced convection air-cooled heat sinks are not well suited for cooling the components generating the highest heat fluxes. Other methods are therefore sought. Recently the use of thermosyphons has attracted attention as a simple and effective cooling system for high heat flux components.

A transient heat transfer model has been developed for a thermal response test on a pipe-in-pipe coaxial borehole heat exchanger. The analytical model calculates the vertical temperature profiles in the fluid flowing through the pipes. which are coupled to the surrounding grout and ground. The model is verified against measured vertical temperature profiles in the circulating fluid during a distributed thermal response test.

The calculated average thickness of the fluid film between the Taylor bubble and the channel wall agree well with the classical analytical correlation developed by Bretherton. The numerical simulation of the behavior of the flow regime transition in a narrow channel shows that the body force has significant effect on the movement of bubbles with different sizes. Smaller body force always leads to the later coalescence of the bubbles. and decreases the flow regime transition time.

1117039,The influence of composition on equiaxed crystal growth mechanisms and grain size in Al alloys,1996,Mats Johnsson and L Bäckerud,87,Zeitschrift für Metallkunde,,,,The role of solute concentration on equiaxed crystal growth mechanisms and grain size has been investigated. The study was undertaken on hypoeutectic concentrations in the systems Al-Si-Ti and Al-Si-Fe-Ti. The equiaxed structure was ensured by adding heterogeneously nucleating TiB{sub 2} particles in excess of that needed for a maximum grain-refining effect. It was found that two principally different growth models have to be applied in different parts of an alloy system. Cellular type of crystals in the low alloy region develop in a clover-leaf form and the diffusion profile build up front-wise ahead of the cellular interface. The alloying elements cooperate by growth restriction in promoting a fine-grained structure. On the high alloy side. however. dendrites with orthogonal branches develop lancet-like tips causing a major part of the diffusion to take place side-wise instead of in front of the growing tip. Increasing the solute concentration in this regime will increase the growth rate and consequently the grain size.

1117041,Influence of Si and Fe on the grain refinement of aluminium,1994,Mats Johnsson,85,Zeitschrift fuer Metallkunde;(Germany),11,,,The influence of hypoeutectic concentrations of Si and Fe on the [alpha]-Al grain size after additions of an Al-Ti-B master alloy has been studied. It was found that the alloying elements cooperate in promoting a fine-grained structure at low concentrations. The growth-restricting effect from each element was taken from the respective binary phase diagram with aluminium. The grain size was found to be proportional to the dendrite growth rate that is inversely proportional to the sum of the growth-restricting factors from the solutes in diffusion controlled growth. At Si concentrations higher than about 3 mass% a deterioration in the grain refining efficiency occurs. It seems to be an effect due to decreasing dendrite tip radius increasing the growth rate.

ZT. A novel chemical alloying method has been used for the synthesis of nanoengineered‐skutterudite CoSb3. The CoSb3 powders were annealed for different durations to obtain a set of samples with different particle sizes. The samples were then compacted into pellets by uniaxial pressing under various conditions and used for the thermoelectric characterization. The transport properties were investigated by measuring the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical and thermal conductivities in the temperature range 300 K to 650 K. A substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity of CoSb3 was observed with decreasing grain size in the nanometer region.

We show how bond paths between an atom A and the atoms B in its environment appear to be determined by competition among the A–B exchange‐correlation energies that always contribute to stabilize the A–B interactions. These pairwise additive stabilizations depend neither on the attractive or repulsive nature of the classical electrostatic interaction between the atoms' charge densities. nor on the change in the self energies of the atoms involved. These other terms may well cause an overall molecular‐energy increase in spite of a possibly large A–B exchange‐correlation stabilization.

The dipole moment is given by a sum over the net charge and first moment of every atom in a molecule. The first term leads to a charge transfer contribution μc. the second to an atomic polarization contribution μa. It is shown that both terms are. in general. of equal importance in determining both the static molecular dipole moment and the moment induced by a nuclear displacement. Models which imploy only point charges and corresponding bond moments which follow rigidly the nuclear framework. i.e.. models which approximate μc and ignore μa. are shown to lead to results that are incompatible with the changes that are found to occur in a molecular charge distribution during a nuclear vibration.

This is done in two ways: through the use of the equation of motion for the generator (| r− r′|)− 1 for a proper open system. an atom. and by solving Poisson's equation for a potential given by the density ρ (r). The source function enables one to equate the value of the density at any point within a molecule to a sum of atomic contributions and to thus view properties of the density from a new perspective.

Bickley et al. proposed a synergetic effect between anatase and rutile in Degussa P25.

In this paper. we report about a series of utterly pure. highly porous titanium dioxide films with identical grain sizes. surface areas. and crystallinity. but varying polymorph compositions. Photocatalytic oxidation of methylene blue was utilized to investigate the influence of the anatase-to-rutile ratio on the photoreactivity.

Aluminium pigments are commonly used in coatings to give a silvery and shiny lustre to the substrate. Such paints and inks have traditionally been solvent borne. since aluminium pigment particles react with water. For environmental and health reasons solvent borne coatings are being replaced by water borne and the aluminium pigments then need to be surface modified in order to stand exposure to water. This process is called inhibition and both organic and inorganic substances are used as inhibiting agents. The organic inhibiting agents range from low molecular weight substances. such as phenols and aromatic acids. via surfactants. in particular alkyl phosphates and other anionic amphiphiles. to high molecular weight compounds. such as polyelectrolytes.

Remarkably. while the MnO core is found to have a T N not far from its bulk value. the magnetic order of the γ− Mn 2 O 3 shell is stable far above T C. exhibiting two characteristic temperatures. at T∼ 40 K [T C (γ− Mn 2 O 3)] and at T∼ 120 K [∼ T N (MnO)].

The Brønsted acidity. the channel structure and the state and location of Mo species in the zeolite seem to be crucial factors for its catalytic performance. It was found that 2% Mo/HZSM-5 calcined at 773 K showed the best aromatization activity among the tested catalysts. the methane conversion being 9% at 1013 K with the selectivity to aromatics higher than 90%.

In this paper. a novel representation known as Radon-fractional Fourier transform (RFRFT) is proposed and investigated to solve the above problems simultaneously. It can not only eliminate the effect of DFM by selecting a proper rotation angle but also achieve long-time coherent integration without ARU effect. The RFRFT can be regarded as a special Doppler filter bank composed of filters with different rotation angles. which indicates a generalization of the traditional moving target detection (MTD) and FRFT methods.

In this paper. the model structure and individual components are described briefly. Further. results for the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) pre-industrial control and historical simulations are presented to demonstrate the model's performance in terms of the mean model state and the internal variability. It is illustrated that BNU-ESM can simulate many observed features of the earth climate system. such as the climatological annual cycle of surface-air temperature and precipitation. annual cycle of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). the overall patterns and positions of cells in global ocean meridional overturning circulation. For example. the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulated in BNU-ESM exhibits an irregular oscillation between 2 and 5 years with the seasonal phase locking feature of ENSO. Important biases with regard to observations are presented and discussed. including warm SST discrepancies in the major upwelling regions. an equatorward drift of midlatitude westerly wind bands. and tropical precipitation bias over the ocean that is related to the double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).,True,_gJn0hcAAAAJ:aDdGf5um_jkC,174,https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2039/2014/,1583170061638784713,/scholar?cites=1583170061638784713,,https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2039/2014/gmd-7-2039-2014.pdf,0,0,0

The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to the reduction of the various material scales by plastic deformation. but the mechanisms controlling their elongation to failure have received relatively little attention. It is usually found that heavily deformed materials show a tendency to plastic strain localization and necking. However. in this paper it is shown that. though the steel wires are plastically deformed up to strain levels as high as 3.5. a significant capability of plastic deformation is preserved in as‐drawn wires.

These hybrid particles were obtained by encapsulating Gd2O3 cores within a polysiloxane shell which carries organic fluorophores and carboxylated PEG covalently tethered to the inorganic network. Longitudinal proton relaxivities of these particles are higher than the positive contrast agents like Gd−DOTA which are commonly used for clinical magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover these particles can be followed up by fluorescence imaging. This study revealed that these particles suited for dual modality imaging freely circulate in the blood vessels without undesirable accumulation in lungs and liver. ,True,g5nl1V8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,777,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja068356j,16969930468470605262,/scholar?cites=16969930468470605262,,http://applications.umons.ac.be/docnum/c7b423fd-d183-486c-9cec-966066b9b364/39CADB53-5A71-490E-A1C1-C79E05B1DEF4/BRIDOT-2007-44-journal.pdf,0,0,0

The field dependence of the proton longitudinal relaxation rate (nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles) in aqueous colloidal suspensions of superparamagnetic particles is based on the so-called Curie relaxation. which essentially accounts for the high field part of the NMRD profiles (B0>0.02 T). The low-field part of the NMRD profiles can only be explained by the crystal’s internal anisotropy energy. a concept which clarifies the important difference between superpara- and paramagnetic compounds: the anisotropy energy modifies both the electronic precession frequencies and the thermodynamic probability of occupation of the crystal magnetic states.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Computer simulations and experimental approach have been used to characterize the properties of particulate MRI contrast agents with special attention paid to the influence of particle size. Up to approximately 50 nm. an increase of the particle diameter leads to a strong enhancement of the transverse magnetization decay rate. For larger grains or aggregates. the decay rate measured without spin‐echo formation reaches a plateau. When observed through a spin‐echo sequence. the transverse magnetization decay rate becomes slower on increasing the particle size or on shortening the echo time. For these large particles. multiexponential decay rates are observed. Definition and measurement of relaxivity in such systems is discussed. © 1991 Academic Press.

In this short review. the main relaxation properties of ferritin in solution and in tissue are presented together with a discussion of the possible reasons for the faster transverse relaxation observed in tissues.

We present quantitative data and simulations of different gadolinium-based extracellular fluid contrast agents and the modulation of their contrast enhancement by the magnetic field to be able to answer the following questions: How are the dose and field dependences of their contrast enhancement? Is there an interrelationship between dose and field dependence? Should one increase or decrease doses at specific fields? Nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion data were acquired for the following contrast agents: gadopentetate dimeglumine. gadoterate meglumine. gadodiamide injection. and gadoteridol injection. as well as for several normal and pathological human tissue samples.

Heidelberg,Even though the intrinsic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast is much more flexible than in other clinical imaging techniques. the diagnosis of several pathologies requires the involvement of contrast agents (CAs) that can enhance the difference between normal and diseased tissues by modifying their intrinsic parameters. MR CAs are indirect agents because they do not become visible by themselves as opposed to other imaging modalities. The signal enhancement produced by MRI CAs (i.e.. the efficiency of the CAs) depends on their longitudinal (r1) and transverse (r2) relaxivity (expressed in s−1 mmol−1 1). which is defined as the increase of the nuclear relaxation rate (the reciprocal of the relaxation time) of water protons produced by 1 mmol per liter of CA.Paramagnetic CAs (most of them complexes of gadolinium) are frequently used in clinics as extracellular. hepatobiliary or blood …,True,g5nl1V8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,127,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72718-7_7,886916046759250563,/scholar?cites=886916046759250563,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carmen_Burtea/publication/5225121_Contrast_Agents_Magnetic_Resonance/links/0046351732eb5aa9fd000000.pdf,0,0,0

To address issues associated with video motion and redundancy. individual watermarks are created for objects within the video. Each watermark is created by shaping an author and video dependent pseudo-random sequence according to the perceptual masking characteristics of the video. As a result. the watermark adapts to each video to ensure invisibility and robustness. Furthermore. the noise-like watermark is statistically undetectable.

Our video dependent watermarking procedure directly exploits the masking and temporal properties to embed an invisible and robust watermark. The watermark consists of static and dynamic temporal components that are generated from a temporal wavelet transform of the video scenes. To generate the watermark. the resulting wavelet coefficient frames are modified by a perceptually shaped pseudo-random sequence representing the author. The noise-like watermark is statistically undetectable to thwart unauthorized removal. Furthermore. the author representation resolves the deadlock problem.

Although instability of the terminal iron–oxo moiety is perhaps the foremost obstacle. steric and electronic factors also limit the activity of previously reported mononuclear iron (IV)–oxo compounds. In particular. although nature's non-haem iron (IV)–oxo compounds possess high-spin S= 2 ground states. this electronic configuration has proved difficult to achieve in a molecular species.

Isothermal adsorption measurements demonstrate a consistently larger isosteric heat of adsorption for D2 vs H2. with the largest difference being 1.4 kJ/mol in the case of Ni-MOF-74. This leads to a low-pressure selectivity for this material that increases from 1.5 at 150 K to 5.0 at 77 K. Idealized adsorption solution theory indicates that the selectivity decreases with increasing pressure. but remains well above unity at ambient pressure. Infrared measurements on different MOF materials show a strong correlation between selectivity and the frequency of the adsorbed H2 translational band. This confirms that the separation is predominantly due to the difference in the zero-point energies of the adsorbed isotopologues.,True,6wNuVPEAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,89,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja402103u,1658980733853106288,/scholar?cites=1658980733853106288,,https://www.mason.chemistry.harvard.edu/s/11.pdf,0,0,0

It is found that the binding energy of the H 2 physisorbed on the outer surface of the bare SWNT is very weak. and cannot be enhanced significantly either by increasing the curvature of the surface through radial deformation. or by the coadsorption of a Li atom that makes the semiconducting tube metallic.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from large point sources such as power plants is one option for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions; however. currently the capture alone will increase the energy requirements of a plant by 25–40 %. This Review highlights the challenges for capture technologies which have the greatest likelihood of reducing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. namely postcombustion (predominantly CO2/N2 separation). precombustion (CO2/H2) capture. and natural gas sweetening (CO2/CH4).

These tetrahedrals can form different types of units. such as 6-rings. 8-rings. or 12-rings. These are. so-called. secondary building units of different types of cylinders or cages.

Computer simulations can determine the vapor–liquid coexistence curve of a large number of n‐alkanes ranging from pentane (C5) through octatetracontane (C48). We have compared the predicted phase diagrams of various models with experimental data. Models which give nearly identical properties of liquid alkanes at standard conditions may have critical temperatures that differ by more than 100 K. A new n‐alkane model has been developed by us that gives a good description of the phase behavior over a large temperature range.

The carbon numbers of the alkanes ranged from four to nine. For branched alkanes inflection behavior was observed for all carbon numbers studied. The inflection was found to occur at a loading of four molecules per unit cell. Below this loading the branched alkanes are seen to be located predominantly at the intersections of the straight and zigzag channels. To obtain loadings higher than four. the branched alkane must seek residence in the channel interiors which is energetically more demanding and therefore requires disproportionately higher pressures; this leads to the inflection behavior. Linear alkanes with six and more carbon atoms also were found to exhibit inflection behavior.

The introduced algorithm essentially mimics the experimental determination of the water adsorption isotherm and quantitatively predicts clay swelling for a montmorillonite-type clay including such details as the occurrence of hydrated states and hysteresis. Furthermore. important insights into the underlying mechanism of clay swelling from the one-layer to the two-layer hydrate are derived. It turns out that. for this case. clay swelling proceeds via the migration of counterions that are initially bound to the mineral surface to the central interlayer plane where they become fully hydrated.

The force field was generated by adjusting the parameters so as to faithfully reproduce the experimentally determined isotherms (particularly the inflection points) on MFI-type zeolite over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. It reproduces extremely well the Henry coefficients. heats of adsorption. preexponential factors. entropies of adsorption. and maximum loading. It is shown that the extension of the force field from MFI to other nanoporous framework topologies is successful. that it affords the prediction of topology-specific adsorption properties. and that it can be an effective tool to resolve the many discrepancies among experimental data sets. ,True,-GxdGBQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,357,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0376727,10446559884913025440,/scholar?cites=10446559884913025440,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200694/files/0689513732dub041.pdf,0,0,0

To obtain a detailed understanding of the lipid–cholesterol interactions. we have developed a mesoscopic water–lipid–cholesterol model. In this model. we take into account the hydrophobic–hydrophilic interactions and the structure of the molecules. We compute the phase diagram of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine–cholesterol by using dissipative particle dynamics and show that our model predicts many of the different phases that have been observed experimentally. In quantitative agreement with experimental data our model also shows the condensation effect; upon the addition of cholesterol. the area per lipid decreases more than one would expect from ideal mixing.

In contrast to the behavior previously observed in the small-wave-vector region. we find that the spin waves at larger values of q→ are only moderately renormalized up to T C. and persist as excitations up to the highest temperature measured (∼ 1.4 T C). No further renormalization of the dispersion relation is observed above T C. Measurements of the spin-wave linewidths show that as the temperature increases to T C the widths rapidly increase. but above T C no additional broadening occurs.

Their efficiency for the separation of acetylene/ethylene mixtures is demonstrated by experimental breakthrough curves (0.73 millimoles per gram from a 1/99 mixture).,True,cKqtQ0MAAAAJ:R22Rs3tN8aoC,618,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6295/141.abstract,16650060243560914041,/scholar?cites=16650060243560914041,,https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=920794,0,0,0

The carbon numbers of the alkanes ranged from four to nine. For branched alkanes inflection behavior was observed for all carbon numbers studied. The inflection was found to occur at a loading of four molecules per unit cell. Below this loading the branched alkanes are seen to be located predominantly at the intersections of the straight and zigzag channels. To obtain loadings higher than four. the branched alkane must seek residence in the channel interiors which is energetically more demanding and therefore requires disproportionately higher pressures; this leads to the inflection behavior. Linear alkanes with six and more carbon atoms also were found to exhibit inflection behavior. Hexane and heptane show inflection due to commensurate …,True,cKqtQ0MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,550,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp982736c,6582018439841853663,/scholar?cites=6582018439841853663,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200661/files/4051108609vlu991.pdf,0,0,0

For the foreseeable future. however. it seems that the ever-growing energy demand will most likely necessitate the consumption of these indispensable sources of energy. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). a process to separate CO2 from the flue gas of coal-fired power plants and then store it underground. has been proposed to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Current CO2 capture processes employed in power plants worldwide are post-combustion “wet scrubbing” methods involving the chemical adsorption of CO2 by amine solutions such as monoethanolamine (MEA).

These materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction. scanning electron microscopy. transmission electron microscopy and N2 adsorption isotherms. DIFFaX was used to simulate pronounced peak broadening in the X-ray diffraction patterns of MCM-56. Toluene disproportionation is used as a test reaction to compare the catalytic activity of MCM-22 and MCM-56. We have found that MCM-56 is made of very thin MWW-type layers. The layers are typically one unit cell along the c direction (with a few of them having two or three unit cells). These very thin layers of MCM-56 become tightly curled upon calcination. The structures thus formed pack very efficiently. and this phenomenon prevents access of organic molecules like toluene to most of the 12 MR cups on the crystal exterior.

The HDO reaction yields two major hydrocarbons: toluene and methylcyclohexane. The deoxygenation of meta-cresol proceeds through two consecutive steps: hydrogenation of the aromatic ring on the Pt metal followed by dehydration reactions of the produced alcohol intermediates on the alumina support. Phenolic ring saturation is proposed to be slower than its sequential dehydration steps on Pt/γ-Al2O3. This is in a good agreement with the higher selectivity of toluene compared to that of the hydrogenated cyclic hydrocarbon. methylcyclohexane. because toluene formation requires fewer ring hydrogenation steps than its counterpart.

GAS wave functions are obtained by defining an arbitrary number of active spaces with arbitrary occupation constraints. By a suitable choice of the GAS spaces. numerous ineffective configurations present in a large complete active space (CAS) can be removed. while keeping the important ones in the CI space. As a consequence. the GAS self-consistent field approach retains the accuracy of the CAS self-consistent field (CASSCF) ansatz and. at the same time. can deal with larger active spaces. which would be unaffordable at the CASSCF level. Test calculations on the Gd atom. Gd2 molecule. and oxoMn(salen) complex are presented.

The analysis reveals that hydration water suppresses protein motions at lower temperatures (<∼200 K). and facilitates protein dynamics at high temperatures. Experimental data demonstrate that the hydration water is harmonic at temperatures <∼180–190 K and is not affected by the proteins’ methyl group rotations. The dynamics of the hydration water exhibits changes at ∼180–190 K that we ascribe to the glass transition in the hydrated protein.

Determining how these two phenomena relate is key to understanding glass formation. Leporini and coworkers have recently argued that τ universally depends on a localization length-scale  (the Debye–Waller factor) in a way that depends only upon the value of  at the glass transition. Here we find that this ‘universal’ model does not accurately describe τ in several simulated and experimental glass-forming materials.

Climate geoengineering has often been considered to be a"" last-ditch"" response to climate change. to be used only if climate change damage should produce extreme hardship.

Renewable energy. energy efficiency. and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Both supply- and demand-side interventions will displace energyand emissionsfrom conventional generators. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent metric for assessing the avoided emissions resulting from such interventions. This paper presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011. we estimate regional MEFs for CO2.

When CO2 dissolves into formation brine. or is trapped as residual phase. buoyancy forces are negligible and the CO2 may be retained with minimal risk of leakage. Solubility trapping may therefore enable more secure storage in aquifer systems than is possible in dry systems (e.g.. depleted gas fields) with comparable geological seals. A crucial question for an aquifer system is. what is the rate of dissolution? In this paper. we address that question by presenting a method for accelerating CO2 dissolution in saline aquifers by injecting brine on top of the injected CO2.

Unlike the conventional pressure decay method. the experimental setup has been designed such that the interface pressure and consequently the dissolved gas concentration at the interface are kept constant. This is accomplished by continuously injecting the required amount of gas into the gas cap from a secondary supply cell to maintain the pressure constant at the gas−liquid interface. The pressure decay is measured in the supply cell. The advantage of the new technique is that. assuming the diffusion coefficient to be constant. a simple analysis allows determination of the equilibrium concentration and diffusion coefficient.,True,GOXWvWkAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,112,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef9008955,13618378241411492491,/scholar?cites=13618378241411492491,,http://ucalgaryreservoirsimulation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/J20-ef9008955.pdf,0,0,0
1117894,Modelling of convective mixing in CO2 storage,2005,H Hassanzadeh and M Pooladi-Darvish and DW Keith,44,Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology,10,,Petroleum Society of Canada,Accurate modelling of the fate of injected CO 2 is necessary if geological storage is to be used at a large scale. In one form of geological storage. CO 2 is injected into an aquifer that has a sealing caprock. forming a CO 2 cap beneath the caprock. The diffusion of CO 2 into underlying formation waters increases the density of water near the top of the aquifer. bringing the system to a hydro-dynamically unstable state. Instabilities can arise from the combination of an unstable density profile and inherent perturbations within the system. eg. formation heterogeneity. If created. this instability causes convective mixing and greatly accelerates the dissolution of CO 2 into the aquifer. Accurate estimation of the rate of dissolution is important for risk assessments because the timescale for dissolution is the timescale over which the CO 2 has a chance to leak through the caprock or any imperfectly sealed wells.,True,GOXWvWkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,104,https://onepetro.org/JCPT/article-abstract/doi/10.2118/05-10-04/32204,2215612141255983041,/scholar?cites=2215612141255983041,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/428e/b5a27bbb2deed356bed1ecaaa636279b0be4.pdf,0,0,0

An understanding of the primary mechanisms such as convective mixing and geochemistry that affect the long-term geostorage process in deep saline aquifers is of prime importance. First. a linear stability analysis of an unstable diffusive boundary layer in porous media is presented. where the instability occurs due to a density difference between the carbon dioxide saturated brine and the resident brine. The impact of geochemical reactions on the stability of the boundary layer is examined. The equations are linearised. and the obtained system of eigenvalue problems is solved numerically.

The results reveal that the interporosity flow coefficient. storativity ratio. natural-fracture permeability anisotropy. and reservoir size play significant roles on the identified flow regimes compared to the hydraulically fractured well location and reservoir shape.

After injection of CO2 into a deep saline aquifer. the density of the brine saturated with CO2 increases slightly. This increase in density induces natural convection. The effect of geothermal gradient is also considered in this work as a second incentive for convection and the double-diffusion convection was studied. Linear stability analysis is used to predict the inception of instabilities and initial wavelength of the convective instabilities. The analysis presented is applied to acid gas injection (as an analogue for CO2 storage) into saline aquifers in the Alberta basin. It is found that the geothermal gradient does not have significant effect on the onset of convection for these aquifers.

Four decades after Warren and Root (1963. SPEJ. 245–255.) introduced the double porosity concept and suggested a relation for it. this parameter is still not completely understood. Even for a single-phase flow problem. investigators report different shape factors. This study shows that for a single-phase flow in a particular matrix block. the shape factor that Warren and Root defined is not unique and depends on the pressure in the fracture and how it changes with time. We use the Laplace domain analytical solutions of the diffusivity equation for different geometries and different boundary conditions to show that the shape factor depends on the fracture pressure change with time.

The entire establishment of fluid flow application in porous media is based on the use of an experimental law proposed by Darcy (1856). There are evidences in the literature that the flow of a fluid in consolidated and unconsolidated porous media does not follow Darcy law at very low fluxes. which is called pre‐Darcy flow. In this paper. the unsteady flow regimes of a slightly compressible fluid under the linear and radial pre‐Darcy flow conditions are modeled and the corresponding highly nonlinear diffusivity equations are solved analytically by aid of a generalized Boltzmann transformation technique.

1117914,Linear models for control of cavity flow oscillations,2006,Clarence W Rowley and David R Williams and Tim Colonius and Richard M Murray and Douglas G Macmynowski,547,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,317-330,Cambridge University Press,Models for understanding and controlling oscillations in the flow past a rectangular cavity are developed. These models may be used to guide control designs. to understand performance limits of feedback. and to interpret experimental results. Traditionally. cavity oscillations are assumed to be self-sustained: no external disturbances are necessary to maintain the oscillations. and amplitudes are limited by nonlinearities. We present experimental data which suggests that in some regimes. the oscillations may not be self-sustained. but lightly damped: oscillations are sustained by external forcing. such as boundary-layer turbulence. In these regimes. linear models suffice to describe the behaviour. and the final amplitude of oscillations depends on the characteristics of the external disturbances. These linear models are particularly appropriate for describing cavities in which feedback has been used for noise suppression. as the oscillations are small and nonlinearities are less likely to be important. It is shown that increasing the gain too much in such feedback control experiments can lead to a peak-splitting phenomenon. which is explained by the linear models. Fundamental performance limits indicate that peak splitting is likely to occur for narrow-bandwidth actuators and controllers.,True,SkjV1ZQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,119,https://authors.library.caltech.edu/5323/,5536405370744697861,/scholar?cites=5536405370744697861,,https://authors.library.caltech.edu/5323/1/ROWjfm06.pdf,0,0,0

Analysis often assumes that geoengineering would be used to maintain a constant global mean temperature. Under this scenario. geoengineering would be required either indefinitely (on societal time scales) or until atmospheric CO2 concentrations were sufficiently reduced. Impacts of climate change. however. are related to the rate of change as well as its magnitude. We thus describe an alternative scenario in which solar geoengineering is used only to constrain the rate of change of global mean temperature; this leads to a finite deployment period for any emissions pathway that stabilizes global mean temperature.

Most previous simulations have prescribed a particular strategy and evaluated its modeled effects. Here we turn this approach around by first choosing example climate objectives and then designing a strategy to meet those objectives in climate models.

One of the most irritating components of helicopter interior noise comes from high frequency (> 500Hz) structureborne gear-mesh tones generated within the transmission. Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation is engaged in a multi-year program to develop a flightworthy ANC system to actively cancel gear-mesh noise in the S-76 helicopter interior. The challenge in this ANC application stems from the high frequencies involved; from 700 Hz to 4 kHz. A major project milestone was reached in 1995 with the first flight test of a high frequency ANC system on a helicopter. In this initial flight test. reductions of 7-12dB in the primary gear-mesh tone (~ 800Hz) were achieved over a wide range of flight conditions. A second flight test. performed in 1996-97. achieved significant improvements in system performance and robustness by utilizing an improved system identification procedure.

The experiment has been designed to investigate the extent to which the on-orbit behavior of a precision-controlled spacecraft can be predicted and controlled using analysis and ground testing prior to launch. A goal of the flight experiment is to demonstrate good payload pointing performance using active controllers designed based on the predicted structural dynamics. For systems with complicated control topologies and large model uncertainties. this requires a systematic control design methodology. The results from preliminary ground-based control experiments are used in this paper to present such a design technique and to illustrate how it can be applied to future flight experiments.

Calcification rates were calculated for more than 9.000 reef locations using model values of Ωarag and sea surface temperature at different levels of atmospheric CO2.

In the northern hemisphere. the jet stream weakened. In the southern hemisphere. the sub‐tropical jet weakened. whereas the polar jet strengthened.

Air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects. First. it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty. so its cost provides an absolute cap on the cost of mitigation. Second. it permits reduction in concentrations faster than the natural carbon cycle: the effects of irreversibility are thus partly alleviated. Third. because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure. air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies.We assess the ultimate physical limits on the amount of energy and land required for air capture and describe two systems that might achieve air capture at prices under 200 and 500 $/tC using current technology.Like geoengineering. air capture …,True,UkN8AbYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,476,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-005-9026-x,5318072251993807984,/scholar?cites=5318072251993807984,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/file/Keithetal-AirCapture.pdf,0,0,0

A simple integrated model of optimal greenhouse gas abatement over time is presented. in which the abatement cost depends on both fixed and transitional elements. It is shown that the optimal current response and long-run prospects differ radically between the classical economic case — in which the cost of a given cutback in emissions is fixed exogenously — and the adaptive case — in which the response is ultimately adaptive but heavily constrained by inertia (ie low fixed but high transitional cost).

However. stored CO2 can leak back to the atmosphere reducing the utility of this technology. To explore the trade-offs between discounting. leakage. the cost of sequestration and the energy penalty (the energy necessary to capture. transport and inject carbon underground). we derive analytic expressions for the value of leaky CO2 storage compared to perfect storage when storage is a marginal component of the energy system. If the annual leak rate is 1% and the discount rate is 4%. for example. then CO2 mitigation using leaky storage is worth 80% of mitigation with perfect storage. Using an integrated assessment numerical model (DIAM) to explore the role of leakage when CO2 storage is non-marginal. we find that a leakage rate of 0.1% is nearly the same as …,True,UkN8AbYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,102,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-10270-1_11,12210226762017200251,/scholar?cites=12210226762017200251,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003927/document,0,0,0

In a baseline scenario without renewables. coal provides 44% of electricity generated from 2010 to 2030. The use of renewables could reduce that figure to 39%. as well as decrease the sector's cumulative emission of CO2 by 8%. SO2 by 3%. and NOx by 4%. In addition. renewables could avoid installing 4.4 GW in fossil fuel generating capacity. conserve domestic coal. decrease coal and gases imports. improving energy independence and security.

An analogue to a city A is a city B whose climate today corresponds to A's simulated future climate. Climates were characterized and compared non-parametrically. using the 30-years distribution of three indicators: Aridity Index. Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days. The level of correspondence (i.e. strength of analogy) was evaluated statistically with the two-samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. generalized to 3 dimensions. We looked at the climate of 12 European cities at the end of the 21st century under an A2 climate change scenario. We used two datasets produced with high-resolution regional climate simulation models from the Hadley Centre and Meteo France. As expected from the modelled warming in local climate. analogues were found in warmer regions. mostly at more southerly latitudes within Europe. although much model and scenario uncertainty remains.

We examine the question of optimal adaptation to climate change in a vintage capital growth model without uncertainty. Along the optimal pathway. adaptation is proactive with an anticipation period of approximately twenty years. While there is additional investment in this scenario compared with a no-climate-change baseline. the overall cost to adapt is low relative to the potential losses from maladaptation.

This is linked with the inertia that characterises energy system dynamics. An optimising model is developed which takes these dimensions explicitly into account in a highly simplified manner. The model optimises the emissions trajectory given abatement costs which are related explicitly to both the degree and the rate of abatement. Altering the coefficients associated with each of these two dimensions reflects different perspectives on the inertia of change. relative to the ultimate technical and behavioural flexibility of society. Low inertia and high absolute costs (no induced technology development) reproduces the kind of results found in other optimising cost-benefit studies. But if the major costs are those associated with the rate but an optimistic perspective on the ultimate potential of technology and/or behavioral patterns to adapt to such constraints - the optimal strategy and long-run prospects are radically altered. In this case. abatement rises within a few years above the level incurred in the ""conventional"" case. and long-run stabilizaiton of atmospheric concentrations may by approached after some decades. at moderate costs. as an optimal response even for moderate valued for the climate damage function.

1117995,An overview of the Earth system science of solar geoengineering,2016,Peter J Irvine and Ben Kravitz and Mark G Lawrence and Helene Muri,7,,6,815-833,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Solar geoengineering has been proposed as a means to cool the Earth by increasing the reflection of sunlight back to space. for example. by injecting reflective aerosol particles (or their precursors) into the lower stratosphere. Such proposed techniques would not be able to substitute for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a response to the risks of climate change. as they would only mask some of the effects of global warming. They might. however. eventually be applied as a complementary approach to reduce climate risks. Thus. the Earth system consequences of solar geoengineering are central to understanding its potentials and risks. Here we review the state‐of‐the‐art knowledge about stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection and an idealized proxy for this. ‘sunshade geoengineering.’ in which the intensity of incoming sunlight is directly reduced in models.

However. a widely held concern is that SRM will not reverse the climate consequences of global warming evenly. resulting in regional disparities in the combined climate response to elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and SRM. Recent research has used climate model projections to quantitatively assess how regional disparities affect the overall efficiency of global SRM and what the resulting potential for cooperation and conflict with regard to SRM may be. First results indicate that regional disparities. although present. may not be severe. These assessments rest on the assumption that. for all regions. any deviation from a past climate state inflicts damages.

We find that very large amounts of wind power can produce nonnegligible climatic change at continental scales. Although large-scale effects are observed. wind power has a negligible effect on global-mean surface temperature. and it would deliver enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of CO2 and air pollutants.

Electricity from wind provides an alternative to conventional generation that could. in principle. be used to achieve deep reductions (> 50%) in carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel use.

The MGA capability is incorporated into Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis (Temoa). an open source framework that also includes a technology rich. bottom up ESOM. In this analysis. Temoa is used to explore alternative energy futures in a simplified single region energy system that represents the U.S. electric sector and a portion of the light duty transport sector.

However. there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models. ESOMs tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties. the model insights may be limited. lack robustness. and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for ESOMs. We have identified four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to ESOM type models: Monte Carlo analysis. stochastic programming. robust optimization. and modelling to generate alternatives.

Offshore compressed air energy storage (OCAES) is a carbon-free storage technology that can used to support renewable energy generation in marine environments. This paper provides the first economic characterization of OCAES performance when coupled to an offshore wind farm by employing a mixed integer programming model. The model seeks the minimum levelized cost of electricity by optimizing the grid-tied cable capacity and OCAES component sizes across a range of specified cable capacity factors. OCAES can be used to increase the capacity factor of the grid-tied transmission cable. but the resultant levelized cost of electricity strongly depends on the OCAES cost assumptions.

We discuss optimal policy and carbon price. interregional and intergenerational equity issues. strategic interaction in the design of international environmental agreements. and the sources of risk and uncertainty surrounding these technologies. We conclude that climate engineering technologies. similar to mitigation and adaptation. should be a fundamental part of future domestic and global climate policy design.

However. modelling studies examining the effectiveness of SRM as a strategy to offset anthropogenic climate change have used only the standard parameterizations of atmosphere–ocean general circulation models that yield climate sensitivities close to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project mean. Here. we use a perturbed-physics ensemble modelling experiment to examine how the response of the climate to SRM implemented in the stratosphere (SRM-S) varies under different greenhouse-gas climate sensitivities. When SRM-S is used to compensate for rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. its effectiveness in stabilizing regional climates diminishes with increasing climate sensitivity.

Here we use these considerations to provide a maximum estimate of wind power availability over land. We use several different methods. First. we outline the processes associated with wind power generation and extraction with a simple power transfer hierarchy based on the assumption that available wind power will not geographically vary with increased extraction for an estimate of 68 TW. Second. we set up a simple momentum balance model to estimate maximum extractability which we then apply to reanalysis climate data. yielding an estimate of 21 TW. Third. we perform general circulation model simulations in which we extract different amounts of momentum from the atmospheric boundary layer to obtain a maximum estimate of how much power can be extracted. yielding 18–34 TW. These three methods consistently yield maximum estimates in the range of 18–68 TW and are notably less than recent estimates that claim abundant wind power availability. Furthermore. we show with the general circulation model simulations that some climatic effects at maximum wind power extraction are similar in magnitude to those associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2.

These estimates are calculated using observed wind speeds in combination with specifications of wind turbine size and density to quantify the extractable wind power. However. this approach neglects the effects of momentum extraction by the turbines on the atmospheric flow that would have effects outside the turbine wake. Here we show with a simple momentum balance model of the atmospheric boundary layer that this common methodology to derive wind power potentials requires unrealistically high increases in the generation of kinetic energy by the atmosphere. This increase by an order of magnitude is needed to ensure momentum conservation in the atmospheric boundary layer. In the context of this simple model. we then compare the effect of three different assumptions regarding the boundary conditions at the top of the boundary layer. with prescribed hub height velocity. momentum transport. or kinetic energy transfer into the boundary layer. We then use simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model that explicitly simulate generation of kinetic energy with momentum conservation. These simulations show that the assumption of prescribed momentum import into the atmospheric boundary layer yields the most realistic behavior of the simple model. while the assumption of prescribed hub height velocity can clearly be disregarded.

However. jet streams are nearly geostrophic flow. that is. they result from the balance between the pressure gradient and Coriolis force in the near absence of friction. Therefore. jet stream motion is associated with very small generation rates of kinetic energy to maintain the high wind velocities. and it is this generation rate that will ultimately limit the potential use of jet streams as a renewable energy resource. Here we estimate the maximum limit of jet stream wind power by considering extraction of kinetic energy as a term in the free energy balance of kinetic energy that describes the generation. depletion. and extraction of kinetic energy. We use this balance as the basis to quantify the maximum limit of how much kinetic energy can be extracted sustainably from the jet streams of the global atmosphere as well as the potential climatic impacts of its use. We first use a simple thought experiment of geostrophic flow to demonstrate why the high wind velocities of the jet streams are not associated with a high potential for renewable energy generation. We then use an atmospheric general circulation model to estimate that the maximum sustainable extraction from jet streams of the global atmosphere is about 7.5 TW. This estimate is about 200-times less than previous estimates and is due to the fact that the common expression for instantaneous wind power 12 ρv3 merely characterizes the transport of kinetic energy by the flow. but not the generation rate of kinetic energy.

However. a detailed reading of their work (3) reveals that their estimates are consistent with ours (and others; table 2 of ref. 2). yet their extrapolation to larger scales is flawed and so are their implications.In contrast to ref. 1. we used an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) that explicitly simulates the dynamics of generating and dissipating kinetic energy associated with the large-scale atmospheric circulation to derive the wind resource. These dynamics are very well understood and documented. and our GCM reproduces these energetics (4⇓–6). While some smaller-scale meteorological phenomena such as land–sea and mountain–valley breezes may be important for local wind resources and may not be represented in ref. 2. we are not aware of any studies that suggest …,True,qB5jB4cAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,0,https://www.pnas.org/content/114/43/E8946.extract,,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/114/43/E8946,0,0,0

Such environmental considerations are an important part of the matrix of issues that must be considered in designing an optimal mix of power sources for the future.Early in the workshop. it was recognized that the fraction of incoming solar radiation that is converted to kinetic energy in the atmosphere represents an upper bound of about 1000 terrawatts (TW) of available wind energy. which corresponds to a maximum global potential wind power extraction by turbines on and near land on the order of 100–300 TW.

Current wind power estimates rely on the use of mean climatological wind speeds. This approach to estimating wind power neglects the influence of momentum extraction by the turbines (ie turbine-turbine interactions) and interannual variability in windspeed. The present study will use a wind turbine parameterization within the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model to assess the role of interannual and climatic variability on power extraction. The WRF model will be forced by NARR. and run from 1980-2010 to incorporate different climatic conditions over the central United States.

Here we have applied it to the particular scenario of desert greening. because previous research on the stability of a green Sahara suggests that it would not be maintained in a steady-state by natural means (cf.

As this would involve a continual energy input. we use Energy-Returnon-Investment (EROI) to benchmark the energetic sustainability of this process.

This method provides a parsimonious way to account for regional inequality in the assessment of SRM effectiveness and allows policy and decision makers to examine the linear climate response to different SRM configurations. To illustrate how the model works. we use data from an ensemble of modeling experiments conducted with a general circulation model (GCM). We find that an SRM scheme optimized to restore population-weighted temperature changes to their baseline compensates for 99% of these changes while an SRM scheme optimized for population-weighted precipitation changes compensates for 97% of these changes.

SRM cannot. however. perfectly offset CO2-driven climate change. and its use introduces novel climate and environmental risks. We introduce SRM in a simple economic model of climate change that is designed to explore the interaction between uncertainty in the climate’s response to CO2 and the risks of SRM in the face of carbon-cycle inertia. The fact that SRM can be implemented quickly. reducing the effects of inertia. makes it a valuable tool to manage climate risks even if it is relatively ineffective at compensating for CO2-driven climate change or if its costs are large compared to traditional abatement strategies. Uncertainty about SRM is high. and decision makers must decide whether or not to commit to research that might reduce this uncertainty.

Climate model simulations project a diversity of regional outcomes that vary with the amount of solar geoengineering deployed. It is unlikely that a single small actor could implement and sustain global-scale geoengineering that harms much of the world without intervention from harmed world powers. However. a sufficiently powerful international coalition might be able to deploy solar geoengineering.

This possibility has created an intense debate given the ethical. moral and scientific questions it raises. This paper examines the economic issues introduced when geoengineering becomes available in a standard model where strategic interaction leads to suboptimal mitigation. Geoengineering introduces the possibility of technical substitution away from mitigation. but it also affects the strategic interaction across countries: mitigation decisions directly affect geoengineering decisions.

Before reaching the tipping point. the introduction of solar geoengineering reduces the amount of mitigation. lowers temperatures and increases carbon concentrations.

China is engaging in the global trend of fragmentation in production. even as an interregional phenomenon. Perhaps something could be learned about conserving or reducing VWT. if we knew where and how it is practiced. Given some proximate causes. perhaps viable policies could be formulated. To this end. we employ China's multiregional input-output tables straddling two periods to trace the trade of a given region's three types of goods: local final goods. local intermediate goods. and goods that shipped to …,True,5A2KLAkAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,17,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135419306141,16127275517899915568,/scholar?cites=16127275517899915568,,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/71697/1/Accepted_Manuscript.pdf,0,0,0

We propose a framework to examine future climate migration patterns using models of human migration. Our framework requires that we distinguish between historical versus climate driven migration and recognizes how the impacts of climate change can extend beyond the affected area. We apply our framework to simulate how migration. driven by sea level rise. differs from baseline migration patterns. Specifically. we couple a sea level rise model with a data-driven model of human migration and future population projections. creating a generalized joint model of climate driven migration that can be used to simulate population distributions under potential future sea level rise scenarios. The results of our case study suggest that the effects of sea level rise are pervasive. expanding beyond coastal areas via increased migration. and disproportionately affecting some areas of the United States.,True,5A2KLAkAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227436,12990891932328066117,/scholar?cites=12990891932328066117,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227436,0,0,0

We start by discussing a wide range of economic channels through which climate change might impact fertility. including sectoral reallocation. the gender wage gap. longevity. and child mortality. Then. we build a quantitative model that combines standard economic-demographic theory with existing estimates of the economic consequences of climate change. In the model. increases in global temperature affect agricultural and non-agricultural sectors differently. Near the equator. where many poor countries are located. climate change has a larger negative effect on agriculture.

Most adaptation strategies are designed to adjust to a new climate state. However. despite our best efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. climate is likely to continue changing far into the future.

We ground our discussion with an example of optimal investment in the face of continued sea-level rise. presenting a quantitative model that illustrates the interplay among physical and economic factors governing coastal development decisions such as rate of sea-level rise. land slope. discount rate. and depreciation rate.

The possibility that one state might unilaterally deploy geoengineering technology has become a fixture in these debates. and has cast a pall over substantive inquiry into climate intervention research and implementation. Speculation about “rogue” states pursuing geoengineering outside multilateral frameworks has given pause to calls for more robust experiments and field trials. and has contributed to the adoption of moratoria by the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 1972 and the Protocol of 1996 (LC/LP) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). 1 In sum. the fear of unilateralism has become an idée fixe in conversations about geoengineering. in effect putting the brakes on more ambitious research efforts and deliberations about governance issues.In this article. I argue that fear of unilateralism is largely misplaced. grounded more in unexamined policy assumptions than in reasoned analysis of the strategic situation faced by states. I will present this argument in five parts. First. I will document the widespread notion that unilateral geoengineering poses a genuine threat to the international order. Second. I will closely examine the interests and constraints that are likely to confront states contemplating intervention in the climate system. Third.

1118150,Solar geoengineering and obligations to the global poor,2016,Joshua Horton and David Keith,,Climate justice and geoengineering: Ethics and policy in the atmospheric Anthropocene,,79-92,Rowman & Littlefield International,One of the very few things that nearly all participants in the climate change debate agree on is that the effects of climate change will disproportionately affect the poor. for the simple reason that poorer people will have fewer resources available to them to manage climate risks and adapt to unavoidable changes compared to their wealthier neighbours. This simple fact applies both to disadvantaged people in every country and more broadly to the developing world in relation to rich. industrialized nations. Some concrete examples help illustrate this particularly tragic aspect of climate change. More frequent and more intense heat waves will harm the poor more than the rich both because the rich are more protected by technology such as air conditioning and because the regions most prone to future extreme heat events are generally less wealthy. The poor have less reliable access to water. which will only be exacerbated by the growth in the number and severity of droughts. Climate change will reduce yields of many staple crops. with disproportionate impacts on the global poor whose economies rely more on agriculture and whose existence is more marginal to begin with. The disadvantaged are more likely to depend on local ecosystems for their subsistence and livelihoods. so that climate-induced ecosystem stresses will prove particularly harmful to the least well off. The loss of coral reefs. for example. will be especially damaging for poor coastal communities who rely on reefs for food and income as well as protection from increasingly destructive storm surges.

Structural incongruities related to causation. time. scope. and scale impede application of tort law to climate change. while political opposition from developed countries prevents intergovernmental consideration of liability as a means of compensating for climate damages. Insurance. however. in particular parametric insurance triggered by objective environmental indices. is emerging as a promising alternative to liability. This is manifest in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. which ruled out recourse to legal liability. and in the formation and expansion of regional sovereign climate risk insurance schemes in the Caribbean.

These include not only the choice of whether to deploy solar engineering. but decisions regarding how to deploy. and ongoing decision-making throughout deployment. Research on the governance of solar geoengineering to date has primarily engaged only with the question of whether to deploy. We examine the science of solar geoengineering in order to clarify the technical dimensions of decisions about deployment – both strategic and operational – and how these might influence governance considerations. while consciously refraining from making specific recommendations.

1118162,Evaluating Solar Geoengineering Deployment Scenarios,2019,Joshua Horton,,Governance of the Deployment of Solar Geoengineering,,37,,When considering governance of solar geoengineering deployment. much depends on the specific deployment scenario that is envisioned. Scenarios are important because they establish the parameters of possible action. and contain assumptions about structures and behaviors. In this brief. I will comment on two deployment scenarios that often feature in discussions about solar geoengineering:“emergency” and “breakout.” In both cases. closer inspection reveals that key scenario elements are either unwarranted. undesirable. or unrealistic. rendering any derivative analysis liable to lead to flawed. perhaps even dangerous. conclusions. e emergency scenario imagines that accelerating climate change may result in a “climate emergency” necessitating rapid deployment of solar geoengineering to forestall catastrophe. In the literature. potential crises are frequently viewed in terms of climate tipping points. or thresholds beyond which abrupt. nonlinear effects take hold. Melting ice sheets and sea ice. and thawing permafrost are commonly offered as examples of climate tipping points. More recently. a group of scientists has advanced the “Hothouse Earth” hypothesis. according to which the cumulative effects of multiple positive feedbacks could push the Earth into a new. much less hospitable state (Steffen et al. 2018). Although the tipping point concept is entrenched in climate policy discourse. there is substantial disagreement within the scientific community about its theoretical soundness and considerable skepticism regarding storylines based on crossing tipping points (IPCC 2013).Whether emergency deployment is justified in terms of tipping …,True,yXDQolcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,3,https://publications.iass-potsdam.de/rest/items/item_4165891_3/component/file_4165893/content#page=43,18004471527497877801,/scholar?cites=18004471527497877801,,https://publications.iass-potsdam.de/rest/items/item_4165891_3/component/file_4165893/content#page=43,0,0,0

Without careful consideration and development of a governance framework for these types of experimentation. governments could be caught out having to respond ad hoc to situations driven by non-governmental actors.  This two-day workshop considered and evaluated governance mechanisms that may be useful for managing proposed SRM field experiments.

In this study. inorganic solid residues from a kraft pulp mill were characterized physically and chemically. The effect of pH. as well as physical characteristics and chemical composition. on the leaching rate was investigated. It was shown that the leaching behaviour differed depending on the production method of the aggregates. A model based on mass transfer was fitted to the experimental leaching data. It was shown that the leaching rate for the easily soluble species was reasonably well described using the concentration gradient of these species within the pellet.

There is also a strong growing interest from society to replace petroleum-based products with products from renewable sources. The spent cooking liquor in a kraft pulp mill. called black liquor. is today used for electricity and steam production. but it could partly be converted into other valuable products. making use of the chemical structures of complex organic compounds derived from the wood components. Moreover. the cellulose fraction which is currently used for paper products can be used for other purposes. such as production of biofuels or specialty cellulose products. In addition. there are new possibilities to make use of low quality biomass. for example forest residues. The pulp mills have good prerequisites to become the future biorefineries. Firstly. the scale of the industry means both large volumes of biomass feedstock in large production sites permitting economies of scale. Secondly. some by-product streams. e.g. black liquor. are already partly processed in pulp production and can be more suitable for further refining than wood waste. agro fibres or other natural- fibre feedstock.

One opportunity is the conversion of chemical pulp mills into dissolving pulp mills by extracting hemicellulose prior to digesting via pre-hydrolysis.

Harvard University Press. 1998). to compute the extent to which tax-and-transfer regimes in 11 countries equalize opportunities among citizens for income acquisition. Roughly speaking. equality of opportunity for incomes has been achieved in a country when it is the case that the distributions of post-fisc income are the same for different types of citizen. where a citizen’s type is defined by the socio-economic status of his parents. Intuitively. a country will have equalized opportunity if the chances of earning high (or low) income are equal for citizens from all family backgrounds. Of course. pre-fisc income distributions. by type. will not be identical. as long as the educational system does not entirely make up for the disadvantage that children. who come from poor families face. but the tax-and-transfer system …,True,gJcWlqAAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC,255,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272701001451,12452407490359892486,/scholar?cites=12452407490359892486,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01651129/file/journal%20of%20public%20economics.pdf,0,0,0
1118204,Policy sequencing toward decarbonization,2017,Jonas Meckling and Thomas Sterner and Gernot Wagner,2,,12,918-922,Nature Publishing Group,Many economists have long held that carbon pricing—either through a carbon tax or cap-and-trade—is the most cost-effective way to decarbonize energy systems. along with subsidies for basic research and development. Meanwhile. green innovation and industrial policies aimed at fostering low-carbon energy technologies have proliferated widely. Most of these predate direct carbon pricing. Low-carbon leaders such as California and the European Union (EU) have followed a distinct policy sequence that helps overcome some of the political challenges facing low-carbon policy by building economic interest groups in support of decarbonization and reducing the cost of technologies required for emissions reductions. However. while politically effective. this policy pathway faces significant challenges to environmental and cost effectiveness. including excess rent capture and lock-in.

To avoid those problems. many have shifted their focus to linkage of bottom-up climate policies such as regional carbon markets. This approach is appealing. but we identify four obstacles to successful linkage: different levels of ambition; competing domestic policy objectives; objections to financial transfers; and the difficulty of close regulatory coordination. Even with a more decentralized approach. overcoming the'global warming gridlock'of the intergovernmental negotiations will require close international coordination.

In popular and social scientific discourse. “tipping points” involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic “tipping points.” the commitment to a state change may occur abruptly. but the change itself may be rate‐limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally. the connection between climatic “tipping points” and economic losses is tenuous. although emerging empirical and process‐model‐based tools provide pathways for investigating it.

1118210,Climate finance: Regulatory and funding strategies for climate change and global development,2009,Richard B Stewart and Benedict Kingsbury and Bryce Rudyk,,,,,NYU Press,Preventing risks of severe damage from climate change not only requires deep cuts in developed country greenhouse gas emissions. but enormous amounts of public and private investment to limit emissions while promoting green growth in developing countries. While attention has focused on emissions limitations commitments and architectures. the crucial issue of what must be done to mobilize and govern the necessary financial resources has received too little consideration. In Climate Finance. a leading group of policy experts and scholars shows how effective mitigation of climate change will depend on a complex mix of public funds. private investment through carbon markets. and structured incentives that leave room for developing country innovations. This requires sophisticated national and global regulation of cap-and-trade and offset markets. forest and energy policy. international development funding. international trade law. and coordinated tax policy. Thirty-six targeted policy essays present a succinct overview of the emerging field of climate finance. defining the issues. setting the stakes. and making new and comprehensive proposals for financial. regulatory. and governance mechanisms that will enrich political and policy debate for many years to come.

All 16 models have estimated the radiative forcing (RF) of the anthropogenic DAE. and have taken into account anthropogenic sulphate. black carbon (BC) and organic aerosols (OA) from fossil fuel. biofuel. and biomass burning emissions. In addition several models have simulated the DAE of anthropogenic nitrate and anthropogenic influenced secondary organic aerosols (SOA). The model simulated all-sky RF of the DAE from total anthropogenic aerosols has a range from −0.58 to −0.02 Wm−2. with a mean of −0.27 Wm−2 for the 16 models. Several models did not include nitrate or SOA and modifying the estimate by accounting for this with information from the other AeroCom models reduces the range and slightly strengthens the mean. Modifying the model estimates for missing aerosol components and for the time period 1750 to 2010 results in a mean RF for the DAE of −0.35 Wm−2. Compared to AeroCom Phase I (Schulz et al.. 2006) we find very similar spreads in both total DAE and aerosol component RF. However. the RF of the total DAE is stronger negative and RF from BC from fossil fuel and biofuel emissions are stronger positive in the present study than in the previous AeroCom study. We find a tendency for models having a strong (positive) BC RF to also have strong (negative) sulphate or OA RF.

The new parameterization makes a much closer connection between the meteorological processes that determine condensate formation and the condensate amount. The parameterization removes some constraints from the simulation by allowing a substantially wider range of variation in condensate amount than in the standard CCM3 and tying the condensate amount to local physical processes. The parameterization also allows cloud drops to form prior to the onset of grid-box saturation and can require a significant length of time to convert condensate to a precipitable form. or to remove the condensate.

Carbonaceous particles can influence snow coverage by warming the atmosphere. reducing surface-incident solar energy (dimming). and reducing snow reflectance after deposition (darkening). We apply a range of models and observations to explore impacts of these processes on springtime climate. drawing several conclusions: 1) Nearly all atmospheric particles (those with visible-band single-scatter albedo less than 0.999). including all mixtures of black carbon (BC) and organic matter (OM). increase net solar heating of the atmosphere-snow column. 2) Darkening caused by small concentrations of particles within snow exceeds the loss of absorbed energy from concurrent dimming. thus increasing solar heating of snowpack as well (positive net surface forcing). Over global snow. we estimate 6-fold greater surface forcing from darkening than dimming. caused by BC+OM. 3) Equilibrium climate experiments suggest that fossil fuel and biofuel emissions of BC+OM induce 95% as much springtime snow cover loss over Eurasia as anthropogenic carbon dioxide. a consequence of strong snow-albedo feedback and large BC+OM emissions from Asia. 4) Of 22 climate models contributing to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. 21 underpredict the rapid warming (0.64°C decade−1) observed over springtime Eurasia since 1979.

MAM is capable of simulating the aerosol size distribution and both internal and external mixing between aerosol components. treating numerous complicated aerosol processes and aerosol physical. chemical and optical properties in a physically-based manner. Two MAM versions were developed: a more complete version with seven lognormal modes (MAM7). and a version with three lognormal modes (MAM3) for the purpose of long-term (decades to centuries) simulations. In this paper a description and evaluation of the aerosol module and its two representations are provided. Sensitivity of the aerosol lifecycle to simplifications in the representation of aerosol is discussed. Simulated sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass concentrations are remarkably similar between MAM3 and MAM7. Differences in primary organic matter (POM) and black carbon (BC) concentrations between MAM3 and MAM7 are also small (mostly within 10%). The mineral dust global burden differs by 10% and sea salt burden by 30–40% between MAM3 and MAM7. mainly due to the different size ranges for dust and sea salt modes and different standard deviations of the log-normal size distribution for sea salt modes between MAM3 and MAM7.

The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions. and the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate geoengineering has often been considered to be a"" last-ditch"" response to climate change. to be used only if climate change damage should produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on emissions control. there is a lack of information on these ways of potentially intervening in the climate system. As one of a two-book report. this volume of Climate Intervention discusses albedo modification-changing the fraction of incoming solar radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo modification raises political and governance issues at national and global levels. as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social. political. and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques. It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action.

Within the international AEROCOM initiative. the representation of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in ten different general circulation models (GCMs) is evaluated using three satellite datasets. The focus is on stratiform liquid water clouds since most GCMs do not include ice nucleation effects. and none of the model explicitly parameterises aerosol effects on convective clouds. We compute statistical relationships between aerosol optical depth (τa) and various cloud and radiation quantities in a manner that is consistent between the models and the satellite data. It is found that the model-simulated influence of aerosols on cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) compares relatively well to the satellite data at least over the ocean. The relationship between τa and liquid water path is simulated much too strongly by the models. This suggests that the implementation of the second aerosol indirect effect mainly in terms of an autoconversion parameterisation has to be revisited in the GCMs. A positive relationship between total cloud fraction (fcld) and τa as found in the satellite data is simulated by the majority of the models. albeit less strongly than that in the satellite data in most of them. In a discussion of the hypotheses proposed in the literature to explain the satellite-derived strong fcld–τa relationship. our results indicate that none can be identified as a unique explanation.

California has experienced its most severe drought in recorded history. causing statewide water stress. severe economic loss and an extraordinary increase in wildfires. Identifying the effects of global warming on regional water cycle extremes. such as the ongoing drought in California. remains a challenge. Here we analyse large-ensemble and multi-model simulations that project the future of water cycle extremes in California as well as to understand those associations that pertain to changing climate oscillations under global warming. Both intense drought and excessive flooding are projected to increase by at least 50% towards the end of the twenty-first century; this projected increase in water cycle extremes is associated with a strengthened relation to El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO)—in particular. extreme El Niño and La Niña events that modulate California’s …,True,VEviFL8AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,128,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9657,14648768348283619224,/scholar?cites=14648768348283619224,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9657,0,0,0

Inc.,Solar geoengineering has been proposed as a means to cool the Earth by increasing the reflection of sunlight back to space. for example. by injecting reflective aerosol particles (or their precursors) into the lower stratosphere. Such proposed techniques would not be able to substitute for mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a response to the risks of climate change. as they would only mask some of the effects of global warming. They might. however. eventually be applied as a complementary approach to reduce climate risks. Thus. the Earth system consequences of solar geoengineering are central to understanding its potentials and risks.

When sulfur dioxide is injected into the tropical or Arctic stratosphere. the main additional surface deposition of sulfate occurs in midlatitude bands. because of strong cross‐tropopause flux in the jet stream regions. We used critical load studies to determine the effects of this increase in sulfate deposition on terrestrial ecosystems by assuming the upper limit of hydration of all sulfate aerosols into sulfuric acid. For annual injection of 5 Tg of SO2 into the tropical stratosphere or 3 Tg of SO2 into the Arctic stratosphere. neither the maximum point value of sulfate deposition of approximately 1.5 mEq m−2 a−1 nor the largest additional deposition that would result from geoengineering of approximately 0.05 mEq m−2 a−1 is enough to …,True,VEviFL8AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,105,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009jd011918,9795285332368563849,/scholar?cites=9795285332368563849,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009JD011918,0,0,0

For eruptions injecting less than about 3 Tg of SO2 into the lower stratosphere. we expect no detectable climatic effect. no matter what the season of the eruption. For an injection of 5 Tg of SO2 into the lower stratosphere. an eruption in the summer would cause detectable climate effects. whereas an eruption at other times of the year would cause negligible effects. This is mainly due to the seasonal variation in insolation patterns and sulfate aerosol deposition rates. In all cases. the sulfate aerosols that form get removed from the atmosphere within a year after the eruption by large‐scale deposition.

Paired carbonate and organic carbon isotope determinations provide a possibility of interpreting not only changes in the global carbon cycle through time. but changes in atmospheric pCO 2 as well.

Glaciers near the equator today survive only at 5.000 meters above sea level or higher. and at the worst of the last ice age they reached no lower than 4.000 meters. Mixed in with the glacial debris are unusual deposits of iron-rich rock.

However. the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 °C [2].[3]) and rise in the depth of the CCD (> 2 km; [4]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM. for which there are several potential mechanisms.

This paper performs the first life cycle assessment (LCA) of the greenhouse gas emissions from LNG exports from Canada. assuming that importing countries use the natural gas for electricity generation. It shows that the climate impact of LNG depends on where it is sent. If LNG from Canada displaces electricity in coal-dependent countries. it will likely lower global greenhouse gas emissions. If it displaces electricity from countries that rely on low carbon sources such as hydroelectricity and nuclear power. it will likely increase global emissions. A broad suite of policy and regulatory measures is discussed for reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to LNG export. from life cycle regulation to facility-level emissions management.,True,UgzX3w8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,8,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2615070,16650611261716753845,/scholar?cites=16650611261716753845,,https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/50466/LNG-OP49.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Extracting and processing bitumen from oil sands is an energy intensive process that requires both electricity and steam which are usually sourced through fossil fuel conversions. This energy intensity (and associated CO2 emissions) as well as the rapid expansion of extraction operations has led to concerns about the management of this resource.

Br. I). Building on previous work within the GEOS-Chem model we include emissions of inorganic iodine from the oceans. anthropogenic and biogenic sources of halogenated gases. gas phase chemistry. and a parameterised approach to heterogeneous halogen chemistry. Consistent with Schmidt et al. (2016) we do not include sea-salt debromination. Observations of halogen radicals (BrO. IO) are sparse but the model has some skill in reproducing these. Modelled IO shows both high and low biases when compared to different datasets. but BrO concentrations appear to be modelled low. Comparisons to the very sparse observations dataset of reactive Cl species suggest the model represents a lower limit of the impacts of these species. likely due to underestimates in emissions and therefore burdens. Inclusion of Cl. Br. and I results in a general improvement in simulation of ozone (O3) concentrations. except in polar regions where the model now underestimates O3 concentrations. Halogen chemistry reduces the global tropospheric O3 burden by 18.6 %. with the O3 lifetime reducing from 26 to 22 days. Global mean OH concentrations of 1.28  ×  106 molecules cm−3 are 8.2 % lower than in a simulation without halogens. leading to an increase in the CH4 lifetime (10.8 %) due to OH oxidation from 7.47 to 8.28 years.

1118337,Limits on the ability of global Eulerian models to resolve intercontinental transport of chemical plumes,2017,Sebastian D Eastham and Daniel J Jacob,17,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,4,2543-2553,Copernicus GmbH, Quasi-horizontal chemical plumes in the free troposphere can preserve their concentrated structure for over a week. enabling transport on intercontinental scales with important environmental impacts. Global Eulerian chemical transport models (CTMs) fail to preserve these plumes due to fast numerical dissipation. We examine the causes of this dissipation and how it can be cured. Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) meteorological data at 0.25°  ×  0.3125° horizontal resolution and  ∼  0.5 km vertical resolution in the free troposphere are used to drive a worldwide ensemble of GEOS-Chem CTM plumes at resolutions from 0.25°  ×  0.3125° to 4°  ×  5°. in both 2-D (horizontal) and 3-D. Two-dimensional simulations enable examination of the sensitivity of numerical dissipation to grid resolution. We show that plume decay is driven by flow divergence and shear. filamenting the plumes until GEOS-Chem's high-order advection scheme cannot resolve gradients and fast numerical diffusion ensues. This divergence can be measured by the Lyapunov exponent (λ) of the flow. Dissipation of plumes is much faster at extratropical latitudes than in the tropics and this can be explained by stronger divergence. The plume decay constant (α) is linearly related to λ. and increasing grid resolution provides only modest benefits toward plume preservation. Three-dimensional simulations show near-complete dissipation of plumes within a few days. independent of horizontal grid resolution and even in the tropics. This is because vertical grid resolution is inadequate in all cases to properly resolve plume gradients. We suggest that finer vertical …,True,XEiwswYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,39,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/2543/2017/,2187297864713332840,/scholar?cites=2187297864713332840,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/2543/2017/acp-17-2543-2017.pdf,0,0,0

1118339,Errors and improvements in the use of archived meteorological data for chemical transport modeling: an analysis using GEOS-Chem v11-01 driven by GEOS-5 meteorology,2018,Karen Yu and Christoph A Keller and Daniel J Jacob and Andrea M Molod and Sebastian D Eastham and Michael S Long,11,Geoscientific model development,1,305-319,Copernicus GmbH, Global simulations of atmospheric chemistry are commonly conducted with off-line chemical transport models (CTMs) driven by archived meteorological data from general circulation models (GCMs). The off-line approach has the advantages of simplicity and expediency. but it incurs errors due to temporal averaging in the meteorological archive and the inability to reproduce the GCM transport algorithms exactly. The CTM simulation is also often conducted at coarser grid resolution than the parent GCM. Here we investigate this cascade of CTM errors by using 222Rn–210Pb–7Be chemical tracer simulations off-line in the GEOS-Chem CTM at rectilinear 0.25∘ × 0.3125∘ (≈ 25 km) and 2∘ × 2.5∘ (≈ 200 km) resolutions and online in the parent GEOS-5 GCM at cubed-sphere c360 (≈ 25 km) and c48 (≈ 200 km) horizontal resolutions. The c360 GEOS-5 GCM meteorological archive. updated every 3 h and remapped to 0.25∘ × 0.3125∘. is the standard operational product generated by the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and used as input by GEOS-Chem. We find that the GEOS-Chem 222Rn simulation at native 0.25∘ × 0.3125∘ resolution is affected by vertical transport errors of up to 20 % relative to the GEOS-5 c360 online simulation. in part due to loss of transient organized vertical motions in the GCM (resolved convection) that are temporally averaged out in the 3 h meteorological archive. There is also significant error caused by operational remapping of the meteorological archive from a cubed-sphere to a rectilinear grid.

We use a coupled tropospheric-stratospheric chemical-transport model with a global aviation emissions inventory to estimate the total impact of aviation on all three risk factors.

Interventions aimed at mitigating these damages need to take into account the physical and political boundaries in Europe. where emissions from one country may have an impact on neighboring populaces (trans-boundary impacts).

Observations typically indicate a 50 % depletion of sea salt aerosol (SSA) bromide relative to seawater composition. implying that SSA debromination could be the dominant global source of tropospheric bromine. However. it has been difficult to reconcile this large source with the relatively low bromine monoxide (BrO) mixing ratios observed in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Here we present a new mechanistic description of SSA debromination in the GEOS-Chem global atmospheric chemistry model with a detailed representation of halogen (Cl. Br. and I) chemistry. We show that observed levels of SSA debromination can be reproduced in a manner consistent with observed BrO mixing ratios. Bromine radical sinks from the HOBr + S(IV) heterogeneous reactions and from ocean emission of acetaldehyde are critical in moderating tropospheric BrO levels. The resulting HBr is rapidly taken up by SSA and also deposited. Observations of SSA debromination at southern midlatitudes in summer suggest that model uptake of HBr by SSA may be too fast. The model provides a successful simulation of free-tropospheric BrO in the tropics and midlatitudes in summer. where the bromine radical sink from the HOBr + S(IV) reactions is compensated for by more efficient HOBr-driven recycling in clouds compared to previous GEOS-Chem versions. Simulated BrO in the MBL is generally much higher in winter than in summer due to a combination of greater SSA emission and slower conversion of bromine radicals to …,True,XEiwswYAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,16,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/6497/2019/,15704059264353950509,/scholar?cites=15704059264353950509,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/6497/2019/,0,0,0

Current global models cannot reproduce this transport. The plumes dilute far too rapidly due to numerical diffusion in sheared flow. We show how model accuracy can be limited by either horizontal resolution (Δx) or vertical resolution (Δz). Balancing horizontal and vertical numerical diffusion. and weighing computational cost. implies an optimal grid resolution ratio (Δx ∕ Δz)opt ∼ 1000 for simulating the plumes. This is considerably higher than current global models (Δx ∕ Δz ∼ 20) and explains the rapid plume dilution in the models as caused by insufficient vertical resolution. Plume simulations with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (GFDL-FV3) over a range of horizontal and vertical grid resolutions confirm this limiting behavior. Our highest-resolution simulation (Δx ≈ 25 km. Δz ≈ 80 m) preserves the maximum mixing ratio in the plume to within 35 % after 8 days in strongly sheared flow. a drastic improvement over current models.

In this thesis. potential links are investigated between high altitude emissions and damages or benefits to human health via photochemical effects. Changes in population exposure to fine particulate matter. ozone and UV-B radiation resulting from current and future high altitude emissions are calculated. applying epidemiologically-derived impact functions to estimate resultant mortality and morbidity. A stratospheric extension is developed for the widely-used tropospheric model GEOS-Chem. which has been shown to accurately model tropospheric conditions and used in simulations of remote and urban pollution.

It leads to simple closed-form solutions for transmission over frequency-selective multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. which are scalable with respect to the number of antennas. size of the coding block. and transmit average/peak power. The scheme operates as a block transmission system in which vectors of symbols are encoded and modulated through a linear mapping operating jointly in the space and time dimension. The specific designs target minimization of the symbol mean square error and the approximate maximization of the minimum distance between symbol hypotheses. under average and peak power constraints. The solutions are shown to convert the MIMO channel with memory into a set of parallel flat fading subchannels. regardless of the design criterion. while appropriate …,True,2woHFu8AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,1018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/995062/,1597881764588562497,/scholar?cites=1597881764588562497,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Scaglione/publication/3318304_Optimal_designs_for_space-time_linear_precoders_and_decoders/links/0fcfd50b56c003371a000000.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we consider an MIMO multicell system where multiple mobile users (MUs) ask for computation offloading to a common cloud server. We formulate the offloading problem as the joint optimization of the radio resources-the transmit precoding matrices of the MUs-and the computational resources-the CPU cycles/second assigned by the cloud to each MU-in order to minimize the overall users' energy consumption. while meeting latency constraints. The resulting optimization problem is nonconvex (in the objective function and constraints). Nevertheless. in the single-user case. we are able to compute the global optimal solution in closed form.

Identifiability issues arising with existing approaches are described first when dealing with multicomponent PPS having the same highest order phase coefficients. This situation is encountered in applications such as synthetic aperture radar imaging or propagation of polynomial phase signals through channels affected by multipath and is thus worthy of a careful analysis. A new approach is proposed based on a transformation called product high-order ambiguity function (PHAF). The use of the PHAF offers a number of advantages with respect to the high-order ambiguity function (HAF). More specifically. it removes the identifiability problem and improves noise rejection capabilities.

Both FIR and pole-zero channels are considered. The inherent flexibility of the proposed transceivers is exploited to derive. as special cases. zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean-square error receive filterbanks. The transmit filterbank converts transmission over a frequency-selective fading channel. affected by additive colored noise. into a set of independent flat fading subchannels with uncorrelated noise samples.
