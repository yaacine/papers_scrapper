In Malaysia. kenaf was identified as one of the main commodity crops and could be the country’s next golden crop after oil palm. Currently. kenaf-based products are getting higher demand from local and international market. Thus. the improvement of kenaf crop for high fibre production is highly needed to meet the demand from the industries. Mutation induction is a method to increase genetic divergence associated with selection. recombination. or a combination of these approaches in plant breeding. This method is very promising to plant breeders for developing a new plant variety with desirable traits. In this project. seeds of a kenaf variety (V36) were used as starting materials for mutation induction and were obtained from National Kenaf and Tobacco Board (NKTB). These seeds were irradiated using gamma ray and mutation induced via acute and chronic irradiation methods. The aim of this research project was to develop new mutant varieties with high fibre characteristics. Radiosensitivity tests were done for determination of optimum dose for irradiation to get the higher mutation rate without eliminating desirable traits. Screening and selection for desirable traits will be done for several generations until stable mutants with targeted traits are obtained. At present. several potential mutants with desirable morphological and agronomical traits were observed in M 3-M 4 generations.

In Malaysia. kenaf is one of the potentially bio-energy crops as an industrial plant. One of the factors that determines the success of kenaf cultivation is the management of fertilizers and good nutrients. In determining the efficiency of fertilizer use especially nitrogen fertilizers and biological fertilizers. the most accurate and easy-to-use method is the 15 N isotope application. The 15 N isotope application is the direct measurement of nitrogen dynamics in soil and plant. When conducting an experiment using a 15 N isotizer. the 15 N isotrate utilization rate should be calculated accurately to avoid wastage. For the study of nitrogen fertilizer. the application method of 15 N is continuously used. while for biobalysis. the application of 15 N application is diluted. The experimental design should also be well designed according to the requirements of 15 N isotope application. Experimental designs can be of various sizes. depending on available field fields and experimental sources such as labor. machinery for fertilizer. irrigation. insecticide. pesticides. harvesting and costs. The use of microplots is very important in experiments involving the use of 15 N isotope. It aims to prevent plants on the plot to take nitrogen on the area in the 15 N plot and avoid nitrogen pollution from the yield plot area. Plant sampling needs to be done manually for experimental isotope experiments 15 N. Plants in the 15 N plot need to be harvested at the same time as the yield plot.(author),True,D_F87IgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:50025148,,,,,0,0,0

Several epigenetic pathways including DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in the silencing of TEs. and in the regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis thaliana. the TE-derived plant mobile domain (PMD) proteins have been involved in TE silencing. genome stability. and control of developmental processes. Using a forward genetic screen. we found that the PMD protein MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) acts synergistically and redundantly with DNA methylation to silence TEs. We found that MAIN and its close homolog MAIN-LIKE 1 (MAIL1) interact together. as well as with the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) PP7-like (PP7L). Remarkably. main. mail1. pp7l single and mail1 pp7l double mutants display similar developmental phenotypes. and share common subsets of upregulated TEs and misregulated genes. Finally. phylogenetic analyses of PMD and PP7-type PPP domains among the Eudicot lineage suggest neo-association processes between the two protein domains to potentially generate new protein function. We propose that. through this interaction. the PMD and PPP domains may constitute a functional protein module required for the proper expression of a common set of genes. and for silencing of TEs.,True,La1HTQ8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008324,3415800827810415322,/scholar?cites=3415800827810415322,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008324,0,0,0

1090911,Effect of riparian vegetation on the spatial distribution of slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus in southwestern Wisconsin streams,2012,Katri Helena Laukkanen,,,,,,The distribution of freshwater sculpin (Coitus spp.). are frequently associated with the quantity and quality ofmacroinvertebrate prey. which are often influenced by the presence of riparian vegetation. I hypothesized that open- canopies would increase primary and secondary production in riffles. and would result in greater densities of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) than in riffles underlying closed- canopies. The quantity of periphyton and macroinvertebrates. and the density and size-frequency distribution of slimy sculpin were monitored for three months in riffles with open- and closed- canopy in three streams in the Coon Creek watershed. Wisconsin. Sculpin densities were not significantly different between riffles with open- or closed- canopies. nor were there differences in periphyton and macroinvertebrate standing crop. However. the sizefrequency distribution of sculpin varied by canopy type; a larger proportion of juvenile and small-bodied sculpin were collected in riffles with open- canopies than in riffles with closed- canopies. Many juvenile sculpin were sampled from within macrophyte beds growing in open- canopy riffles. These results suggest that the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation may not influence the density of sculpins through enhancement of periphyton and subsequent increases in macroinvertebrate prey. but rather. may influence the size distribution of sculpin by increasing the growth of macrophytes. which serve as an important habitat for juvenile slimy sculpin.,True,LMwh-DMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/62271,13826625453458165689,/scholar?cites=13826625453458165689,,https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/62271/Laukkanen_Katri_Thesis.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

While commonly debated and often opposed. these are clearly successful as a method for treating obesity. hyperlipidemia and diabetes at least in the short to medium term. Therefore. this research was conducted to investigate the impact of ketogenic diet (KD) supplemented with oil of either grape seed or fish and virgin olive on diabetic rats. Forty eight male albino rats weighing 200 to 210 g. were assigned into two main groups. The first group (n= 8) was control negative group (-ve). the second main group (n= 40) were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ)[60 mg/kg bw] for induction of diabetes. then these rats were divided into five subgroups. Subgroup one was fed on the basal diet and served as a control positive group. while subgroup 2 was fed on KD only and subgroups from 3 to 5 were fed on KD supplemented with 4% oil of either grape seed or fish and virgin olive. respectively for 8 weeks. The results indicated that. STZ treated rats showed significant reduction (P≤ 0.05) in serum insulin concentration and increased glucose levels compared to normal rats. KD supplemented with oil of either grape seed or fish and virgin olive improved the biochemical changes due to diabetes. Furthermore. the intervention caused favorable changes in blood lipids and restored liver and kidney functions of the treated rats compared to the control positive group.

This ceramic mixture was prepared using paligorskiet as a Clay. Porcelanite as a Silica. and Limestone as a flux. Viger yeast was used as an additive to the raw materials. Physical properties of the produced CF were measured. The hydraulic conductivity of the produced was measured. The average hydraulic conductivity of the produced CF was 110 times that of commercial types of ceramic filters. The mineral composition of the produced ceramics was found by X-Ray tests. Tests results showed that all of the produced ceramics filters composed mainly of low Cristobalte and Tridoymite in addition to some of other minerals. The results showed that CF has excellent adsorption ability for solutes of four heavy metals. Cd. Co. Fe. and Zn. at concentrations of 1 mg/leach and 10 mg/l each. The adsorption capacities of each filter to adsorb four heavy metals were computed according to kinematic energy models. They were Langmuir model and Freundlich models.

Postmenopausal women have an increased risk of developing CVD due to decreased estrogen availability. which is accompanied by increased oxidative stress. Serum free thiols (R-SH) provide a robust and powerful read-out of systemic oxidative stress. In this study. we aimed to establish serum levels of free thiols and explore associations between free thiols and demographic. clinical. and biochemical parameters related to obesity and the risk for developing CVD in both pre-and postmenopausal women. Serum free thiols were measured in a cohort consisting of healthy pre-(n= 223) and postmenopausal (n= 118) Omani women. Postmenopausal women had significantly lower levels of serum free thiols as compared to premenopausal women (762.9±85.3 vs. 780±80.9 μM. age-adjusted p< 0.001). Women′ s age was positively associated with serum free thiol levels in premenopausal women (β= 0.36. p= 0.002). whereas an inverse association was observed in postmenopausal women (β=− 0.29. p= 0.002). Homocysteine levels were significantly inversely associated with serum free thiol levels in both pre-(β=− 0.19. p= 0.005) and postmenopausal (β=− 0.20. p= 0.032) women. independent from known cardiovascular risk factors. In this study. we show that postmenopausal women are affected by increased systemic oxidative stress. which independently associates with homocysteine levels.

1090939,The Social Behavior and Dynamics of Old Ring-tailed Lemurs  (Lemur catta) at the Duke Lemur Center,2017,Katie Marie McGuire,,,,,,Thesis directed by Professor Michelle L. Sauther There has been little emphasis within primatology on the social and behavioral strategies old primates might use to meet the challenges of senescence while maintaining social engagement. such as assuming a group role like navigator. Understanding how old primates maintain sociality can reveal how behavioral flexibility might have facilitated an increase in longevity within the order. Using focal sampling of old (N= 9. 10+ years) and adult (N= 6.< 10 years) Lemur catta at the Duke Lemur Center. activity budgets. social interactions. and group traveling information were recorded and compared from May to August of 2016. I found that both male and female old lemurs maintained sociality in the group. with older females being more social than adults. I failed to support the second hypothesis that older individuals would have a behavioral profile distinct from adults. Finally. I found preliminary support that older females help care for a daughter’s offspring in the form of carrying. These results indicate that social manifestations of age and senescence depend on a myriad of factors such as environment. life history. and individual personalities. This research also reveals the importance of decoupling ideas of chronological age. being an old individual. with senescence because somatic decline depends on these other factors besides age. Understanding these complex interactions is essential as we strive to define senescence and explore how age has shaped evolutionary trajectories among primates.,True,TcfSUAkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://scholar.colorado.edu/downloads/z603qx76b,1664559513241340376,/scholar?cites=1664559513241340376,,https://scholar.colorado.edu/downloads/z603qx76b,0,0,0

1090950,Assessing the allelopathy of invasive Robina pseudoacacia in northern Michigan forests,2017,Julie Carter and Cody Ladd and Kyle Lough and Fawnnie Pamenan and Grace Pernecky,,,,,,The rapid spread of invasive species. facilitated by increasing globalization. can have negative impacts on native ecosystems. Our study focuses on Robinia pseudoacacia. an invasive tree species native to the southern Appalachian and Ozark mountains that has spread to multiple continents (Li et al. 2014). Previous studies have suggested that one adaptation that makes R. pseudoacacia successful is the secretion of allelopathic chemicals. which can affect surrounding vegetation (Nasir et al.. 2005; Callaway et al.. 2011; Dreiss and Volin.. 2011; Benesperi et al..2012; Cierjacks et al.. 2013; Medina-Villar et al.. 2017). We looked at the effect of age and size of R. pseudoacacia on concentration of allelopathic chemicals. as well as how these chemicals might affect surrounding species composition. diversity. and richness. We hypothesize the following: 1. Robinia pseudoacacia significantly affects species composition. diversity and richness of surrounding vegetation. 2. The concentration of allelopathic compounds within Robinia pseudoacacia is correlated with the age of the tree. 3. The concentration of allelopathic compounds within Robinia pseudoacacia is correlated with the size of the tree. We compared species composition surrounding 20 R. pseudoacacia against 12 control species. Quercus rubra and Acer saccharum. We also tested tree cores to see if age and size of R. pseudoacacia affect the concentration of allelopathic chemicals. We found no significant difference in species composition. diversity. and richness. However. we did find that age and size were significantly positively correlated with allelopathic concentration.

1090955,The importance of studying about lifestyle: quantitative analysis of articles in the field of lifestyle,2013,Seyyed Mohammad Miri and Fatemeh Razaghi and Zahra Heidari,1,Islamic Lifestyle Centered on Health,2,13-6,,Background: The lifestyle from the point of sociology refers to the way a person lives to one’s own ability but basically and due to its importance with health and wellness means choosing the best method for improving health aspects in one person’s life. Lifestyle is discussed in different religious as well as several countries. Objectives: Due to the importance of studying about lifestyle as a way of person life we aimed to study the distribution of published articles in the field of Islamic lifestyle in different Middle Eastern countries and different religions using two major databases like ISI web of Sciences (WoS) and Pubmed.Materials and Methods: Using WoS and Pubmed during 1992 to 2011 with the keyword of “lifestyle”. the total number of published articles was obtained. Results: Among total of 1228 articles indexed in Pubmed and 378 in ISI the highest number of article were seen in 2010. There was a significant differentiation between total number of published articles in USA and Middle East countries while in Middle East countries Turkey and Iran have most published article in this field. Besides Christian and Muslims have more published articles in 2000-2011. Public Environmental Occupational Health has the most number of Lifestyle’s articles comparing with other fields. During recent two years more attention is absorbed toward Islamic lifestyle than Christianity. Conclusions: The tendency to study about lifestyle has been increased gradually during recent years especially about Islamic lifestyle which could be originated from its nature about covering different aspects of person life.,True,sIfOCrIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Razaghi/publication/263655834_The_Importance_of_Studying_About_Lifestyle_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Articles_in_the_Field_of_Lifestyle/links/571ce5b108ae408367be519d.pdf,17616073573441816460,/scholar?cites=17616073573441816460,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/F_Razaghi/publication/263655834_The_Importance_of_Studying_About_Lifestyle_Quantitative_Analysis_of_Articles_in_the_Field_of_Lifestyle/links/571ce5b108ae408367be519d.pdf,0,0,0

Their functional heterogeneity. however. represents a major challenge for their isolation and in developing potency and release assays to predict their functionality prior to transplantation. Additionally. potency. biomarker profiles and defining mechanisms of action in a particular clinical setting are increasing requirements of Regulatory Agencies for release of hBM MSCs as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products for cellular therapies. Since the healing of bone fractures depends on the coupling of new blood vessel formation with osteogenesis. we hypothesised that a correlation between the osteogenic and vascular supportive potential of individual hBM MSC-derived CFU-F (colony forming unit-fibroblastoid) clones might exist. We tested this by assessing the lineage (i.e. adipogenic (A). osteogenic (O) and/or chondrogenic (C)) potential of individual hBM MSC-derived CFU-F clones and determining if their osteogenic (O) potential correlated with their vascular supportive profile in vitro using lineage differentiation assays. endothelial-hBM MSC vascular co-culture assays and transcriptomic (RNAseq) analyses. Our results demonstrate that the majority of CFU-F (95%) possessed tri-lineage. bi-lineage or uni-lineage osteogenic capacity. with 64% of the CFU-F exhibiting tri-lineage AOC potential. We found a correlation between the osteogenic and vascular tubule supportive activity of CFU-F clones. with the strength of this association being donor dependent.

Potamogeton pectinatus. Najas marina (submerged plants). Phragmites australis. and Typha domingensis (emergent plants). The results indicate that cadmium. chromium. and iron concentrations in aquatic plants were above the World Health Organization (WHO). In contrast. zinc. copper. and lead were within the allowable limits. C. demersum and N. marina showed higher concentrations of heavy metal accumulation than the other aquatic plants. The concentration of heavy metals in plant tissues during the summer months was higher than in the different seasons. C. demersum and N. marina showed higher concentrations of heavy metal accumulation than the other aquatic plants.

Our objective was to follow the development of macrophytes over 3–4 decades in 24 new. shallow. eutrophic lakes in order to test the hypotheses that: (1) species richness reaches a maximum after some years and then declines; and (2) species composition changes substantially from small early colonisers to taller. competitive later colonisers. which causes ongoing high β‐diversity.

Insectivore birds and waders rapidly appear in newly established Danish lakes before dense populations of tall emergent plants on the shores and fish in the water become established and reduce their food availability. But what is the successional development of submerged plants? Broad-scale analyses show that plants species richness increases during the first 10 years in new Danish lakes and later declines when lakes grow older than about 20 years. Some species immigrate early. while other species immigrate late and are mainly restricted to natural lakes. Early immigrants tend to have smaller leaves. seeds and more vegetative propagules (short shoots and turions) than late immigrants. Early immigrants also tend to grow faster which should permit them to form a dense vegetation cover within few years.

Analysis of the 48 haplotypes detected within populations showed a clear phylogeographic structure strongly correlated with species’ geographical distribution.

Recent years. a number of ubiquitin-like proteins have been identified. however. their roles in eukaryotes are largely unknown. Here. we describe a ubiquitin-like protein URM1. and found it plays important roles in development and infection process of the rice blast fungus. Magnaporthe oryzae. Targeted deletion of URM1 in M. oryzae resulted in slight reduction in vegetative growth and significant decrease in conidiation. More importantly. the Δurm1 mutant also showed evident reduction in virulence to host plants. Infection process observation demonstrated that the mutant was arrested in invasive growth. and resulted in accumulation of massive host reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further. we found the Δurm1 mutant was sensitive to the cell wall disturbing reagents. thiol oxidizing agent diamide and rapamycin. We also showed that URM1-mediated modification was responsive to oxidative stresses. and the thioredoxin peroxidase Ahp1 was one of the important urmylation targets. These results suggested that URM1-mediated urmylation plays important roles in detoxification of host oxidative stress to facilitate invasive growth in M. oryzae.,True,LuFh6wQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02039/full,7610058624050545,/scholar?cites=7610058624050545,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02039/full,0,0,0

1090999,Simultaneous mapping of molecular proximity and comobility reveals agonist-enhanced dimerization and DNA binding of nuclear receptors,2019,Bálint Rehó and Lukas Lau and Gábor Mocsár and Gabriele Müller and Lina Fadel and Péter Brázda and László Nagy and Katalin Tóth and György Vámosi,92,Analytical chemistry,2,2207-2215,American Chemical Society,Single Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) revolutionized time lapse imaging of live cells and organisms due to its high speed and reduced photodamage. Quantitative mapping of molecular (co)mobility by fluorescence (cross-)correlation spectroscopy (F(C)CS) in a SPIM has been introduced to reveal molecular diffusion and binding. A complementary aspect of interactions is proximity. which can be studied by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Here. we extend SPIM-FCCS by alternating laser excitation. which reduces false positive cross-correlation and facilitates comapping of FRET. Thus. different aspects of interacting systems can be studied simultaneously. and molecular subpopulations can be discriminated by multiparameter analysis.

Given a potentially limiting/sequestered pool of RXR and simultaneous expression of several RXR partners. we hypothesized that NRs compete for binding to RXR and that this competition is directed by specific agonist treatment. Here. we tested this hypothesis on three NRs: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). vitamin D receptor (VDR). and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα). The evaluation of competition relied on a nuclear translocation assay applied in a three-color imaging model system by detecting changes in heterodimerization between RXRα and one of its partners (NR1) in the presence of another competing partner (NR2). Our results indicated dynamic competition between the NRs governed by two …,True,FwOIhBwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817489435,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817489435,0,0,0

Ghallab EH and Shehata M and Zekri AN,,Nanotechnology,,,IOP Publishing,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Recent identification of AD biomarkers has led to the diagnosis of AD before the onset of dementia. It has been shown that Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable model for studying human neurodegeneration. including AD. According to its properties. curcumin shows promising potential for the diagnosis of AD. In order to improve its use. new formulations. including nanotechnology-based delivery systems. have been applied. The current study aims to diagnose AD by detecting the accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide via carbon-dot–curcumin nanoparticle conjugation in Drosophila. The accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide has been detected via the conjugate using the fluorescence imaging technique. These results suggest that carbon-dot–curcumin nanoparticle conjugation could be used as a diagnostic tool for AD.,True,gi57DBQAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,1,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/ab7535/meta,714573341628851972,/scholar?cites=714573341628851972,,,0,0,0

Memory dysfunction stems in part from reduced gene expression that leads to decreased levels of proteins essential for neural plasticity. Gene expression is facilitated by histone acetylation. an epigenetic mechanism that regulates chromatin accessibility. Compounds that maintain histone acetylation. called histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). enhance memory by preventing deacetylation of core histone proteins. which allows for transcriptional machinery to bind open chromatin and increase gene expression. Although HDACi are promising therapeutics that could be used to prevent or delay memory loss associated with AD and other dementias. existing HDACi have poor solubility and undesirable toxicity. To address these shortcomings. our group has …,True,nB95v0UAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.047677,,,,,0,0,0

1091032,Off-Target Effects of FDA-Approved Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors on Mature Lymphocyte populations,2018,Samer Alanani,,,,,,Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a fundamental role in tumor development and growth. Because of this. drugs that affect gene expression such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been developed and used as an adjunct treatment to other standard anti-cancer drugs. Currently. three FDA-approved HDACi have shown promise in the treatment of specific lymphoid cancers by reducing tumor cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. However. a significant downside to using HDACi is their lack of cell specificity as they can affect both tumor and normal cells. Furthermore. the approved HDACi affect both nuclear and cytoplasmic HDACs and thus can alter cytoplasmic protein acetylation and function in addition to gene expression. We hypothesized that treatment with these non-specific HDACi will result in increased normal lymphocyte death. To identify off-target effects. normal mature leukocyte populations harvested from wild-type mice were treated with different doses of two FDA-approved HDAC inhibitors.

After 24 or 48 hours of treatment. the cells were labeled with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry to identify T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte subsets. and myeloid cells.

Hatch and Schultz [1] hold the view that organizational identity is an ongoing process that behaves like a conversation between the organizational self (as expressed by its culture) and images held by key stakeholders. This perspective is an extension by analogy of Meadâ€™ s social identity theory [2] in which he posits that individual identity is born of a conversation between the â€ œIâ€ and the â€ œmeâ€. Processes linking organizational identity are positioned with respect to recent concerns about the effects of increased levels of organizational transparency. Issues of concern that were ascertained via this research are the following:(1) Learning outcomes set by the Professor are mostly manifested/observed in the Graduate Class (2) Some prerequisite research skills are weakly manifested/observed in the Graduate Class. Â Hence. using Argyrisâ€™ scientific feedback loop models for evaluation [3]. it is recommended that a double-feedback loop be implemented as it allows identification and modification of weak organizational practices.

We hypothesized that FF and FF-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be conveyors of signals capable of inducing functionally-relevant transcriptional responses in oviductal cells. The aim of this study was. therefore. to evaluate the effect of FF and FF-derived EVs on the transcriptome of primary bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOECs). We examined the gene expression of BOECs in three conditions: BOECs cultured with FF. FF-derived EVs. and without supplementations. For each condition. cells were cultured for 6 and 24 h. RNA sequencing results revealed that FF had a stronger effect on BOECs gene expression compared to EVs. We detected 488 and 1998 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with FF treatment in 6 and 24 h. respectively. whereas only 41 DEGs were detected at 6 h following EV treatment. Pathway analysis of the FF-induced DEGs showed that several pathways were highly enriched. notably oxidative phosphorylation. thermogenesis. arachidonic acid metabolism. and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Some of these pathways have a role in sperm survival. fertilization. and early embryo development. In conclusion. the findings of our study demonstrate for the first time that bovine FF and FF-derived EVs can induce changes in the gene expression of the bovine oviductal cells which. although observed in vitro. may be reflective of in vivo responses which may contribute to a favorable periconceptional microenvironment for sperm survival …,True,7JFjxYAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/782124,3400156001772385697,/scholar?cites=3400156001772385697,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/15/5365/pdf,0,0,0

Indeed. some of the changes induced by spermatozoa may have a direct functional importance in the pre-conceptional period. Although the mechanisms underlying these sperm-maternal interactions are not well characterized. it is possible that they could involve ligands that are released from the spermatozoa. This study therefore aimed to test whether physical contact between bovine spermatozoa and bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOECs) is a prerequisite for spermatozoa-induced gene expression changes. We used two co-culture models: a contact co-culture model in which spermatozoa interact directly with BOECs. and a non-contact co-culture model in which an insert with the pore size of 0.4 μm was placed between spermatozoa and BOECs.

The origin and functions of such RNAs in human ovarian follicle. the environment of oocyte maturation. are unclear. The current study investigates the difference in the microRNA profiles of fertile women and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients in three compartments from the same preovulatory follicle: mural granulosa cells (MGC). cell-free follicular fluid (FF). and extracellular vesicles (EV) of the FF by small RNA sequencing. In silico analysis was used for the prediction and over-representation of targeted pathways for the detected microRNAs. PCOS follicles were distinguished from normal tissue by the differential expression of 30 microRNAs in MGC and 10 microRNAs in FF (FDR< 0.1) that commonly regulate cytokine signaling pathways. The concentration of EV-s was higher in the FF of PCOS patients (p= 0.04) containing eight differentially expressed microRNAs (p< 0.05). In addition. we present the microRNA profiles of MGC. FF. and EV in the fertile follicle and demonstrate that microRNAs loaded into EVs target mRNAs of distinct signaling pathways in comparison to microRNAs in FF.

To capture interactions between a species and its environment. in this work the demographic traits of the European ground squirrel (EGS).

The habitat suitability index was determined for 20 localities within the study area based on habitat use. management and type. After mapping the habitat patch occupancy in the field. crop cover maps. the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and automated water extraction index (AWEI) were obtained from satellite images covering the period 2013-2015. This data was used to develop population-level generalized linear models (GLMs) and individual-level conditional mixed-effects models (GLMMs) in R package Ime4. focusing on the key demographic traits of the EGS. The land composition and patch carrying capacity (PCC) are the key determinants of the endangered EGS population size. while system productivity is the main factor influencing individuals’ body condition after monitoring for variations across sampling years and age classes. The proposed landscape structural models show that human activities and abiotic factors shape the demographic rates of the EGS.

We hypothesized that FF and FF-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be conveyors of signals capable of inducing functionally-relevant transcriptional responses in oviductal cells. The aim of this study was. therefore. to evaluate the effect of FF and FF-derived EVs on the transcriptome of primary bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOECs). We examined the gene expression of BOECs in three conditions: BOECs cultured with FF. FF-derived EVs. and without supplementations. For each condition. cells were cultured for 6 and 24 h. RNA sequencing results revealed that FF had a stronger effect on BOECs gene expression compared to EVs. We detected 488 and 1998 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with FF treatment in 6 and 24 h. respectively. whereas only 41 DEGs were detected at 6 h following EV treatment. Pathway analysis of the FF-induced DEGs showed that several pathways were highly enriched. notably oxidative phosphorylation. thermogenesis. arachidonic acid metabolism. and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Some of these pathways have a role in sperm survival. fertilization. and early embryo development. In conclusion. the findings of our study demonstrate for the first time that bovine FF and FF-derived EVs can induce changes in the gene expression of the bovine oviductal cells which. although observed in vitro. may be reflective of in vivo responses which may contribute to a favorable periconceptional microenvironment for sperm survival …,True,acI778UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://www.mdpi.com/782124,3400156001772385697,/scholar?cites=3400156001772385697,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/15/5365/pdf,0,0,0

Indeed. some of the changes induced by spermatozoa may have a direct functional importance in the pre-conceptional period. Although the mechanisms underlying these sperm-maternal interactions are not well characterized. it is possible that they could involve ligands that are released from the spermatozoa. This study therefore aimed to test whether physical contact between bovine spermatozoa and bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOECs) is a prerequisite for spermatozoa-induced gene expression changes.

1091077,Internal Fertilization,2020,Qurat Ul Ain Reshi,,,,,,Internal fertilization is the process in which fusion of male and female gametes occur inside the body of females. Internal fertilization is most common in land-based terrestrial animals. but few aquatic animals also employ this mode of fertilization. Fertilization refers to the amalgamation of haploid male and female gametes (sperm and oocyte) in a series of well-coordinated molecular events. which eventually leads to the formation of diploid zygote. Fertilization leads to the merging of genetic material within the species. which results in genetic variation in the organisms. In sexual reproduction. two modes of fertilization have been noted in animals–internal fertilization and external fertilization. In internal fertilization. the amphimixis (fusion of male and female gametes) process occurs within the body of females. and the zygote starts developing inside the mother’s body. Under external fertilization. the union of eggs and spermatozoa occurs outside the female body in a medium like water where the concerned animals reside. In this entry. we will be discussing internal fertilization in more detail. Internal fertilization which is often seen in land animals has three types:1. Oviparity: The fertilized eggs are laid outside the female’s body and develop there; yolk part of the egg serves as the source of nourishment. 2. Ovoviparity: The fertilized eggs are retained in the female. and the embryo fulfills its nourishment requirement from the egg yolk. 3. Viviparity: The embryo formed develops within the female and receives its nourishment from the mother’s blood through a placenta.,True,acI778UAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qurat_Reshi/publication/344153221_I_Internal_Fertilization/links/5f55ff5992851c250b99767a/I-Internal-Fertilization.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qurat_Reshi/publication/344153221_I_Internal_Fertilization/links/5f55ff5992851c250b99767a/I-Internal-Fertilization.pdf,0,0,0

This study includes 42 control subjects (Group I). and 92 Iraqi patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The patient group was subdivided into two groups: Group II (54) with T2DM only and Group III (38) with T2DM and dyslipidemia (who were treating with atorvastatin along with diabetes treatment). The samples were obtained to measure arginase activity and NO levels. Serum arginase activity increased significantly in patients (groupII and groupIII) compared to control group. While serum NO level was significantly lower in diabetic patients as compared to control group. three significant correlations appeared in this study between glucose and arginase activity. glucose and NO levels. and between arginase activity and NO levels. The results also show that treatment with atorvastatin affects arginase activity and NO levels. Increasing in levels of arginase activity can be considered as an indicator of diabetic status.

The study included fifty patients scheduled for elective major lower abdominal surgery. the serum levels of T3. T4 and TSH were determined one day preoperatively. intraoperative. one day postoperatively. two days postoperatively. and rT3 was determined one day preoperatively. and one day postoperatively. We observed that the levels of (T3. T4.

Threatened by habitat loss. human-interactions and illegal trafficking. there are only approximately 7.100 individuals remaining in the wild. Cheetahs used to roam large parts of Africa. and Western and Southern Asia. Today they are confined to about 9% of their original distribution. To investigate their genetic diversity and conservation status. we generated genome-wide data from historical and modern samples of all four currently recognized subspecies. along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) data. We found clear genetic differentiation between the subspecies. thus refuting earlier assumptions that cheetahs show only little population differentiation. Our genome-wide nuclear data indicate that cheetahs from East Africa may be more closely related to A. j. soemmeringii than they are to A. j. jubatus. This supports the need for further research on the classification of cheetah subspecies. as East African cheetahs are currently included in the Southern Africa subspecies. A. j. jubatus. We detected stronger inbreeding in individuals of the Critically Endangered A. j. venaticus (Iran) and A. j. hecki (Northwest Africa). and show that overall genome-wide heterozygosity in cheetah is lower than that reported for other threatened and endangered felids. such as tigers and lions. Furthermore. we show that MHC class II diversity in cheetahs is generally higher than previously reported. but still lower than in other felids.

Apesar dos altos índices de produção. a produtividade da cultura é reduzida devido a ocorrência de pragas e doenças. Entre as principais doenças. as podridões pós-colheita destacam-se pelas perdas mais elevadas em relação as ocorridas no campo. pois além dos custos de produção. são adicionadas despesas de colheita. classificação. embalagem. transporte. armazenamento e comercialização. A podridão olho de boi é uma doença pós-colheita causada por um complexo de espécies do gênero Neofabraea. sendo que a ocorrência de cada táxon varia de acordo com a região geográfica. Por exemplo. N. alba é a única espécie relatada no Chile enquanto que N. alba. N. kienholzii e N. perennans já foram registradas na Polônia.

While the majority of clinically available antibiotics were discovered from terrestrial Streptomyces. related species from marine sediments as a source of antibiotics remain underexplored. Here. we utilized culture-dependent isolation of thirty-five marine sediment-derived actinobacterial isolates followed by a screening of their antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant S. aureus ATCC BAA-44. Our results revealed that the crude extract of Streptomyces griseorubens strain DSD069 isolated from marine sediments collected in Romblon. Philippines displays the highest antibacterial activity. with 96.4% growth inhibition. The S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 cells treated with crude extract of Streptomyces griseorubens strain DSD069 showed cell membrane damage as demonstrated by a) leakage and loss of vital cell constituents. including DNA and proteins. b) irregular shrinkage of cells. and c) increase membrane permeability.

The aim of the study was to analyse the effects of these two entirely different farming systems on the soil quality. microbial population. agronomical parameters and productivity of the crop and quality of the food grain produced. The study used a holistic approach to study the interplay between these factors. It was found that the soil physico-chemical properties of the organic plot were far better than the conventional plot. DGGE analysis did not show any remarkable difference between the two systems in terms of bacterial diversity. Nevertheless. the relative abundances of the Operational Taxonomic Units showed temporal variations. 16S rDNA quantification revealed more microbial load in the conventional soil at all the stages of cultivation. The diazotrophic abundance estimated using nifH copy number showed that the number of diazotrophs increased in the conventional soil while in the organic soil there was a decrease in the number of diazotrophs during the course of cultivation. The agronomical parameters of chickpea plant increased under organic cultivation. Moreover. the grain yield of the crop was more under organic cultivation (1345.5 kg ha-1) as compared to conventional cultivation (896.5 kg ha-1).

This study was carried out to consider sampling methods for macrofungi exploration especially in Turgo tropical forest ecosystem. There were two sampling method models which adequately bring our macrofungi collection to have valid data. The first is adaptive sampling which includes fixed-size plots where prior we decided how many tracks. plots. or what size to examine at each site to help keeping our focus on track. By having a fixed plot. we allowed ourselves to find our macrofungi and work on the identification process thoroughly without racing against the time as much. Then we can obtain frequency. distribution. density and others ecological quantitative data by sampling plots. Another way. we can choose opportunistic sampling. we mean carefully walking on through chosen site as study area and collecting conspicuous sporocarp of macrofungi.

Slovakia,Nanoparticles are used in wide range of applications given their unique optical. chemical and electronic properties. Microbial biosynthesis of nanoparticles has offered a milder and eco-friendly alternative to physical and chemical methods of synthesis. One potential use of nanoparticles is for the inhibition of quorum sensing-mediated processes by microorganisms during pathogenic colonization and infection. In this study. bacteria from hyperalkaline spring (pH 11) were isolated using various enrichment media. The isolates. phylogenetically related to Lysinibacillus sp. and Pseudomonas stutzeri. were investigated for their ability to biosynthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) at pH 9. Extracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption analysis which showed a peak at 500-600 nm wavelength range corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs. The AuNPs synthesized were of spherical and irregular shapes as revealed by SEM analysis. The presence of elemental gold was further confirmed by EDX analysis. FTIR results showed that various functional groups are possibly involved in the reduction of HAuCl4 and stabilization of synthesized gold nanoparticles. The inhibitory effect of biosynthesized AuNPs was tested on the growth and pyocyanin production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 during a 72-hour incubation period. Although the biosynthesized AuNPs showed no toxicity to the test organism. an increasing inhibition level of pyocyanin production was observed with increasing volumes of nanoparticles used. The levels of pyocyanin in setups treated with …,True,wFBa4K0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.jmbfs.org/issue/october-november-2018-vol-8-no-2/jmbfs_301_sandiego/?issue_id=4902&article_id=5,11642865868693518192,/scholar?cites=11642865868693518192,,https://www.jmbfs.org/issue/october-november-2018-vol-8-no-2/jmbfs_301_sandiego/?issue_id=4902&article_id=5,0,0,0

Two ABCG2 gene subfamily members have been identified in birds. A detailed comparative study of the ABCG2 and ABCG2-like genes aid our understanding of their evolutionary history at the molecular level and provide a theoretical reference for studying the specific functions of ABCG2 and ABCG2-like genes in birds. We first identified 77 ABCG2/ABCG2-like gene sequences in the genomes of 41 birds. Further analysis showed that both the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of ABCG2 and ABCG2-like genes were highly conserved and exhibited high homology in birds. However. significant differences in the N-terminal structure were found between the ABCG2 and ABCG2-like amino acid sequences. A selective pressure analysis showed that the ABCG2 and ABCG2-like genes were affected by purifying selection during the process of bird evolution. We believe that multiple members of the ABCG2 gene subfamily exist on chromosome 4 in the ancestors of birds. Over the long course of evolution. only the ABCG2 gene was retained on chromosome 4 in birds. The ABCG2-like gene on chromosome 6 might have originated from chromosome replication or fusion. The structural differences between the N terminus of ABCG2 protein and those of ABCG2-like proteins might lead to functional differences between the corresponding genes.,True,WlxMYzUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-020-01654-z,,,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-020-01654-z,0,0,0

Birds also retain this trait. Recently. Inaba et al.(2019) found that ASIP (agouti signal protein) regulated interconversion between different melanocyte types leads to dorsal stripe pattern. which may partly explain the birds’ dorsoventral plumage color difference. In this study. we used the embryo samples of LBM (light brown mottling) ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) with white ventral and dark dorsal body parts to investigate the mechanism of dorsoventral color variation. Firstly. melanin deposition process of duck embryos was investigated. The result indicated that E13 and E16 were the active stages of melanin synthesis.
