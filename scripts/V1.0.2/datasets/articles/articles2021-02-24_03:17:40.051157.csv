Disentangling the different processes involved in community assembly is not only interesting in itself but also crucial for an understanding of how communities will behave under future environmental scenarios. The traditional concept of assembly rules reflects the notion that species do not co‐occur randomly but are restricted in their co‐occurrence by interspecific competition. This concept can be redefined in a more general framework where the co‐occurrence of species is a product of chance. historical patterns of speciation and migration. dispersal. abiotic environmental factors. and biotic interactions. with none of these processes being mutually exclusive.Here we present a survey and meta‐analyses of 59 papers that compare observed patterns in plant communities with …,True,C3XY2KIAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,669,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00187.x,14696437443460687051,/scholar?cites=14696437443460687051,,https://is.muni.cz/el/1431/podzim2017/Bi6340/um/Clanky_Pojeti_sp/Gotzenberger_etal2011_Biol-Rev.pdf,0,0,0

1094501,Quantifying and interpreting functional diversity of natural communities: practical considerations matter,2006,Jan Leps and Francescode Bello and Sandra Lavorel and Sandra Berman,78,Á Preslia,,,,"Quantifying the functional diversity in ecological communities is very promising for both studying the response of diversity to environmental gradients and the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (i.e. in ""biodiversity experiments""). In our view. the Rao coefficient is a good candidate for an efficient functional diversity index. It is. in fact. a generalization of the Simpson's index of diversity and it can be used with various measures of dissimilarity between species (both those based on a single trait and those based on several traits). However. when intending to quantify the functional diversity. we have to make various methodological decisions such as how many and which traits to use. how to weight them. how to combine traits that are measured at different scales and how to quantify the species' relative abundances in a community. Here we discuss these issues with examples from real plant communities and argue that diversity within a single trait is often the most ecologically relevant information. When using indices based on many traits. we plead for careful a priori selection of ecologically relevant traits. although other options are also feasible. When combining many traits. often with different scales. methods considering the extent of species overlap in trait space can be applied for both the qualitative and quantitative traits. Another possibility proposed here is to decompose the variability of a trait in a community according to the relative effect of among- and within-species differentiation (with the latter not considered by current indices of functional diversity). in a way analogical to decomposition of Sum of squares in ANOVA.

Aggregated trait averages (i.e. averages of trait values of constituent species. weighted by species proportions) are popular indices reflecting the functional characteristics of locally dominant species. Because the variation of these indices along environmental gradients can be caused by both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability. it is necessary to disentangle the role of both components to community variability. For quantitative traits. trait averages can be calculated from ‘fixed’ trait values (i.e. a single mean trait value for individual species used for all habitats where the species is found) or trait values for individual species specific to each plot. or habitat. where the species is found.

However. few attempts have been made to influence the course of succession thereby testing the hypothesis that passing through one stage is essential before entering the next one. At each stage of succession ecosystem processes may be affected by the diversity of species present. but there is little empirical evidence showing that plant species diversity may affect succession. On ex-arable land. a major constraint of vegetation succession is the dominance of perennial early-successional (arable weed) species. Our aim was to change the initial vegetation succession by the direct sowing of later-successional plant species.

Despite a wealth of phylogenetic work on individual clades and a deep knowledge of particular cultivated species such as tomato and potato. a robust evolutionary framework with a dated molecular phylogeny for the family is still lacking. Here we investigate molecular divergence times for Solanaceae using a densely-sampled species-level phylogeny. We also review the fossil record of the family to derive robust calibration points. and estimate a chronogram using an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock. Our densely-sampled phylogeny shows strong support for all previously identified clades of Solanaceae and strongly supported relationships between the major clades. particularly within Solanum. The Tomato clade is shown to be sister to section Petota. and the Regmandra clade is the first branching member of the Potato clade.

Several of these are cultivated for their fruits. such as the tomato. the pepper and the aubergine. The family is very diverse in fruit type with capsules. drupes. pyrenes. berries. and several sorts of dehiscent non‐capsular fruits occurring in the 90+ genera. In this paper. recent work on fruit type evolution in angiosperms is reviewed in relation to dispersal agents and habitat ecology. Defining fruit types in the Solanaceae in a simple five state system. then mapping them onto a previously published molecular phylogeny based on chloroplast DNA allows discussion of the evolution of these fruit types in a phylogenetic framework. Capsules are plesiomorphic in the family. and although berries are a synapomorphy (shared derived character) for a large clade including the genus Solanum (tomatoes and aubergines). they have arisen several times in the …,True,yHApU78AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,315,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/53/377/2001/497225,3502518252651536183,/scholar?cites=3502518252651536183,,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/53/377/2001/497225,0,0,0

Poaceae. In phylogenetic analyses. Bambusoideae. Pooideae and Ehrhartoideae formed the BEP clade. yet the internal relationships of this clade are controversial. The distinctive life history (infrequent flowering and predominance of asexual reproduction) of woody bamboos makes them an interesting but taxonomically difficult group. Phylogenetic analyses based on large DNA fragments could only provide a moderate resolution of woody bamboo relationships. although a robust phylogenetic tree is needed to elucidate their evolutionary history. Phylogenomics is an alternative choice for resolving difficult phylogenies.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present the complete nucleotide sequences of six woody bamboo chloroplast (cp) genomes using Illumina sequencing. These genomes are similar to those of other grasses and rather conservative in evolution. We constructed a phylogeny of Poaceae from 24 complete cp genomes including 21 grass species. Within the BEP clade. we found strong support for a sister relationship between Bambusoideae and Pooideae. In a substantial improvement over prior studies. all six nodes within Bambusoideae were supported with ≥0.95 posterior probability from Bayesian inference and 5/6 nodes resolved with 100% bootstrap support in maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses. We found that repeats in the cp genome could provide phylogenetic information. while caution is needed when using indels in phylogenetic analyses based on few selected genes.

We present a well-resolved phylogeny of the main lineages of basidiomycetes which suggests that the Sebacinaceae is the most basal group with known mycorrhizal members.

The axenically cultivable root endophyte Piriformospora indica is a model organism of this fungal order. It is able to increase biomass and grain yield of crop plants. In barley. the endophyte induces local and systemic resistance to fungal diseases and to abiotic stress. To elucidate the lifestyle of P. indica. we analyzed its symbiotic interaction and endophytic development in barley roots. We found that fungal colonization increases with root tissue maturation.

Recently a few members of this fungal order not fitting this definition and commonly referred to as ‘endophytes’ have raised considerable interest by their ability to enhance plant growth and to increase resistance of their host plants against abiotic stress factors and fungal pathogens. Using DNA-based detection and electron microscopy. we show that Sebacinales are not only extremely versatile in their mycorrhizal associations. but are also almost universally present as symptomless endophytes. They occurred in field specimens of bryophytes. pteridophytes and all families of herbaceous angiosperms we investigated. including liverworts. wheat. maize. and the non-mycorrhizal model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. They were present in all habitats we studied on four continents. We even detected these fungi in herbarium specimens originating from pioneering field trips to North Africa in the 1830s/40s. No geographical or host patterns were detected. Our data suggest that the multitude of mycorrhizal interactions in Sebacinales may have arisen from an ancestral endophytic habit by specialization.

Even though these organisms have been studied for more than 100 y. their effective use in the field remains elusive. Recently. however. it has been discovered that many of these entomopathogenic fungi play additional roles in nature. They are endophytes. antagonists of plant pathogens. associates with the rhizosphere. and possibly even plant growth promoting agents. These findings indicate that the ecological role of these fungi in the environment is not fully understood and limits our ability to employ them successfully for pest management. In this paper. we review the recently discovered roles played by many entomopathogenic fungi and propose new research strategies focused on alternate uses for these fungi.

1094616,Phylogenetic distribution of fungal sterols,2010,John D Weete and Maritza Abril and Meredith Blackwell,5,PloS one,5,e10899,Public Library of Science,Background Ergosterol has been considered the “fungal sterol” for almost 125 years; however. additional sterol data superimposed on a recent molecular phylogeny of kingdom Fungi reveals a different and more complex situation.  Methodology/Principal Findings The interpretation of sterol distribution data in a modern phylogenetic context indicates that there is a clear trend from cholesterol and other Δ5 sterols in the earliest diverging fungal species to ergosterol in later diverging fungi. There are. however. deviations from this pattern in certain clades. Sterols of the diverse zoosporic and zygosporic forms exhibit structural diversity with cholesterol and 24-ethyl -Δ5 sterols in zoosporic taxa. and 24-methyl sterols in zygosporic fungi. For example. each of the three monophyletic lineages of zygosporic fungi has distinctive major sterols. ergosterol in Mucorales. 22-dihydroergosterol in Dimargaritales. Harpellales. and Kickxellales (DHK clade). and 24-methyl cholesterol in Entomophthorales. Other departures from ergosterol as the dominant sterol include: 24-ethyl cholesterol in Glomeromycota. 24-ethyl cholest-7-enol and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7.24(28)-dienol in rust fungi. brassicasterol in Taphrinales and hypogeous pezizalean species. and cholesterol in Pneumocystis.  Conclusions/Significance Five dominant end products of sterol biosynthesis (cholesterol. ergosterol. 24-methyl cholesterol. 24-ethyl cholesterol. brassicasterol). and intermediates in the formation of 24-ethyl cholesterol. are major sterols in 175 species of Fungi.

Although media accounts often evoke abortion stigma as a universal social fact. we suggest that the social production of abortion stigma is profoundly local. Abortion stigma is neither natural nor ‘essential’ and relies upon power disparities and inequalities for its formation.

Dichogamy,1986,David G Lloyd and CJ Webb,24,New Zealand journal of botany,1,135-162,Taylor & Francis Group,Dichogamy is the separation of the presentation of pollen and stigmas in time within a plant. It is a common but neglected feature of outcrossing angiosperms. Dichogamy has been almost universally interpreted as an outcrossing mechanism. but many dichogamous species are also self-incompatible (and sometimes also herkogamous and/or with unisexual flowers). In outcrossing species. there is almost invariably a clash between selection to place pollen and stigmas in similar positions for effective pollination and selection to keep the androecia and gynoecia apart to avoid interference between them. We suggest that the separation of pollen and stigmas acts in general to reduce this self-interference and it often also reduces self-fertilisation.

The serial adjustment hypothesis has three parts: A. The amount of maternal expenditure is regulated at many developmental units. particularly single flowers and fruit. at three principal sequential stages–the determination of flowers. the development of ovaries and the maturation of fruit. B. At each stage. the initiation or continuation of an investment requires an amount of available resources above a certain threshold. Hence maternal expenditure is continually adjusted to the resources available at each developmental site. C. The pattern of controls that maximizes the maternal fitness of a plant is selected.

At the evolutionarily stable strategy. the proportional gain in the success of an offspring from an increment in the investment in the offspring equals the proportional loss in offspring numbers. A parallel marginal-value theorem applies to discontinuous variation in the amount of care. When selection acts directly on offspring size rather than on number. the evolutionarily stable level of care depends only on the fitness curve relating the fitness of single offspring to the amount of resources received.

The importance local people accorded to each species was compared to the number of its uses. number of people using it. and other aspects of its use.

Here we use molecular phylogenetics and precise dating of two island species within the same clade as the continental taxa to show recent speciation in a species-rich genus characteristic of the Cape flora. The results indicate that diversification began approximately 7–8 Myr ago. coincident with extensive aridification caused by changes in ocean currents. The recent origin of endemic species diversity in the Cape flora shows that large …,True,e1DB5FgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,269,https://www.nature.com/articles/35084067?ref=%C4%B0lkSexShop.Com,3327498936614467793,/scholar?cites=3327498936614467793,,,0,0,0
1094668,Bird-pollinated flowers in an evolutionary and molecular context,2008,Quentin Cronk and Isidro Ojeda,59,,4,715-727,Oxford University Press,Evolutionary shifts to bird pollination (ornithophily) have occurred independently in many lineages of flowering plants. This shift affects many floral features. particularly those responsible for the attraction of birds. deterrence of illegitimate flower visitors (particularly bees). protection from vigorous foraging by birds. and accurate placement of pollen on bird's bodies. Red coloration appears to play a major role in both bee-deterrence and bird-attraction. Other mechanisms of bird-attraction include the production of abundant dilute nectar and the provision of secondary perches (for non-hovering birds). As a result of selection for similar phenotypic traits in unrelated bird-pollinated species. a floral syndrome of ornithophily can be recognized. and this review surveys the component floral traits. The strong convergent evolution evident in bird-pollinated flowers raises a question about the nature of the genetic …,True,e1DB5FgAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,259,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/59/4/715/643663,2200687418272448667,/scholar?cites=2200687418272448667,,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/59/4/715/643663,0,0,0

The physiology of bryophytes differs in major respects from that of vascular plants by virtue of their smaller size; unlike vascular plants. the leafy shoots of bryophytes equilibrate rapidly with the water potential in their surroundings and tend to be either fully hydrated or desiccated and metabolically inactive. The time required to recover from desiccation increases and degree of recovery decreases with length of desiccation; both also depend upon temperature and intensity of desiccation.

We postulate that desiccation tolerance is a primitive trait. thus mechanisms by which the first land plants achieved tolerance may be reflected in how extant desiccation-tolerant bryophytes survive drying. Evidence is consistent with extant bryophytes employing a tolerance strategy of constitutive cellular protection coupled with induction of a recovery/repair mechanism upon rehydration. Cellular structures appear intact in the desiccated state but are disrupted by rapid uptake of water upon rehydration. but cellular integrity is rapidly regained. The photosynthetic machinery appears to be protected such that photosynthetic activity recovers quickly. Gene expression responds following rehydration and not during drying.

Several such concepts have been called the Phylogenetic Species Concept. thus leading to considerable confusion in the literature. We support one version of the Phylogenetic Species Concept. one that. we will argue. can serve as a synthesis of all versions. but for historical clarity we will distinguish among different versions. their origins. and motivations (see also discussion by Baum 1992). Hennig himself apparently held a view on species close to the Biological Species Concept. He deﬁned species as “a complex of spatially distributed reproductive com—munities”(1966247). He made an important distinction between tokogenetic relationships (ones that obtain between an “individual and its descendants and predecessors of the ﬁrst degree” 1966: 65) and phylogenetic relationships (ones that obtain between different lineages.“each bounded by two cleavage processes in the sequence of indi-viduals that are connected by tokogenetic relations” 1966: 20). In other words. tokogenetic relationships are diachronic. ancestor—descendant connections. whereas phy-logenetic relationships are synchronic. sister-group connections. Hennig’s approach. although sound in many respects. errs in our opinion by pos—tulating that there is one single breaking point at which reticulating tokogenetic relationship ends and divergent phylogenetic relationship begins.

Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however. genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses.

These sequences could offer a new forensic tool in plant and animal conservation—especially for endangered species such as members of the Cycadales. Ideally. barcodes could be used to positively identify illegally obtained material even in cases where diagnostic features have been purposefully removed or to release confiscated organisms into the proper breeding population. In order to be useful. a DNA barcode sequence must not only easily PCR amplify with universal or near-universal reaction conditions and primers. but also contain enough variation to generate unique identifiers at either the species or population levels. Chloroplast regions suggested by the Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBoL). and two alternatives. the chloroplast psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS). were tested for their utility in generating unique identifiers for members of the Cycadales. Ease of amplification and sequence generation with universal primers and reaction conditions was determined for each of the seven proposed markers. While none of the proposed markers provided unique identifiers for all species tested. nrITS showed the most promise in terms of variability. although sequencing difficulties remain a drawback.

To determine when this polyploidization occurred relative to speciation events in angiosperm history. we employed a phylogenomic approach to investigate the timing of gene set duplications located on syntenic gamma blocks. We populated 769 putative gene families with large sets of homologs obtained from public transcriptomes of basal angiosperms. magnoliids. asterids. and more than 91.8 gigabases of new next-generation transcriptome sequences of non-grass monocots and basal eudicots. The overwhelming majority (95%) of well-resolved gamma duplications was placed before the separation of rosids and asterids and after the split of monocots and eudicots. providing strong evidence that the gamma polyploidy event occurred early in eudicot evolution. Further. the majority of gene duplications was placed after the divergence of the Ranunculales and core eudicots. indicating that the gamma appears to be restricted to core eudicots. Molecular dating estimates indicate that the duplication events were intensely concentrated around 117 million years ago. The rapid radiation of core eudicot lineages that gave rise to nearly 75% of angiosperm species appears to have occurred coincidentally or shortly following the gamma triplication event. Reconciliation of gene trees with a species phylogeny can elucidate the timing of major events in genome evolution. even when genome sequences are only available for a subset of species represented in the gene trees.

Understanding the central mechanisms that are responsible for sympatho-excitation in this disease state may help in reducing the deleterious effects of chronic sympatho-excitation. This review will summarize our understanding of abnormal reflex control of the circulation in CHF. The roles of the arterial baroreflex. the chemoreflex. the cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex and the cardiopulmonary reflex are discussed. New experimental techniques that allow genetic manipulation of substances such as nitric oxide synthase in discrete areas of the brain aid in clarifying the role of NO in the modulation of sympathetic tone in the CHF state.

The distributions exhibited by populations of living organisms in their natural environments include an almost infinite variety of patterns. However. the lack of an adequate method of description has prevented the development of any system of pattern classification other than a most general one. The situation is further complicated by the fact that it has generally been considered necessary. for practical reasons. to use samples rather than entire populations as the source of distributional information. and this frequently introduces bias and inaccuracy into the estimates of population parameters.

1094760,A Revision of the Catfish Genus Noturus Rafinesque with an Analysis of Higher Groups in the Ictaluridae,1969,William Ralph Taylor,,Bulletin of the United States National Museum,,,,This study of the small North American catfishes in the genus Noturus was undertaken to analyze the species and to determine their relationships. It is based on critical examination of most of the many thousand specimens of Noturus now in museums. upon several hundred skeletonized or cleared and stained specimens of catfishes. and upon comparison with most of the other species in the family Ictaluridae. The species in thefamily Ictaluridae appear to constitute six genera. forming three major natural groups. Each group includes one mono-typic genus that is blind. unpigmented. and of restricted subterranean range. and one genus with species that are eyed. pigmented. and of widespread distribution in surface waters. The divisions are:(1) an Ictalurus group including the genus Ictalurus Rafinesque and the blind Trogloglanis pattersoni Eigenmann.(2) a Noturus group containing that genus and Prietella phreatophila Carranza. and (3) the Pylodictis group consisting of the large Pylodictis olivaris (Rafinesque) and the eyeless Satan eurystomus Hubbs and Bailey. The 23 species of Noturus include one subspecies and ten species that are described here as new. They are arranged in three subgenera: Rabida Jordan and Evermann. Noturus Rafinesque. and Schilbeodes Bleeker. With Prietella. several of their characters are intermediate between those of the Ictalurus group and those of the Pylodictis group. In certain characters they appear to be the most primitive. but they have specialized in several directions. exemplified by loss. reduction. or fusion of some structures and by increase in others.

Current theory also predicts that the intense biotic interactions at low latitudes will select plants for greater defence against herbivores. We reviewed the literature to provide an assessment of the evidence for and against the hypothesis that herbivory is more intense at lower latitudes. and that plants from low latitudes are better defended than are plants from high latitudes. 2. Only 37% of the 38 latitudinal comparisons of herbivory showed higher herbivory at lower latitudes. and the average effect size in a meta‐analysis was not significantly different from zero.

Relevant information is however scarce because of the considerable challenges of collecting and interpreting such data. Here we use recent advances in nutritional theory to analyze data on food selection and nutrient intake by wild spider monkeys (Ateles chamek). We show that hypotheses traditionally used to explain vertebrate diet selection. such as energy or protein maximization. or avoidance of plant secondary metabolites. cannot explain the observed pattern of nutrient intake. Instead. spider monkeys maintained a stable daily protein intake but allowed total energy intake to vary as a function of the composition of available food items.

Toxic and fitness-reducing compounds generally are avoided or minimized in the diet within the limits of a species' dietary scope. and avoidance of plant parts defended heavily by digestibility-reducing compounds is stronger the smaller the species. These trends are determined by strong size-related constraints on digestive ability and metabolic rate. However. these constraints have been circumvented by some mammals living in tropical and temperate forests. In these forests there exists an abundant food resource (ie. foliage) that is well defended by both toxic and digestibility-reducing compounds. but this food resource can only be reached by animals small and light enough to be supported in the forest canopy. Hence. the maximum size for arboreal. folivorous mammals is much smaller than physiological theory predicts. It has been postulated that these mammals live closer to digestive and metabolic limits than do most. if not all. other herbivores.!-4 Understanding the adaptations of these species should give insights into the limits to chemical interactions between plants and mammals and how far these limits can be stretched.,True,NOnMPVkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,188,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8MViLaEBd-cC&oi=fnd&pg=PA133&dq=info:hTXLF3N3qq0J:scholar.google.com&ots=Ti0G21_arP&sig=TGGzi_KRhhOAXLGKtjAsXABap5A,12513945850806482309,/scholar?cites=12513945850806482309,,,0,0,0

The long‐term stability of these ecosystems is explained by interactions among sea level. land elevation. primary production. and sediment accretion that regulate the elevation of the sediment surface toward an equilibrium with mean sea level. We show here in a salt marsh that this equilibrium is adjusted upward by increased production of the salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora and downward by an increasing rate of relative sea‐level rise (RSLR). Adjustments in marsh surface elevation are slow in comparison to interannual anomalies and long‐period cycles of sea level. and this lag in sediment elevation results in significant variation in annual primary productivity.

In contrast. we use simulations from five numerical models to quantify the conditions under which ecogeomorphic feedbacks allow coastal wetlands to adapt to projected changes in sea level. In contrast to previous sea‐level assessments. we find that non‐linear feedbacks among inundation. plant growth. organic matter accretion. and sediment deposition. allow marshes to survive conservative projections of sea‐level rise where suspended sediment concentrations are greater than ∼20 mg/L.

The ecology of salt marshes in which this species dominates has been extensively investigated because of the documented biogeochemical functions that these ecosystems perform and the resulting societal values they provide. Since many of the salt marsh-derived values originate. either directly or indirectly. from the presence of a vegetated marsh and its primary productivity. it has long been a major goal of salt marsh ecology to elucidate the determinants of the growth of Spartina.

For example. they transfer to the atmosphere globally significant quantities of C (60. 61) and reduced sulfur gases (127). Coastal marshes may function as net sinks for N20 (46). Because of the anaerobic nature of their soils. wetlands act as sinks for organic carbon. It has been estimated that wetlands once sequestered a net of 57 to 83 x 106 metric tons of carbon per year worldwide. but recent widespread drainage of wetland soils has shifted the carbon balance (7). Although this rate of carbon uptake is small in comparison to other global carbon fluxes. such as the annual release of carbon from combustion of fossil fuel (5-6 X 109 metric tons yr-')(112) or the net uptake of CO2-C by the ocean (1.6 x 109 metric tons yr-')(129). it is important when the net balance between large fluxes is considered. and it is certainly important over geologic time scales.,True,QghVU2IAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,261,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.22.110191.001353,4111686801066803220,/scholar?cites=4111686801066803220,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas_tom_Tomascik/post/How_air_pollution_affects_the_quality_of_saltmarsh_habitats/attachment/59d64c3579197b80779a610c/AS%3A483562894958594%401492301786447/download/Morris+1991+Effects+of+nitrogen+loading+on+wetlands+ecosystems+with+particular+reference+to+atmospheric+deposition+Annu+Rev+Ecol+Syst+22+257-279.pdf,0,0,0

Here we present analytical and numerical models of salt marsh sedimentation that. in addition to capturing inorganic processes. explicitly account for above- and belowground organic processes including root growth and decay of organic carbon. The analytical model is used to examine the bias introduced by organic processes into proxy records of sedimentation. namely 137Cs and 210Pb. We find that accretion rates estimated using 210Pb will be less than accretion rates estimated using the 137Cs peak in steadily accreting marshes if (1) carbon decay is significant and (2) data for 210Pb extend below the 137Cs peak.

There are many anecdotal reports of plants that appear to have abandoned sex for clonal reproduction. yet few studies have quantified the degree of sexual variation in clonal plants and fewer still have determined the underlying ecological and/or genetic factors. Recent empirical work has shown that some clonal plants exhibit very wide variation in sexual reproduction that translates into striking variation in genotypic diversity and differentiation of natural populations.

The analysis of mating systems is usually concerned with the genetic relatedness of sexual partners and hence the degree of inbreeding practised by individuals within populations. Mating patterns in plant populations are inﬂuenced by numerous environmental. demographic and genetic factors. Of these. the type of breeding system (eg dioecism. heterostyly) that a population possesses is of prime importance (Richards. 1986). Quantitative studies of mating systems. until recently. were largely restricted to cultivated plants. However. the recent growth of population biology. and the advent of electrophoretic techniques has provided impetus for a growing number of investigations of mating patterns in natural plant populations (Schemske and Lande. 1985). Consequently. during the past two decades there has been a rapid increase in studies on the measurement of mating system parameters. particularly levels of self-and cross-fertilization.The mating system is not a static property of an individual. population or species. Mating patterns are dynamic. and subject to modiﬁcation by many forces. operating on both ecological and evolutionary time scales. Interest in the causes of shifts in mating systems arise because of the important consequences that such changes have on population genetic structure. selection response. and speciation.

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant—pollinator coevolution and in the long—standing concept of pollination syndromes. But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa. we draw on studies of two floras in the United States. and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that. although the colors of flowers are aggregated in phenotype space. there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict.

They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant–pollinator interactions. the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers.Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes. and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized.Ordination of …,True,pGS18ZgAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,401,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/103/9/1471/145709,6703348887128401943,/scholar?cites=6703348887128401943,,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/103/9/1471/145709,0,0,0

1094822,Reconciling ecological processes with phylogenetic patterns: the apparent paradox of plant--pollinator Systems,1996,Jeff Ollerton,84,Journal of Ecology,5,767-769,Wiley. British Ecological Society,To what extent do studies of the ecology of mutualistic interactions inform us about the evolution of such relationships? As I will show below. the evolution of floral diversity seems to be based upon specialized relationships with pollinators. yet (with some obvious exceptions) the majority of angiosperms appear to be promiscuously pollinated by a range of taxa. This apparent discrepancy between ecological process and phylogenetic pattern is worth exploring in some detail. Consider four facts regarding plantpollinator interactions:1 The vast majority of angiosperms are generalists in their pollinator requirements; a spectrum of taxonomically diverse animals can usually service the same plant species (Waser 1983; Renner & Feil 1983; Waser et al. 1996). For most plant species. this spectrum ranges across orders of insects (eg butterflies. bees. flies) but occasionally covers classes of animals. for example insects and …,True,pGS18ZgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,293,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2261338,9873596176998413276,/scholar?cites=9873596176998413276,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30951213/Ollerton1996JournalEcology.pdf,0,0,0

Using historical records. we assessed the rate of extinction of bee and flower-visiting wasp species in Britain from the mid-19th century to the present. The most rapid phase of extinction appears to be related to changes in agricultural policy and practice beginning in the 1920s. before the agricultural intensification prompted by the Second World War. often cited as the most important driver of biodiversity loss in Britain.

In the textbook ‘three domains’ tree based on informational genes. eukaryotes and Archaea share a common ancestor to the exclusion of Bacteria. However. some phylogenetic analyses of the same data have placed eukaryotes within the Archaea. as the nearest relatives of different archaeal lineages. We compared the support for these competing hypotheses using sophisticated phylogenetic methods and an improved sampling of archaeal biodiversity. We also employed both new and existing tests of phylogenetic congruence to explore the level of uncertainty and conflict in the data.

Methods/Principal Findings PubMed. Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau (CAB) abstracts and 23 international databases were systematically searched for articles published from January 1. 1990 to June 1. 2008. Articles were evaluated for inclusion by at least two researchers focusing on study design and methods. Data were extracted independently using standardized forms. A random-effects binomial model was used to estimate the proportion of NCC among people with epilepsy (PWE). Overall. 565 articles were retrieved and 290 (51%) selected for further analysis. After a second analytic phase. only 4.5% of articles. all of which used neuroimaging for the diagnosis of NCC. were reviewed. Only two studies. both from the US. estimated an incidence rate of NCC using hospital discharge data. The prevalence of NCC in a random sample of village residents was reported from one study where 9.1% of the population harboured brain lesions of NCC. The proportion of NCC among different study populations varied widely. However. the proportion of NCC in PWE was a lot more consistent. The pooled estimate for this population was 29.0% (95%CI: 22.9%–35.5%). These results were not sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of any particular study.

In adult skin. quiescent multipotent progenitors express Tcf3 and commit to a hair cell fate in response to Wnt signaling. We find that embryonic skin progenitors also express Tcf3.

Wnt-inhibited state and Tcf3 promotes a transcriptional program shared by embryonic and postnatal SCs. Further. Tcf3-repressed genes include transcriptional regulators of the epidermal. sebaceous gland and hair follicle differentiation programs. and correspondingly. all three terminal differentiation pathways are suppressed when Tcf3 is induced postnatally.

This systematic review aims to estimate the frequencies of different manifestations. complications and disabilities associated with NCC.   Methods A systematic search of the literature published from January 1. 1990. to June 1. 2008. in 24 different electronic databases and 8 languages was conducted. Meta-analyses were conducted when appropriate.   Results A total of 1569 documents were identified. and 21 included in the analysis. Among patients seen in neurology clinics. seizures/epilepsy were the most common manifestations (78.8%. 95%CI: 65.1%–89.7%) followed by headaches (37.9%. 95%CI: 23.3%–53.7%). focal deficits (16.0%. 95%CI: 9.7%–23.6%) and signs of increased intracranial pressure (11.7%. 95%CI: 6.0%–18.9%). All other manifestations occurred in less than 10% of symptomatic NCC patients. Only four studies reported on the mortality rate of NCC.   Conclusions NCC is a pleomorphic disease linked to a range of manifestations. Although definitions of manifestations were very rarely provided. and varied from study to study. the proportion of NCC cases with seizures/epilepsy and the proportion of headaches were consistent across studies. These estimates are only applicable to patients who are ill enough to seek care in neurology clinics and likely over estimate the frequency of manifestations among all NCC cases.,True,gOJ3t0oAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC,263,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001152,1983832096879495054,/scholar?cites=1983832096879495054,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001152,0,0,0

This activity does not conform to the ‘Large Igneous Province’ model in view of lower eruption and melt production rates. wide dispersal of centres and the apparent absence of deep mantle upwelling. Age data for Vietnamese plateau basalts reflect spatial–temporal patterns consistent with a rotating stress field rather than supra-hotspot lithosphere migration. For most of the volcanic centres there are two eruptive episodes: an early series formed by high-SiO2. low-FeO* quartz and olivine tholeiites—large melt fractions of refractory (lithosphere-like) mantle—and a later series made up of low-SiO2. high-FeO* olivine tholeiites. alkali basalts and basanites—smaller melt fractions of more fertile (asthenosphere-like) mantle.

Founder effects. hybridization. and adaptation to novel environments cause genetic differentiation between native and introduced populations and may contribute to the success of invaders. An influential idea in this context has been the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis. It proposes that after enemy release plants rapidly evolve to be less defended but more competitive. thereby increasing plant vigour in introduced populations. To detect evolutionary change in invaders. comparative studies of native versus introduced populations are needed.

Some evidence suggests that disproportionately high densities of some invaders are due to the release of biochemicals that are novel. and therefore harmful. to naïve organisms in their new range. So far. such evidence has been restricted to the direct phytotoxic effects of plants on other plants. Here we found that one of North America's most aggressive invaders of undisturbed forest understories. Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) and a plant that inhibits mycorrhizal fungal mutualists of North American native plants. has far stronger inhibitory effects on mycorrhizas in invaded North American soils than on mycorrhizas in European soils where A. petiolata is native.

Monocultures. three‐species mixtures. and the four‐species mixture were sown at two densities and with either random or intraspecifically aggregated distributions. There was a hierarchy of competitive abilities among the four species. The weaker competitors showed higher aboveground biomass in the aggregated distribution compared to the random distribution. especially at high density. In one species. intraspecific aggregation resulted in an 86% increase in the number of flowering individuals and a 171% increase in the reproductive biomass at high density.

Brassicaceae) is an invasive. nonindigenous species currently invading the understory of North American woodlands where it is a serious threat to the native flora. Part of this success might be due to allelopathic interference by garlic mustard. Two congeneric species. the European Geum urbanum and the North American Geum laciniatum. were tested for allelopathic inhibition of germination by garlic mustard. Seeds were germinated either on substrate contaminated by garlic mustard or on substrate with contamination neutralized by activated carbon. Allelopathic effects of native European and invasive North American garlic mustard populations were also compared.

Ferns are distributed by small wind‐dispersed propagules that are produced in very large numbers and capable of dispersing thousands of kilometers. Thus. most taxon distributions in ferns are assumed to be a function of dispersal rather than vicariance. Here. we review some case examples that provide good evidence for vicariance and dispersal in ferns. We then ask whether dispersal is so extensive in ferns that vicariance is no longer detectable in most cases.

Here we focus on one particular root-apex zone. the transition zone. which is located between the apical meristem and basal elongation region. This zone has a unique role as the determiner of cell fate and root growth; this is accomplished by means of the complex system of a polar auxin transport circuit. The transition zone also integrates diverse inputs from endogenous (hormonal) and exogenous (sensorial) stimuli and translates them into signalling and motoric outputs as adaptive differential growth responses. These underlie the root-apex tropisms and other aspects of adaptive root behaviour.,True,l3wMLRoAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,230,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138510000889,3041190182549555815,/scholar?cites=3041190182549555815,,http://www.linv.org/images/papers_pdf/tps%20tz.pdf,0,0,0

1094933,Brilliant green: the surprising history and science of plant intelligence,2015,Stefano Mancuso and Alessandra Viola,,,,,Island Press,Are plants intelligent? Can they solve problems. communicate. and navigate their surroundings? Or are they passive. incapable of independent action or social behavior? Philosophers and scientists have pondered these questions since ancient Greece. most often concluding that plants are unthinking and inert: they are too silent. too sedentary--just too different from us. Yet discoveries over the past fifty years have challenged these ideas. shedding new light on the extraordinary capabilities and complex interior lives of plants. In Brilliant Green. Stefano Mancuso. a leading scientist and founder of the field of plant neurobiology. presents a new paradigm in our understanding of the vegetal world. Combining a historical perspective with the latest in plant science. Mancuso argues that. due to cultural prejudices and human arrogance. we continue to underestimate plants. In fact. they process information. sleep. remember. and signal to one another--showing that. far from passive machines. plants are intelligent and aware. Through a survey of plant capabilities from sight and touch to communication. Mancuso challenges our notion of intelligence. presenting a vision of plant life that is more sophisticated than most imagine. Plants have much to teach us. from network building to innovations in robotics and man-made materials--but only if we understand more about how they live. Part botany lesson. part manifesto.

These scientists have been particularly interested in the occurrence in these regions of Nothofagus--southern beeches. This book. which focuses on the distribution. history. and ecology of the genus Nothofagus. provides a key to understanding the historical plant geography and modern vegetation patterns of the southern hemisphere. The book begins with a discussion of the long-term and broad-scale patterns of origin and differentiation in the genus. Next each major Nothofagus biome is discussed. first in a chapter that considers contemporary ecological patterns and then in a chapter that focuses on the history and paleoecology of the region.

Comparison of potential outgroups (Fagus and Betulaceae) suggests that Fagus is most satisfactory. but clear morphological differences between it and Nothofagus support the placement of the latter in the monogeneric family Nothofagaceae. The cladistic analysis supports the four subgenera and four extant pollen groups proposed in the most recent revisions and is consistent with the extensive fossil record. although not especially supported by it. The evolution of the deciduous or evergreen habit. so long considered a singular event of importance in Nothofagus. probably occurred several times. and is an example of parallel evolution.

At the end of the 80s the predictivity of 20 different methods with respect to instrumental pollution data was tested in Switzerland using multiple regression [1. 5]. The highest correlation was found with the sum of frequencies of lichen species within a sampling grid of 10 units positioned on the trunks of free-standing trees. This method was immediately and widely adopted in several other countries. esp. Italy and Germany. with some modifications. chiefly concerning the size of the sampling grid.

The method adopted was designed to avoid subjectivity at all stages. from the sampling strategy to data analysis. Thus. lichen data are expressed by an index that does not depend on any sensitivity scale; data analysis relies on multivariate methods of classification and ordination. and the pollution maps have been produced by automatic mapping programmes. The index. based on the frequency of species within a sampling grid. showed a very high statistical correlation with pollution data measured by recording gauges.

1094988,BRYOATT: attributes of British and Irish mosses. liverworts and hornworts,2007,Mark Oliver Hill and CD Preston and SDS Bosanquet and DB Roy,,,,,Centre for Ecology and Hydrology,In recent years the availability in electronic form of ‘attribute data’for all British vascular plant species has greatly enhanced our ability to interpret distribution patterns. and in particular to interpret changes in those patterns in response to environmental pressures. Whereas in the past plants tended to be grouped simply by broad habitat. such as woodland or calcareous grassland. they can now usefully be grouped by attributes that indicate additional features such as the life-form of species. their pH preferences and their shade-tolerance. Attributes thus allow many of the individual factors which together comprise the autecology of a species to be identified. and then allow species sharing particular traits to be grouped together even though they may grow in very different broad habitats. Thus a number of recent studies have shown a marked tendency for species characteristic of nutrient-rich places to have been more successful than those that grow in nutrient-poor habitats. and this is true over a range of broad habitats. time periods and spatial scales (eg Braithwaite et al.. 2006; Haines-Young et al.. 2000; Walker & Preston. 2006).This compilation is a sequel to PLANTATT (Hill. Preston & Roy. 2004). presenting for bryophytes similar attribute information to that which we presented for vascular plants. Just as for PLANTATT. we have assembled the information over a period of years. either for our own use or for particular projects.

Only H.C. Watson and J.R. Matthews have attempted to devise a more or less comprehensive classification. based on the British range of the species (Watson) or the European distribution (Matthews). A new classification of 1481 native species is presented. based on their range in the Northern Hemisphere. Species are classified by their occurrence in one or more major biomes (Arctic. Boreal. Temperate. Southern) and their longitudinal distribution (Oceanic. Suboceanic. European. Eurosiberian. Eurasian. Circumpolar). The distribution of species in the floristic elements is illustrated by coincidence maps for the British Isles and Europe. The British and Irish flora is dominated by Boreo-temperate.

Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms. but also suggest several ancient genome‐doubling events.

Perhaps the last great question remaining in basal angiosperm phylogeny involves the branching order among the five major clades of mesangiosperms (Ceratophyllum. Chloranthaceae. eudicots. magnoliids. and monocots). Previous analyses have found no consistent support for relationships among these clades. In an effort to resolve these relationships. we performed phylogenetic analyses of 61 plastid genes (≈42.000 bp) for 45 taxa. including members of all major basal angiosperm lineages.

These hypotheses are problematical because many groups originated and diversified well after the last known connection between Africa and South America (≈105 million years ago). and it is unlikely that “sweepstakes” dispersal accounts for many of these disjunctions. Phylogenetic analyses of the angiosperm clade Malpighiaceae. combined with fossil evidence and molecular divergence-time estimates. suggest an alternative hypothesis to account for such distributions.

Several explanations for the disparity of biological diversity in the tropics compared to temperate regions have been proposed including that the tropics may act as a “museum” where older lineages persist through evolutionary time or as a “cradle” where new species continue to be generated. We infer the molecular phylogenetic relationships of 295 ant specimens including members of all 21 extant subfamilies to explore the evolutionary diversification and biogeography of the ants. By constraining the topology and age of the root node while using 45 fossils as minimum constraints. we converge on an age of 139–158 Mya for the modern ants.

Analyses of morphological and molecular data reveal a revised “anthophyte clade” consisting of the fossils glossopterids. Pentoxylon. Bennettitales. and Caytonia as sister to angiosperms. Molecular estimates of the age of crown group angiosperms have converged on 140–180 million years ago (Ma). older than the oldest fossils (132 Ma). suggesting that older fossils remain to be discovered. Whether the first angiosperms were forest shrubs (darkand-disturbed hypothesis) or aquatic herbs (wet-and-wild hypothesis) remains unclear. The near-basal phylogenetic position of Nymphaeales (water lilies). which may include the well-known fossil Archaefructus. certainly indicates that the aquatic habit arose early. After initial. early “experiments.” angiosperms radiated rapidly (≤ 5 million years [Myr]). yielding the five lineages of Mesangiospermae (magnoliids and Chloranthaceae as sisters to a clade of monocots and eudicots+ Ceratophyllaceae). This radiation ultimately produced approximately 97% of all angiosperm species. Updated estimates of divergence times across the angiosperms conducted using nonparametric rate smoothing. with one or multiple fossils. were older than previous reports. whereas estimates using PATHd8 were typically younger.

We provide an overview on the structure and composition of the plastid genome of land plants as well as the functions of its genes in an explicit phylogenetic and evolutionary context. We will discuss the architecture of land plant plastid chromosomes. including gene content and synteny across land plants. Moreover. we will explore the functions and roles of plastid encoded genes in metabolism and their evolutionary importance regarding gene retention and conservation. We suggest that the slow mode at which the plastome typically evolves is likely to be influenced by a combination of different molecular mechanisms. These include the organization of plastid genes in operons. the usually uniparental mode of plastid inheritance. the activity of highly effective repair …,True,_exgruMAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,601,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11103-011-9762-4,14299145531654169188,/scholar?cites=14299145531654169188,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11103-011-9762-4,0,0,0

A new method. modified complex indel coding is described that aims at maximizing the phylogenetic information retained from unambiguously aligned sequence regions or regions where the principal relative position of gaps to one another can be safely established. An algorithm is described that allows application of the method to all theoretically possible gap-nucleotide patterns. A platform-independent computer program is introduced that automates the new method as well as several previously published coding schemes. Differences to previously published indel coding approaches as well as to the integration of ambiguously aligned regions into phylogenetic analysis are discussed.,True,_exgruMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,277,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790305002307,2584355959963827449,/scholar?cites=2584355959963827449,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.4564&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1095032,PRAP—computation of Bremer support for large data sets,2004,Kai Müller,31,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2,780-782,Academic Press,The Bremer support (BS. Bremer. 1988. 1994; Källersjö et al.. 1992). also known as ‘‘decay index’’(Olmstead et al.. 1993).‘‘length difference’’(Faith. 1991). or ‘‘support index’’(SI. Davis. 1993; Kluge and Farris. 1969). is a measure of branch support frequently seen in the recent phylogenetic literature. The strengths and limits of this index have lately been examined (DeBry. 2001; Oxelman et al.. 1999) and it was generally concluded that care must be taken when interpreting the values. In particular. the calculation of BS becomes problematic for intermediate to large data sets. Either. the resulting support values will be sometimes drastic overestimates of support (Bremer. 1994) or. if more thorough search strategies are invoked to assess support of all the individual branches. the process will become a very time consuming task (Oxelman et al.. 1999). Various procedures have been suggested for computationally more demanding data sets (Davis. 1995; Morgan. 1997). and the reverse constraint method has emerged as most effective (Morgan. 1997). The power of all approaches. however. strongly depends on the ability of the applied heuristic search strategy to find shortest trees. With the common search strategies and the currently available processor speed. this ability shrinks rapidly as matrix sizes grow to more than 100–150 taxa (although strongly depending on the data set). While finding the most parsimonious (MP) tree for a large data set is time consuming itself. heuristic searches have to be repeated N times if N is the number of internal branches to be tested (N 6 number of terminals—2).

In this study. we have developed a new procedure to define the conservation priorities among endemic plants and habitats by evaluating eight criteria. Five criteria deal with the geographic and ecological range of the evaluated species. whereas the other three refer to threats. After the evaluation of each criterion. we combined the partial scores to obtain a priority index (PI).

1095071,Experimental analysis of intermediate disturbance and initial floristic composition: decoupling cause and effect,1995,Scott L Collins and Susan M Glenn and David J Gibson,76,Ecology,2,486-492,Ecological Society of America,The intermediate disturbance hypothesis predicts that richness will be highest in communities with moderate levels of disturbance and at intermediate time spans following disturbance. This model was proposed as a nonequilibrium explanation of species richness in tropical forests and coral reefs. A second model of succession. initial floristic composition. states that nearly all species. including late seral species. are present at the start of succession.

Kansas. USA is described with respect to plant species compositional changes over a five year period in response to fire and topography. The principal gradient of variation in the vegetation is related to time since burning. Species show an individualistic response in terms of relative abundance to this gradient. Both the percentage of and cover of C4 species and all grasses decrease as the prairie remains unburnt. Forb and woody plant species numbers and abundance increase along this gradient. A secondary gradient of variation reflects topography (i.e. upland versus lowland soils). Upland soils support a higher species richness and diversity.

Andropogon gerardii. and a less dependent species. Elymus canadensis. were grown in intra- and interspecific combination in a target-neighbour experiment with and without mycorrhizal fungi to examine their influence on competition. 2 Mycorrhizal fungi significantly influenced the competitive effects and responses of both plant species. Strong competitive effects of Andropogon disappeared in the absence of mycorrhizas indicating that its competitive dominance in tallgrass prairie is highly dependent upon its mycorrhizal associations. The influence of mycorrhizal fungi on Andropogon responses to neighbours decreased with increasing neighbour density indicating reduced host plant benefit from mycorrhizas under crowded conditions. 3 Effects of mycorrhizas on competition were generally smaller for the less mycorrhiza-dependent Elymus.

Results indicated that fire history affected the magnitude of the vegetation response to fire and to N additions. Sites not burned for over 15 years averaged only a 9% increase in foliage biomass in response to N enrichment. In contrast. foliage production increased an average of 68% in response to N additions on annually burned sites. while infrequently burned sites. burned in the year of the study. averaged a 45% increase. These findings are consistent with reports indicating that reduced plant growth on unburned prairie is due to shading and lower soil temperatures. while foliage production on frequently burned areas is constrained by N availability.

Once NCDs are developed. they become chronic health and economic problems. Their primary prevention is linked to their common risk factors. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of NCD risk factors with a focus on their clustering in Bangladeshi adults. This nationally representative study was done in 4.073 (1.812 men and 2.261 women) adults aged 25 years or older selected from rural and urban households. Multistage cluster sampling design was used. Selected variables were in line with steps I and II of WHO stepwise surveillance except alcohol. Forty-four percent used tobacco in any form. Almost 93 % did not consume adequate fruit and vegetables (5 servings or more). Thirty eight percent had low physical activity level (<600 MET-minutes/week). One-quarter (26 %) were overweight (body mass index > =25 kg/m^2). Twenty-one percent had hypertension (blood pressure > =140/90 mmHg or medication) and about 5 % had documented diabetes. Upon examination of risk factor clustering. we observed that 38 % had at least three risk factors. After this threshold. clustering suddenly dropped down to a fairly low level. Using this threshold as a cut-off. clustering of risk factors was associated with age. male gender. urban residence. educational levels and quality of house in multivariate analysis. Prevalence of NCD risk factors is fairly high in Bangladeshi adults with a tendency of clustering.

1095117,Physical and chemical composition of some walnut (Juglans regia L) genotypes grown in Turkey,2005,Gulcan Ozkan and M Ali Koyuncu,56,Grasas y Aceites,2,141-146,,Walnut ( Juglans regia L.) samples were collected during the 2000 and 2001 harvests from different selections of trees grown in Turkey . Important physical and biochemical properties of fruit were examined in these walnut types. At the end of this study. 10 types were selected and nut and kernel properties. fatty acid composition and the proximate composition of these selections which are commonly grown in Turkey were evaluated. Physical properties are attributed to the quality criteria of nuts. Investigated genotypes showed good quality according to the test results. The total oil content ranged from 61.97 to 70.92 % while the crude protein ranged from 15.17 to 19.24 %. Ash ranged from 1.26 to 2.06 % while the moisture was found between 3.25-3.91 % of the kernel. The total carbohydrate was calculated as between 8.05-13.23 %. The oleic acid content of the oils ranged from 21.18 to 40.20% of the total fatty acids. while the linoleic acid content ranged from 43.94 to 60.12 % and the linolenic contents from 6.91 to11.52 %.

1095119,Starch-encapsulated pesticides for slow release,1976,BS Shasha and WM Doane and CR Russell,,,,,,Advantages of controlled-release pesticide systems may include a less active agent and fewer applications. more effective control of the target organism. reduced toxicity to nontarget organisms. and reduced~ nvironmental pollution. Such systems are being developed and a few are being marketed based on containment of the pesticide within either a polymer matrix or coating. Synthetic elastomers serve to control the release of antifouling agents in coat· ings for objects immersed in marine waters and for molluscicides. Insecti· cides incorporated in plastic strips provide slow release of the active agent over several weeks. An insecticide is now being sold in the form of micro· capsules where a polyamide film surrounds the active agent. Because of the diversity of properties of hundreds of biologically active chemicals for which controlled release would be beneficial and because the environments vary so widely into which the formulation would be placed. considerable research is needed to optimize the numerous controlled· release systems. Obviously. for the systems to be accepted on a broad scale. they must be both technically and economically feasible. In our research to extend or replace petroleum-derived polymers from reo newabl~ resources. such as agricultural crops. we have devised a simple procedure to encapsulate a broad range of biologically active materials within a starch matrix. Besides the simplicity of the procedure. the availability of starch. and its low cost. the coating material will biodegrade and will leave no residue in the environment.The procedure consists of oXidatively crosslinking starch xanthate in an aqueous system in …,True,hziqd-8AAAAJ:ocFeo90gyj0C,128,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/29646/PDF,7021101491521454271,/scholar?cites=7021101491521454271,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/29646/PDF,0,0,0

Force. energy and specific deformation before initial rupturing and kernel extraction quality were investigated as functions of shell thickness and geometric mean diameter at different compression positions (length. width and suture). Results showed that while energy for initial rupturing increased linearly with increase in shell thickness except for length position. it decreased linearly with an increase in geometric mean diameter. The direction of change of specific deformation as a function of shell thickness and geometric mean diameter was similar to that of energy for all compression positions.

The few published studies investigating adaptive aspects of floral displays suggest that numbers of flowers and their arrangement in space and time determine levels of pollination and fruit‐set in natural populations. The frequently conflicting demands placed on inflorescence architecture have led to an evolutionary compromise that maximizes the genetic contribution of an individual plant to the next generation. These conflicting demands include pollinator attraction vs. ovary competition. fruit dispersal vs. fruit predation. and reproductive vs. vegetative resource allocation. In most cases. the inflorescence size most successful in fruit production is also the most frequent in natural populations.

An evaluation framework. and an application to Indian cities,2015,Parveen Kumar and Davide Geneletti,42,Land use policy,,210-226,Pergamon,Addressing climate change issues require different response actions at various spatial scales. However. the incorporation of climate change issues in the form of agreement. framework and climate policies has tended to focus on international and national scale but lacking at local level. The spatial policies at local level. although not directly linked to climate change. if implemented effectively may become a viable policy instrument to mitigate and adapt to climate change issues. Policy makers at the local level have not explored these local policy options widely. Drawing from the case study in India. this paper aims at understanding how spatial plans in India are incorporating climate change issues and identifying potential gaps. Spatial plans across various cities in India were examined. The skeleton of the review framework is developed upon Moser and Loers (2008) work.

A stable. oscillatory. flat. left spin state is first identified from a standard bifurcation analysis of the aircraft model considered. and this is chosen as the starting point for all recovery attempts. Three different symmetric. level-flight trim states. representative of high. moderate. and low-angle-of-attack trims for the chosen aircraft model. are computed by using an extended-bifurcation-analysis procedure. A standard form of the nonlinear dynamic inversion algorithm is implemented to recover the aircraft from the oscillatory spin state to each of the selected level trims.

In addition. there is no standardised method for an all-inclusive vulnerability assessment at the local level. Results from higher broad-scale vulnerability assessments are difficult to implement conceptually and technically at the local scale.

Drifts are slow eye movements between two adjacent fixational saccades. We quantified fixational saccades and asked whether their changes could be attributed to pathologic drifts seen in amblyopia. one of the most common causes of blindness in childhood.   Methods Thirty-six pediatric subjects with varying severity of amblyopia and eleven healthy age-matched controls held their gaze on a visual target. Eye movements were measured with high-resolution video-oculography during fellow eye-viewing and amblyopic eye-viewing conditions. Fixational saccades and drifts were analyzed in the amblyopic and fellow eye and compared with controls.   Results We found an increase in the amplitude with decreased frequency of fixational saccades in children with amblyopia. These alterations in fixational eye movements correlated with the severity of their amblyopia. There was also an increase in eye position variance during drifts in amblyopes. There was no correlation between the eye position variance or the eye velocity during ocular drifts and the amplitude of subsequent fixational saccade. Our findings suggest that abnormalities in fixational saccades in amblyopia are independent of the ocular drift.   Discussion This investigation of amblyopia in pediatric age group quantitatively characterizes the fixation instability. Impaired properties of fixational saccades could be the consequence of abnormal processing and reorganization of the visual system in amblyopia.

Solid pekmez was found to exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. however. diluted samples are Newtonian. The effect of temperature on viscosity can be described by means of an Arrhenius equation. Depending on the soluble solid contents. the activation energies for flow of diluted samples vary from 43.85 to 15.93 kJ/mol.

Avicel PlusÕ CM 2159 or b-glucan) were investigated throughout ripening. The low-fat cheeses made with fat replacers were compared with full-and low-fat counterparts as controls. Reduction of fat caused increases in moisture and protein contents and decreases in moisture-in-non fat substance and yield values in low-fat cheeses. The use of fat replacers in the manufacture of low-fat Kashar cheese increased water binding capacity and improved overall quality of the cheeses. Use of fat replacer in low-fat cheese making has enhanced cheese proteolysis. All samples underwent lipolysis during ripening and low-fat cheeses with fat replacers had higher level of total free fatty acid than full-or low-fat control cheeses. Texture attributes and meltability significantly increased with addition of fat replacers. Sensory scores showed that the full-fat cheese was awarded best in all stages of ripening and low-fat variant of Kashar cheeses have inferior quality. However. fat replacers except b-glucan improved the appearance. texture and flavour attributes of low-fat cheeses. When the fat replacers are compared. the low-fat cheese with Avicel PlusÕ CM 2159 was highly acceptable and had sensory attributes closest to full-fat Kashar cheese.,True,VlHGndQAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C,97,https://www.academia.edu/download/48217479/Influence_of_fat_replacers_on_chemical_c20160821-1947-xpn4ld.pdf,1646947828905896376,/scholar?cites=1646947828905896376,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48217479/Influence_of_fat_replacers_on_chemical_c20160821-1947-xpn4ld.pdf,0,0,0

As a result of decreased absorption by pigments. reflectance at visible wavelengths increased consistently in stressed leaves for eight stress agents and among six vascular plant species. Visible reflectance was most sensitive to stress in the 535–640‐nm and 685–700‐nm wavelength ranges. A sensitivity minimum occurred consistently near 670 nm. Infrared reflectance was comparatively unresponsive to stress. but increased at 1.400–2.500 nm with severe leaf dehydration and the accompanying decreased absorption by water.

Valachovich,,,,38,European Comission,The European Red List of Habitats provides an overview of the risk of collapse (degree of endangerment) of marine. terrestrial and freshwater habitats in the European Union (EU28) and adjacent regions (EU28+). based on a consistent set of criteria and categories and detailed data and expertise from involved countries. Amongst terrestrial and freshwater habitats the highest percentage of threatened types (categories Critically Endangered. Endangered. Vulnerable) was found amongst mires and bogs (85% in the EU28. 54% in the EU28+). followed by grasslands (53%. 49%). freshwater habitats (46%. 38%) and coastal habitats (45%. 43%). Relatively low percentages of heathland and scrub. forests. and sparsely vegetated habitats were assessed to be threatened. Overall the amount of threatened habitats was higher in the EU28 (36%) than in the wider range of the EU28+(31%). The European Red List of Habitats provides extensive additional information on habitat classification and definition. pressures and threats. conservation and restorability of habitats. distribution. status and trends in individual countries. and sub-habitats that may possibly be threatened. The information provided can inform and support European nature and biodiversity policy in a variety of ways. particularly in relation to the EU2020 Biodiversity Strategy targets. Further applications include the revitalisation of the EUNIS habitat classification. synergies with the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services initiative. and the improvement of Red List methodologies.,True,VTtCQAgAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C,209,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/401538,3577929493931905422,/scholar?cites=3577929493931905422,,,0,0,0

In the seed bank prior to disturbance. seed distribution through the vertical soil profile was evaluated to determine the initial seed species structure. Then. several characteristics of the shallow seed bank and the extant vegetation were evaluated prior and following field disturbance: seed species composition and abundance. and species composition of the aboveground vegetation. The contribution of seed rain versus seed bank was evaluated by means of the comparison of the vegetation developed in plots filled with sterilised soil (seed bank removal) and the vegetation developed in non-sterilised plots in the field. The distribution of seeds through the profile indicated a sharp decline in abundance with depth …,True,VTtCQAgAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,173,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X0400089X,7561998080596057223,/scholar?cites=7561998080596057223,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39799748/acta_oecol_05.pdf,0,0,0

A vegetation model was used to simulate the extent of the potential refugia during the last glacial period. At the same time a genetic survey was carried out on this species.Results  The simulated distribution of P. sylvestris during the last glacial period is coherent with the observed fossil data. which showed a patchy distribution of the refugia between c. 40° N and 50° N.

These questions have profound importance both for how we view the stratigraphic record of changing climate in different regions and for our understanding of the climate system. Here we link the four longest European pollen records and derive a terrestrial sequence of vegetation events and a coherent stratigraphic scheme for the last 500.000 years. Comparison of the terrestrial and marine records shows good agreement. but it also reveals that the pollen sequences contain a higher degree of climate sensitivity than the oxygen isotope record. In addition. it suggests that neither an oxygen isotope record …,True,ArOp8t0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,296,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X97000782,7709488314289433394,/scholar?cites=7709488314289433394,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50540301/s0012-821x_2897_2900078-220161125-3044-1g8h7jl.pdf,0,0,0

This mid-Holocene ‘mélange’ has been the subject of debates that have often been polarised between support for climatic causation and those favouring anthropogenic explanations for changes in vegetation. river flooding. wildfire regimes. etc. One way to shed light on the causes of mid-Holocene landscape changes is to focus on natural archives. such as lake and cave isotopes. the records of which can be unambiguously attributed to climatic forcing. These primary climate proxies can then be compared and contrasted with secondary or response variables. such as pollen and microcharcoal data. which can be the product of either climate changes or human activity or both. ideally using a multiproxy approach.

Contrasting patterns of palaeohydrological changes have been evidenced in the central Mediterranean: south (north) of around 40° N of latitude. the middle part of the Holocene was characterised by lake-level maxima (minima). during an interval dated to ca. 10 300–4500 cal BP to the south and 9000–4500 cal BP to the north. Available data suggest that these contrasting palaeohydrological patterns operated throughout the Holocene. both on millennial and centennial scales. Regarding precipitation seasonality. maximum humidity in the central Mediterranean during the middle part of the Holocene was characterised by humid winters and dry summers north of ca. 40° N. and humid winters and summers south of ca. 40° N. This may explain an apparent conflict between palaeoclimatic records depending on the proxies used for reconstruction as well as the synchronous expansion of tree species taxa with contrasting climatic requirements. In addition. south of ca. 40° N. the first millennium of the Holocene was characterised by very dry climatic conditions not only in the eastern. but also in the central-and the western Mediterranean zones as reflected by low lake levels and delayed reforestation.

The first part of this book describes the original fungal cell and its development into specialized cells of which the various tissues and thalli are composed. This is followed by discussions on sexual reproduction of ascolichens and basidiolichens and on systematic criteria for the definition of taxa in different hierarchical steps. This book also explains the types of propagules produced by lichens and the submicroscopical investigations of lichens. including phycobiont and mycobionts' substructure and symbiotic relationship. The second part of this book examines the physiological aspects of lichens. It includes discussions on metal cation uptake and translocation in vascular plants and on lichens' role in rock weathering and soil formation. This part also studies photosynthetic rates and nitrogen absorption and metabolism by the intact thallus of lichens. Succeeding chapters discuss physiological and morphological responses of lichens to the most important environmental factors and the relationship of these factors to lichen distribution. Substrate preferences of lichens and their causes and implications with regard to the ecology. distribution. and taxonomy of lichens are also examined.

Two cultivars of maize (cv. Agaiti 2002 and cv. Av 4001) selected on the basis of their yield potential were grown in pots outdoors under natural conditions during July. Microorganisms were applied at seedling stage and salt stress was induced 21 days after sowing and maintained up to 50% flowering after 120 days of stress. The salt treatment caused a detrimental effect on growth and development of plants. Co-inoculation resulted in some positive adaptative responses of maize plants under salinity. The salt tolerance from inoculation was generally mediated by decreases in electrolyte leakage and in osmotic potential. an increase in osmoregulant (proline) production. maintenance of relative water content of leaves. and selective uptake of K ions.

Effect of seed inoculation and rhizosphere inoculation were studied in two varieties of maize. which were subjected to drought stress at vegetative stage. Water deficiency affected accumulation of free amino acids. soluble sugars. proline and soluble protein contents. However. seed inoculated plants had an increased accumulation of 54.54 percent and 63.15 percent free amino acids and soluble sugars respectively. while rhizosphere inoculated plants showed 45.45 percent increase in free amino acids and 31.57 percent increase in soluble sugars as compared to control. The concentrations of soluble proteins on the contrary decreased in the similar order. The plants growth aspect ie shoot and root fresh weight. shoot and root dry weight. shoot length and root length. also showed results in consistence with the biochemical attributes.

1095235,The evolution of plants,2014,Kathy Willis and Jennifer McElwain,,,,,Oxford University Press,Plants first colonized the land over 430 million years ago. having evolved from some of the most primitive forms of life. Since then. plants have played a major role in supplying the atmospheric oxygen we all need to survive. But how did plants evolve. how has their distribution and diversity been affected by changes in climate over millions of years-and how can these processes be studied? The Evolution of Plants blends evidence from the fossil record and data from biomolecular studies to tell the story of plant evolution from the earliest forms of life to the present day. Focusing on the key events during the evolution of plants-from the colonization of land to the first forests. the emergence of seed plants to the evolution of flowering plants-its straightforward explanations and clear illustrations provide the reader with the most accessible introduction to plant evolution available. With stunning biome maps illustrating the global distribution of plants during the different periods of life on Earth. the book explains how the diversity of vegetation has changed in response to climate. reinforcing the close link between climate change and the process of biological evolution. It is a contemporary account of a dynamic field. which is perfect for any student looking for a broad. balanced introduction to the subject.

These results. coupled with a record of Mesozoic paleowildfires. are incompatible with the prediction of prolonged intervals of low atmospheric O2 levels (10 to 12%) in the Mesozoic.,True,x1bwH_sAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,145,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5893/1197.abstract,7671795939634657864,/scholar?cites=7671795939634657864,,,0,0,0

Skr. 55: 343-373,,,,One of every 10 flowering plant species is in the family Compositae. With ca. 24.000-30.000 species in 1600-1700 genera and a distribution that is global except for Antarctica. it is the most diverse of all plant families. Although clearly mouophyletic. there is a great deal of diversity among the members: habit varies from annual and perennial herbs to shrubs. vines. or trees. and species grow in nearly every type of habitat from lowland forests to the high alpine fell fields. though they are most common in open areas. Some are well-known weeds. but most species have restricted distributions. and members of this family are often important components of'at risk'habitats as in the Cape Floral Kingdom or the Hawaiian Islands. The sub-familial classification and ideas about major patterns of evolution and diversification within the family remained largely unchanged from Beutham through Cronquist. Recently obtained data. both morphological and molecular. have allowed us to examine the distribution and evolution of the family in a way that was never before possible. It is now known that the tribe formerly thought to be ancestral (Heliantheae s. I.) is actually nested high in the phylogeny while one previously thought to be in a derived position (Mutisieae s. I.) is basal. Likewise. tribes previously thought to be closely related. Eupatorieae and Vernonieae. are now widely separated. and the Cardueae (thistles) are embedded in the African Mutisieae clade.

Using data from 94 plots the family-level floristic patterns in wet tropical South America are described. To test diversity patterns. 268 plots are used in this large area. Contrary to a widely held belief. western Amazonian plots are not necessarily the most diverse. Several central Amazonian plots have equal or even higher tree diversity. Annual rainfall is not a good estimator for tree diversity in the Amazonia area and Guiana shield. Plots in the Guiana Shield area (and eastern Amazonia) usually have lower diversity than those in central or western Amazonia. It is argued that this is not because of low rainfall or low nutrient status of the soil but because of the small area of the relatively isolated rain forest area in eastern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield. The low diversity on nutrient-poor white sand soils in the Amazon basin is not necessarily due to their Low nutrient status but is. at least partly. caused by their small extent and fragmented nature.,True,BGN6fPsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,355,https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/31255,3610643878970721101,/scholar?cites=3610643878970721101,,https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/31255/WOS000166498000002.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Analysis of these data showed that the flora of China is significantly more diverse than that of the United States. Furthermore. the difference in diversity arises at and below the level of genera. Finally. the euasterids II and Caryophyllidae are exceptions to the general trend in being more diverse in the United States.

The study area was divided into 71 geographical units distributed in five latitudinal zones. Species lists of pteridophytes and spermatophytes were compiled for each geographical unit. Three measures of beta diversity were used: βsim. which is one minus the Simpson index of similarity. βslope. which is the slope of the relationship between Simpson index and geographical distance. and β0.5‐distance. which is the distance that halves the similarity from its initial value.Results  Average βsim is higher for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes …,True,w_YbY-AAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,155,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00450.x,8743306197202244327,/scholar?cites=8743306197202244327,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hong_Qian3/publication/229984204_Beta_diversity_in_relation_to_dispersal_ability_for_vascular_plants_in_North_America/links/5a03bbc20f7e9beb177219ae/Beta-diversity-in-relation-to-dispersal-ability-for-vascular-plants-in-North-America.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,Latham and Ricklefs observed statistically significant continent (region) effects in global comparisons of the species richness of forest trees. They argued that ecologists should entertain diversity hypotheses that include region-specific effects of history and geography on biological diversity. Francis and Currie rejected this approach. claiming that alternative hypotheses based on variation in local ecological conditions are more parsimonious. In response. we point out that the diversity of the earth's biota. whether examined at the local. regional. or global level. does have a history and is responsive to large-scale events and processes that have region-specific expression and influence the net rate of diversification.

At the species level. trait combinations depend on trade-offs representing different ecological strategies. but at the community level trait combinations are expected to be decoupled from these trade-offs because different strategies can facilitate co-existence within communities. A key question is to what extent community-level trait composition is globally filtered and how well it is related to global versus local environmental drivers. Here. we perform a global. plot-level analysis of trait–environment relationships. using a database with more than 1.1 million vegetation plots and 26.632 plant species with trait information.

Data were collected along transects radiating away from permanent water sources. Dung unit density counts revealed gradients of livestock activity. but utilization belts around water sources overlapped. indicating that pastoral land use affects the entire landscape. Dung unit counts corresponded to gradients in soil nutrient parameters (C. N. P). which significantly decreased with distance from the wells. However. no significant correlation was observed for plant species richness and vegetation composition with distance from water source. This indicates that soil parameters and livestock grazing exert a relatively smaller influence on the vegetation than the high inter-annual variability in precipitation.

Since prehistoric times. among all inorganic antimicrobial agents. silver has been extensively used to resist infections. As silver salts. having an antimicrobial effect [1]. are used in a variety of applications including dental work. catheters and burn wounds [2. 3]. synthesis of silver nanoparticles now a days are of great desire. Although an array of physical and chemical methods have been used to synthesize silver nanoparticles. the use of bio-compatible. non-toxic. cost-effective and ecofriendly methods predominate the others. The rich diversity of microorganisms such as bacteria. fungi. etc. and their potentiality to control the synthesis of various metallic nanoparticles. should be taken into consideration which is yet to be fully explored. Moreover. biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles have many applications in areas of non-linear optics. spectrally selective coating for solar energy absorption and intercalation materials for electric batteries. optical receptors. catalysts in chemical reactions. biolabelling and antibacterials [4]. A number of microorganisms including algae [5]. bacteria [6. 7] and fungi have been reported for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

In order to elucidate its glacial history. 325 individuals from 69 populations were analysed using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. A strongly hierarchical phylogeographical pattern was detected: Two major east–west vicariant groups can be separated along a gap in the distributional area. A further subdivision into at least four populational groups is in congruence with presumed peripheral glacial refugia. There is no indication for survival on unglaciated mountain tops (nunataks) in the interior of the Pleistocene ice shield covering the Alps.

Therefore. it seems to be an improvement compared to measures of functional diversity that are currently available. An unexpected property of FDQ is that its value may decrease if species richness increases.

Given the multiplicity of approaches to classify vegetation. it is important to develop international consensus around a set of general guidelines and purpose‐specific standard protocols.

This paper presents a framework to facilitate comparisons between broad‐scale plot‐based classification approaches.Our framework is based on the distinction of four structural elements (plot record. vegetation type. consistent classification section and classification system) and two procedural elements (classification protocol and classification approach).

Standley. Associate Curator of the United States National Herbarium. The work is based wholly upon the extensive series of Mexican plants in the National Herbarium. a large proportion of which have been obtained by special investigators sent out by the United States National Museum and the United States Department of Agriculture. The flora of Mexico. especially the arborescent flora. includes many species of great economic value. They furnish many products of commercial importance. such as henequen and ixtle fiber. palm oil. lumber. cacao. rubber. drugs. alcohol. and many fruits.Heretofore no descriptive flora of any portion of tropical continental North America has been published. and the identification of the species of plants yielding important products has often been very difficult. Identification of material has been possible only by comparison with extensive series of herbarium specimens. such as are to be found only in the larger botanical institutions. or by reference to isolated descriptions. many of them available only in the largest libraries. The present work brings together all the published species of woody Mexican plants and furnishes keys for their identification as well as brief descriptive notes. Much information is presented also concerning commercial and local uses of the plants. The vernacular names of the trees and shrubs are given. and since these are fairly well standardized by local usage they will be found helpful as guides to the identity of fragmentary or otherwise difficult material.

Ser",,401-408,,Introduction: Preparation of manuscript for the Flora of Costa Rica has been the most agreeable botanical work that the writer ever has undertaken. for two reasons. No other area of equal size anywhere in America possesses so rich and varied a flora and none in North America is at all comparable in these respects. It is improbable that in any part of the earth there can be found an equal area of greater botanical interest. In the second place. work upon the flora has enabled the writer to relive many happy days spent in Costa Rica in 1924 and 1925-26. while making collections and becoming acquainted with several separated and representative regions: the Meseta Central; the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; the Province of Guanacaste. so unlike and yet in some respects so similar to central Costa Rica; the volcanoes; the Cantón de Dota; and even the alpine paramos of Dota. the only ones. even if small and insignificant in comparison with those of the Andes. that exist in North America. Working over these collections revived a host of memories of inspiring days spent in mountain and lowland forests. memories of the most varied kinds. all happy and pleasant ones. It is truly remarkable that in traveling so many miles. afoot. on horseback. and by other. often primitive means of transportation. there should have occurred no unpleasant incidents. anything more embarrassing than minor failures of modern rather than primitive machines of transport. In few countries of the world. I believe. would it be possible to travel so much and find only pleasant and ever varied scenes. and be received everywhere with simple and sincere hospitality.

Standley. assistant curator. United States National Herbarium. Mr. Wooton was connected with the New Mexico College of Agriculture for twenty years. during which time he made extensive botanical collections in nearly all the counties of the State. Mr. Standley spent three years in botanical work at the same institution and has since revisited the State for the purpose of further studying its flora. This volume. therefore. is based very largely upon the collections made by the two authors. although all other available collections from New Mexico have been studied. Only the flowering plants and vascular cryptogams of New Mexico are contained in the present work. Keys are given for the determination of the species as well as of the larger groups. so that the volume may be used as a field manual. At the same time the citations will enable those who have access to libraries to consult readily the original descriptions of the species. The number of species treated is approximately 3.000. Notwithstanding the large amount of field work already accomplished. many remote districts in New Mexico are still imperfectly known botanically. so that eventually this number will doubtless be increased by several hundred species.

However. there has been no agreement on which region(s) should be used for barcoding land plants. To provide a community recommendation on a standard plant barcode. we have compared the performance of 7 leading candidate plastid DNA regions (atpF-atpH spacer. matK gene. rbcL gene. rpoB gene. rpoC1 gene. psbK-psbl spacer. and trnH-psbA spacer). Based on assessments of recoverability. sequence quality. and levels of species discrimination. we recommend the 2-locus combination of rbcL+ matK as the plant barcode.

This approach was successfully pioneered in animals using a portion of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) mitochondrial gene. In plants. establishing a standardized DNA barcoding system has been more challenging. In this paper. we review the process of selecting and refining a plant barcode; evaluate the factors which influence the discriminatory power of the approach; describe some early applications of plant barcoding and summarise major emerging projects; and outline tool development that will be necessary for plant DNA barcoding to advance.,True,n19ktXAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1016,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019254,12154951164212764601,/scholar?cites=12154951164212764601,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019254,0,0,0
1095391,DNA barcoding in the cycadales: testing the potential of proposed barcoding markers for species identification of cycads,2007,Chodon Sass and Damon P Little and Dennis Wm Stevenson and Chelsea D Specht,2,PloS one,11,e1154,Public Library of Science,Barcodes are short segments of DNA that can be used to uniquely identify an unknown specimen to species. particularly when diagnostic morphological features are absent. These sequences could offer a new forensic tool in plant and animal conservation—especially for endangered species such as members of the Cycadales. Ideally. barcodes could be used to positively identify illegally obtained material even in cases where diagnostic features have been purposefully removed or to release confiscated organisms into the proper breeding population. In order to be useful. a DNA barcode sequence must not only easily PCR amplify with universal or near-universal reaction conditions and primers. but also contain enough variation to generate unique identifiers at either the species or population levels. Chloroplast regions suggested by the Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBoL). and two alternatives. the chloroplast psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS). were tested for their utility in generating unique identifiers for members of the Cycadales. Ease of amplification and sequence generation with universal primers and reaction conditions was determined for each of the seven proposed markers. While none of the proposed markers provided unique identifiers for all species tested. nrITS showed the most promise in terms of variability. although sequencing difficulties remain a drawback. We suggest a workflow for DNA barcoding. including database generation and management. which will ultimately be necessary if we are to succeed in establishing a universal DNA …,True,n19ktXAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,331,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001154,9215207576441829009,/scholar?cites=9215207576441829009,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001154,0,0,0

Cycads are often cited as a classic example. reaching their greatest diversity during the Jurassic–Cretaceous (199.6 to 65.5 million years ago) then dwindling to their present diversity of ~300 species as flowering plants rose to dominance. Using fossil-calibrated molecular phylogenies. we show that cycads underwent a near synchronous global rediversification beginning in the late Miocene. followed by a slowdown toward the Recent. Although the cycad lineage is ancient. our timetrees indicate that living cycad species are not much older than ~12 million years. These data reject the hypothesized role of dinosaurs in generating extant diversity and the designation of today’s cycad species as living fossils.,True,n19ktXAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,310,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6057/796.abstract,3462686967401845975,/scholar?cites=3462686967401845975,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.5983&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this study we examined rbcL sequences and morphological characters from 55 fern taxa: 34 were from Polystichum and 21 were from other genera in the Dryopteridaceae. We found that Phanerophlebia. possibly including Polystichopsis. is the sister group to Polystichum sensu lato (s.l.). including Cyrtomium. Polystichum as commonly recognized is paraphyletic. Our results lead us to suggest recognizing the clade of earliest diverging Polystichum species as a distinct genus (Cyrtomidictyum) and to continue to recognize Cyrtomium as a separate genus. leaving a monophyletic Polystichum sensu stricto (s.s.).

We first use 22.833 sets of orthologs from the nuclear genomes of 101 genera across land plants to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships. One of the more salient results is the resolution of some enigmatic relationships in seed plant phylogeny. such as the placement of Gnetales as sister to the rest of the gymnosperms. In using this novel phylogenomic approach. we were also able to identify overrepresented functional gene ontology categories in genes that provide positive branch support for major nodes prompting new hypotheses for genes associated with the diversification of angiosperms. For example. RNA interference (RNAi) has played a significant role in the divergence of monocots from other angiosperms. which has experimental support in Arabidopsis and rice. This analysis also implied that the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V (NRPD2) played a prominent role in the divergence of gymnosperms. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of 24nt siRNA in conifers. the maternal control of small RNA in the seeds of flowering plants. and the emergence of double fertilization in angiosperms. Our approach takes advantage of genomic data to define orthologs. reconstruct relationships. and narrow down candidate genes involved in plant evolution within a phylogenomic view of species' diversification.,True,n19ktXAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,145,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002411,9905713063851870379,/scholar?cites=9905713063851870379,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002411,0,0,0

In a consistent analysis of trends from 1980 onwards. the majority of surface waters (38 of 56) showed significant (p ≤0.05) decreasing trends in pollution-derived sulphate. Only two sites showed a significant increase. Nitrate. on the other hand. had a much weaker and more varied pattern. with no significant trend at 35 of 56 sites. decreases at some sites in Scandinavia and Central Europe. and increases at some sites in Italy and the UK. The general reduction in surface water acid anion concentrations has led to increases in acid neutralising capacity (significant at 27 of 56 sites) but has also been offset in part by decreases in base cations. particularly calcium (significant at 26 of 56 sites). indicating that much of the improvement in runoff quality to date has been the result of decreasing ionic strength. Increases in acid neutralising capacity have been accompanied by increases in pH and decreases in aluminium. although fewer trends were significant (pH 19 of 56. aluminium 13 of 53). Increases in pH appear to have been limited in some areas by rising concentrations of organic acids. Within a general trend towards recovery. some inter-regional variation is evident. with recovery strongest in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. moderate in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom. and apparently weakest in Germany.Keywords: acidification. recovery.

Large regions of Europe have received high inputs of inorganic nitrogen for the past 20 - 30 years. with an approximate 20% decline in central and northern Europe during the late 1990s. Nitrate concentrations in streamwaters are related to the amount of N deposition. All sites with less than 10 kgN ha-1 yr-1 deposition have low concentrations of nitrate in streamwater. whereas all sites receiving > 25 kgN ha-1 yr-1 have elevated concentrations. Very few of the sites exhibit significant trends in nitrate concentrations; similar analyses on other datasets also show few significant trends. Nitrogen saturation is thus a process requiring many decades. at least at levels of N deposition typical for Europe. Declines in nitrate concentrations at a few sites may reflect recent declines in N deposition. The overall lack of significant trends in nitrate concentrations in streams in Europe may be the result of two opposing factors. Continued high deposition of nitrogen (above the 10 kgN ha-1 yr-1 threshold) should tend to increase N saturation and give increased nitrate concentrations in run-off. whereas the decline in N deposition over the past 5 – 10 years in large parts of Europe should give decreased nitrate concentrations in run-off. Short and long-term variations in climate affect nitrate concentrations in streamwater and. thus. contribute ""noise"" which masks long-term trends.

Long-term trends in sulphate concentrations and fluxes in precipitation/throughfall and freshwaters of 20 European catchments were analysed to evaluate catchment response to decreasing sulphate deposition. Sulphate deposition in the catchments studied declined by 38-82% during the last decade. Sulphate concentrations in all freshwaters decreased significantly. but acidification reversal was clearly delayed in the German streams. In Scandinavian streams and Czech/Slovakian lakes sulphate concentrations responded quickly to decreased input. Sulphate fluxes in run-off showed no clear trend in Germany and Italy but decreased in Scandinavia. the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The decrease. however. was less than the decline in input fluxes. While long-term sulphate output fluxes from catchments were generally correlated to input fluxes. most catchments started a net release of sulphate during the early 1990s. Release of stored sulphate leads to a delay of acidification reversal and can be caused by four major processes. Desorption and excess mineralisation were regarded as the most important for the catchments investigated. while oxidation and weathering were of lesser importance for the long-term release of sulphate. Input from weathering has to be considered for the Italian catchments. Sulphate fluxes in German catchments. with deeply weathered soils and high soil storage capacity. responded more slowly to decreased deposition than …,True,_DuzFgcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,156,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/5/311/2001/,8845078048031526597,/scholar?cites=8845078048031526597,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/5/311/2001/hess-5-311-2001.pdf,0,0,0

Unlike most of the genus. the eggplant and its relatives are from the Old World; most eggplant wild relatives are from Africa. An informal system for naming eggplant wild relatives largely based on crossing and other biosystematics data has been in use for approximately a decade. This system recognises several forms of two broadly conceived species. S. incanum L. and S. melongena. Recent morphological and molecular work has shown that species-level differences exist between these entities. and a new species-level nomenclature has been identified as necessary for plant breeders and for the maintenance of accurately named germplasm.   Methodology/Principal Findings We examined herbarium specimens from throughout the wild species ranges as part of a larger revision of the spiny solanums of Africa. Based on these morphological and molecular studies. we delimited species in the group to which the common eggplant belongs and constructed identification keys for the group. We also examined the monophyly of the group considered as the eggplant relatives by previous authors.   Conclusions/Significance We recognise ten species in this group: S. aureitomentosum Bitter. S. campylacanthum A.Rich.. S. cerasiferum Dunal. S. incanum L.. S. insanum L.. S. lichtensteinii Willd.. S. linnaeanum Hepper & P.-M.L.Jaeger. S. melongena L..

Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects.

C4 or Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathways represent a fundamental axis of trait variation in plants. with importance at scales from genome to biome. Knowing the distribution of these pathways among wild species is a crucial first step in understanding the patterns and processes of photosynthetic evolution and its role in ecological processes at large scales (eg changes in the composition of biomes under global change).

Counter‐intuitively. many trees do not die during the drought itself. Indeed. observations globally have documented that trees often grow for several years after drought before mortality. A combination of meta‐analysis and tree physiological models demonstrate that optimal carbon allocation after drought explains observed patterns of delayed tree mortality and provides a predictive recovery framework.

Water was applied differentially by drip irrigation at rates of 15%. 25%. 40%. 57%. 71%. 89%. and 107% evapotranspiration (ETc) in 2002. and 28%. 33%. 55%. 74%. 93%. 117%. and 140% ETc in 2003. Each treatment was replicated three times. Olives were harvested on two different dates each year from each of 21 plots. Three of four harvest dates showed a decrease in maturity index with increasing irrigation levels. Oils were made from olive samples collected from each plot and analyzed for oil quality parameters. Total polyphenol levels and oxidative stability decreased as the trees received more water. especially for the three lowest irrigation treatment levels in 2002. but few differences were noted between treatments in 2003 when all the trees were irrigated more heavily. Average oxidative stability was correlated very closely with total polyphenol content with r2 = 0.98 in 2002 and 0.94 in 2003. In 2002. free fatty acid levels increased and peroxide levels were unchanged. but in 2003. free fatty acid levels were unchanged and peroxide levels decreased in treatments receiving more water.

INC.,The term Anthropocene. proposed and increasingly employed to denote the current interval of anthropogenic global environmental change. may be discussed on stratigraphic grounds. A case can be made for its consideration as a formal epoch in that. since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Earth has endured changes sufficient to leave a global stratigraphic signature distinct from that of the Holocene or of previous Pleistocene interglacial phases. encompassing novel biotic. sedimentary. and geochemical change. These changes. although likely only in their initial phases. are sufficiently distinct and robustly established for suggestions of a Holocene–Anthropocene boundary in the recent historical past to be geologically reasonable. The boundary may be defined either via Global Stratigraphic Section and Point (“golden spike”) locations or by adopting a numerical date. Formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility. particularly to earth scientists working on late Holocene successions. This datum. from the perspective of the far future. will most probably approximate a distinctive stratigraphic boundary.,True,w_RIkQwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,854,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/51376303.pdf,868496040708938781,/scholar?cites=868496040708938781,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/51376303.pdf,0,0,0

Depending on the information available. researchers have often used primary calibrations from the fossil record or secondary calibrations from previous molecular dating studies. In analyses of flowering plants. primary calibration data can be obtained from macro- and mesofossils (e.g.. leaves. flowers. and fruits) or microfossils (e.g.. pollen).

The Holocene of the Neotropics is now revealed as a time of some temperature change with precipitation:evaporation ratios fluctuating markedly. Major changes in lake level. ice‐accumulation. and vegetation are indicative of changes both in precipitation and temperature regimes. Although global‐scale forcing mechanisms may underlie some of these changes. e.g. the precessional rhythm. other variability appears to be localised.

Reporte Técnico,5,1-97,,This report presents an overview of the biological conservation of the humid montane forests of Peru’s eastern Andean slopes. The main aim of the report has been to attract more attention to this diverse region and to the natural processes that create and maintain biological diversity. The report also deals with the social. political. and historical forces that have modified these forests through time. A better understanding of the ways in which human land-use affects the montane forests of the Andes might help mitigate the impacts of future development.

In the current study we report on exploitative interspecific interaction between two closely related phloem—feeding species of gall—forming aphids (Homoptera; Pemphigidae; Fordinae). mediated by the supply of photoassimilates from the host plant. Geoica sp. forms a spherical gall on the leaflet midrib of Pistacia palaestina (Anacardiaceae). while Forda formicaria forms crescent—shaped galls on the leaflet margin of the same host plant. Using 14C labeling. we were able to trace the food supply (assimilated carbohydrates) from the leaves to galls of each species. We found that Geoica galls are strong sinks. These galls divert the normal phloem transport of the plant and reduce the amount of assimilates imported by F. formicaria. especially when they are located on the same leaflet.

In conjunction with this. in many instances irrigation with freshwater causes an increase in soil salinity due to overirrigation of agricultural land. inefficient water use and poor drainage of unsuitable soils. The problem of salinity was recognized a long time ago and. due to the importance of irrigated agriculture. numerous efforts have been devoted towards improving crop species for better utilization of saline soils and water. Irrigating plants with saline water is a challenge for practitioners and researchers throughout the world.

1095505,Is xylem cavitation resistance a relevant criterion for screening drought resistance among Prunus species?,2008,Hervé Cochard and S Tete Barigah and Marc Kleinhentz and Amram Eshel,165,Journal of plant physiology,9,976-982,Urban & Fischer,Fruit trees are likely to suffer from the effects of severe drought in the future; however. sound criteria for evaluating the species’ ability to survive these extreme conditions are largely missing. Here. we evaluated the feasibility of using xylem cavitation resistance as a tool for screening Prunus species for drought resistance. Ten different Prunus species were selected to cover a large range of water requirements. from hydrophilic to xerophilic types. Shoot cavitation resistance was evaluated with the new Cavitron technique. At this inter-specific level. cavitation resistance was related to species drought resistance. with xerophilic species being less vulnerable to cavitation. The Cavitron technique enabled species characterization that required a short time and small amounts of plant material. This technique could be used to evaluate the drought resistance of a limited number of fruit tree genotypes.

1095506,Root life span. efficiency. and turnover,2002,David M Eissenstat and Ruth D Yanai,3,Plant roots: the hidden half,,221-238,Marcel Dekker Inc. New York. NY,Like other plant organs. roots have a life history in which they pass from birth to death. The size and population structure of the root system is determined by the birth rate and death rate of the individual roots. The study of root demography is of interest to many disciplines. including crop science. physiology. ecology. and soil science. For example. a better understanding of root demography could enable agronomists and horticulturalists to increase yields while reducing agrochemical inputs. Severe root losses. such as those caused by drought or pathogens. clearly are not conducive to crop production. Growing too many roots. however. may also be undesirable. since large amounts of carbohydrates and mineral nutrients are needed for root growth and maintenance that otherwise might be allocated to photosynthetic organs or harvested parts. An optimization approach suggests that. other things being equal. total plant growth should be greatest when a root system maximizes water and nutrient acquisition per unit resource supplied from the shoot (eg. Thornley. 1998). If roots are produced in the most favorable soil patches and shed when they are no longer efficient in water and nutrient absorption. then production. theoretically. should be maximized.The birth and death of roots also influence plant competition. Root competition can be more intense than shoot competition (Wilson. 1988). Just as perennial structures aboveground can give plants a competitive advantage for light capture. there may be advantages to long-lived roots in the capture of limited soil resources. Resource preemption can be an important component of competitive success …,True,Mmc6vnQAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,130,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=C7daGqhy1N8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA339&dq=info:UfX2fEUaXo4J:scholar.google.com&ots=raCmfGlKjl&sig=9luZ_l_sP3UDVUVs7GBmHAP2jM0,10258665886948193617,/scholar?cites=10258665886948193617,,,0,0,0

Transpiration rates. xylem sap concentration. leaf salt content. recretion rates and rates of salt retranslocation out of the leaves were continuously monitored during three day periods and the salt fluxes in and out of the leaves were calculated.

1095517,Mexican grasses in the United States National Herbarium,1913,Albert Spear Hitchcock,17,,,,Govt. print. off.,During recent years the United States National Herbarium has received large collections of grasses from various parts of North America. Some of the larger genera have been revised and their nomenclature adjusted upon a type basis. It is planned to continue these revisions until all the North American species have been elaborated in this manner. Since revisions ought to include. as a part of the usual taxonomic study. an examination of type specimens. several years must elapse before the task is completed. To meet the more immediate requirements. it seems desirable to prepare a preliminary series of grass floras which. though lacking in completeness and not elaborated wholly upon a type basis. will nevertheless be of service to students of grasses who have not ready access to the scattered literature of the subject.

Often this identification can be made only by examining the type specimen. the original description being inconclusive. Under the American code of botanical nomenclature. a which has been followed by the author of this paper.“the nomenclatorial type of a species or subspecies is the specimen to which the describer originally applied the name in publication.” The procedure indicated by the American code. namely. to appeal to the type specimen when the original description is insufficient to identify the species. has been much misunderstood by European botanists. It has been taken to mean. in the case of the Linnæan herbarium. for example. that a specimen in that herbarium bearing the same name as a species described by Linnæus in his Species Plantarum must be taken as the type of that species regardless of all other considerations. In point of fact. the specimen preserved in the herbarium of Linnæus is often not the type specimen of the species whose name it bears. Linnæus sometimes based a species on the figure and description of an older author. but by mistake placed in his herbarium a specimen belonging to a similar but distinct species. He'sometimes failed to preserve the specimen on which one of his species was based. but later preserved some other specimen incorrectly referred to the species.

1095523,The American bats of the genera Myotis and Pizonyx,1928,Gerrit Smith Miller and Glover Morrill Allen,144,,,,US Government Printing Office,The bats of the genus Myotis. though small and inconspicuous mammals. present many features of unusual interest from the point of view of systematic zoology. At nearly every point in its excessively wide range the genus is represented by several species often puzzlingly alike in superficial appearance though readily distinguishable from each other when the true differential characters are once recognized. As these animals everywhere subsist. so far as known. on small. soft-bodied insects. and their habits appear to be subject to no conspicuous changes from species to species or from district to district. we are forced to regard the process of specific differentiation in the group as a whole as primarily dependent on some other factor than any influence which might be exercised directly by the environment. This is equally true of the species in most genera of bats; but in no other genus do we find the process worked out in so much variety of detail over a territory so nearly world-wide in extent.,True,yL43hvAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,262,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NP8SAAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:tudfljRHu_wJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MVVZWy78sS&sig=fHtgjvKdu2lQvYcM3HfEDwantt0,18211227809389471670,/scholar?cites=18211227809389471670,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NP8SAAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:tudfljRHu_wJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MVVZWy78sS&sig=fHtgjvKdu2lQvYcM3HfEDwantt0,0,0,0
1095524,Catalogue of the Mammals of Western Europe:(Europe Exclusive of Russia) in the Collection of the British Museum,1912,Gerrit Smith Miller,,,,,order of the Trustees,ALTHOUGH the idea of a publication on the Mammals of Europe was suggested many years ago by the late Lord Lilford. who kindly contributed an annual sum towards the collecting necessary for its realization. the possibility of issuing the present Catalogue has mainly grown up from the work which its author. Mr. Gerrit S. Miller. of the United States National Museum at Washington. has for some years been doing independently on the subject. It is true that European Mammals had not been neglected here. and that the collection had begun to grow. both by the help of the Lilford Fund and by the efforts of Major GEH Barrett-Hamilton. who published many papers on the subject. and of Mr. Oldfield Thomas. FRS. who devoted a number of his vacations to collecting in various parts of the Continent.There was. however. no prospect of being in a position to prepare a Catalogue until about 1905. when Mr. Miller arranged to devote his entire time for a considerable period to the study of European Mammals. The opportunity was taken of having the results of this work published here instead of in America. by inducing him to write a British Museum Catalogue; thus utilizing his knowledge. and combining for the purposes of his studies the material of both the American and the British National Museums. Collections were then made in various selected areas. partly by Mr. Miller himself and partly by trained collectors. such as Messrs. A. Robert. C. Mottaz. Rev. S. Gonzalez and N. Gonzalez. the cost of whose services were contributed by friends of the Museum. notably Mr. Oldfield Thomas. the Hon. NC Rothschild and Mr. JIS Whitaker.

1095525,The telescoping of the cetacean skull (with eight plates),1923,Gerrit S Miller,,Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,,,,The skeleton of the cetaceans shows more conspicuously than that of any other group of mammals the simultaneous action of two oppo-site trends of modification: the first toward reduction and elimination of those parts which have been rendered useless by a change from an original mode of life to another of a very dififerent kind. the second toward the extreme remodeling of theparts which remain actively functional under such new conditions. The changes of the second type are those which present thegreatest interest. Among them the most important are shown by the skull. In mammals whose skulls have departed widely from the gen-eralized original form the modifications have usually been made through great changes in the shape or size of individual bones with comparatively little alteration in the mutual contact-relationships of the parts concerned in the process. In the rare instances when such changes of contact-relationship occur. as the extension of the pre-maxillary backward over thefrontal above the orbitin the elephants. or the covering of the parietals by the forward advancing occipital shield in the burrowing rodents of the genus Spalax. the changes are recognizable as exceptions to the general course of modification which the skull is undergoing.

This paper contains a brief synopsis of the results. The classification which we have adopted is based on the fol lowing conception of the evolutionary course followed by the order during its development. This course has been mainly conditioned by the mechanical problem of strengthening a chew ing apparatus in which the unusually important cutting func tion of the incisors is strongly contrasted with the grinding func tion of the cheekteeth; the highest degree of efficiency to be given always to the incisors and in most instances to the cheek teeth as well. The problem has been solved by five sequences of correlated changes in the masseter muscle and the bones to which this muscle is attached.

Ocimum in Africa is represented by two sections: sect. Ocimum and sect. Hierocymum Benth. The type section is divided into two subsections. O. circinatum probably belongs in sect. Ocimum on account of its stamen morphology. but it does not fall into either existing subsection. The calyx and nutlets of O. circinatum suggest that a new subsection should be circumscribed. However. this would be premature as a more extensive survey of related taxa is needed before proposing a new infrageneric classification. It is also suggested that sect.

The ability of metallophytes to tolerate extreme metal concentrations commends them for revegetation of mines and metal‐contaminated sites. Metallophytes can also be exploited in environmental technologies. for example. phytostabilization. phytoremediation. and phytomining. Actions towards conserving metallophyte species are imperative. as metallophytes are increasingly under threat of extinction from mining activity.

Accumulation of foliar Cu and Co to > 300 μg g−1 is exceptionally rare globally. and known principally from the Copperbelt of Central Africa. Cobalt accumulation is also observed in a limited number of nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator plants occurring on ultramafic soils around the world. None of the putative Cu or Co hyperaccumulator plants appears to comply with the fundamental principle of hyperaccumulation. as foliar Cu–Co accumulation is strongly dose‐dependent. Abnormally high plant tissue Cu concentrations occur only when plants are exposed to high soil Cu with a low root to shoot translocation factor.

Dordrecht,The Louisiana red swamp crayfish. Procambarus clarkii. has had a major impact on aquatic ecosystems in Europe and America where it has been introduced for human consumption. In Lake Naivasha. where it was introduced in 1970. it is suspected of causing the complete disappearance of native floating-leaved and submerged plants by 1982 and again by 1996; recovery of submerged plants occurred in between. concurrent with a decline in P. clarkii. Examination of the feeding of P. clarkii by microscopic analysis of gut contents collected from the lake confirmed information from both its native and exotic ranges; that it is an omnivore with green plants and insects the predominant items recognised.

1095562,Ocean surface winds drive dynamics of transoceanic aerial movements,2008,Ángel M Felicísimo and Jesús Muñoz and Jacob González-Solis,3,PLoS one,8,e2928,Public Library of Science,Global wind patterns influence dispersal and migration processes of aerial organisms. propagules and particles. which ultimately could determine the dynamics of colonizations. invasions or spread of pathogens. However. studying how wind-mediated movements actually happen has been hampered so far by the lack of high resolution global wind data as well as the impossibility to track aerial movements. Using concurrent data on winds and actual pathways of a tracked seabird. here we show that oceanic winds define spatiotemporal pathways and barriers for large-scale aerial movements. We obtained wind data from NASA SeaWinds scatterometer to calculate wind cost (impedance) models reflecting the resistance to the aerial movement near the ocean surface. We also tracked the movements of a model organism. the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea). a pelagic bird known to perform long distance migrations. Cost models revealed that distant areas can be connected through “wind highways” that do not match the shortest great circle routes. Bird routes closely followed the low-cost “wind-highways” linking breeding and wintering areas. In addition. we found that a potential barrier. the near surface westerlies in the Atlantic sector of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). temporally hindered meridional trans-equatorial movements. Once the westerlies vanished. birds crossed the ITCZ to their winter quarters. This study provides a novel approach to investigate wind-mediated movements in oceanic environments and shows that large-scale migration and dispersal processes over the oceans can be largely driven by spatiotemporal …,True,0VJHi5MAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,129,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002928,15286669803479715370,/scholar?cites=15286669803479715370,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002928,0,0,0

1095566,Further studies in photoperiodism: the response of the plant to relative length of day and night,1923,WW Garner and HA Allard,,,,,US Government Printing Office,"INTRODUCTION In an earlier paper (7) 2 considerable data were presented tending to show that the length of day exercises a remarkable regulatory action in initiating or inhibiting sexual reproduction in plants. In a number of species studied it was found that ordinarily the plant can attain the flowering and fruiting stages only when the length of day falls within certain limits. so that in such cases flowering and fruiting occur only at certain seasons of the year. In this respect some species and varieties respond to relatively long days while others respond to short days. Moreover. some plants are much more sensitive to change in length of day than are others. In the absence of the particular day length favorable to sexual reproduction vegetative devdopment may continue for a more or less indefinite period. thus frequently leading to the phenomenon of gigantism. It was discovered. also. that exposure to a daily light period intermediate between that favorable only to vegetative development. on the one hand. and that favoring only flowering and fruiting on the other hand. tends to cause both forms of activity to progress simultaneously. This combined form of activity constitutes what is commonly known as the"" everflowering.. or"" everbearing"" behavior. It was suggested that probably the seasonal range in length of day is an important factor in the natural distribution of plants and that in agricultural practise the correct time for planting many crop plants may be largely conditioned by the prevailing length of day. To designate the response of the plant to length of day the term"" photoperiodism"" was suggested. 8 The data on which these conclusions are based …",True,cKV925MAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,613,https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/IND43966624/PDF,5832409154414745232,/scholar?cites=5832409154414745232,,https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/IND43966624/PDF,0,0,0

These contrasted responses seemed to be correlated with the changes in behavior of the different varieties under field conditions with advance of the season. Of the four varieties studied under field conditions in the vicinity of Washington. D. C. the Biloxi consistently behaved as a very late variety. earliest plantings first coming into flower about September 1 and failing to mature seed; the Tokyo was somewhat earlier. the first plantings usually flowering early in August and successfully maturing seed; the Peking flowered about 10 days earlier than the Tokyo. or toward the close of July. being well adapted to the region; the Mandarin behaved as an early variety. flowering 3 to 4 weeks after germination. Thus the normal vegetative periods of early plantings of the four varieties. in the order named. are about 95. 65. 55j and 25 days. respectively.It was found that. when early plantings of the four varieties are exposed to an artificially shortened daylight period of 10 to 12 hours or less. all varieties tend to flower at about the same time. namely. 20 to 25 days after germination. In other words. all behave as early varieties.

Conclusions were based mainly upon tests involving very short days in contrast with the lull length of day or very long days obtained by the use of artificial electric light. As a result. less was known of the upper or lower limits for flowering in members of the two groups than at present. As the work was extended a large mass of observations accumulated. making clearer the behavior of many species and varieties representing numerous families in relation to lengths of day increased by half-hour steps from 8 to 10 hours of light daily. up to the longest day of summer. and even to light periods beyond this point by the use of artificial light after sunset.

1095572,Effect of abnormally long and short alternations of light and darkness on growth and development of plants,1931,Wightman Wells Garner and Harry Ardell Allard,42,,,629-651,United States Department of Agriculture,One of the striking facts developed in the study of plant response to relative length of day and night is that. so far as concerns initiation of flowering and fruiting. darkening the plant for a period m the middle of the day fails to produce the same effects as those resulting from excluding the early morning or late afternoon light. Early in the investigations of the present writers on this subject^ it was shown that in such typical short-day plants as Biloxi soybeans (Soja max (L.) Piper) and Aster Hnariifolius L.. darkening from 10 am to 2 p/m. each day has but little effect in hastening flowering as compared with that produced by exposure to an imbroken short day. Further studies have shown that other short-day plants. as weïl as typical long-day plants. also show a curious indifference to darkening in the middle of the day with respect to flowering and fruiting. even'when the amount of light thus excluded is vastly greater than that excluded with decisive effects in the early morning and late afternoon. These results indicate that. with a given total number of hours of daily illumination. two short periods do not produce the same result as a single unbroken period of illumination. Indeed. the effect of midday darkening is much the same as if the plants remained in the light for the whole day.Another prominent feature of photoperiodic response in plants is that species and varieties differ widely in their sensitivity to change in length of day. Comparatively small changes in day length may exert marked formative action on some plants. while in other plants wide variation in the daily light period may produce only slight quantitative effects.

1095573,OIL CONTENT OF SEEDS AS AFFECTED BY THE,1915,WW Garner and HA Allard and CL Foubert,3,Journal of Agricultural Research,3,227,Department of Agriculture,Although oils and fats are very widely distributed in the plant world. the commercial supply of these products is derived chiefly from a com-paratively small number of species. and in most cases the seeds of these plants furnish the raw material. In general. the oil produced by the plant is usually stored in the seed or other reproductive parts. and for this and other reasons the seed constitutes the most favorable material for a study of the quantitative production of oil in plants.The seed as a rule varies less in composition than other plant parts. as would be inferred when we consider its relatively small size along with the fact that it normally possesses the ability to reproduce in detail the distinctive characters of the parental type. Nevertheless. when grown under widely different conditions. seeds frequently show such marked changes in composition that their agricultural or commercial value is materially affected. The composition of certain seeds. more particularly wheat and other grains. as influenced by environ-ment. has been extensively investigated in so far as relates to their content of protein. carbohydrate. and ash; but no extensive investigation of the oil content of seeds as affected by the various factors of nutrition has thus far been reported.

Among the most distinctive characteristics of clonal plants is their potential for clonal integration (i.e. the translocation of resources between interconnected ramets). suggesting that integration may play a role in their success. However. a general synthesis of effects of clonal integration on plant performance is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of clonal integration on biomass production and asexual reproduction of the whole clone. the recipient part (i.e. the part of a clone that imports resources) and the donor part (i.e. the part of a clone that exports resources). The final dataset contained 389 effect sizes from 84 studies covering 57 taxa. Overall. clonal integration increased performance of recipient parts without decreasing that of donor parts. and thus increased performance of whole clones.

Using meta‐analysis. we examined whether invasive species: (1) incur less damage. (2) exhibit better performance in the presence of enemies. and (3) tolerate damage more than native species. Invasive alien species did not incur less damage than native species overall.

Nevertheless. resources for management are limited. which makes prioritization unavoidable. We present a prioritization framework which can be useful for decision makers as it includes both a scientific impact assessment and the evaluation of impact importance by affected stakeholders. The framework is divided into five steps. namely 1) stakeholder selection and weighting of stakeholder importance by the decision maker. 2) factual description and scoring of changes by scientists. 3) evaluation of the importance of impact categories by stakeholders. 4) calculation of weighted impact categories and 5) calculation of final impact score and decision making.

Modern research. however. does not support this cascade of loss for all natural systems. In this paper we explore the errors in this assumption and present a conceptual model taking a more mechanistic approach to the species–functional trait association in a context of land‐use change. We provide empirical support for our model's predictions demonstrating that the association of species and functional trait diversity follows various trajectories in response to land‐use change. The central premise of our model is that land‐use change impacts upon processes of community assembly. not species per se.

Current theory also predicts that the intense biotic interactions at low latitudes will select plants for greater defence against herbivores. We reviewed the literature to provide an assessment of the evidence for and against the hypothesis that herbivory is more intense at lower latitudes. and that plants from low latitudes are better defended than are plants from high latitudes. 2. Only 37% of the 38 latitudinal comparisons of herbivory showed higher herbivory at lower latitudes. and the average effect size in a meta‐analysis was not significantly different from zero.

Many studies have searched for traits that characterize successful invaders. Unfortunately. very few generalizations have emerged from this work. It seems that the traits of successful invaders are idiosyncratic and context-dependent. Unless we are to study each potential invader in each possible target community individually. we will need a new approach. 2. We introduce a framework for predicting traits that are likely to confer success in a given ecosystem. Our approach considers the prevailing environmental conditions. the traits of resident species. and the traits of potentially invading species. 3. Our approach can be applied to ecosystems where the environmental conditions and/or disturbance regime have recently changed. to predict the range of trait space occupied by (i) native species at risk of local extinction.(ii) native species that can persist under the present conditions. and (iii) successful invaders.

The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However. a general theory of trait-based ecology. that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature). has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory. it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa. such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term ‘Trait Driver Theory’ or TDT.

Reproductive allometry where plant size differences are due to environmental variability has been interpreted both as an adaptive strategy of plant growth and allocation. and as the product of fixed developmental constraints. Patterns of development are crucial in defining reproductive allometry but development is not fixed across individuals. For example. environmental adversity (e.g. resource impoverishment) tends to favor reproduction at relatively small sizes – an adaptive response to environmental adversity. While small individuals may have lower reproductive output than large individuals. all plants should maximize their reproductive output and relative allocation to reproduction may be constant across sizes. Thus. where individual plants within a population initiate reproduction at …,True,WnKu5MkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,121,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143383190800067X,15532498529136758636,/scholar?cites=15532498529136758636,,,0,0,0

1095633,Páramo is the world's fastest evolving and coolest biodiversity hotspot,2013,Santiago Madriñán and Andrés J Cortés and James E Richardson,4,Frontiers in genetics,194,,Frontiers Media SA,Understanding the processes that cause speciation is a key aim of evolutionary biology. Lineages or biomes that exhibit recent and rapid diversification are ideal model systems for determining these processes. Species rich biomes reported to be of relatively recent origin. i.e.. since the beginning of the Miocene. include Mediterranean ecosystems such as the California Floristic Province. oceanic islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago and the Neotropical high elevation ecosystem of the Páramos. Páramos constitute grasslands above the forest tree-line (at elevations of c. 2800–4700 m) with high species endemism. Organisms that occupy this ecosystem are a likely product of unique adaptations to an extreme environment that evolved during the last three to five million years when the Andes reached an altitude that was capable of sustaining this type of vegetation. We compared net diversification rates of lineages in fast evolving biomes using 73 dated molecular phylogenies. Based on our sample. we demonstrate that average net diversification rates of Páramo plant lineages are faster than those of other reportedly fast evolving hotspots and that the faster evolving lineages are more likely to be found in Páramos than the other hotspots. Páramos therefore represent the ideal model system for studying diversification processes. Most of the speciation events that we observed in the Páramos (144 out of 177) occurred during the Pleistocene possibly due to the effects of species range contraction and expansion that may have resulted from the well-documented climatic changes during that period. Understanding these effects will assist with efforts …,True,K9Wwx68AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,277,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2013.00192/full?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Genetics-w43-2013,10965008093917408837,/scholar?cites=10965008093917408837,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2013.00192/full?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Genetics-w43-2013,0,0,0

With that in mind. an ecological diversity study was conducted based on the geographical origin of 104 wild common bean accessions to estimate drought tolerance in their natural habitats. Our wild population sample covered a range of mesic to very dry habitats from Mexico to Argentina. Two potential evapotranspiration models that considered the effects of temperature and radiation were coupled with the precipitation regimes of the last fifty years for each collection site based on geographical information system analysis. We found that wild accessions were distributed among different precipitation regimes following a latitudinal gradient and that habitat ecological diversity of the collection sites was associated with natural sub-populations. We also detected a broader geographic distribution of wild beans across ecologies compared to cultivated common beans in a reference collection of 297 cultivars. Habitat drought stress index based on the Thornthwaite potential evapotranspiration model was equivalent to the Hamon estimator. Both ecological drought stress indexes would be useful together with population structure for the genealogical analysis of gene families in common bean. for genome-wide genetic-environmental associations. and for postulating the evolutionary history and diversification processes that have occurred for the species. Finally. we propose that wild common bean should be taken into account to exploit variation for drought tolerance in cultivated common bean which is generally …,True,K9Wwx68AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,71,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062898,16983389121442219205,/scholar?cites=16983389121442219205,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062898,0,0,0

Hypericum (St. John’s wort). with over 65% of its Neotropical species. has a center of diversity in these high Mountain ecosystems. Using nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of a broad sample of New World Hypericum species we investigate phylogenetic patterns. estimate divergence times. and provide the first insights into diversification rates within the genus in the Neotropics. Two lineages appear to have independently dispersed into South America around 3.5 Ma ago. one of which has radiated in the páramos (Brathys). We find strong support for the polyphyly of section Trigynobrathys. several species of which group within Brathys. while others are found in temperate lowland South America (Trigynobrathys s.str.). All páramo species of Hypericum group in one clade. Within these páramo Hypericum species enormous phenotypic evolution has taken place (life forms from arborescent to prostrate shrubs) evidently in a short time frame. We hypothesize multiple mechanisms to be responsible for the low differentiation in the ITS region contrary to the high morphological diversity found in Hypericum in the páramos. Amongst these may be ongoing hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. as well as the putative adaptive radiation. which can explain the contrast between phenotypic diversity and the close phylogenetic relationships.,True,K9Wwx68AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,60,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2013.00175/full,11780890802674292754,/scholar?cites=11780890802674292754,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2013.00175/full,0,0,0

Caesalpinioideae). A survey on the phenology and reproductive biology of Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. was carried out in a cerradão area at Fazenda Capim Branco. Uberlândia. MG. Flowering occurs during the rain season and seed dispersal during the dry season. Flowers are pale-green. 0.5 cm in diameter. weakly zigomorphic and organized in paniculate inflorescences. They are highly odoriferous. one-day flowers. Anthesis begins at about 5: 00 h. The nectar production is very small (0.2 ml) with 49% of sucrose equivalents. The most frequent flower visitors and pollinators were Apis mellifera. Scaptotrigona cf. depiles and Trigona spinipes bees. Controlled hand-pollinations showed that the species is mostly self-sterile and non-apomictic. However. pollen tubes were observed growing down to the ovary and penetrating the ovules in self-pollinated pistils. a fact which suggests late-acting self-sterility phenomena or inbreeding depression. Fruit-set was always low and related to low flower to fruit conversion. may be due to inefficient pollination and fruit predation.RESUMO–(Biologia reprodutiva de Copaifera langsdorffii Desf.(Leguminosae.

However. the workload required for classic taxonomic surveys remains high and is particularly problematic for megadiverse tropical forests.  Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a comprehensive census of all trees in two hectares of a tropical forest in French Guiana. we examined whether plant DNA barcoding could contribute to increasing the quality and the pace of tropical plant biodiversity surveys. Of the eight plant DNA markers we tested (rbcLa. rpoC1. rpoB. matK. ycf5. trnL. psbA-trnH. ITS). matK and ITS had a low rate of sequencing success. More critically. none of the plastid markers achieved a rate of correct plant identification greater than 70%. either alone or combined. The performance of all barcoding markers was noticeably low in few species-rich clades. such as the Laureae. and the Sapotaceae. A field test of the approach enabled us to detect 130 molecular operational taxonomic units in a sample of 252 juvenile trees. Including molecular markers increased the identification rate of juveniles from 72% (morphology alone) to 96% (morphology and molecular) of the individuals assigned to a known tree taxon.  Conclusion/Significance We conclude that while DNA barcoding is an invaluable tool for detecting errors in identifications and for identifying plants at juvenile stages. its limited ability to identify collections will constrain the practical implementation of DNA-based tropical plant biodiversity programs.,True,_cExHtwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,242,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007483,8942458199812739506,/scholar?cites=8942458199812739506,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007483,0,0,0
1095688,Revealing the demographic histories of species using DNA sequences,2001,Brent C Emerson and Emmanuel Paradis and Christophe Thébaud,16,,12,707-716,Elsevier Current Trends,Various methodological approaches using molecular sequence data have been developed and applied across several fields. including phylogeography. conservation biology. virology and human evolution. The aim of these approaches is to obtain predictive estimates of population history from DNA sequence data that can then be used for hypothesis testing with empirical data. This recent work provides opportunities to evaluate hypotheses of constant population size through time. of population growth or decline. of the rate of growth or decline. and of migration and growth in subdivided populations. At the core of many of these approaches is the extraction of information from the structure of phylogenetic trees to infer the demographic history of a population. and underlying nearly all methods is coalescent theory.

However. there are few cases where it has been possible to define an appropriate genotypic space for a range of species. Here we address this problem by defining a genetically controlled space that captures variation in shape and size between closely related species of Antirrhinum. The axes of the space are based on an allometric model of leaves from an F2 of an interspecific cross between Antirrhinum majus and Antirrhinum charidemi. Three principal components were found to capture most of the genetic variation in shape and size. allowing a three-dimensional allometric space to be defined.

A hybrid zone between morphs showed a steep cline specifically at genes controlling flower color differences. indicating that these loci are under selection. Antirrhinum species with diverse floral phenotypes formed a U-shaped cloud within the genotypic space. We propose that this cloud defines an evolutionary path that allows flower color to evolve while circumventing less-adaptive regions.

The present distribution of this species showed that it spread along the river system at an average rate of 970 m/yr.

Despite Madagascar’s extreme isolation from India and proximity to Africa. a high proportion of the biota of the Madagascar region has Asian affinities. This pattern has rarely been viewed as surprising. as it is consistent with Gondwanan vicariance. Molecular phylogenetic data provide strong support for such Asian affinities. but often not for their vicariant origin; most divergences between lineages in Asia and the Madagascar region post‐date the separation of India and Madagascar considerably (up to 87 Myr). implying a high frequency of dispersal that mirrors colonization of the Hawaiian archipelago in distance.

Brazil. The objective was to understand: (1) how numbers and composition of the soil seed bank change as the forest regrows. and (2) how such changes affect the species available for regeneration if forests of different ages are cut down. In each forest stand (5. 18. 27-yr-old and a mature forest). 57 soil samples were collected (0-2.5 and 2.5-5 cm deep). Viable seed density of herbaceous species ranged between 11.003 seeds. m-2 (5-yr-old vegetation) and 482 (mature forest). and between 25 (5-yr-old vegetation) and 389 seeds. m-2 (mature forest) for woody plant species in the 0-5 cm soil layer. suggesting a decrease in seed stocks in the course of forest regeneration. Seeds buried in the 0-2.5 cm soil layer represented between 56.9% and 67.4% of all viable seeds. Most of the viable seeds belonged to weeds of Asteraceae. Poaceae. Malvaceae and Solanaceae. The results provide evidence that. in forests of different ages. the soil does not store seeds of the same key ecological groups involved in the regeneration of Atlantic forest.

In this study we model the present and future predicted distribution of indigenous Arabica. and identify priorities in order to facilitate appropriate decision making for conservation. monitoring and future research. Using distribution data we perform bioclimatic modelling and examine future distribution with the HadCM3 climate model for three emission scenarios (A1B. A2A. B2A) over three time intervals (2020. 2050. 2080). The models show a profoundly negative influence on indigenous Arabica. In a locality analysis the most favourable outcome is a c. 65% reduction in the number of pre-existing bioclimatically suitable localities. and at worst an almost 100% reduction. by 2080. In an area analysis the most favourable outcome is a 38% reduction in suitable bioclimatic space. and the least favourable a c. 90% reduction. by 2080.

The coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei). the most important pest of coffee worldwide. has already benefited from the temperature rise in East Africa: increased damage to coffee crops and expansion in its distribution range have been reported. In order to anticipate threats and prioritize management actions for H. hampei we present here. maps on future distributions of H. hampei in coffee producing areas of East Africa. Using the CLIMEX model we relate present-day insect distributions to current climate and then project the fitted climatic envelopes under future scenarios A2A and B2B (for HADCM3 model). In both scenarios. the situation with H. hampei is forecasted to worsen in the current Coffea arabica producing areas of Ethiopia. the Ugandan part of the Lake Victoria and Mt. Elgon regions. Mt. Kenya and the Kenyan side of Mt. Elgon. and most of Rwanda and Burundi. The calculated hypothetical number of generations per year of H. hampei is predicted to increase in all C. arabica-producing areas from five to ten. These outcomes will have serious implications for C. arabica production and livelihoods in East Africa. We suggest that the best way to adapt to a rise of temperatures in coffee plantations could be via the introduction of shade trees in sun grown plantations.

Commercially pure magnesium was deformed at 250 °C through the routes A. BC and C up to four passes. Texture evolution was found to follow a different course for different routes of ECAE. In general. the ECAE textures were asymmetric. An average grain size of 6–8 μm could be achieved after four passes. The improved cold formability in the present investigation has been attributed to the initial non-basal texture and grain refinement introduced by ECAE. The textures introduced by ECAE may be beneficial for cold rolling characteristics of magnesium.,True,U3ePF7AAAAAJ:KsHrIg64uVUC,167,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092150930700812X,13725223258343412525,/scholar?cites=13725223258343412525,,,0,0,0

We studied the effect of siRNA on larval development by selective targeting of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene of Helicoverpa armigera. Chemically synthesized siRNA molecules were directly fed to H. armigera larvae along with the artificial diet. The siRNA treatment resulted in specific gene silencing of AChE and consequently brought about mortality. growth inhibition of larvae. reduction in the pupal weight. malformation and drastically reduced fecundity as compared to control larvae.

UV-B radiations are known to have damaging effects on all forms of life. In plants. the UV-B exposure leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). eventually resulting in oxidative stress. ROS induce lipid peroxidation of biological membranes. destroy the natural lipid-soluble antioxidants. and alter the expression of several genes through nonspecific signaling pathways. The integration of the thylakoid membrane appears to be much more sensitive than the activities of the photosynthetic components bound within. However. the decrease of mRNA transcripts in the photosynthetic complexes and other chloroplast proteins are among the early events of UV-B damage.

Lacks of implementation of environmental regulations are contributing to the bad air quality of most of the Indian cities. Air pollutants produced in any air shed are not completely confined. but at time trespassing all the geographical boundaries. hence donot remain only a problem of urban centres. but spread and affect remote rural areas supporting large productive agricultural land.Air pollutants pose risks on yield of crops depending on the emission pattern. atmospheric transport and leaf uptake and on the plant’s biochemical defense capacity. Recent trends have shown decrease in SO2 emissions. but increase in NO2 emission due to more number of automobiles. In past few decades. tropospheric O3 has been identified as a most important air pollutant of rural areas. Air pollutants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). which adversely affect biochemical processes of plants and reduce their tolerance capacity to other stresses also. Several vital physiological processes such as photosynthetic CO2 fixation and energy metabolism are also affected negatively by air pollutants. An adverse effect caused by air pollutants depends not only upon its concentration. but also on the duration and combination of air pollutants.

To achieve this overarching goal. the GSPC has established a series of targets. one of which is to ensure that plant diversity is well understood. so that it can be effectively conserved and used in a sustainable manner. Brazil hosts more than 46.000 species of plants. algae and fungi. representing one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth. and playing a key role in the GSPC. To meet the GSPC goals of Target 1 and facilitate access to plant diversity. Brazil committed to preparing the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora (2008-2015) and the Brazilian Flora 2020 (2016-present). Managing all the information associated with such great biodiversity has proven to be an extremely challenging task. Here. we synthesize the history of these projects. focusing on the multidisciplinary and collaborative approach adopted to develop and manage the inclusion of all the knowledge generated though digital information systems.

We recorded 189 species of Mimosa. 74% restricted to the biome and 26% in other areas; 8% are endangered. Grid rectangles of 1° × 1° 30′ within continuous Cerrado were scored for Mimosa species. Similarity matrixes using the Jaccard coefficient were assessed using UPGMA clustering and nonmetric multidimensional scaling; this produced 12 floristic provinces. Centers of diversity overlapped with centers of endemism at the spatial scale of this analysis; 48% of the species are narrow endemics and were registered to 28 (22%) of the grid rectangles. Mimosa is proposed as an indicator taxon of highland plant endemism within the Cerrado. as several Mimosa-inferred centers of endemism are also major centers of highland endemism.

In very old. wet forests. nearly every tree surface. from outermost twigs to thick branches and the main trunk. is covered by epiphytes. An arboreal botanist faced with this diversity quickly realizes that these plants are not uniformly distributed across tree surfaces and that most of the species seldom. if ever. grow on the forest floor below. Many epiphytes. including all of the lichens and bryophytes. are poikilohydric organisms. Their survival in the canopy depends on an ability to become dormant when humidity is low. with physiological activity resuming only upon rehydration by atmospheric moisture. In this chapter. we focus on the ecology of epiphytic lichens and bryophytes. After introducing the organisms. we describe their distributions along environmental gradients. summarize biotic interactions. discuss the strong associations between some species and old-growth forests. evaluate their roles in forest ecosystems. and consider their conservation in an uncertain future.

This work started in 2010. with the publication of the Plants and Fungi Catalogue. and has been updated since by more than 430 specialists working online. Brazil is home to 32.086 native Angiosperms and 23 native Gymnosperms. showing an increase of 3% in its species richness in relation to 2010. The Amazon Rainforest is the richest Brazilian biome for Gymnosperms. while the Atlantic Rainforest is the richest one for Angiosperms. There was a considerable increment in the number of species and endemism rates for biomes. except for the Amazon that showed a decrease of 2.5% of recorded endemics. However. well over half of Brazillian seed plant species (57.4%) is endemic to this territory. The proportion of life-forms varies among different biomes: trees are more expressive in the Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest biomes while herbs predominate in the Pampa. and lianas are more expressive in the Amazon.

However. in 1932. Otto Degener suggested that the yellow passion fruit had its origin in Australia through breeding. calling it P. edulis forma flavicarpa. and that it could be distinguished by the color of the fruit. the deeper shade of purple of the corona. and the presence of glands on the sepals. These distinctions do not support themselves. for the glands are common to the species (although they may be absent). and the corona has a wide range of colors. regardless of the color of the fruit. A more critical ingredient is the fact that the external coloration of the fruit is a character of complex inheritance and is not dominant. thus displaying a number of intermediate colors. making it difficult to identify the extreme colors. For the correct scientific naming of agricultural plants. the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature must be used in conjunction with the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. with the selections with significant agronomic characteristics recognized and named cultivars.

Called Gobero. this suite of closely spaced sites chronicles the rapid pace of biosocial change in the southern Sahara in response to severe climatic fluctuation.  Methodology/Principal Findings Two main occupational phases are identified that correspond with humid intervals in the early and mid-Holocene. based on 78 direct AMS radiocarbon dates on human remains. fauna and artifacts. as well as 9 OSL dates on paleodune sand. The older occupants have craniofacial dimensions that demonstrate similarities with mid-Holocene occupants of the southern Sahara and Late Pleistocene to early Holocene inhabitants of the Maghreb. Their hyperflexed burials compose the earliest cemetery in the Sahara dating to ∼7500 B.C.E. These early occupants abandon the area under arid conditions and. when humid conditions return ∼4600 B.C.E.. are replaced by a more gracile people with elaborated grave goods including animal bone and ivory ornaments.  Conclusions/Significance The principal significance of Gobero lies in its extraordinary human. faunal. and archaeological record. from which we conclude the following:   The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6200 B.C.E.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites that include the earliest recorded cemetery in the Sahara.

1095824,Pollen stratigraphy of sediment sequences from lakes Albano and Nemi (near Rome) and from the central Adriatic. spanning the interval from oxygen isotope stage 2 to present day,1996,John J Lowe and Carla A Accorsi and M Bandini Mazzanti and Alex Bishop and Sander Van der Kaars and Luisa Forlani and Anna M Mercuri and Cecilia Rivalenti and Paola Torri and Clare Watson,55,MEMORIE-ISTITUTO ITALIANO DI IDROBIOLOGIA,,71-98,INSTITUTO ITALIANO DI IDROBIOLOGIA,Pollen-stratigraphic data are presented for sediment cores obtained from the floor of two crater lakes situated close to Rome (Lake Albano and Lake Nemi) and from 4 sediment cores recovered from the floor of the Central Adriatic Sea. Lake Albano sequence spans the interval from OIS 2 to the present time. while that from the Lake Nemi provides a detailed record of the Holocene. The longest of the Central Adriatic cores probably extends back to before the last glacial maximum. though the precise age of the base of the sequence is unknown. Two other core sequences span the Lateglacial and Holocene. while the fourth provides a high-resolution record of the mid-to late-Holocene. The results are compared with the recently-published pollen-stratigraphic data from Lago Grande di Monticchio (Watts et al. 1996) and also with a number of other published pollen records obtained from sites in Italy and adjacent marine basins. It is shown that the new pollen data are not only internally consistent. but also show strong resemblances to previously-published pollen records from both terrestrial and marine sites. Pollen stratigraphy thus provides a basis for the correlation and relative dating of lake and marine sequences. For these purposes. a number of very clear pollen-stratigraphic ‘marker’horizons can be recognised. These include (i) a series of very abrupt fluctuations in pollen concentrations during the last (Würm) glacial maximum.(ii) the expansion of deciduous trees at the onset of the Lateglacial period.(iii) the revertance to steppic plant associations during the Younger Dryas cold oscillation.(iv) the marked expansion of a number of tree types at the …,True,0uG7uRoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,130,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Maria_Mercuri/publication/285746187_Pollen_stratigraphy_of_sediment_sequences_from_lakes_Albano_and_Nemi_near_Rome_and_from_the_central_Adriatic_spanning_the_interval_from_oxygen_isotope_Stage_2_to_the_present_day/links/56d5a87308ae5c281ca44f6d/Pollen-stratigraphy-of-sediment-sequences-from-lakes-Albano-and-Nemi-near-Rome-and-from-the-central-Adriatic-spanning-the-interval-from-oxygen-isotope-Stage-2-to-the-present-day.pdf,937040596497298556,/scholar?cites=937040596497298556,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Maria_Mercuri/publication/285746187_Pollen_stratigraphy_of_sediment_sequences_from_lakes_Albano_and_Nemi_near_Rome_and_from_the_central_Adriatic_spanning_the_interval_from_oxygen_isotope_Stage_2_to_the_present_day/links/56d5a87308ae5c281ca44f6d/Pollen-stratigraphy-of-sediment-sequences-from-lakes-Albano-and-Nemi-near-Rome-and-from-the-central-Adriatic-spanning-the-interval-from-oxygen-isotope-Stage-2-to-the-present-day.pdf,0,0,0

Here we collate taxonomically verified checklists to present a list of seed plant species from lowland Amazon rain forests. Our list comprises 14.003 species. of which 6.727 are trees. These figures are similar to estimates derived from nonparametric ecological models. but they contrast strongly with predictions of much higher tree diversity derived from parametric models. Based on the known proportion of tree species in neotropical lowland rain forest communities as measured in complete plot censuses. and on overall estimates of seed plant diversity in Brazil and in the neotropics in general. it is more likely that tree diversity in the Amazon is closer to the lower estimates derived from nonparametric models.

1095833,Brazilian Flora 2020: Innovation and collaboration to meet Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC),2018,BFG,69,Rodriguésia,,1513-1527,,The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) was established by the Conference of Parties in 2002 to decrease the loss of plant diversity. reduce poverty and contribute to sustainable development. To achieve this overarching goal. the GSPC has established a series of targets. one of which is to ensure that plant diversity is well understood. so that it can be effectively conserved and used in a sustainable manner. Brazil hosts more than 46.000 species of plants. algae and fungi. representing one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth. and playing a key role in the GSPC. To meet the GSPC goals of Target 1 and facilitate access to plant diversity. Brazil committed to preparing the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora (2008-2015) and the Brazilian Flora 2020 (2016-present). Managing all the information associated with such great biodiversity has proven to be an extremely challenging task. Here. we synthesize the history of these projects. focusing on the multidisciplinary and collaborative approach adopted to develop and manage the inclusion of all the knowledge generated though digital information systems.

Phylogenetic studies in the family have also progressed steadily. For this study. a parsimony analysis was carried out using all rbcL sequences currently available for Cyperaceae. including data for two new genera. One of the four subfamilies (Caricoideae) and seven of the 14 tribes (Bisboeckelereae. Cariceae. Cryptangieae. Dulichieae. Eleocharideae. Sclerieae. Trilepideae) are monophyletic. Subfamily Mapanioideae and tribe Chrysitricheae are monophyletic if. as the evidence suggests. Hellmuthia is considered a member of Cypereae. Some other features of our analysis include: well-supported Trilepideae and Sclerieae–Bisboeckelereae clades; a possible close relationship between Cryptangieae and Schoeneae; polyphyletic tribes Schoeneae and Scirpeae; the occurrence of Cariceae within the Dulichieae–Scirpeae clade. and a strongly supported clade. representing Cyperus and allied genera in Cypereae. sister to a poorly supported Ficinia–Hellmuthia–Isolepis–Scirpoides clade. Such patterns are consistent with other studies based on DNA sequence data. One outcome may be that only two subfamilies. Mapanioideae and Cyperoideae. are recognized.

1095850,Floristic and vegetational aspects of an inselberg in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil,2009,P Gomes and M Alves,66,Edinburgh Journal of Botany,2,329,Cambridge University Press,Inselbergs are rocky environments that support a unique flora distinct from that of the surrounding area. The objectives of this work were to conduct a floristic inventory of an inselberg in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil. and to investigate the relationship between its flora and the flora of the surrounding area. The following questions were addressed: is the species richness comparable to other inselbergs in northeastern Brazil; is the floristic composition of the inselberg more similar to other inselbergs or to the surrounding Caatinga vegetation; and do the similarities in the floristic composition of inselbergs depend on the distance between them? This work documents 201 species in 62 families. Cyperaceae (28 spp.). Euphorbiaceae (19). Poaceae (15). Orchidaceae (11) and Bromeliaceae (9) are the most species-rich families.

With many elements of the major branching sequence of phylogeny established. a revised suprafamilial classification of flowering plants becomes both feasible and desirable. Here we present a classification of 462 flowering plant families in 40 putatively monophyletic orders and a small number of monophyletic. informal higher groups. The latter are the monocots. commelinoids. eudicots. core eudicots. rosids including eurosids I and II. and asterids including euasterids I and II. Under these informal groups there are also listed a number of families without assignment to order.

Brazil hosts more than 46.000 species of plants. algae and fungi. representing one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth. and playing a key role in the GSPC. To meet the GSPC goals of Target 1 and facilitate access to plant diversity. Brazil committed to preparing the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora (2008-2015) and the Brazilian Flora 2020 (2016-present). Managing all the information associated with such great biodiversity has proven to be an extremely challenging task. Here. we synthesize the history of these projects. focusing on the multidisciplinary and collaborative approach adopted to develop and manage the inclusion of all the knowledge generated though digital information systems.

Because most C4 plants are grasses. studies of the origin of C4 are intimately tied to studies of the origin of the grasses. We present here a phylogeny of the grass family. based on nuclear and chloroplast genes. and calibrated with six fossils. We find that the earliest origins of C4 likely occurred about 32 million years ago (Ma) in the Oligocene. coinciding with a reduction in global CO2 levels. After the initial appearance of C4 species. photosynthetic pathway changed at least 15 more times; we estimate nine total origins of C4 from C3 ancestors. at least two changes of C4 subtype. and five reversals to C3.

Though broad-scale mapping is based primarily on remote sensing data. the accuracy of resulting forest carbon stock estimates depends critically on the quality of field measurements and calibration procedures. The mismatch in spatial scales between field inventory plots and larger pixels of current and planned remote sensing products for forest biomass mapping is of particular concern. as it has the potential to introduce errors. especially if forest biomass shows strong local spatial variation. Here. we used 30 large (8–50 ha) globally distributed permanent forest plots to quantify the spatial variability in aboveground biomass density (AGBD in Mg ha–1) at spatial scales ranging from 5 to 250 m (0.025–6.25 ha). and to evaluate the implications of this variability for calibrating remote sensing products using simulated remote sensing footprints. We found that local spatial variability in AGBD is large for standard plot sizes. averaging 46.3% for replicate 0.1 ha subplots within a single large plot. and 16.6% for 1 ha subplots. AGBD showed weak spatial autocorrelation at distances of 20–400 m. with autocorrelation higher in sites with higher topographic variability and statistically significant in half of the sites. We further show that when field calibration plots are smaller than the remote sensing pixels. the high local spatial variability in AGBD leads to a substantial ""dilution"" bias in calibration parameters. a …",True,kpTfZvoAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,99,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/6827/2014/,13239017893890791640,/scholar?cites=13239017893890791640,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/6827/2014/bg-11-6827-2014.pdf,0,0,0

DNA of historical samples is difficult to extract. and the extracts are seldom of good quality. The quality of DNA obtained was estimated by using a spectrophotometer to measure the A260/280 absorbance ratio. The total DNA yield was measured by a fluorometer. The results indicate the success of using both mixer mill grinding and a DNeasy Plant Kit. Another extraction protocol (grinding with mortar and pestle. using liquid nitrogen) yielded DNA from many samples. Modified CTAB extraction. with a lengthy precipitation. usually provided good amounts of DNA.

Ten diversity zones in categories within the spectrum of less than 100 species and more than 5 000 species per 10 000 km2 have been considered and mapped by ten colour indicators. Furthermore. some different approaches to the largescale mapping of biodiversity are reviewed.

Based on the existing literature. a terminology for the classification of plants according to the mode and time of their first occurrence in the study area. and for the respective diversities. is introduced. It is particularly important to distinguish between the autodiversity. ie the diversity of indigenous plants (autophytes). and the allodiversity. ie the diversity of plants introduced by man (allophytes). In addition. for other purposes it is more important to distinguish between the eudiversity. ie the diversity of autophytes and plants introduced with the former continuous migration of man (archaeophytes). and the neodiversity. ie the diversity of plants dispersed by man over large distances. usually resulting in distribution gaps (neophytes). Neodiversity is increased tremendously by neoterodiversity. ie the diversity of plants dispersed in the context of motorised mass transportation since the end of the last century (neoterophytes.“invaders”).,True,xyXv2eAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,203,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jens_Mutke/publication/215672839_Terminological_and_methodological_aspects_of_the_mapping_and_analysis_of_global_biodiversity/links/57c5338208aecd4514157c0b/Terminological-and-methodological-aspects-of-the-mapping-and-analysis-of-global-biodiversity.pdf,18051027296793273885,/scholar?cites=18051027296793273885,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jens_Mutke/publication/215672839_Terminological_and_methodological_aspects_of_the_mapping_and_analysis_of_global_biodiversity/links/57c5338208aecd4514157c0b/Terminological-and-methodological-aspects-of-the-mapping-and-analysis-of-global-biodiversity.pdf,0,0,0

Most recent studies of these belowground dynamics have used one of two methodological strategies. In one approach. based on analysis of carbon isotopes. the persistence of carbon is inferred; in the other. based on direct observations of roots with cameras. the longevity of individual roots is measured. We show that the contribution of fine roots to the global carbon cycle has been overstated because observations of root lifetimes systematically overestimate the turnover of fine-root biomass.

In this study we investigated the fungal communities associated with roots of D. octopetala in alpine sites in Norway and in the High Arctic on Svalbard. where we aimed to reveal whether the fungal diversity and species composition varied across the Alpine and Arctic regions. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA was used to identify the fungal communities from bulk root samples obtained from 24 plants. A total of 137 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected (using 97% similarity cut off during sequence clustering) and well-known ECM genera such as Cenococcum. Cortinarius. Hebeloma. Inocybe and Tomentella occurred frequently. There was no decrease in fungal diversity with increasing latitude. The overall spatial heterogeneity was high. but a weak geographical structuring of the composition of OTUs in the root systems was observed. Calculated species accumulation curves did not level off. This study indicates that the diversity of fungi associated with D. octopetala does not decrease in high latitude arctic regions. which contrasts observations made in a wide spectrum of other organism groups. A high degree of patchiness was observed across root systems. but the fungal communities were nevertheless weakly spatially structured. Non-asymptotical species accumulation curves and the occurrence of a high number of singletons indicated that only a small fraction of the fungal diversity was detected.,True,_aCE2s0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,107,https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-10-244,15923042239007729530,/scholar?cites=15923042239007729530,,https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-10-244,0,0,0

For Romerolagus diazi (volcano rabbit). the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700 m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation. as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare). we modelled the British metapopulation.

We found that. for butterfly and plant species in Europe. and for bird species in the Western Hemisphere. such areas coincide with regions that have rare climates. and are higher and colder areas than surrounding regions. Species with small range sizes also tend to occur in climatically diverse regions. where species are likely to have been buffered from extinction in the past. We suggest that the centres of high small-range species richness we examined predominantly represent interglacial relict areas where cold-adapted species have been able to survive unusually warm periods in the last ca 10 000 years.

This idea has given rise to numerous hypotheses explaining “invasion success” by virtue of altered ecological and evolutionary pressures. There are surprisingly few data. however. testing the underlying assumption that the performance of introduced populations. including organism size. reproductive output. and abundance. is enhanced in their introduced compared to their native range. Here. we combined data from published studies to test this hypothesis for 26 plant and 27 animal species that are considered to be invasive.

Parasitic infections (and at times. their absence) are thought to be a key component in the success and impact of biological invasions by plants and animals. They can facilitate or limit invasions. and positively or negatively impact native species.  Parasites have not only direct effects on their hosts. but also indirect effects on the species with which their hosts interact. Indirect effects include density‐mediated effects (resulting from parasite‐induced reduction in host reproduction and survival) as well as trait‐mediated indirect effects (resulting from parasite‐induced changes in host phenotype. behaviour or life history). These effects are not mutually exclusive but often interact.

Likewise. they are increasingly important economically and environmentally as pests. Obtaining generalizations about the tiny fraction of immigrant taxa that become successful invaders has been frustrated by two enigmatic phenomena. Many of those species that become successful only do so (i) after an unusually long lag time after initial arrival. and/or (ii) after multiple introductions. We propose an evolutionary mechanism that may account for these observations. Hybridization between species or between disparate source populations may serve as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness.

Alongside commonly used arbitrarily amplified DNA markers. other methods have been developed. Targeted fingerprinting marker techniques are based on the well-established practices of arbitrarily amplified DNA methods. but employ novel methodological innovations such as the incorporation of gene or promoter elements in the primers. These markers provide good reproducibility and increased resolution by the concurrent incidence of dominant and co-dominant bands. Despite their promising features. these semi-random markers suffer from possible problems of collision and non-homology analogous to those found with randomly generated fingerprints.

These consecutive gene blocks. consisting of several regions. are widely applied in plant phylogenetics. The regions coding for the subunits of the rRNA have the lowest rate of evolution. Also the spacer regions like the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and external transcribed spacers (ETS) are widely utilized in phylogenetics. The fact. that these regions are present in many copies in the plant genome is an advantage for laboratory practice but might be problem for phylogenetic analysis.

Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects.

Hidden semi-Markov chains are particularly useful to model the succession of homogeneous zones or segments along sequences. A discrete hidden semi-Markov chain is composed of a nonobservable state process. which is a semi-Markov chain. and a discrete output process. Hidden semi-Markov chains generalize hidden Markov chains and enable the modeling of various durational structures. From an algorithmic point of view. a new forward-backward algorithm is proposed whose complexity is similar to that of the Viterbi algorithm in terms of sequence length (quadratic in the worst case in time and linear in space).

This methodology is implemented in the AMAPmod software. which provides the user with various tools for encoding. exploring and modelling plants. In a typical experiment. botanical structures of plants are measured in the field. possibly at different scales of detail. These structures are encoded using a dedicated language in a coding file. From this description. a formal representation of the plant structures can be built by the AMAPmod software. This model of the plant structures can represent several plants. both at different scales (eg internode scale and branching system scale) and at different dates. The AMAPmod software provides a natural feedback on the measured plants by creating realistic 3D graphical reconstructions. The user can then interact with this formal representation of real plants using the AMAPmod querying language. Various types of data can thus be extracted at different levels of complexity. From the extracted samples of data. models belonging to different families can be estimated. Some of these models are used as analysis tools in order to reveal levels of organisation which cannot be studied efficiently using only direct observations. Such a methodology introduces new perspectives in agronomy by giving a central role to the structure of plants.(Résumé d'auteur),True,1IZHN3wAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,152,https://agritrop.cirad.fr/389699/,7567186652323315401,/scholar?cites=7567186652323315401,,,0,0,0

In AMAPmod. plant architectures are represented by a formal model. called MTG. which is the cen-tral data structure of the system. A dedicated querying language AML enables the user to access plant architecture data with efficient built-in primitives. By combining these primitives. the user can extract various types of data that preserve a more or less important part of the structural information of the plant. Specific statistical tools have been designed to analyse data samples extracted from the plant architectures. Most of these tools. ranging from (hidden) Markovian models to dynamic programming comparison techniques. apply to samples of sequences. AMAPmod methodology is illustrated on an actual-scale example concerning a hybrid family of apple trees.(© Inra/Elsevier.

1096035,An auxin transport-based model of root branching in Arabidopsis thaliana,2008,Mikaël Lucas and Yann Guédon and Christian Jay-Allemand and Christophe Godin and Laurent Laplaze,3,PLoS One,11,e3673,Public Library of Science,Root architecture is a crucial part of plant adaptation to soil heterogeneity and is mainly controlled by root branching. The process of root system development can be divided into two successive steps: lateral root initiation and lateral root development/emergence which are controlled by different fluxes of the plant hormone auxin. While shoot architecture appears to be highly regular. following rules such as the phyllotactic spiral. root architecture appears more chaotic. We used stochastic modeling to extract hidden rules regulating root branching in Arabidopsis thaliana. These rules were used to build an integrative mechanistic model of root ramification based on auxin. This model was experimentally tested using plants with modified rhythm of lateral root initiation or mutants perturbed in auxin transport. Our analysis revealed that lateral root initiation and lateral root development/emergence are interacting with each other to create a global balance between the respective ratio of initiation and emergence. A mechanistic model based on auxin fluxes successfully predicted this property and the phenotype alteration of auxin transport mutants or plants with modified rythms of lateral root initiation. This suggests that root branching is controlled by mechanisms of lateral inhibition due to a competition between initiation and development/emergence for auxin.,True,1IZHN3wAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,88,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003673,15385335608172828192,/scholar?cites=15385335608172828192,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003673,0,0,0
1096036,Analyzing the time-course variation of apple and pear tree dates of flowering stages in the global warming context,2008,Yann Guédon and Jean Michel Legave,219,Ecological Modelling,1-2,189-199,Elsevier,Over the last 40 years. perceptible advances in dates of flowering stages have been observed in apple and pear trees growing in three cropping areas in France and one in Switzerland. The time-course variation of dates of flowering stages was established for eight chronological sequences. Our aim was to propose a statistical modelling framework for such sequences with the objective of characterizing the relationship between flowering advances in fruit trees and global warming. After an exploratory analysis. change-point models were applied to multivariate and univariate sequences. The results clearly support the occurrence of a significant abrupt change in the time-course variation of flowering dates at the end of the 1980s toward more frequent early dates. the most probable change instant being between 1988 and 1989. The coincidence between this abrupt change in phenological variations and marked …,True,1IZHN3wAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380008004146,565426378145898296,/scholar?cites=565426378145898296,,https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/83/18/05/PDF/GuedonEcologicalModelling2008.pdf,0,0,0

In their paper. they developed the equivalent of the forward-backward algorithm for hidden Markov tree models and called it the ""upward-downward algorithm"". This algorithm is subject to the same numerical limitations as the forward-backward algorithm for hidden Markov chains (HMCs). In this paper. adapting the ideas of Devijver from 1985. we propose a new ""upward-downward"" algorithm. which is a true smoothing algorithm and is immune to numerical underflow. Furthermore. we propose a Viterbi-like algorithm for global restoration of the hidden state tree. The contribution of those algorithms as diagnosis tools is illustrated through the modeling of statistical dependencies between wavelet coefficients with a special emphasis on local regularity changes.",True,1IZHN3wAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,86,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1323262/,378372380327940147,/scholar?cites=378372380327940147,,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00830078/file/hmt.pdf,0,0,0

Its uppermost tectonostrati-graphic unit overlies the ophiolitic units. and consists of a thick metasedimentary sequence. the Ordenes Series. intruded by orthogneisses and gabbros. In the lower part of the Ordenes Series. the large Monte Castelo gabbro (∼ 150 km 2) is surrounded by high-grade migmatitic paragneisses. Several shear zones cutting across the gabbro massif depict intermediate-pressure granulite facies. indicating a metamorphic evolution common with the surrounding paragneisses. Recent U-Pb geochronological data prove that the main tectonothermal evolution of the Ordenes Series took place in Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician time. These data suggest that the intrusion of the Monte Castelo gabbro (499±2 Ma; U-Pb in zircons) was immediately followed by a Barrov-ian metamorphic episode that reached the granulite facies (493-498 Ma; U-Pb in monazites). A later Variscan overprint is indicated by U-Pb rutile ages of 380-390 Ma. Considering the geochronological evidence for almost coeval magmatism and metamorphism during the Early Ordovician. together with the geochemical characteristics of the Monte Castelo gabbro. an accretionary complex related to a Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician island arc appears as the more probable setting for the uppermost allochthonous terrane in the northwest of the Iberian Massif.

Some 11-10.000 years ago bands of hunter-gatherers started to abandon their high-mobility lifestyles in favour of growing crops. and the creation of settled. sedentary communities. This shift into an agricultural lifestyle triggered the evolution of complex political and economic structures. and technological developments. and ultimately underpinned the rise of all the great civilisations of recent human history.

Although the beginning of their evolution is largely unknown. researchers assumed that they developed in tandem with cultivation since the appearance of agricultural habitats some 12.000 years ago. These rapidly-evolving plants invaded the human disturbed areas and thrived in the new habitat.

These adaptations help them to colonize harsh oligotrophic habitats. e.g. on the surface and subsurface of rocks. One of their most characteristic stress-resistance mechanisms is the accumulation of melanin in the cell walls. This. production of other protective molecules and a plastic morphology further contribute to ecological flexibility of black fungi. Increased growth rates of some species after exposure to ionizing radiation even suggest yet unknown mechanisms of energy production. Other unusual metabolic strategies may include harvesting UV or visible light or gaining energy by forming facultative lichen-like associations with algae or cyanobacteria. The latter is not entirely surprising. since certain black fungal lineages are phylogenetically related to clades of lichen-forming fungi. Similar to black fungi. lichen-forming fungi are adapted to growth on exposed surfaces with low availability of nutrients. They also efficiently use protective molecules to tolerate frequent periods of extreme stress.

Patterns of diversification. origination. and extinction conform in general to the predictions of Sepkoski's kinetic model of diversification. Rates of generic origination and extinction vary not only through time but also between organ systems for a single time interval. This fact. coupled with data on longevity and turnover and comparative morphological observations. can be used to document mosaic evolution in early vascular plant history. Mosaic evolution is an important theme in plant evolution; indeed. what we recognize as macroevolutionary events often correlate with brief periods of pronounced mosaicism.

Both share the characters of exarch protosteles and reniform sporangia. and it is argued that characters separating the two. e.g.. microphylls and leaf-associated sporangia. could easily be derived by modification of zosterophyll emergences and sporangial position. Recently. different opinions concerning the derivation of lycopsid features have been proposed and an earlier time of occurrence of lycopsids has been suggested. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the position of zosterophylls relative to lycopsids employing current information and considering prevailing theories.

Their wood currently represents the earliest evidence of secondary growth in plants. The small size of the plants and the presence of thick-walled cortical cells confirm that wood early evolution was driven by hydraulic constraints rather than by the necessity of mechanical support for increasing height.

The aim of this paper is to show a methodology to assess the feasibility of a water reuse project taking into account not just the internal impact. but also the external impact (environmental and social. for example) and the opportunity cost derived from the project. Internal benefit is obtained from the difference between internal income and internal costs. Internal income is obtained by multiplying the selling price of reclaimed water and the volume obtained. Internal costs are made up of the sum of investment costs. operating costs. financial costs and taxes.

With its roots in socio-cultural perspectives on learning and development. the programme has been designed specifically to foster the development of ‘learning communities’. within which participants co-construct knowledge and understanding. and promote social. cognitive. psycholinguistic and technological abilities in the children. The analytic work presented focuses on exploring the relations between the dialogical. collaborative writing processes of teams of fifth graders (10 to 11 years old) engaged in the production of two types of texts. namely emails and opinion articles. It is argued that divergent tasks. such as collaborative writing. require somewhat different dialogic styles of interaction than convergent tasks.

It is but natural that those who regard sociology as a science should divide the science. as other sciences are divided. into the two natural departments. pure and applied. But as the term"" pure sociology” has been freely used for several years by certain European sociologists. it seems proper to explain that the matter for this work has been accumulating in my hands for many years. I should perhaps rather say that sociological material has been long pouring in upon me. and that the first classification that was made of it was into such as related to the origin. nature. and genetic or spontaneous development of society. and such as related to means and methods for the artificial improvement of social conditions on the part of man and society as conscious and intelligent agents. The first of these classes I naturally called pure sociology. the second. applied sociology. It was upon my notes as thus classified that in 1897 I delivered two courses of lectures before the Summer School of the University of Chicago. one on Pure Sociology and the other on Applied Sociology. These two courses of lectures under the same titles. but with ever increasing volume of data. I repeated in 1898 at the University of West Virginia. and in 1899 at Leland Stanford Junior University.

To explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster. we performed Hi-C and poly(A)+ RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2. Kc167. DmBG3-c2. and OSC).

Fagopyrum esculentum and F. tataricum. belong to the order Caryophyllales - a large group of flowering plants with uncertain evolutionary relationships. F. esculentum (common buckwheat) is also an important food crop. Despite these practical and evolutionary considerations Fagopyrum species have not been the subject of large-scale sequencing projects. Normalized cDNA corresponding to genes expressed in flowers and inflorescences of F. esculentum and F. tataricum was sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing technology. This resulted in 267 (for F. esculentum) and 229 (F. tataricum) thousands of reads with average length of 341-349 nucleotides. De novo assembly of the reads produced about 25 thousands of contigs for each species. with 7.5-8.2× coverage.

A necessary prerequisite of exact and reliable data is the accurate choice of reference genes. We studied the expression stability of potential reference genes in common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) in order to find the optimal reference for gene expression analysis in this economically important crop. Recently sequenced buckwheat floral transcriptome was used as source of sequence information. Expression stability of eight candidate reference genes was assessed in different plant structures (leaves and inflorescences at two stages of development and fruits). These genes are the orthologs of Arabidopsis genes identified as stable in a genome-wide survey gene of expression stability and a traditionally used housekeeping gene GAPDH. Three software applications – geNorm. NormFinder and BestKeeper - were used to estimate expression stability and provided congruent results. The orthologs of AT4G33380 (expressed protein of unknown function. Expressed1). AT2G28390 (SAND family protein. SAND) and AT5G46630 (clathrin adapter complex subunit family protein.

Kew,A phylogenetic analysis of 589 plastid rbcL gene sequences representing nearly all eudicot families (a total of 308 families; seven photosynthetic and four parasitic families are missing) was performed. and bootstrap re-sampling was used to assess support for clades. Based on these data. the ordinal classification of eudicots is revised following the previous classification of angiosperms by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG).

However. only a small set of markers are commonly used. Most of them have been designed for amplification in a large range of Angiosperms and are located in the Large Single Copy (LSC). Here we developed a new set of 100 primer pairs optimized for amplification in Monocotyledons. Primer pairs amplify coding (exon) and non-coding regions (intron and intergenic spacer). They span the different chloroplast regions: 72 are located in the LSC. 13 in the Small Single Copy (SSC) and 15 in the Inverted Repeat region (IR). Amplification and sequencing were tested in 13 species of Monocotyledons: Dioscorea abyssinica. D. praehensilis. D. rotundata. D. dumetorum. D. bulbifera. Trichopus sempervirens (Dioscoreaceae). Phoenix canariensis. P. dactylifera. Astrocaryum scopatum. A. murumuru. Ceroxylon echinulatum (Arecaceae). Digitaria excilis and Pennisetum glaucum (Poaceae). The diversity found in Dioscorea. Digitaria and Pennisetum mainly corresponded to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) while the diversity found in Arecaceae also comprises Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR). We observed that the most variable loci (rps15-ycf1. rpl32-ccsA. ndhF-rpl32. ndhG-ndhI and ccsA) are located in the SSC. Through the analysis of the genetic structure of a wild-cultivated species complex in Dioscorea. we demonstrated that this new set of primers is of great interest for population genetics and we anticipate that it will also be useful for phylogeny and bar-coding studies.,True,lzCZnWIAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,96,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019954,7254100292789537588,/scholar?cites=7254100292789537588,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019954,0,0,0

A compelling group to compare with angiosperms is ferns. because of their high polyploidy. The bi-parental inheritance of nuclear DNA sequence markers makes them advantageous for investigating polyploid complexes. but few such markers have been available for ferns. We have used DNA sequences from the low-copy nuclear LFY locus to study an Asplenium polyploid complex. The New Zealand species of this Austral group comprise seven tetraploids and eight octoploids. LFY sequences indicate that allopolyploidy is much more predominant than previously thought. being implicated in the origins of seven of the octoploids.

A multiflash kinetic fluorimeter was used to monitor the redox state of the plastoquinone pool in leaves. It was found that in many species of plants. particularly those using the NAD-malic enzyme C4 system of photosynthesis. the pool actually became more reduced following a light to dark transition. In some Amaranthus species. plastoquinone remained reduced in the dark for several hours. Far red light. which preferentially drives Photosystem I turnover. could effectively oxidize the plastoquinone pool.

In this article. a comprehensive mechanism is proposed. in which distinct roles are played by these cytoskeletal components. First. cortical MT bundles and. in the case of pavement cells. radial MT arrays combined with MT bundles determine the deposition of local cell wall thickenings. the cellulose microfibrils of which copy the orientation of underlying MTs. Cell growth is thus locally prevented and. consequently. lobes and constrictions are formed. Arch‐like tangential expansion is locally imposed at the external periclinal wall of pavement cells by the radial arrangement of cellulose microfibrils at every wall thickening.

This process is characterized by a ‘vulnerability curve’ (VC) showing the variation of the percentage of cavitation as a function of xylem pressure potential. The shape of this VC varies from ‘sigmoidal’ to ‘exponential’. This review provides a panorama of the techniques that have been used to generate such a curve. The techniques differ by (i) the way cavitation is induced (e.g. bench dehydration. centrifugation. or air injection). and (ii) the way cavitation is measured (e.g. percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) or acoustic emission). and a nomenclature is proposed based on these two methods. A survey of the literature of more than 1200 VCs was used to draw statistics on the usage of these methods and on their reliability and validity.

Kleaf values of light-exposed leaves responded to temperature and 0.1 mm cycloheximide treatments. Furthermore. Kleaf was not related to stomatal aperture.

EC 1.11.1.9) were first discovered in mammals as key enzymes involved in scavenging of activated oxygen species (AOS). Their efficient antioxidant activity depends on the presence of the rare amino‐acid residue selenocysteine (SeCys) at the catalytic site. Nonselenium GPX‐like proteins (NS‐GPXs) with a Cys residue instead of SeCys have also been found in most organisms. As SeCys is important for GPX activity. the function of the NS‐GPX can be questioned. Here. we highlight the evolutionary link between NS‐GPX and seleno‐GPX. particularly the evolution of the SeCys incorporation system. We then discuss what is known about the enzymatic activity and physiological functions of NS‐GPX.

The ultrastructure of interconduit pits strongly affects drought-induced embolism resistance. but also mechanical properties of the xylem are involved. The first experimental evidence for a lower embolism resistance in stems of herbaceous plants compared to stems of their secondarily woody descendants further supports this mechanical-functional trade-off.

We compare available phylogenetic studies anddivergence time estimates for plant lineages that may have diversified in response to Andeanorogeny. The influence of the Andes on plant diversification is separated into four major groups:The Andes as source of new high-elevation habitats. as a vicariant barrier. as a North-Southcorridor and as generator of new environmental conditions outside the Andes. Biogeographicalrelationships between the Andes and other regions are also considered. Divergence timeestimates indicate that high-elevation lineages originated and diversified during or after the majorphases of Andean uplift (Mid-Miocene to Pliocene). although there are some exceptions. Asexpected. Andean mid-elevation lineages tend to be older than high-elevation groups. Mostclades with disjunct distribution on both sides of the Andes diverged during Andean uplift.Inner-Andean clades also tend to have divergence time during or after Andean uplift. This isinterpreted as evidence of vicariance. Dispersal along the Andes has been shown to occur ineither direction. mostly dated after the Andean uplift.

Boraginales),2011,Federico Luebert and Hartmut H Hilger and Maximilian Weigend,61,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,1,90-102,Academic Press,The uplift of the Andes was a major factor for plant diversification in South America and had significant effects on the climatic patterns at the continental scale. It was crucial for the formation of the arid environments in south-eastern and western South America. However. both the timing of the major stages of the Andean uplift and the onset of aridity in western South America remain controversial. In this paper we examine the hypothesis that the Andean South American groups of Heliotropium originated and diversified in response to Andean orogeny during the late Miocene and a the subsequent development of aridity.

In the Mediterranean Sea. the two species Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula co-occur in barren areas.

Yet our present view is biased towards arctic and temperate/tropical forest regions. with very little focus on the extensive arid regions of the planet. The Australian arid zone is one of the largest desert landform systems in the world. with a unique. diverse and relatively well-studied biota. With foci on palaeoenvironmental and molecular data. we here review what is known about the assembly and maintenance of this biome in the context of its physical history. and in comparison with other mesic biomes. Aridification of Australia began in the Mid-Miocene. around 15 million years. but fully arid landforms in central Australia appeared much later. around 1–4 million years. Dated molecular phylogenies of diverse taxa show the deepest divergences of arid-adapted taxa from the Mid-Miocene. consistent with the onset of desiccation. There is evidence of arid-adapted taxa evolving from mesicadapted ancestors. and also of speciation within the arid zone. There is no evidence for an increase in speciation rate during the Pleistocene. and most arid-zone species lineages date to the Pliocene or earlier. The last 0.8 million years have seen major fluctuations of the arid zone. with large areas covered by mobile sand dunes during glacial maxima. Some large. vagile taxa show patterns of recent expansion and migration throughout the arid zone. in parallel with the ice sheet-imposed range shifts in Northern Hemisphere taxa.

We investigated biodiversity changes in a meta‐analysis of 39 resurvey studies in European temperate forests (3988 vegetation records in total. 17–75 years between the two surveys) by assessing the importance of (i) coarse‐resolution (i.e.. among sites) vs. fine‐resolution (i.e.. within sites) environmental differences and (ii) changing environmental conditions between surveys.

Endosperm. produced by fertilization of the central cell in the female gametophyte. is essential for embryo and seed development. Several imprinted genes play an important role in endosperm development. The mechanism of gene imprinting involves DNA methylation and histone modification. DNA methylation is actively removed at the imprinted alleles to be activated. Histone methylation mediated by the Polycomb group complex provides another layer of epigenetic regulation at the silenced alleles.

Liebl.) trees. The root systems were spatially subdivided into three concentric cylinders. Diameters and compass direction of roots were recorded at each point where they crossed one of the cylinders. Analysis of the distribution of root cross-sectional area (Ar) at 30 cm radius from the stem showed clustering in a preferred direction only for 10 small trees (diameter at breast height (DBH) < 9 cm). A classification of four incline growth types was used to describe differences in root architecture associated with the different age stands.

1096522,Functional traits of epiphytic lichens as potential indicators of environmental conditions in forest ecosystems,2012,Paolo Giordani and Giorgio Brunialti and Giovanni Bacaro and Juri Nascimbene,18,Ecological Indicators,,413-420,Elsevier,Several experimental studies support the effectiveness of lichen diversity as an indicator of environmental change. On the contrary. the potential of functional trait values of epiphytic lichens as indicators of environmental conditions is still poorly documented. Comparisons of lichen diversity across diverse regions may be problematic due to high levels of floristic variation related to differences in environmental conditions (e.g. climate and substrate availability and types). Species’ functional traits may prove to be a user-friendly tool for large-scale and long-term ecological monitoring. This paper explores the use of functional traits of epiphytic lichen species as indicators of environmental conditions: we tested the susceptibility of the three easily discernible functional traits (growth form. reproductive strategy. and photobiont type) to environmental factors related to climate. human disturbance. and stand structure.

Only 5 patients (17.2%) identified sadness as the most troubling problem. and 48.3% specified pains and other somatic symptoms instead. An internally consistent stigma scale with Cronbach's alpha of. 67. comprised 13 items. was used to assess stigma. In addition to the scale score for each subject. the contribution of each item was reported and compared. A suggestive. though not significantly lower value of the stigma score for patients reporting somatic symptoms as most troubling. compared with sadness. was consistent with findings from prior studies showing a positive relationship between the magnitude of depression and stigma. These findings are discussed with reference to their impact on recognition and help seeking among patients. and recognition and management of depression by general practitioner.

(Moringaceae) are examined. The zygomorphic gullet type flowers show a forenoon (6.00 h–12.00 h) pattern of anthesis after which pollen anthesis takes place (7.00 h–13.00 h). Each flower produces an average of 23525 pollen grains with an average 523 pollen grains per ovule. Natural populations yield an average of 10.28% fruit and successful pollination of the flowers require a large number of insect (Orders Thysanoptera. Hymenoptera. Lepidoptera and Coleoptera) visitations. Among these Xylocopa is most common. Flowers favour cross pollination due to a delayed stigma receptivity.

The EMS1 (also known as EXS) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) and TPD1 small protein play key roles in regulating somatic and reproductive cell fate determination in Arabidopsis anthers. Here. we show that ectopic expression of TPD1 causes abnormal differentiation of somatic and reproductive cells in anthers. In addition. ectopic TPD1 activity requires functional EMS1. Yeast two-hybrid. pull-down. and coimmunoprecipitation analyses further demonstrate that TPD1 interacts with EMS1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover. TPD1 induces EMS1 phosphorylation in planta. Thus. our results suggest that TPD1 serves as a ligand for the EMS1 receptor kinase to signal cell fate determination during plant sexual reproduction.,True,d7rmMsAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,164,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/6/2220.short,8815245980451128704,/scholar?cites=8815245980451128704,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/6/2220.full.pdf,0,0,0

Several studies have shown that TCDD exposure reduced fecundity and ovulatory rate in rats and increased the incidence of endometriosis in monkeys. Recent work suggests that TCDD’s endocrine-disrupting effects are. at least in part. caused by a direct action at the ovary. Although the factors involved in TCDD-induced toxicity are still under investigation. several studies have shown that TCDD induces programmed cell death. or apoptosis. in various tissues and may act in a similar fashion in the ovary. In the present study. we set out to evaluate the in vitro effects of TCDD on steroid secretion. specifically estradiol-17β (E2) and progesterone. by human luteinized granulosa cells (LGC). and to further determine whether TCDD is capable of inducing apoptosis in this cell type.

This study reports the results of an ultrastructural comparison of pollen wall formation in the mutant to wall development in wild-type plants. Pollen wall development in the mutant parallels that of wild-type until the early tetrad stage. At this point in wild-type plants. the microspore plasma membrane assumes a regular pattern of ridges and valleys. Initial sporopollenin deposition occurs on the ridges marking the beginning of probacula formation. In contrast. the plasma membrane in the mutant appears irregular with flattened protuberances and rare invaginations. As a result. the wild-type regular pattern of ridges and valleys is not formed.

In addition to its role in the detoxification of cytotoxic 2-oxo-aldehydes. specifically methylglyoxal. it has been suggested that the glyoxalase system may also play a role in controlling cell differentiation and proliferation. During the analysis of a T-DNA-tagged mutant of Arabidopsis we identified the gene for a glyoxalase II isozyme (GLY1) that appears to be mitochondrially localized. The cDNA encoding a glyoxalase II cytoplasmic isozyme (GLY2) was also isolated and characterized. Southern blot and sequence analyses indicate that glyoxalase II proteins are encoded by at least two multigene families in Arabidopsis.

1096601,Structure and function of the musculoskeletal system,2009,James Watkins,,,,,Human Kinetics,Human movement is brought about by the musculoskeletal system—the skeletal muscles. bones. and joints—under the control of the nervous system. The bones of the skeleton are linked together at joints in a way that allows them to move relative to each other. The skeletal muscles pull on the bones to control the movements of the joints and. in doing so. control the movement of the body as a whole. Through coordinated activity of the various muscle groups. the forces generated by our muscles are transmitted by our bones and joints to enable us to maintain an upright or partially upright posture. move from one place to another. and manipulate objects. often simultaneously.The open-chain arrangement of the bones of the skeleton—two arms and two legs attached independently to the vertebral column—allows us to adopt a wide range of body postures and perform a wide range of movements. However. this movement capability is only possible at the expense of low mechanical advantage of skeletal muscles. Most muscles are attached to bones very close to joints. such that in most postures and movements other than lying down. the muscles have to exert very large forces which. in turn. result in very large forces in joints.,True,lWe_8C0AAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C,221,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6084428292427433103&hl=en&oi=scholarr,6084428292427433103,/scholar?cites=6084428292427433103,,,0,0,0

The degree and extent of desiccation tolerance (DT) in the gametophytes of tropical fern species was assessed to understand mechanisms that have allowed ferns to radiate into a diversity of habitats.  •  Species from several functional groups were subjected to a series of desiccation events. including varying degrees of intensity and multiple desiccation cycles. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence were used to assess recovery ability and compared with species ecology and gametophyte morphology.  •  It is shown that vegetative DT (rare in vascular plants) is widely exhibited in fern gametophytes and the degree of tolerance is linked to species habitat preference.

This was an episode of explosive plant radiations that produced our modern angiosperm-dominated world. This period was also a time of great Pteridophytic diversification and experimentation and saw the rise of most extant fern lineages. Prominent among these was the widespread appearance of epiphytic species. In modern tropical forest canopies. epiphytic ferns often represent some of the most abundant taxa and can dominate epiphyte biomass. Yet from most perspectives. the epiphytic habitat is vastly different from the forest floor. What happened during the Cretaceous that led to such widespread epiphyte fern diversification?

This study aimed to determine the host-range potential of this accession of the rust by testing its pathogenicity on plants of 122 taxa. representative of the 15 tribes of the subfamily Myrtoideae in the family Myrtaceae. Each taxon was tested in two separate trials (unless indicated otherwise) that comprised up to five replicates per taxon and six replicates of a positive control (Syzygium jambos). No visible symptoms were observed on the following four taxa in either trial: Eucalyptus grandis×camaldulensis. E. moluccana. Lophostemon confertus and Sannantha angusta. Only small chlorotic or necrotic flecks without any uredinia (rust fruiting bodies) were observed on inoculated leaves of seven other taxa (Acca sellowiana. Corymbia calophylla ‘Rosea’.

Studies to date have suggested that the fleshy-fruited state has arisen on several occasions in the Myrtaceae. The previously accepted and predominantly Neotropical tribe Myrteae has traditionally been divided into three groups. the subtribes Myrtinae. Eugeniinae and Myrciinae. This subtribal arrangement is analysed in detail here for the first time. The monophyly of the tribe and subtribes are tested and relationships of the genera within them. in particular those of the Myrciinae and anomalous genera sometimes associated with it. are discussed.

These lineages are now separated by environmental barriers such as the arid regions of the Sahara and Kalahari Deserts or the tropical lowlands of Central Africa. Alternative explanations for the Rand Flora pattern range from vicariance and climate-driven extinction of a widespread pan-African flora to independent dispersal events and speciation in situ. To provide a temporal framework for this pattern. we used published data from nuclear and chloroplast DNA to estimate the age of disjunction of 17 lineages that span 12 families and 9 orders of angiosperms.

Olfactory stimuli. imitating dung or decaying organic (zoogenic or phytogenic) matter. are used as attractants. together with mimetic colouration and. sometimes mimetic sculpturing. In most species nectar is present. The nectar mainly serves as optical attractant causing brilliance effects. and as visitor guide. However. nectar obviously is also a reward in many species. Flies (Cyclorrhapha:Calyptratae) constitute the most important pollinating group. In the pollination process they carry pollinaria only at the distal parts of their proboscis. never on their legs.

Next to the exploration of macromolecular characters to infer the phylogeny. the palynology of Rubiaceae finally received the attention it deserves. This article aims to present a state-of-the-art analysis of the systematic palynology of the family. The range of varíation in pollen morphology is wide. and some of the pollen features are not known from other angiosperm taxa; eg. a looplike or spiral pattern for the position of apertures in pantoaperturate grains. We compiled an online database at the generic level for the major pollen characters and orbicule presence in Rubiaceae.

Si. Fe. Mn. Cu and Ca were analysed in leaves of ten Rubiaceae species. most of which are Al accumulators. and these were compared with concentrations in one species of Melastomataceae. Quantitative data confirmed the distribution of Al accumulation as previously determined by semi‐quantitative tests. and suggest that there is an apparent congruency between the shoot Al concentration and the number of accumulators within a certain genus or tribe. Al accumulators within the Rubiaceae are most characteristic of the Rubioideae subfamily. although a second origin is likely in at least a few members of the tribes Vanguerieae and Alberteae. While the leaf Si concentration in Melastomata malabathricum L. (Melastomataceae) was negligible. all Rubiaceae studied showed relatively high Si levels (mostly >3000 mg kg–1).

The solubility of phosphate is inhibited by the presence of iron and aluminium in acidic soils and calcium in neutral and alkaline soils. This leads to fixation of phosphorous. making it not available to crop plants. The phosphate solubilizing bacteria (phosphobacteria) secretes some kinds of organic acids which act on insoluble phosphates and convert the same into soluble form. thus providing phosphorous to plant. An experiment was conducted to enumerate the population density of phosphobacteria in the rhizosphere soils of brinjal. chilly. cotton. green grain. groundnut. maize. paddy. ragi. sorghum and turmeric using Ketznelson and Bose medium following dilution plate technique. Efforts have been made to isolate phosphobacteria from these soils and isolated strains were inoculated in specific media containing specific substrates to produce growth regulating substances such as IAA and GA3 and phosphatase enzyme. The result showed that the population levels of phosphobacteria were higher in the rhizosphere soil of groundnut plant.

The eco‐physiological plasticity of this species was evaluated by studying plants growing at two sites with different soil moistures on the island of Elba (Italy). through dendrochronological. wood‐anatomical analyses and stable isotopes measurements. Intra‐annual density fluctuations (IADFs) were abundant in tree rings. and were identified as the key parameter to understand site‐specific plant responses to water stress. Our findings showed that the formation of IADFs is mainly related to the high temperature. precipitation patterns and probably to soil water availability. which differs at the selected study sites.

Such evidence corroborates the hypothesis that bamboos have been derived from herbaceous ancestors.

Ac-EO caused an interesting dose-dependent reduction in the number of eggs of S. mansoni. Precocene I (74.30%) and (E)-caryophyllene (14.23%) were identified as the two major constituents of Ac-EO. These compounds were tested individually and were found to be much less effective than Ac-EO and PZQ. A mixture of the two major compounds in a ratio similar to that found in the Ac-EO was also less effective than Ac-EO. thus revealing that there are no synergistic effects between these components.

Phylogenetic. phylogeographic and ecological studies support plant diversifications on the QTP through multiple mechanisms such as allopatric speciation via geographic isolation. climatic oscillations and divergences. pollinator-mediated isolation. diploid hybridization and introgression. and allopolyploidy. These mechanisms have driven spectacular radiations and/or species diversifications in various groups of plants such as Pedicularis L.. Saussurea DC.. Rhododendron L.. Primula L.. Meconopsis Vig.. Rhodiola L.. and many lineages of gymnosperms. Nevertheless. much work is needed toward understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of plant diversifications on the QTP. Well-sampled biogeographic analyses of the QTP plants in the broad framework of the Northern Hemisphere as well as the Southern Hemisphere are still relatively few and should be encouraged in the next decade. This paper reviews recent evidence from phylogenetic and biogeographic studies in plants. in the context of rapid radiations. mechanisms of species diversifications on the QTP. and the biogeographic significance of the QTP in the broader context of both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere biogeography.

The presence of somaclonal variation in populations derived from tissue culture is affecting the use of tissue culture negatively and has remained a major problem. Conversely. it is a source of new desirable clones/variants with better agronomic traits. In this review. we summarize the possible causes. detection methods and desirability of variants. Somaclonal variation is one of the most researched and reviewed topics. Hence. we restricted ourselves to outlining various examples which may be used as important references for researchers who intend to identify and/or characterize somaclonal variants while using tissue culture for research and production.

Globally. the past 15 years has witnessed a surge in the use of topolins and their derivatives in research laboratories. Topolins. especially the meta-topolin and its derivatives have been employed for culture initiation. protocol optimization and for counteracting various in vitro induced physiological disorders in many species. Evidence from various studies indicate the rising popularity and advantages (although not universal for all species) of topolins compared to other CKs. In this review. we assess the use of topolins in PTC with emphasis on their metabolism. structure–activity relations and effect on morphogenesis in vitro.

Similarly. a decrease in the level of accumulated proline in the rehydrated plants is due to both down regulation of proline biosynthetic pathway enzymes and upregulation of proline degrading enzymes. But. the role of proline during plant development and the molecular basis of the effect of proline accumulation during stress and upon relief of stress are still largely obscure.

The profound effects of polyploidy on gene expression appear to be caused more by hybridity than by genome doubling. Epigenetic mechanisms underlying genome-wide changes in expression are as yet poorly understood; only methylation has received much study. and its importance varies among polyploids. Genetic diploidization begins with the earliest responses to genome merger and doubling; less is known about chromosomal diploidization. Polyploidy duplicates every gene in the genome. providing the raw material for divergence or partitioning of function in homoeologous copies.

1096744,Genomic expression dominance in allopolyploids,2009,Ryan A Rapp and Joshua A Udall and Jonathan F Wendel,7,BMC biology,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Allopolyploid speciation requires rapid evolutionary reconciliation of two diverged genomes and gene regulatory networks. Here we describe global patterns of gene expression accompanying genomic merger and doubling in inter-specific crosses in the cotton genus (Gossypium L.). Employing a micro-array platform designed against 40.430 unigenes. we assayed gene expression in two sets of parental diploids and their colchicine-doubled allopolyploid derivatives. Up to half of all genes were differentially expressed among diploids. a striking level of expression evolution among congeners. In the allopolyploids. most genes were expressed at mid-parent levels. but this was achieved via a phenomenon of genome-wide expression dominance. whereby gene expression was either up- or down-regulated to the level of one of the two parents. independent of the magnitude of gene expression. This massive expression dominance was approximately equal with respect to direction (up- or down-regulation). and the same diploid parent could be either the dominant or the recessive genome depending on the specific genomic combination. Transgressive up- and down-regulation were also common in the allopolyploids. both for genes equivalently or differentially expressed between the parents. Our data provide novel insights into the architecture of gene expression in the allopolyploid nucleus. raise questions regarding the responsible underlying mechanisms of genome dominance. and provide clues into the enigma of the evolutionary prevalence of allopolyploids.,True,46bO1t8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,232,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-7-18,5357262611333566303,/scholar?cites=5357262611333566303,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-7-18,0,0,0

Phylogenetic studies in the family have also progressed steadily. For this study. a parsimony analysis was carried out using all rbcL sequences currently available for Cyperaceae. including data for two new genera. One of the four subfamilies (Caricoideae) and seven of the 14 tribes (Bisboeckelereae. Cariceae. Cryptangieae. Dulichieae. Eleocharideae. Sclerieae. Trilepideae) are monophyletic. Subfamily Mapanioideae and tribe Chrysitricheae are monophyletic if. as the evidence suggests. Hellmuthia is considered a member of Cypereae. Some other features of our analysis include: well-supported Trilepideae and Sclerieae–Bisboeckelereae clades; a possible close relationship between Cryptangieae and Schoeneae; polyphyletic tribes Schoeneae and Scirpeae; the occurrence of Cariceae within the Dulichieae–Scirpeae clade. and a strongly supported clade. representing Cyperus and allied genera in Cypereae. sister to a poorly supported Ficinia–Hellmuthia–Isolepis–Scirpoides clade. Such patterns are consistent with other studies based on DNA sequence data. One outcome may be that only two subfamilies. Mapanioideae and Cyperoideae. are recognized.

A previous molecular phylogenetic study placed one of the species in an isolated position in Sapindales. while morphological studies had placed Biebersteinia in or near Geraniaceae. albeit doubtfully. We tested the monophyly and placement of the family with data from the chloroplast genes rbcL and atpB obtained for all four species. other major clades of Sapindales and outgroups for a total of up to 114 taxa. Parsimony. Bayesian. and likelihood analyses place Biebersteinia in Sapindales. possibly as sister to the other eight families.

The benefits of sex stem from both the DNA maintenance and repair during meiotic divisions and the impact of various forms of mating upon genetic variation. Meiosis is retained by virtually all sexual organisms. and aside from the meiotic parthenogens. mating is required between distinct and alternate forms. called sexes or mating types (but interesting cases exist in fungi of same-sex mating and sex without evidence of meiosis [17. 76]). Mating compatibility is determined by a great variety of mechanisms. In reptiles. diploid males and females are determined by the incubation temperature during egg development (60).

Host–pathogen coevolution can alternatively lead to a ‘trench warfare’. i.e.. balancing selection. maintaining certain alleles at loci involved in host–pathogen recognition over long time scales. Recently. technological and methodological progress has enabled detection of footprints of selection directly on genes. which can provide useful insights into the processes of coevolution.

Dispersal of B. terrestris gained momentum in the 1980s when bees were reared artificially in Europe and supplied commercially for greenhouse pollination services. Very early after its commercial introduction. it was recognized that this species is invasive. can island hop to new locations and may disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris are: high migration ability. early seasonal emergence. high adaptability under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats. generalist or polylectic foraging strategies. enabling it to work a wide variety of flowers for resources. foraging over wide distances. a thermoregulatory metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures. no natural enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range. and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a newly colonized area. In addition. commercial bees produce more gynes and are better competitors than the local conspecific populations and may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna. competition for nest sites with. and genetic contamination of. local Bombus spp.. spread of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant reproductive capacity.

We demonstrate an alternative approach. which involves duplicating conflicting taxa in the matrix. such that each duplicate is represented by one partition only. This allows the combination of all available data in standard phylogenetic analyses. despite reticulations.

We review the principles and problems of placing fossils in trees of extant taxa and using them to constrain the ages of nodes in molecular dating analyses.

In these wetlands the pattern of plant zonation can differ from year to year and season to season. and depth is not always a good indicator of the plant community composition in different zones. In order to determine which aspects of water regime (depth. duration or frequency of flooding) were important in the development of plant communities an experiment using seed bank material from two wetlands was undertaken over a 16 week period in late spring–early summer 1995–1996.

These traits are uncommon in Orchidaceae. but have been observed in these and some other species pollinated by flies or other pollinators with behavior that facilitates self‐pollination.

Advances in agriculture are mainly directed at increasing food production to solve problems of a growing human population. However. food security remains a problem to ensure healthy food and to prevent human disease. These two tendencies often do not coincide. At present. the selective breeding programs of crops are mainly oriented toward the production of high-yielding varieties of genetically enhanced cultivars of cereals that have increased growth rates. increasing the percentage of usable plant parts and resistance against crop diseases. This initiative is linked to what began in the 1960s and was named by William Gaud (of USAID) a"" Green Revolution""(Davies. 2003). It was a product of globalization as evidenced in the creation of international agricultural research centres to introduce new crop varieties around the world. This process caused a significant increase in total cereal production and daily calorie supply in developing countries between the 1960s and 1990s (Davies. 2003).

This article questions the assumptions that underpin this claim. particularly the myth that pristine forest represents the primary repository of nature's medicinal providence. After tracing colonial European efforts at medicinal plant discovery. intellectual property exploitation. and plant transference and acclimation. I review the recent resurgence of scientific interest in tropical folk pharmacopoeias. In spite of the image marketed by environmental entrepreneurs. the medicinal foraging preference of rural tropical groups is largely successional mosaics of their own creation—trails. kitchen gardens. swiddens. and forest fallows.

Unlike biological systems. where the ecological consequences of biological invasions are primarily negative. from an ethnoscientific standpoint. invasive species' impacts on cultural systems span a range of effects. Biological invasions affect cultural groups in myriad. often unpredictable and at times contradictory ways.

1096880,Is non-timber forest product harvest sustainable in the less developed world? A systematic review of the recent economic and ecological literature,2012,Denise Stanley and Robert Voeks and Leaa Short,1,,,,,Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) provide material subsistence and cash income to millions of rural people. particularly in less developed countries. This paper offers a systematic review of recent trends (2000-2010) in the ecological and economic sustainability of NTFPs. Of 101 NTFP ecological studies. most addressed harvest consequences at the population-individual level (62.4%). and over half (52.5%) were carried out in Latin America. Nearly two-thirds of research (63.3%) reported that extraction was sustainable or likely to be so. compared to less than one-fifth (17.8%) that found it to be unsustainable. Extractive enterprise in Latin America was most often reported as ecologically sustainable (82.6%). and least often in Asia (58.8%). Because little of the economic NTFP literature identifies whether extractive returns meet the financial needs of extractors. at least on a daily basis. we outline economic sustainability criteria in terms of whether returns surpass an absolute poverty line or alternative wage. Of the 71 articles presenting financial data. over two-thirds met or exceeded the threshold of economic sustainability. Roughly 75% of studies demonstrated that gatherers earned more than USD $2 PPP/day (the international absolute poverty line) or more than a local wage. These positive results do not. however. demonstrate that gathering reduces long-term poverty because forest dependence. and likely tenure security. remains low among these populations. Caution must be exercised in terms of extending these results into the future. as changing economic conditions. rates and sources of habitat modification. and climate change all point to …,True,LvlkMq4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,95,http://ethnobioconservation.com/index.php/ebc/article/view/19,10289995871040179285,/scholar?cites=10289995871040179285,,https://ethnobioconservation.com/index.php/ebc/article/download/19/91,0,0,0

Brazil,2002,Robert A Voeks,,Journal of Tropical Ecology,,121-136,Cambridge University Press,The reproductive ecology of piassava palm (Attalea funifera Mart.) was investigated for 19 months in the Atlantic forests of eastern Brazil. Its breeding biology is characterized by the production of functionally female. male and bisexual inflorescences. Staminate sterility is positively correlated with number of pistillate flowers. Staminate and pistillate flowers are receptive at anthesis. Bagging tests for apomixis were negative. Although geitonogamy can occasionally occur. outcrossing predominates. Pollen is relatively dry. but wind pollination is not a significant factor in cross pollination. Although inflorescences are visited by large numbers of insects. pollination is effected mainly by small sap beetles (Mystrops sp.) and weevils (Phyllotrox tatianae). which feed and breed in fertile staminate flowers.

The specific aim was to prepare a list of tree species over 10 cm dbh along these transects and determine their relative importance to the forest. thereby providing a better understanding of the composition of the lowland Amazonian ecosystem in the park and providing actual data for conservation ef-forts. Until about 15 years ago forests of Amazonian Ec-uador were largely inaccessible.

For this reason. countries at the innovation stage of economic development commit signiﬁcant resources to graduate education and compete intensely to attract top scientists and researchers. Although mobility is not a new phenomenon. evidence suggests that a high demand for researchers and scientists has lead to an increase in skilled migration in recent years. The number of foreign scholars employed by universities in the US provides an illustrative example. Between 1993 and 2003 this number rose over 70 per cent from about 60.000 to 84.000 scholars. the majority of which were in the hard sciences.

Brazil went through a series of economic structural adjustment policies. This article investigates how these 2 simultaneous advances altered the relationship between labor market earnings and education. We find that the economic reward for staying in school for 1 more year fundamentally changed from 1982 to 1998. Returns to tertiary education increased sharply. whereas returns to primary and lower secondary education dropped. 26% and 35%. respectively. In the same time period. wage inequality was reduced. We argue that this reduction was linked to a reduction in returns to schooling and was only secondarily linked to a more equitable distribution of schooling.

In open. increasingly knowledgebased economies. advanced education and research are key to remaining competitive. Yet the international dimension of higher education is a double-edged sword for Latin America. Mobility of skilled individuals risks eroding the region’s knowledge base and draining scarce resources. Every year emigration claims a significant portion of the region’s better-educated population (Wodon 2003).Countries in Latin America are becoming players in the global market for talent and higher education services. Between 1993 and 2002. the number of Latin American postsecondary students in the United States increased by 50 percent. Foreign providers have also entered the market for higher education in Latin America. European and US-based institutions. such as the University of Bologna. the University of Heidelberg. and New York University. now offer programs or are establishing branches in the region. Within Latin America universities have also begun to operate across borders. such as Mexico’s Technological Institute of Monterrey. which offers distance-learning programs over the Internet. Evidence from Latin America and the OECD suggests that the best strategy for reaching the frontier of new knowledge is to engage in the exchange of people and ideas rather than turn inward.

I examine the genetic architecture of life‐history variation in male and female gametophytes from two populations of the moss Ceratodon purpureus. focusing on genetic correlations within and between the sexes. A significant negative correlation between allocation to vegetative and reproductive tissue was evident in males of both populations. but not females. All traits showed between‐sex correlations of significantly less than one. indicating additive genetic variance for sexual dimorphism. The degree of dimorphism for traits was significantly negatively associated with the strength of the between‐sex correlation.

Bryophytes offer fertile material for such analyses. which can help clarify long standing biogeographic questions that were intractable before molecular data became available. In particular. molecular data can help distinguish between dispersal and fragmentation explanations for disjunct distributions that characterize many bryophytes at the specific as well as higher levels. Phylodemography is the application of molecular data and phylogenetic analyses to infer past changes in population size within species. Grounded in coalescence theory from population genetics. this new field could be fruitfully applied to bryophytes.

This paper reviews the evolutionary and developmental origins of this diversity in pollen structure using recent models based on the behaviour of colloids and formation of micelles in the differentiating microspore glycocalyx and primexine. The developmental model is consistent with observations of structures recovered by pollen wall dissolution. Pollen wall diversity in Compositae is inferred to result from small changes in the glycocalyx. for example ionic concentration. which trigger the self-assembly of highly diverse structures. Whilst the fine details of exine substructure are. therefore. not under direct genetic control. it is likely that genes establish differences in the glycocalyx which define the conditions for self-assembly.

Pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) flesh has an intense yellow/orange color owing to the high level of carotenoids. mainly α-carotene. β-carotene. β-cryptoxanthin. lutein and zeaxanthin. There is considerable interest in extracting carotenoids and other bioactives from pumpkin flesh. Extraction procedures able to preserve nutritional and pharmacological properties of carotenoids are essential. Conventional extraction methods. such as organic solvent extraction (CSE). have been used to extract carotenoids from plant material for a long time. In recent years. supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) extraction has received a great deal of attention because it is a green technology suitable for the extraction of lipophylic molecules and is able to give extracts of high quality and totally free from potentially toxic chemical solvents. Here. we review the results obtained so far on SC-CO 2 extraction efficiency and quali-quantitative composition of carotenoids from pumpkin flesh. In particular. we consider the effects of (1) dehydration pre-treatments;(2) extraction parameters (temperature and pressure); the use of water. ethanol and olive oil singularly or in combination as entrainers or pumpkin seeds as co-matrix.

The combined use of food-grade commercial plant cell-wall glycosidases (Celluclast/Novozyme plus Viscozyme) allows to increase lycopene (∼153%) and lipid (∼137%) concentration in the matrix and rises substrate load onto the extraction vessel (∼46%) compared to the control. The addition of an oleaginous co-matrix (hazelnut seeds) to the tomato matrix (1:1 by weight) increases CO2 diffusion through the highly dense enzyme-treated matrix bed and provides lipids that are co-extracted increasing lycopene yield.

The genus first appears in Cenomanian age deposits from western Canada. Alaska and the Arkagala and Koylma River basins in Russia and indicates that Metasequoia had achieved a wide distribution early in its evolutionary history. Exchange of Metasequoia between Asia and North America probably occurred across Beringia. which had become functional at the Albian-Cenomanian boundary (ca. 100 million years ago). However. if the inter-continental exchange of the early representatives of this genus occurred prior to the establishment of Beringia. migration would have still been possible across the Spitsbergen Corridor. which was functional during the Early Cretaceous.

We conducted greenhouse experiments to test the impact of light quantity and duration on both carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions of three deciduous conifers whose fossil counterparts were components of Paleogene Arctic floras: Metasequoia glyptostroboides. Taxodium distichum. and Larix laricina. We found that plant leaf bulk carbon isotopic values of the examined species were 1.75–4.63‰ more negative under continuous light (CL) than under diurnal light (DL). Hydrogen isotope values of leaf n-alkanes under continuous light conditions revealed a D-enriched hydrogen isotope composition of up to 40‰ higher than in diurnal light conditions. The isotope offsets between the two light regimes is explained by a higher ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO …,True,2zJMuicAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,67,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-009-1321-1,3524436220761609030,/scholar?cites=3524436220761609030,,http://en.xtbg.ac.cn/at/sr/201106/P020110615527986838564.pdf,0,0,0

Longterm changes in canopy cover of vegetation were evahtated between 1969 and 1984. and comparisons were made between ungazed and grazed plant communities in 1969. Long-term changes included both increases in species richness (diversity) and significant increases in canopy cover for midgrass. shortgrass. shrub. and forb species groups. Total vegetation cover was not significantly different on the grazed and ungrazed areas. but cover of midgrasses was significantly different. Increased cover of pkins lovegrass (Eragrostis intermedia Hitchc.) on the ungazed pasture was largely responsible for this difference. No differences in cover existed for the shortgrass. shrub. or forb species groups.

University of California Press, Berkeley, California, USA",,254-280,,Restoration practitioners. seed producers. academic researchers. consulting biologists. agronomists. ranchers. and landowners have made some significant advances in California grassland restoration. Many were involved in the establishment of the California Native Grasslands Association (CNGA) and the California chapter of the Society for Ecological Restoration (SERCAL). both in 1991. Hundreds of grassland restoration projects have been initiated across California. Initially. most were designed to establish permanent grassland habitats with native perennial grasses as the backbone (Anderson and Anderson 1996). Once established. individual native perennial grasses may survive for hundreds of years (Hamilton et al. 2002). and the basal clumps form the structural basis for a physically more complex habitat. The focus on perennial grasses in California grassland restoration is based on the assumption that by restoring the structural diversity of perennial bunchgrasses. colonization and survival of associated herbs. shrubs. insects. small mammals. and other community members will eventually occur (MacArthur et al. 1966; Bell et al. 1991; Huston 1994; Rosenzwieg 1995; Vickery et al. 2001; Goerrissen 2005). Also. because native perennial grasses are persistent. it is assumed they will provide greater resistance to invasion and resilience to stress than annual species. Whether sites restored to native perennial grasses achieve the ultimate goal of a restored ecosystem. as defined by SER. however. has rarely been evaluated. More recently. there has been greater emphasis on other plant groups. such as native forbs.

These represent local. not global. species extinctions. Coastal habitats. including mangroves. have lost 39% of their species. while inland forests have last 29%. Epiphytic species (62% loss) appear particularly prone to extinction. which is reflected in a similar disposition exhibited by the Orchidaceae. Deforestation and disturbance have been the main cause of plant species extinction in Singapore. The rich mangrove epiphyte flora has been totally exterminated. and a number of tree species are reduced to populations of a few mature individuals. Many more species continue to survive than the species‐area relationship would predict given the 99.8% loss of primary forest.
