1211231,The role of cyclooxygenase-2 in cell proliferation and cell death in human malignancies,2010,Cyril Sobolewski and Claudia Cerella and Mario Dicato and Lina Ghibelli and Marc Diederich,2010,,,,Hindawi,It is well admitted that the link between chronic inflammation and cancer involves cytokines and mediators of inflammatory pathways. which act during the different steps of tumorigenesis. The cyclooxygenases (COXs) are a family of enzymes. which catalyze the rate-limiting step of prostaglandin biosynthesis. This family contains three members: ubiquitously expressed COX-1. which is involved in homeostasis; the inducible COX-2 isoform. which is upregulated during both inflammation and cancer; and COX-3. expressed in brain and spinal cord. whose functions remain to be elucidated. COX-2 was described to modulate cell proliferation and apoptosis mainly in solid tumors. that is. colorectal. breast. and prostate cancers. and. more recently. in hematological malignancies. These findings prompt us to analyze here the effects of a combination of COX-2 inhibitors together with different clinically used therapeutic strategies in order to further improve the efficiency of future anticancer treatments. COX-2 modulation is a promising field investigated by many research groups.,True,0N8cM-QAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,430,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2010/215158/abs/,9739257557107259236,/scholar?cites=9739257557107259236,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2010/215158/abs/,0,0,0
1211232,Targeting COX-2 expression by natural compounds: a promising alternative strategy to synthetic COX-2 inhibitors for cancer chemoprevention and therapy,2010,Claudia Cerella and Cyril Sobolewski and Mario Dicato and Marc Diederich,80,,12,1801-1815,Elsevier,Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is a pro-inflammatory immediate early response protein. chronically up-regulated in many pathological conditions. In autoimmune diseases. it is responsible for degenerative effects whereas in cancer. it correlates with poor prognosis. A constitutive expression of COX-2 is triggered since the earliest steps of carcinogenesis. Consequently. strategies aimed at inhibiting COX-2 enzymatic activity have been clinically applied for the treatment of autoimmune disorders; in addition. the same approaches are currently investigated for anti-cancer purposes. However. COX-2 protein inhibitors (i.e.. NSAIDs and COXIBs) are not amenable to prolonged administration since they may cause severe side effects. and efforts are underway to identify alternative approaches for chemoprevention/therapy.

1211234,Deciphering miRNAs’ action through miRNA editing,2019,Marta Correia de Sousa and Monika Gjorgjieva and Dobrochna Dolicka and Cyril Sobolewski and Michelangelo Foti,20,,24,6249,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with the capability of modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level either by inhibiting messenger RNA (mRNA) translation or by promoting mRNA degradation. The outcome of a myriad of physiological processes and pathologies. including cancer. cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. relies highly on miRNAs. However. deciphering the precise roles of specific miRNAs in these pathophysiological contexts is challenging due to the high levels of complexity of their actions. Indeed. regulation of mRNA expression by miRNAs is frequently cell/organ specific; highly dependent on the stress and metabolic status of the organism; and often poorly correlated with miRNA expression levels. Such biological features of miRNAs suggest that various regulatory mechanisms control not only their expression. but also their activity and/or bioavailability. Several mechanisms have been described to modulate miRNA action. including genetic polymorphisms. methylation of miRNA promoters. asymmetric miRNA strand selection. interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or other coding/non-coding RNAs. Moreover. nucleotide modifications (A-to-I or C-to-U) within the miRNA sequences at different stages of their maturation are also critical for their functionality. This regulatory mechanism called “RNA editing” involves specific enzymes of the adenosine/cytidine deaminase family. which trigger single nucleotide changes in primary miRNAs. These nucleotide modifications greatly influence a miRNA’s stability. maturation and activity by changing its specificity towards target mRNAs.

1211235,MicroRNAs-dependent regulation of PPARs in metabolic diseases and cancers,2017,Dorothea Portius and Cyril Sobolewski and Michelangelo Foti,2017,,,,Hindawi,Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of ligand-dependent nuclear receptors. which control the transcription of genes involved in energy homeostasis and inflammation and cell proliferation/differentiation. Alterations of PPARs’ expression and/or activity are commonly associated with metabolic disorders occurring with obesity. type 2 diabetes. and fatty liver disease. as well as with inflammation and cancer. Emerging evidence now indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs). a family of small noncoding RNAs. which fine-tune gene expression. play a significant role in the pathophysiological mechanisms regulating the expression and activity of PPARs. Herein. the regulation of PPARs by miRNAs is reviewed in the context of metabolic disorders. inflammation. and cancer.

In many cancer types. loss of TTP expression is observed allowing for stabilization of ARE-mRNAs and their pathologic overexpression. Here we demonstrate that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Trichostatin A. SAHA and sodium butyrate) promote TTP expression in colorectal cancer cells (HCA-7. HCT-116. Moser and SW480 cells) and cervix carcinoma cells (HeLa). We found that HDAC inhibitors-induced TTP expression. promote the decay of COX-2 mRNA. and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. HDAC inhibitors were found to promote TTP transcription through activation of the transcription factor Early Growth Response protein 1 (EGR1). Altogether. our findings indicate that loss of TTP in tumors occurs through silencing of EGR1 and suggests a therapeutic approach to rescue TTP expression in colorectal cancer.

This effect has been associated with the inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity but also as an off-target effect essentially in adherent cancer cell models. In this study. we investigated the effect of three COX-2 inhibitors (nimesulide. NS-398 and celecoxib) on cell proliferation of leukemic and lymphoblastic cells expressing COX-2 at high (U937. Jurkat. Hel and Raji) and very low (K562) protein levels. We found that the inhibitors reduce cell proliferation in all COX-2-expressing cells leading to an accumulation in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. We provide evidence that this modulation corresponds to an accumulation of cells in G0 paralleled by the expression of cell differentiation markers in U937 (CD15) and Hel (CD41a and CD61) cells but not in the insensitive K562.

Extensive efforts to target this enzyme have been developed to reduce growth of cancer cells for chemopreventive and therapeutic reasons. In this context. cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors present interesting antitumor effects. However. inhibition of COX-2 by anti-COX-2 compounds such as celecoxib was recently associated with detrimental cardiovascular side effects limiting their clinical use. As many anticancer effects of celecoxib are COX-2 independent. analogs such as 2.5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC). which lacks COX-2-inhibitory activity. represent a promising alternative strategy.

AUBPs can bind to the AU-rich elements present in the 3’-UTR of more than 8% of all mRNAs and are thereby able to control the stability and/or translation of numerous target mRNAs. The regulation of the stability and the translation of mRNA transcripts by AUBPs are highly complex processes that occur through multiple mechanisms depending on the cell type and the cellular context. While AUBPs have been shown to be involved in inflammatory processes and the development of various cancers. their important role and function in the development of chronic metabolic and inflammatory fatty liver diseases (FLDs). as well as in the progression of these disorders toward cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). has recently started to emerge. Alterations of either the expression or activity of AUBPs are indeed significantly associated with FLDs and HCC. and accumulating evidence indicates that several AUBPs are deeply involved in a significant number of cellular processes governing hepatic metabolic disorders. inflammation. fibrosis. and carcinogenesis.

However. the pathophysiological roles of miR-22-3p in the deregulated hepatic metabolism with obesity and cancer remains poorly characterized. Herein. we observed that alterations of hepatic miR-22-3p expression with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the context of obesity are not consistent in various human cohorts and animal models in contrast to the well-characterized miR-22-3p downregulation observed in hepatic cancers. To unravel the role of miR-22 in obesity-associated NAFLD. we generated constitutive Mir22 knockout (miR-22KO) mice. which were subsequently rendered obese by feeding with fat-enriched diet. Functional NAFLD-and obesity-associated metabolic parameters were then analyzed. Insights about the role of miR-22 in NAFLD associated with obesity were further obtained through an unbiased proteomic analysis of miR-22KO livers from obese mice. Metabolic processes governed by miR-22 were finally investigated in hepatic transformed cancer cells. Deletion of Mir22 was asymptomatic when mice were bred under standard conditions. except for an onset of glucose intolerance. However. when challenged with a high fat-containing diet. Mir22 deficiency dramatically exacerbated fat mass gain. hepatomegaly. and liver steatosis in mice.

1211253,Stress granules in colorectal cancer: Current knowledge and potential therapeutic applications,2020,Noémie Legrand and Dan A Dixon and Cyril Sobolewski,26,,35,5223,Baishideng Publishing Group Inc,Stress granules (SGs) represent important non-membrane cytoplasmic compartments. involved in cellular adaptation to various stressful conditions (eg.. hypoxia. nutrient deprivation. oxidative stress). These granules contain several scaffold proteins and RNA-binding proteins. which bind to mRNAs and keep them translationally silent while protecting them from harmful conditions. Although the role of SGs in cancer development is still poorly known and vary between cancer types. increasing evidence indicate that the expression and/or the activity of several key SGs components are deregulated in colorectal tumors but also in pre-neoplastic conditions (eg.. inflammatory bowel disease). thus suggesting a potential role in the onset of colorectal cancer (CRC). It is therefore believed that SGs formation importantly contributes to various steps of colorectal tumorigenesis but also in chemoresistance.

Its leaves are used for its antipyretic properties in traditional areas. The aim of our study is to determine the acute toxicity and the antipyretic activity of a methanolic extract of Alchornea cordifolia leaves. Acute toxicity was assessed by measuring mortality. changes in body weight. spontaneous movements. and normal rectal temperature in mice. Antipyretic activity was evaluated by brewer’s yeast-induced hyperpyrexia in rats according to Teotino method (1963). The antipyretic effect of methanolicextract of Alchornea cordifolia leaves was compared with paracetamol (100 mg/kg bw) orally. Groups of mice treated with doses of 6500; 3250; 1625 and 812.5 mg/kg of the extract did not show any mortality. nor significant alteration of body weight. nor alteration of spontaneous movements.

An exploratory series (series 1) was used to assess phenotypic heterogeneity and to identify early criteria predicting future outcome; it included 75 consecutive steroid-free patients. longitudinally evaluated for motor. respiratory. cardiac and cognitive functions (median follow-up: 10.5 yrs). A validation series (series 2) was used to test robustness of the selected predictive criteria; it included 34 more routinely evaluated patients (age>12 yrs). Multivariate analysis of series 1 classified 70/75 patients into 4 clusters with distinctive intellectual and motor outcomes: A (early infantile DMD. 20%): severe intellectual and motor outcomes; B (classical DMD. 28%): intermediate intellectual and poor motor outcome; C (moderate pure motor DMD. 22%): normal intelligence and delayed motor impairment; and D (severe pure motor DMD. 30%): normal intelligence and poor motor outcome.

Our study is based on a cellular automaton model which aims at reproducing the kinetics of a lump of glioma cells deposited on a substrate of collagen. The dynamical effects of cell attraction and motion inertia are introduced through adequate automaton rules. We compare the density profiles given by the model to those obtained experimentally. The result of the best fit indicates a substantial cell–cell attraction due to cell–cell communication through gap junctions (or chemotaxis) and negligible inertia effects during migration.

Recently. organotypical brain cultures were successfully used in short-term invasion studies on glioma cell lines. In this paper the authors report that the invasiveness of human glioma biopsy specimens directly implanted into rodent brain slices by using the intraslice implantation system (ISIS) can be quantified with precision. The model was first validated by the demonstration that. in long-term studies. established glioma cells survive in the ISIS and follow pathways of invasion similar to those in vivo.Methods. Brain slices (400 µm thick) from newborn mice were maintained on millicell membranes for 15 days. Cells from two human and one rodent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines injected into the ISIS were detected by …,True,FrDVylgAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,52,https://thejns.org/view/journals/j-neurosurg/97/1/article-p169.xml,10970322250632122728,/scholar?cites=10970322250632122728,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1640/ab7767746dc8a31fba7bade6f82d5260320a.pdf,0,0,0

The model is based on a cellular automaton where the various dynamical effects are introduced through adequate evolution rules. Using our model. we investigate the role of homotype and heterotype gap junction communication and show that it is possible to reproduce the corresponding experimental migration patterns. In particular. we confirm the experimental findings that inhibition of homotype gap junctions favours migration while heterotype inhibition hinders it.

Regulation of NSC fate by small molecules is important for the generation of a certain type of cell. The identification of small molecules that can induce new neurons from NSCs could facilitate regenerative medicine and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study. we screened natural compounds to identify molecules that are effective on NSC cell fate determination. We found that Kuwanon V (KWV). which was isolated from the mulberry tree (Morus bombycis) root. increased neurogenesis in rat NSCs. In addition. during NSC differentiation. KWV increased cell survival and inhibited cell proliferation as shown by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine pulse experiments. Ki67 immunostaining and neurosphere forming assays. Interestingly. KWV enhanced neuronal differentiation and decreased NSC proliferation even in the presence of mitogens such as epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2.

The molecular basis of McCune-Albright syndrome and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.,1996,Matthew D Ringel and William F Schwindinger and Michael A Levine,75,,4,171-184,,Inactivating and activating mutations in the gene encoding G alpha s (GNAS1) are known to be the basis for 2 well-described contrasting clinical disorders. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). AHO is an autosomal dominant disorder due to germline mutations in GNAS1 that decrease expression or function of G alpha s protein. Loss of G alpha s function leads to tissue resistance to multiple hormones whose receptors couple to G alpha s. By contrast. MAS results from postzygotic somatic mutations in GNAS1 that lead to enhanced function of G alpha s protein. Acquisition of the activating mutation early in life leads to a more generalized distribution of the mosaicism and is associated with the classic clinical triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. endocrine hyperfunction. and café au lait skin lesions described in MAS. Acquisition of a similar activating mutation in GNAS1 later in life presumably accounts for the restricted distribution of the gsp oncogene. and is associated with the development of isolated lesions (for example. fibrous dysplasia. pituitary or thyroid tumors) without other manifestations of MAS. Tissues that are affected by loss of G alpha s function in AHO are also affected by gain of G alpha s function in MAS. thus identifying specific tissues in which the second messenger cAMP plays a dominant role in cell growth. proliferation. or function.

Substantial evidence suggests that the antiproliferative effect of these TZD members in cancer cells is independent of PPARγ activation. To discern the role of PPARγ in the antitumor effects of TZDs. we have synthesized PPARγ-inactive TZD analogs which. although devoid of PPARγ activity. retain the ability to induce apoptosis with a potency equal to that of their parental TZDs in cancer cell lines with varying PPARγ expression status. Mechanistic studies from this and other laboratories have further suggested that troglitazone and ciglitazone mediate antiproliferative effects through a complexity of PPARγ-independent mechanisms. Evidence indicates that troglitazone …,True,Y7RtOdkAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,178,https://erc.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/erc/13/2/0130401.xml,2874967875671824883,/scholar?cites=2874967875671824883,,https://erc.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/erc/13/2/0130401.xml,0,0,0

However. the clinical identification of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) among patients with benign thyroid nodules is still a challenge. Preoperative fine needle aspiration-based cytology cannot always differentiate follicular carcinomas from benign follicular neoplasias. Because current methods fail to improve preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules. new molecular-based diagnoses should be explored. We conducted a microarray-based study to reveal the genetic profiles unique to FTC and follicular adenomas (FAs). to identify the most parsimonious number of genes that could accurately differentiate between benign and malignant follicular thyroid neoplasia. We confirmed our data by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in two independent validation sets with a total of 114 samples.

However. the usefulness of immunoassay is limited by both the requirement for thyroid hormone withdrawal to attain optimal test sensitivity and interference by antithyroglobulin antibodies. To circumvent these problems. we amplified thyroglobulin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in peripheral blood using RT-PCR and compared the accuracy of this test to serum thyroglobulin immunoassay in patients with thyroid cancer.Thyroglobulin mRNA was amplified from peripheral blood of 77 patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for well differentiated thyroid cancer. 68 of whom while taking thyroid hormone for TSH suppression.

AHO patients with mutations on maternally inherited alleles are resistant to multiple hormones (e.g.. PTH. TSH). a variant termed pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type 1a. due to presumed tissue-specific paternal imprinting of the α chain of Gs as demonstrated in murine renal proximal tubule and fat cells.

Although the biological role of CRH remains enigmatic. the presence of functional CRH receptors in the myometrium suggests that CRH may modulate myometrial contractility and hence parturition. CRH action is mediated via multiple receptor subtypes and pregnancy results in differential receptor expression. These receptors are primarily linked to the adenylate cyclase second messenger system. which would help the intracellular microenvironment to maintain the required myometrial quiescence. CRH can exert further actions such as inhibition of prostaglandin production to prevent contractions.

The type 1 receptors are highly expressed throughout the cerebral cortex. a region involved in cognitive function and modulation of stress responses. where they are coupled to the adenylyl cyclase system. Using techniques that analyse receptor‐mediated guanine‐nucleotide binding protein (G‐proteins) activation. we recently demonstrated that expressed type 1α CRH receptors are capable of activating multiple G‐proteins. which suggests that CRH can regulate multiple signalling pathways.

Furthermore. the intrauterine health of the baby is important for preventing certain adult diseases. However. the molecular mechanisms driving the onset of human labour remain uncertain. although several key players have been identified. It is becoming clear that there are many pathways to parturition in humans. Stress peptides. in particular placental corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and possibly the related peptide urocortin. appear to play important roles throughout pregnancy. Plasma CRH is a predictor of the duration of human gestation. During most of pregnancy. CRH. acting via specific CRH receptor subtypes. plays a ‘protective’role by promoting myometrial quiescence via the generation of cAMP and cGMP. and upregulation of nitric oxide synthase expression. At term. myometrial contractility is enhanced by a complex series of molecular switches. involving the upregulation of oxytocin receptor expression and crosstalk between the oxytocin and CRH receptors. This results in protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation of specific CRH receptor subtypes. with subsequent desensitization and a shift in the intracellular microenvironment to enhance contractility. CRH/urocortin. via specific receptor isoforms. is now able to activate Gq and potentially enhance the oxytocin-driven generation of inositol triphosphate. In addition.

In this review we focus on the diverse structural and functional characteristics of the family of CRH-like peptides and their receptors.,True,iCoj5SoAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,78,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.889.831&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12520067149906322103,/scholar?cites=12520067149906322103,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.889.831&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1211408,Placental corticotrophin‐releasing hormone and its receptors in human pregnancy and labour: still a scientific enigma,2008,DK Grammatopoulos,20,,4,432-438,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,It is now accepted that. in humans. placental corticotrophin‐releasing hormone (CRH) is involved in the mechanisms controlling the onset of labour; however. the precise biological role in foeto–maternal tissues remain enigmatic. Maternal plasma levels of CRH rise exponentially as pregnancy progresses towards term and peak during labour; however. evidence to link this with an active role in the onset and progression of labour. is still inconclusive. Certainly. one of the tissues targeted by CRH is the myometrial smooth muscle. which expresses a plethora of specific CRH receptors. This finding implicates CRH in the mechanisms preparing the myometrial microenvironment for the onset of labour and possibly in the regulation of active contractility during labour. Other gestational tissues also targeted by CRH include the placenta. foetal membranes and foetal adrenals. where CRH might regulate distinct physiological …,True,iCoj5SoAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,72,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01660.x,2716078723477015821,/scholar?cites=2716078723477015821,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2826.2008.01660.x,0,0,0

In this study we investigated the expression of urocortin II (UCN II) in human myometrium and its ability to phosphorylate intracellular components that can be involved in modulating myometrial contractility. Using RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization. we demonstrated that UCN II and type-2 CRH receptor (CRH-R2) mRNAs were expressed in human nonpregnant and pregnant myometrium. Immunofluorescent studies confirmed protein expression of UCN II in human pregnant myometrial cells. whereas chemical cross-linking studies with radiolabeled UCN II confirmed the presence of CRH-R2 sites with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa.

To characterize molecular determinants of CRH-R2 functional activity. we used HEK293 cells overexpressing recombinant CRH-R2β and investigated mechanisms involved in attenuation of CRH-R2 signaling activity and uncoupling from intracellular effectors. CRH-R2β-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation was sensitive to homologous desensitization induced by pretreatment with either UCN-II or the weaker agonist CRH. CRH-R2β activation induced transient β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. as well as clathrin. recruitment to the plasma membrane. β-Arrestin2 appeared to be the main β-arrestin subtype associated with the receptor.

The efficiency of CRH actions is determined by expression of functional receptors (CRH-R). which are dynamically regulated. Studies in myometrial tissue biopsies using quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the onset of labor. term or preterm. is associated with a significant 2- to 3-fold increase in CRH-R1 mRNA levels. Detailed analysis of myometrial CRH-R1 mRNA variants showed a decline of the pro-CRH-R1 mRNA encoding the CRH-R1β variant during labor and increased mRNA levels of CRH-R1d mRNA. Studies in myometrial cells identified IL-1β as an important regulator of myometrial CRH-R1 gene expression because prolonged treatment of myometrial cells with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 18 h induced expression of CRH-R1 mRNA levels by 1.5- to 2-fold but significantly attenuated CRH-R1β mRNA expression by 70%.

A few mitochondria genomes have been sequenced. but a comprehensive picture of the domestication event for silkworm mitochondria remains to be established. In this study. we integrate the extant data. and perform a whole genome resequencing of Japanese wild silkworm to obtain breakthrough results in silkworm mitochondrial (mt) population. and finally use these to deduce a more comprehensive phylogeny of the Bombycidae. We identified 347 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mt genome. but found no past recombination event to have occurred in the silkworm progenitor. A phylogeny inferred from these whole genome SNPs resulted in a well-classified tree. confirming that the domesticated silkworm. Bombyx mori. most recently diverged from the Chinese wild silkworm. rather than from the Japanese wild silkworm. We showed that the population sizes of the domesticated and Chinese wild silkworms both experience neither expansion nor contraction. We also discovered that one mt gene. named cytochrome b. shows a strong signal of positive selection in the domesticated clade. This gene is related to energy metabolism. and may have played an important role during silkworm domestication.

Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 50 variants associated with increased risk for type 1 diabetes. Comparison of these variants with those identified in other autoimmune diseases reveals three important findings: (1) there is a high degree of overlap in implicated variants in diseases with similar pathophysiology. (2) in diseases with differing pathophysiology the same variants are often implicated in opposite roles. (3) in diseases with differing pathophysiology that have many non-overlapping or oppositely implicated variants there are still several variants which are overlapping or shared.

In humans. haploinsufficiency of SIM1 causes early-onset obesity. Mice deficient in the homologous gene. SIM1. also exhibit early onset obesity and increased sensitivity to a high fat diet. SIM1 is expressed in several areas of the brain implicated in control of energy balance including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). the supraoptic nucleus (SON). the medial amygdala and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. We have previously shown that mice with global Sim1 neuron ablation exhibit obesity with hyperphagia as the primary defect. The PVN has a critical role in feeding and in high-fat appetite. thus. we sought to determine the effect of Sim1 neuron ablation limited to the PVN. We achieved PVN-SIM1 limited ablation through stereotactic injection of diphtheria toxin into the PVN of Sim1Cre-iDTR mice. The specificity of this ablation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR of the PVN. supraoptic nucleus and the amygdala.

We generated Clec16a inducible knockout (KO) mice to examine the functional link between CLEC16A auto-inflammation and autoimmunity. Clec16a KO mice exhibited weight loss and thymic and splenic atrophy. Mitochondrial potential was lowered in KO mice splenocytes resulting in aggregation of unhealthy mitochondria in B. T. and NK cells. In Clec16a KO mice we detected disrupted mitophagy in splenic B and T cells. NK cells from Clec16a KO mice exhibited increased cytotoxicity. Incomplete mitophagy was attenuated with PI3K and/or MEK inhibition in Clec16a KO mice. Our results demonstrate a functional link between CLEC16A and disrupted mitophagy in immune cells and show that incomplete mitophagy predisposes the KO mice to inflammation. Taken together. loss of function variants in CLEC16A that are associated with decreased CLEC16A expression levels may contribute to inflammation in autoimmunity through disrupted mitophagy.

This is achieved by a feedback loop that receives input from the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR). expressed on the surface of parathyroid cells. In response to low ionized calcium. the parathyroids increase secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases serum calcium. The CASR is also highly expressed in the kidneys. where it regulates the reabsorption of calcium from the primary filtrate. Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) type 1 is caused by heterozygous activating mutations in the CASR which increase the sensitivity of the CASR to extracellular ionized calcium. Consequently. PTH synthesis and secretion is suppressed at normal ionized calcium concentrations. Patients present with hypocalcemia. hyperphosphatemia. low magnesium levels. and low or low-normal levels of PTH. Urinary calcium excretion is typically increased due to the decrease in circulating PTH concentrations and by the activation of the renal tubular CASR. Therapeutic attempts using CASR antagonists (calcilytics) to treat ADH are currently under investigation. Recently. heterozygous mutations in the alpha subunit of the G protein G11 (GNA11) have been identified in patients with ADH. and this has been classified as ADH type 2. ADH2 mutations lead to a gain-of-function of Gα11. a key mediator of CASR signaling. Therefore. the mechanism of hypocalcemia appears similar to that of activating mutations in the CASR. namely an increase in the sensitivity of parathyroid cells to extracellular ionized calcium.

1211491,Stress and the HPA axi: Role of glucocorticoids in alcohol dependence.,2012,Mary Ann C Stephens and Gary Wand,,,,,Superintendent of Documents,Stress has long been suggested to be an important correlate of uncontrolled drinking and relapse. An important hormonal response system to stress—the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis—may be involved in this process. particularly stress hormones known as glucocorticoids and primarily cortisol. The actions of this hormone system normally are tightly regulated to ensure that the body can respond quickly to stressful events and return to a normal state just as rapidly. The main determinants of HPA axis activity are genetic background. early-life environment. and current life stress. Alterations in HPA axis regulation are associated with problematic alcohol use and dependence; however. the nature of this dysregulation appears to vary with respect to stage of alcohol dependence.

Currently available data suggest that ethanol increases opioid neurotransmission and that this activation is part of the mechanism responsible for its reinforcing effects. Findings from preclinical research indicate that ethanol consumption and ethanol-induced dopamine (DA) release are both reduced by opioid antagonists. Individual differences in endogenous opioid activity have been linked to inherited risks for alcoholism in studies comparing ethanol-preferring and nonpreferring rats. as well as in studies using targeted gene mutation (knockout) strategies.

Additionally. presence of a proinflammatory state shown in recent literature in both diabetes and depression may contribute to this as well.

To understand the role of the cAMP–PKA signal transduction in mediating the effects of ethanol. we have studied ethanol consumption and the sedative effects of ethanol in three lines of genetically modified mice. We report that mice with the targeted disruption of one Gsα allele as well as mice with reduced neuronal PKA activity have decreased alcohol consumption compared with their wild-type littermates. Genetic reduction of cAMP–PKA signaling also makes mice more sensitive to the sedative effects of ethanol. although plasma ethanol concentrations are unaffected. In contrast. mice with increased adenylyl cyclase activity resulting from the transgenic expression of a constitutively active form of Gsα in neurons within the forebrain are less sensitive to the sedative effects of ethanol.

Anesthetics have been previously shown to induce tau hyperphosphorylation through a mechanism involving hypothermia-induced inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. However. the effects of propofol. a common clinically used intravenous anesthetic. on tau phosphorylation under normothermic conditions are unknown. We investigated the effects of a general anesthetic dose of propofol on levels of phosphorylated tau in the mouse hippocampus and cortex under normothermic conditions. Thirty min following the administration of propofol 250 mg/kg i.p.. significant increases in tau phosphorylation were observed at the AT8. CP13. and PHF-1 phosphoepitopes in the hippocampus. as well as at AT8. PHF-1. MC6. pS262. and pS422 epitopes in the cortex. However. we did not detect somatodendritic relocalization of tau. In both brain regions. tau hyperphosphorylation persisted at the AT8 epitope 2 h following propofol. although the sedative effects of the drug were no longer evident at this time point. By 6 h following propofol. levels of phosphorylated tau at AT8 returned to control levels. An initial decrease in the activity and expression of PP2A were observed. suggesting that PP2A inhibition is at least partly responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau at multiple sites following 30 min of propofol exposure. We also examined tau phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells transfected to overexpress human tau.

Preterm delivery was defined as spontaneous onset of labor resulting in delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. in a singleton pregnancy. with no apparent etiology for preterm labor and delivery. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. and β2AR alleles were identified by established techniques. Results: Only one woman (4%) with preterm labor was homozygous for Arg16 versus 79 (31%) in the control group (P =.01. odds ratio 0.08). There was no association of preterm labor with genotype at position 27.

These receptors are primarily linked to the adenylate cyclase second messenger system. which would help the intracellular microenvironment to maintain the required myometrial quiescence.

However. the function of this placental CRH is entirely unknown. A number of observations have led us to believe that CRH might influence myometrial contractility and. hence. parturition via specific receptor mechanisms. 1) In idiopathic preterm labor. plasma immunoreactive-CRH concentrations are significantly elevated compared to control values. 2) CRH and oxytocin exhibit a marked synergistic effect on myometrial contractility which is prostaglandin dependent and can be inhibited by the CRH receptor antagonist [alpha-helical CRF-(9-41)]. In view of this. we searched for specific CRH-binding sites in myometrial tissue obtained at biopsy from pregnant (cesarian section) and nonpregnant (hysterectomy) patients. To test for the presence of CRH receptors …,True,QsZ_T9gAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,134,https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/76/3/736/2649823,4184765558898372358,/scholar?cites=4184765558898372358,,,0,0,0
1211562,NEUROTRANSMITTER REGULATION OF CORTICOTROPIN‐RELEASING FACTOR IN VITRO,1977,Mortyn T Jones and Edward W Hillhouse,297,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,1,536-558,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,The release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is controlled by several factors including stress. circadian rhythm. and feedback mechanisms. It is generally accepted that the secretion of CRF occurs from nerve cells originating in the hypothalamus and terminating in the median eminence. The secretion of CRF is therefore dependent on the excitatory and inhibitory inputs that become integrated at the hypothalamic level. We. therefore. set up a preparation of the whole rat hypothalamus in vitro in order to examine the role of various putative neurotransmitters in the regulation of CRF. Such a preparation has several advantages. It enables CRF secretion to be measured directly and the environment remains constant. Its limitations include the loss of neural and feedback inputs from other parts of the brain and enzymes released from the tissue can cause degradation of some of the hypothalamic hormones (eg TRH).,True,QsZ_T9gAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,128,https://www.academia.edu/download/48519815/j.1749-6632.1977.tb41881.x20160902-13159-1ibec6i.pdf,15197330514894425939,/scholar?cites=15197330514894425939,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48519815/j.1749-6632.1977.tb41881.x20160902-13159-1ibec6i.pdf,0,0,0

1211564,Role of stress peptides during human pregnancy and labour,2002,Edward W Hillhouse and Dimitris K Grammatopoulos,124,,3,323-329,PORTLAND PRESS,Premature birth is the major source of perinatal death and disability. Furthermore. the intrauterine health of the baby is important for preventing certain adult diseases. However. the molecular mechanisms driving the onset of human labour remain uncertain. although several key players have been identified. It is becoming clear that there are many pathways to parturition in humans. Stress peptides. in particular placental corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and possibly the related peptide urocortin. appear to play important roles throughout pregnancy. Plasma CRH is a predictor of the duration of human gestation. During most of pregnancy. CRH. acting via specific CRH receptor subtypes. plays a ‘protective’role by promoting myometrial quiescence via the generation of cAMP and cGMP. and upregulation of nitric oxide synthase expression. At term. myometrial contractility is enhanced by a complex series of molecular switches. involving the upregulation of oxytocin receptor expression and crosstalk between the oxytocin and CRH receptors. This results in protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation of specific CRH receptor subtypes. with subsequent desensitization and a shift in the intracellular microenvironment to enhance contractility. CRH/urocortin. via specific receptor isoforms. is now able to activate Gq and potentially enhance the oxytocin-driven generation of inositol triphosphate. In addition. CRH/urocortin. via specific CRH receptor subtypes. may generate prostaglandins from the fetal membranes and decidua. play a role in placental vasodilatation and participate in fetal adrenal function and organ maturation.

We therefore investigated the direct effect of FGF21 on cardio-protection in obese and lean hearts in response to ischemia.  Methods and Results FGF21. FGF21-receptor 1 (FGFR1) and beta-Klotho (βKlotho) were expressed in rodent. human hearts and primary rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiac FGF21 was expressed and secreted (real time RT-PCR/western blot and ELISA) in an autocrine-paracrine manner. in response to obesity and hypoxia. involving FGFR1-βKlotho components. Cardiac-FGF21 expression and secretion were increased in response to global ischemia. In contrast βKlotho was reduced in obese hearts. In isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes.

MSTN orthologues have been previously characterized in 12 vertebrate species. including the white bass Morone chrysops. Presented herein is the identification and characterization of novel cDNA clones from two additional Morone species: saxatilis (striped bass) and americana (white perch). which were obtained by PCR amplification and subsequent TA-cloning.

We measured fasting myostatin mRNA levels in adult tilapia skeletal muscle and in whole larvae. Although fasting reduced some growth indexes in adults. skeletal muscle myostatin mRNA levels were unaffected. By contrast. larval myostatin mRNA levels were sometimes elevated after a short-term fast and were consistently reduced with prolonged fasting. These effects were specific for myostatin. as mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphatase were unchanged. Cortisol levels were elevated in fasted larvae with reduced myostatin mRNA. whereas in addition immersion of larvae in 1 ppm (2.8 μM) cortisol reduced myostatin mRNA in a time-dependent fashion.

Both ligands bind and activate ActRIIB receptors with similar affinities and should therefore have similar actions. yet these studies suggest that GDF11 activates muscle regeneration whereas myostatin is well known to inhibit it. They also suggest that circulating GDF11 levels. but not those of myostatin. decline with age. We performed a careful assessment of the ELISA used to quantify circulating myostatin in these studies and determined that assay reagents significantly cross react with each protein. each of which is highly homologous.

Recent studies suggest that myostatin may influence many of these systems. We therefore sought to determine whether they are affected by aging. especially in ‘middle-aged’MstnK/K mice (12–20 months old (mo)). Although body weights were similar in wild-type (WT) and MstnK/K mice. lean fat-free mass and skeletal muscles composed of predominantly type I.

1211604,Anatomy and organization of human skin,2004,JA McGrath and RAJ Eady and FM Pope,1,Rook’s textbook of dermatology,,3.2-3.80,Wiley-Blackwell. London. UK.,Human skin consists of a stratified. cellular epidermis and an underlying dermis of connective tissue [1–5]. The dermal–epidermal junction is undulating in section; ridges of the epidermis. known as rete ridges. project into the dermis. The junction provides mechanical support for the epidermis and acts as a partial barrier against exchange of cells and large molecules. Below the dermis is a fatty layer. the panniculus adiposus. usually designated as ‘subcutaneous’. This is separated from the rest of the body by a vestigial layer of striated muscle. the panniculus carnosus. There are two main kinds of human skin. Glabrous skin (non-hairy skin). found on the palms and soles. is grooved on its surface by continuously alternating ridges and sulci. in individually unique configurations known as dermatoglyphics. It is characterized by a thick epidermis divided into several well-marked layers. including a compact stratum corneum. by the presence of encapsulated sense organs within the dermis. and by a lack of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Hair-bearing skin (Fig. 3.1). on the other hand. has both hair follicles and sebaceous glands but lacks encapsulated sense organs. There is also wide variation between different body sites. For example. the scalp with its large hair follicles may be contrasted with the forehead. which has only small vellus-producing follicles. albeit associated with large sebaceous glands. The axilla is notable because it has apocrine glands in addition to the eccrine sweat glands. which are found throughout the body.

1211617,The role of elastin and collagen in cutaneous aging: intrinsic aging versus photoexposure.,2008,Jouni Uitto,7,,2 Suppl,s12-6,,Cutaneous aging occurs through 2 biologically distinct processes: intrinsic and extrinsic aging. The first is a naturally occurring process that results from slow tissue degeneration. In human dermis. intrinsic aging is characterized by 3 features: atrophy of the dermis due to loss of collagen. degeneration in the elastic fiber network. and loss of hydration. In contrast to intrinsic aging. extrinsic aging is due to environmental factors. Since ultraviolet (UV) exposure is the principal cause of extrinsic aging. it is often referred to as photoaging. At the microscopic level. the distinguishing feature of photoaging is a massive accumulation of elastotic material in the upper and middle dermis. a process termed solar elastosis. Using recombinant DNA technology. it has become possible to demonstrate that UV radiation can activate the human elastin promoter. This provides a mechanism for enhanced elastin biosynthesis. which contributes to the clinical and morphologic changes observed in photoaged skin.,True,RNA4e6cAAAAJ:Amrzk_ktLr0C,306,https://europepmc.org/article/med/18404866,11810900605757790579,/scholar?cites=11810900605757790579,,,0,0,0

Loss-of-function mutations in the profilaggrin gene (FLG) are common and are present in up to 10% of the population. These mutations are the cause of the semi-dominant skin-scaling disorder ichthyosis vulgaris and are a major risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis. The discovery of these mutations also provides new data concerning the genetics of atopic asthma as well as intriguing insight into disease mechanisms of systemic allergies involving antigen exposure in skin with defective barrier function.

The proteins encoded by these multiple genes regulate distinct functions. We show here a functional link between tumors with VHL mutations and those with disruption of the genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits B (SDHB) and D (SDHD). A transcription profile of reduced oxidoreductase is detected in all three of these tumor types. together with an angiogenesis/hypoxia profile typical of VHL dysfunction. The oxidoreductase defect. not previously detected in VHL-null tumors. is explained by suppression of the SDHB protein. a component of mitochondrial complex II. The decrease in SDHB is also noted in tumors with SDHD mutations. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses show that the link between hypoxia signals (via VHL) and mitochondrial signals (via SDH) is mediated by HIF1α.

Currently. calcitonin measurements are mostly useful in the evaluation of tumor size and progression. and as an index of biochemical improvement of medullary thyroid carcinomas. Although measurement of calcitonin is a highly sensitive method for the detection of medullary thyroid carcinoma. it presents a low specificity for this tumor. Several physiologic and pathologic conditions other than medullary thyroid carcinoma have been associated with increased levels of calcitonin. Several cases of thyroid nodules associated with increased values of calcitonin are not medullary thyroid carcinomas. but rather are related to other conditions. such as hypercalcemias. hypergastrinemias. neuroendocrine tumors. renal insufficiency. papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas. and goiter. Furthermore. prolonged treatment with omeprazole (> 2-4 months). beta-blockers. glucocorticoids and potential secretagogues. have been associated with hypercalcitoninemia. An association between calcitonin levels and chronic auto-immune thyroiditis remains controversial.

Mutation analysis of the entire MEN1 tumor suppressor gene and genetic screening of at-risk family members were performed by direct sequencing. To analyze the implementation of genetic diagnosis. the studied patients were separated into 3 groups: MEN1 index cases (group I). clinically diagnosed MEN1 cases (group II). and genetically diagnosed MEN1 cases (group III). RESULTS: In total. 154 individuals were clinically and genetically studied. We identified 12 different MEN1 mutations. Fifty-two MEN1 cases were identified: 13 in group I. 28 in group II. and 11 in group III. The mean age in group III (27.0 years) was significantly lower than in groups I (39.5 years) and II (42.4 years; P= 0.03 and P= 0.01. respectively). Patients in groups I and II mostly presented 2 or 3 MEN1-related tumors. while 81.8% of those in group III presented 1 or no MEN1-related tumor. Additionally. in group III. 45.4% of cases were asymptomatic. and no metastasis or death was verified. Surveillance for MEN1 mutations allowed the exclusion of 102 noncarriers. including a case of MEN1 phenocopy.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is still an underdiagnosed. or late-diagnosed condition in many areas of the world. Since 1993. when the first missense RET proto-oncogene (RET) mutations were reported in MEN2. up to 46 different RET-causing disease mutations have been described. Since a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists for MEN2. the detection of RET mutations has produced a major impact in early recognition and treatment of MTC and MEN2. Presently. RET mutation analysis should be performed for all MEN2 cases and their at-risk familial relatives. Further. prophylactic total thyroidectomy is indicated in all cases harboring activating gametic RET mutations. In most RET mutation carriers. prophylactic total thyroidectomy is indicated at ages as early as a few months to 4 years of age. promoting longer survival and improvement of quality of life or even definitive cure.

RT-PCR amplification of CRH receptor sequences from human myometrium and fetal membranes yielded cDNAs that encode a novel CRH-R type 1 spliced variant. This variant (CRH-R1d) is present in the human pregnant myometrium at term only. which suggests a physiologically important role at the end of human pregnancy and labor. The amino acid sequence of CRH-R1d is identical to the CRH-R1α receptor except that it contains an exon deletion resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain.

The proteins encoded by these multiple genes regulate distinct functions. We show here a functional link between tumors with VHL mutations and those with disruption of the genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits B (SDHB) and D (SDHD). A transcription profile of reduced oxidoreductase is detected in all three of these tumor types. together with an angiogenesis/hypoxia profile typical of VHL dysfunction. The oxidoreductase defect. not previously detected in VHL-null tumors. is explained by suppression of the SDHB protein. a component of mitochondrial complex II. The decrease in SDHB is also noted in tumors with SDHD mutations. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses show that the link between hypoxia signals (via VHL) and mitochondrial signals (via SDH) is mediated by HIF1α. These findings explain the shared features of pheochromocytomas with VHL and SDH mutations and suggest an additional mechanism for increased HIF1α activity in tumors.,True,z0hzdN8AAAAJ:9NZAP19TdFAC,444,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010008,10942181793978833745,/scholar?cites=10942181793978833745,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010008,0,0,0

Assuming a 7-year study with 4 years of enrollment. 5 years of average follow-up. a recurrence rate of 10% after 7 years. a 25% relative reduction in the rate of the primary endpoint (newly identified structural disease; i.e.. persistent. recurrent. or distant metastatic disease) with central lymph node dissection and an annual dropout rate …,True,z0hzdN8AAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C,189,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/thy.2011.0317,12788867304628300334,/scholar?cites=12788867304628300334,,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/thy.2011.0317,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone remodeling and induces differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) by orchestrating activities of local factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). The activity and specificity of different BMP ligands are controlled by various extracellular antagonists that prevent binding of BMPs to their receptors. Low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 6 (LRP6) has been shown to interact with both the PTH and BMP extracellular signaling pathways by forming a complex with parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) and sharing common antagonists with BMPs. We hypothesized that PTH‐enhanced differentiation of MSCs into the osteoblast lineage through enhancement of BMP signaling occurs by modifying the extracellular antagonist network via LRP6.

More recently. the term vitamin D insufficiency has been used to describe low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D that may be associated with other disease outcomes. Reliance on a single cutoff value to define vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is problematic because of the wide individual variability of the functional effects of vitamin D and interaction with calcium intakes. In adults. vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of fractures and falls. The evidence for other purported beneficial effects of vitamin D is primarily based on observational studies.

Consequently. it is difficult to compare objectively or follow radiographic improvement. We prospectively evaluated the utility and reproducibility of a scoring method for measuring the severity of rickets.

Worldwide. nutritional rickets is considered to be the most common non-communicable disease of children. Rickets can be due either to primary deficiencies of vitamin D or calcium or to combined deficiencies of both elements. Vitamin D deficiency is also increasingly linked to non-skeletal complications. Even without laboratory and radiologic resources. the diagnosis of rickets is considered clinically when a child presents with limb deformities and has beaded ribs and widened wrists and ankles. Prevention is possible through increased sun exposure and dietary enhancement. Treatment of nutritional rickets involves provision of adequate vitamin D and calcium.

The genetic basis of blood pressure variation is largely unknown but is likely to involve genes that influence renal salt handling and arterial vessel tone. Here we argue that susceptibility to hypertension is ancestral and that differential susceptibility to hypertension is due to differential exposure to selection pressures during the out-of-Africa expansion. The most important selection pressure was climate. which produced a latitudinal cline in heat adaptation and. therefore. hypertension susceptibility. Consistent with this hypothesis. we show that ecological variables. such as latitude. temperature. and rainfall. explain worldwide variation in heat adaptation as defined by seven functional alleles in five genes involved in blood pressure regulation. The latitudinal cline in heat adaptation is consistent worldwide and is largely unmatched by latitudinal clines in short tandem repeat markers. control single nucleotide polymorphisms. or non-functional single nucleotide polymorphisms within the five genes. In addition. we show that latitude and one of these alleles. GNB3 (G protein β3 subunit) 825T. account for a major portion of worldwide variation in blood pressure. These results suggest that the current epidemic of hypertension is due to exposures of the modern period interacting with ancestral susceptibility. Modern populations differ in susceptibility to these new exposures. however. such that those from hot environments are more susceptible to hypertension than populations from cold environments. This differential susceptibility is likely due to our history of adaptation to climate.,True,OUz6P2UAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,243,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010082,10577140912605725605,/scholar?cites=10577140912605725605,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010082,0,0,0

The first part maps out three “strands” in the reception of panopticism in surveillance studies. suggesting that it tends to fall into one of three broad kinds: its wholesale appropriation and application; its wholesale rejection as inadequate with respect to a supposedly “post-disciplinary” society; and its qualified acceptance subject to some empirically-dependent limitations. I then attempt in a preliminary way to supplement these three positions. In particular. I question the logical adequacy of equating visual surveillance with effective subjectification and self-discipline by drawing upon a range of philosophical and sociological perspectives. Philosophically. it is suggested that the Foucauldian thesis may well “pathologise” the relationship between subjectivity and visibility. and thereby overlook other dimensions of our experience of vision.

Among people of European descent. GWASs have identified genetic variants at 13 loci that are associated with blood pressure. It is unknown if these variants confer susceptibility in people of African ancestry. Here. we examined genome-wide and candidate gene associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using the Candidate Gene Association Resource (CARe) consortium consisting of 8591 AAs. Genotypes included genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data utilizing the Affymetrix 6.0 array with imputation to 2.5 million HapMap SNPs and candidate gene SNP data utilizing a 50K cardiovascular gene-centric array (ITMAT-Broad-CARe [IBC] array).
