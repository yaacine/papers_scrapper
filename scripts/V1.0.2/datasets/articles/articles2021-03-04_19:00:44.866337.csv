Using quantitative proteomics. we found that lenalidomide causes selective ubiquitination and degradation of two lymphoid transcription factors. IKZF1 and IKZF3. by the CRBN-CRL4 ubiquitin ligase. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are essential transcription factors in multiple myeloma. A single amino acid substitution of IKZF3 conferred resistance to lenalidomide-induced degradation and rescued lenalidomide-induced inhibition of cell growth. Similarly. we found that lenalidomide-induced interleukin-2 production in T cells is due to depletion of IKZF1 and IKZF3.

A complete understanding of the interacting proteins and their associated protein complexes. whether the compounds are discovered by cell-based phenotypic or target-based screens. is extremely rare. Such a capability is expected to be highly illuminating—providing strong clues to the mechanisms used by small-molecules to achieve their recognized actions and suggesting potential unrecognized actions.

The findings revealed a major policy implementation gap between the national government and the hospitals. While modern practices such as landfill and incineration are used. their daily operations were not carried according to minimum standards. Incinerator ash is openly dumped and wastes are burned on landfills instead of being covered with soil. The incinerators used are also not environmentally friendly as they use old technology. The findings further revealed that there is no proper separation of wastes according to their classification as demanded by the national …,True,z1Br4gUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,175,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X07003704,5254118173499311350,/scholar?cites=5254118173499311350,,,0,0,0
1124711,Status of pharmaceuticals in African water bodies: occurrence. removal and analytical methods,2017,Lawrence Mzukisi Madikizela and Nikita Tawanda Tavengwa and Luke Chimuka,193,,,211-220,Academic Press,In this review paper. the milestones and challenges that have been achieved and experienced by African Environmental Scientists regarding the assessment of water pollution caused by the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in water bodies are highlighted. The identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals in the African water bodies is important to the general public at large due to the lack of information. The consumption of pharmaceuticals to promote human health is usually followed by excretion of these drugs via urine or fecal matter due to their slight transformation in the human metabolism. Therefore. large amounts of pharmaceuticals are being discharged continuously from wastewater treatment plants into African rivers due to inefficiency of employed sewage treatment processes. Large portions of African communities do not even have proper sanitation systems which results in direct …,True,z1Br4gUAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,117,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479717301305,15749691274185861483,/scholar?cites=15749691274185861483,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lawrence_Madikizela/publication/313845760_Status_of_pharmaceuticals_in_African_water_bodies_Occurrence_removal_and_analytical_methods/links/59ccdcfb0f7e9bc3aedc8a42/Status-of-pharmaceuticals-in-African-water-bodies-Occurrence-removal-and-analytical-methods.pdf,0,0,0

Sample workup with this technique can be hampered by low enrichment factors due to incomplete trapping in the stagnant acceptor solution for weak basic compounds. The different parameters. such as acceptor pH and ionic strength of both the donor and acceptor solutions. related to this problem were studied theoretically and experimentally. A simple equation for the maximum enrichment factor was developed. Results showed that the ionic strengths of the two aqueous phases in the system have an effect on the maximum enrichment factor. which can be increased by increasing the ionic strength of the donor phase.

Antioxidant activity was determined by analysing the total phenolics content. total flavonoids content. reducing power and radical scavenging activity using the 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical method. The total phenolics content of moringa was almost twice that of the vegetables and the total flavonoids content was three times that of the selected vegetables. The reducing power of moringa was higher than that of the vegetables and the percentage of free radicals remaining was lower compared with the vegetables. These results combined show that moringa is a good source of antioxidants.

South Africa and potential health effects,2010,Olalekan S Fatoki and M Bornman and L Ravandhalala and L Chimuka and Bettina Genthe and A Adeniyi,36,Water Sa,1,,,Phthalate ester plasticizers were determined in rivers and dams of the Venda region. South Africa. Liquid-liquid extraction. column chromatographic clean-up and capillary gas chromatography were the methods used for the quantitative analyses. Levels of phthalates in water samples from the rivers and dams ranged from 0.16 mg/ℓ to 10.17 mg/ℓ and varied between 0.02 mg/kg and 0.89 mg/kg in sediments. Generally. the highest concentrations of phthalates were found as DBP and DEHP. which is consistent with their common use in plastic materials and other industrial chemicals. The phthalate levels found in the water samples were much higher than the criterion of 3 μg/ℓ phthalates recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for the protection of fish and other aquatic life. and higher than the Suggested No-Adverse Effect Levels (SNAEL) of 7.5 to 38.5 μg/ℓ for drinking water. The health risk-assessment studies on the phthalates found in the water systems suggested potential carcinogenic and other toxic effects they may pose to communities downstream which might be exposed either through drinking untreated water from the rivers. through dermal absorption or by using the freshwater sources to water their vegetable gardens. DEHP posed the highest risk potential of all the phthalates and the water use or exposure pathway that appeared to pose the highest potential health risk for carcinogenic as well as toxic effects was vegetable watering.

A porous PTFE membrane was impregnated with a water immiscible organic solvent. forming a barrier between two aqueous phases. With a flowing donor and a stagnant acceptor solution. an enrichment of the triazines was obtained. The various factors that influence the extraction efficiency and selectivity of the extraction procedure were experimentally studied. The obtained results were in good agreement with the developed theoretical model. The pH of the acceptor solution was found to be the critical limiting factor in obtaining higher extraction efficiencies and led to an extraction efficiency decrease with an increase in enrichment time.

The model simulates all main aerosol components. including several secondary components such as nitrate and secondary organic carbon. The model reproduces the main chemical composition and size features observed during large aerosol campaigns. Although the chemical composition compares best with ground-based measurement over land for modelled sulphate. no systematic differences are found for other compounds.

The new version includes fundamental changes of the transport scheme such as transporting all chemical species of the model individually and applying a family-based correction scheme for mass conservation for species of the nitrogen. chlorine and bromine groups. a revised transport scheme for ozone. furthermore more detailed halogen reaction and deposition schemes. and a new cirrus parameterisation in the tropical tropopause region. By means of these changes the model manages to overcome or considerably reduce deficiencies recently identified in SOCOL version 1.1 within the CCM Validation activity of SPARC (CCMVal). In particular. as a consequence of these changes. regional mass loss or accumulation artificially caused by the semi-Lagrangian transport scheme can be significantly reduced. leading to much more realistic distributions of the modelled chemical species. most notably of the halogens and ozone.,True,iV5tfBsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,100,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/8/5957/2008/,8003996541191981560,/scholar?cites=8003996541191981560,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/8/5957/2008/acp-8-5957-2008.pdf,0,0,0
1124745,Secondary organic aerosol in the global aerosol–chemical transport model Oslo CTM2,2007,CR Hoyle and T Berntsen and G Myhre and ISA Isaksen,7,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,21,5675-5694,Copernicus GmbH, The global chemical transport model Oslo CTM2 has been extended to include the formation. transport and deposition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Precursor hydrocarbons which are oxidised to form condensible species include both biogenic species such as terpenes and isoprene. as well as species emitted predominantly by anthropogenic activities (toluene. m-xylene. methylbenzene and other aromatics). A model simulation for 2004 gives an annual global SOA production of approximately 55 Tg. Of this total. 2.5 Tg is found to consist of the oxidation products of anthropogenically emitted hydrocarbons. and about 15 Tg is formed by the oxidation products of isoprene. The global production of SOA is increased to about 69 Tg yr−1 by allowing semi-volatile species to partition to ammonium sulphate aerosol. This brings modelled organic aerosol values closer to those observed. however observations in Europe remain significantly underestimated. Allowing SOA to partition into ammonium sulphate aerosol increases the contribution of anthropogenic SOA from about 4.5% to 9.4% of the total production. Total modelled organic aerosol (OA) values are found to represent a lower fraction of the measured values in winter (when primary organic aerosol (POA) is the dominant OA component) than in summer. which may be an indication that estimates of POA emissions are too low. Additionally. for measurement stations where the summer OA values are higher than in winter. the model generally underestimates the increase in summertime OA.

In order to explain the NAT clouds observed over the Arctic in mid-December 2009. a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism is required. occurring via immersion freezing on the surface of solid particles. likely of meteoritic origin. For the first time. a detailed microphysical modelling of this NAT formation pathway has been carried out. Heterogeneous NAT formation was calculated along more than sixty thousand trajectories. ending at Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observation points. Comparing the optical properties of the modelled NAT with these observations enabled a thorough validation of a newly developed NAT nucleation parameterisation. which has been built into the Zurich Optical and Microphysical box Model (ZOMM). The parameterisation is based on active site theory. is simple to implement in models and provides substantial advantages over previous approaches which involved a constant rate of NAT nucleation in a given volume of air. It is shown that the new method is capable of reproducing observed polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) very well. despite the varied conditions experienced by air parcels travelling along the different trajectories. In a companion paper. ZOMM is applied to a later period of the winter. when ice PSCs are also present. and it is shown that the observed PSCs are also represented extremely well under these conditions.,True,iV5tfBsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,63,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/9577/2013/,5699751214308495370,/scholar?cites=5699751214308495370,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/9577/2013/acp-13-9577-2013.pdf,0,0,0

The production of SOA was found to have increased from about 35 Tg yr−1 to 53 Tg yr−1 since pre-industrial times. leading to an increase in the global annual mean SOA burden from 0.33 Tg to 0.50 Tg. or about 51%. The effect of allowing semi-volatile species to partition to sulphate aerosol was also tested. leading to an increase in SOA production from about 43 Tg yr−1 to 69 Tg yr−1 since pre-industrial times. while the annual mean SOA burden increased from 0.44 Tg to 0.70 Tg. or about 59%. The increases were greatest over industrialised areas. especially when partitioning to sulphate aerosol was allowed. as well as over regions with high biogenic precursor emissions. The contribution of emissions from different sources to the larger SOA burdens has been calculated. The results suggest that the majority of the increase was caused by emissions of primary organic aerosols (POA). from fossil fuel and bio fuel combustion. As yet. very few radiative forcing estimates of SOA exist. and no such estimates were provided in the latest IPCC report. In this study. we found that the change in SOA burden caused a radiative forcing (defined here as the difference between the pre-industrial and the present day run) of −0.09 W m−2. when SOA was allowed to partition to both organic and sulphate aerosols. and −0.06 W m−2 when only partitioning to organic aerosols was assumed.

The SOA particles were produced from the ozone initiated oxidation of α-pinene in an aerosol chamber at temperatures in the range from− 38 to− 10° C at 5–15% relative humidity with respect to water to ensure their formation in a highly viscous phase state. ie semi-solid or glassy.

During January 2010. ice PSCs (polar stratospheric clouds) were shown by CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) to have occurred on a synoptic scale (~1000 km dimension). CALIPSO observations also showed widespread PSCs containing NAT (nitric acid trihydrate) particles in December 2009. prior to the occurrence of synoptic-scale regions of ice PSCs during mid-January 2010. We demonstrate by means of detailed microphysical modeling along air parcel trajectories that the formation of these PSCs is not readily reconciled with expectations from the conventional understanding of PSC nucleation mechanisms. The measurements are at odds with the previous laboratory-based understanding of PSC formation. which deemed direct heterogeneous nucleation of NAT and ice on preexisting solid particles unlikely. While a companion paper (Part 1) addresses the heterogeneous nucleation of NAT during December 2009. before the existence of ice PSCs. this paper shows that also the large-scale occurrence of stratospheric ice in January 2010 cannot be explained merely by homogeneous ice nucleation but requires the heterogeneous nucleation of ice. e.g. on meteoritic dust or preexisting NAT particles. The required efficiency of the ice nuclei is surprisingly high. namely comparable to that of known tropospheric ice nuclei such as mineral dust particles.

To determine their relevance to processes such as ice nucleation or chemistry occurring within particles requires knowledge of the temperature and relative humidity (RH) range for SOA to exist in these states. In the Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets (CLOUD) experiment at The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). we deployed a new in situ optical method to detect the viscous state of α-pinene SOA particles and measured their transition from the amorphous highly viscous state to states of lower viscosity. The method is based on the depolarising properties of laboratory-produced non-spherical SOA particles and their transformation to non-depolarising spherical particles at relative humidities near the deliquescence point. We found that particles formed and grown in the chamber developed an asymmetric shape through coagulation. A transition to a spherical shape was observed as the RH was increased to between 35 % at −10 °C and 80 % at −38 °C. confirming previous calculations of the viscosity-transition conditions.

In state of the art global- or regional-scale models. heterogeneous NAT nucleation is currently simulated in a very coarse manner using a constant. saturation-independent nucleation rate.

This reaction is the main source of tropospheric O3. through the subsequent photolysis of NO2. as well as being a major source of OH. The branching of the reaction to HNO3 reduces the formation of these species significantly. affecting O3 abundances. radiative forcing and the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. The Oslo CTM2. a three-dimensional chemistry transport model. is used to calculate atmospheric composition and trends with and without the new reaction branch. Results for the present day atmosphere. when both temperature and pressure effects on the branching ratio are accounted for. show an 11 % reduction in the calculated tropospheric burden of O3. with the main contribution from the tropics. An increase of the global. annual mean methane lifetime by 10.9 %. resulting from a 14.1 % reduction in the global. annual mean OH concentration is also found. Comparisons with measurements show that including the new branch improves the modelled O3 in the Oslo CTM2. but that it is not possible to conclude whether the NOy distribution improves. We model an approximately 11 % reduction in the tropical tropospheric O3 increase since pre-industrial times. and a 4 % reduction of the increase in total tropospheric burden. Also. an 8 % decrease in the trend of OH concentrations is calculated. when the new branch is accounted for. The radiative forcing due to changes in O3 over the industrial era was calculated as 0.33 W m−2. reducing to 0.26 W m−2 with the new reaction branch. These results are significant. and it is …,True,iV5tfBsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,47,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/8929/2011/,720226078151358214,/scholar?cites=720226078151358214,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/8929/2011/acp-11-8929-2011.pdf,0,0,0

The biogenic HOMs were produced from ozonolysis of α-pinene at 5 ∘C. Here we extend this study to compare the molecular composition of positive and negative HOM clusters measured with atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight mass spectrometers (APi-TOFs). at three different temperatures (25. 5 and −25 ∘C). Most negative HOM clusters include a nitrate (NO) ion. and the spectra are similar to those seen in the nighttime boreal forest. On the other hand. most positive HOM clusters include an ammonium (NH) ion. and the spectra are characterized by mass bands that differ in their molecular weight by ∼ 20 C atoms. corresponding to HOM dimers. At lower temperatures the average oxygen to carbon (O : C) ratio of the HOM clusters decreases for both polarities. reflecting an overall reduction of HOM formation with decreasing temperature. This indicates a decrease in the rate of autoxidation with temperature due to a rather high activation energy as has previously been determined by quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore. at the lowest temperature (−25 ∘C). the presence of C30 clusters shows that HOM monomers start to contribute to the nucleation of positive clusters. These experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical calculations of the binding energies of representative neutral and charged clusters.,True,iV5tfBsAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,41,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/65/2018/,7334481269300783020,/scholar?cites=7334481269300783020,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/65/2018/,0,0,0

The new challenge in bioimaging is to design chemical probes for three-dimensional (3D) tissue imaging. In this work. we discovered that light scattering of metal nanoparticles can provide 3D imaging contrast in intact and transparent tissues. The nanoparticles can act as a template for the chemical growth of a metal layer to further enhance the scattering signal. The use of chemically grown nanoparticles in whole tissues can amplify the scattering to produce a 1.4 million-fold greater photon yield than obtained using common fluorophores. These probes are non-photobleaching and can be used alongside fluorophores without interference. We demonstrated three distinct biomedical applications: (a) molecular imaging of blood vessels.

The core–shell UCLNPs consist of a β-NaYF4 core doped with Yb3+/Tm3+ ions and a shell of pure β-NaYF4. Upon 980 nm excitation. they display emission bands peaking at 360 and 475 nm. which is a perfect match to the absorption bands of the enzyme cosubstrate NADH and the coenzyme FAD. respectively. By exploiting these spectral overlaps. we have designed fluorescent detection schemes for NADH and FAD that are based on the modulation of the emission intensities of UCLNPs by FAD and NADH via an inner filter effect.,True,SQK2G8gAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,39,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am5038643,4728474023097486644,/scholar?cites=4728474023097486644,,https://www.wilhelm-lab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2014_ACS_AMI.pdf,0,0,0

However. this approach requires the preparation of optically transparent samples using harsh chemical and physical methods. which can lead to a significant loss of nanoparticles and decreased sensitivity of subsequent analyses. Here. we investigate the influence of electrophoresis and clearing time on nanoparticle retention within intact tissues and the impact of these factors on the final 3D image quality. Our findings reveal that longer clearing times lead to a loss of nanoparticles but improved transparency of tissues.

The analytes of interest were priority pollutants of low water solubility which could not be readily removed from the soil using water. Direct toxicity testing of the soil samples by Microtox® showed a high background toxicity which prevented realistic toxicity data from being obtained for the contaminants present. A range of different extraction solutions was used in an attempt to extract the contaminants while eliminating the matrix effects of the soil.

The repeat nature of the coiled-coil sequence motif often prevents the simple identification of homologs of animal coiled-coil proteins by generic sequence similarity searches. As a consequence. counterparts of many animal proteins with long coiled-coil domains. like lamins. golgins. or microtubule organization center components. have not been identified yet in plants.

The public availability of the complete genome sequence of M. grisea provides ample opportunities to understand the molecular mechanism of its pathogenesis on rice plants at the transcriptome level. To identify all the expressed genes encoded in the fungal genome. we have analyzed the mycelium and appressorium transcriptomes using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS). robust-long serial analysis of gene expression (RL-SAGE) and oligoarray methods. The MPSS analyses identified 12.531 and 12.927 distinct significant tags from mycelia and appressoria. respectively. while the RL-SAGE analysis identified 16.580 distinct significant tags from the mycelial library. When matching these 12.531 mycelial and 12.927 appressorial significant tags to the annotated CDS. 500 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of CDS. 6.735 unique genes in mycelia and 7.686 unique genes in appressoria were identified.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that a major fraction of the exothermicity of the reaction RO2+NO is deposited into vibrational excitation of the alkoxy radical product. A combined electronic structure and kinetic modeling study has been conducted to examine these issues.

However. some of their features limit their application in organic synthesis. especially the frequently lower enzyme activity under nonaqueous conditions. which constitutes a major drawback in the application of enzymes in organic solvents.

Due to the ensemble-averaging nature of EXAFS. the values of the coordination numbers in nanoparticles cannot be simply interpreted in terms of the degree of alloying or segregation if the compositional distribution is broad. We demonstrate that a Cowley short range order parameter is an objective measure of either the segregation tendency (e.g.. a core-shell type) or the degree of randomness (in homogeneous nanoalloys).

Among them polymers play an important role being light. easy to form and inert in biological environment. Tight requirements expected from elements to be used in a human body can only exceptionally be fulfilled by single phased materials. An obvious solution is thus the use of surface treatments allowing the combination of different properties in various areas of the material.

The effectiveness of the process was estimated based on the degree of conversion of 4-chloro-2-nitro phenol. It was observed that ozonation is more effective at alkaline reaction of medium than other conditions. The degree of conversion achieved (at the first 5 minutes of the process)at pH 9 was 99.64% compared to 99.03% and 77.35% at pH 7 and 3. respectively. Another parameter used to quantify the 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol during ozonation was the pseudo first order rate constant k [min−1]. Results showed that the rate constant of the process was approximately much higher at the alkaline pH compared to acidic ones.

As a faster. more versatile and alternative access toward (pseudo) peptidic receptors. a new approach based on multiple Ugi four-component reactions (Ugi-4CR) is proposed as a means of simultaneously incorporating several binding and catalytic elements into organizing scaffolds. By employing α-amino acids either as the amino or acid components of the Ugi-4CRs. this multiple multicomponent process allows for the one-pot assembly of podands bearing chimeric peptide–peptoid chains as appended arms. Tripodal. bowl-shaped. and concave polyfunctional skeletons are employed as topologically varied platforms for positioning the multiple peptidic chains formed by Ugi-4CRs. In a similar approach. steroidal building blocks with several axially-oriented isocyano groups are synthesized and utilized to align the chimeric chains with conformational constrains. thus providing an alternative to the classical peptido-steroidal receptors. The branched and hybrid peptide–peptoid appendages allow new possibilities for both rational design and combinatorial production of synthetic receptors.

1125099,Polymerizations in supercritical carbon dioxide,1999,Jonathan L Kendall and Dorian A Canelas and Jennifer L Young and Joseph M DeSimone,99,,2,543-564,American Chemical Society,In the search for new polymerization solvents. scientists have turned to supercritical fluids. Supercritical carbon dioxide possesses many properties that have allowed it to emerge as the most extensively studied supercritical fluid for polymerization reactions. The work presented in this review shows that supercritical CO2 is a viable and promising alternative to traditional solvents used in polymer synthesis. Much of this promise results from its fluid properties. effects on polymers. and environmental advantages. Supercritical fluids have the best of two worlds: they can have gaslike diffusivities (which have important implications for reaction kinetics) while having liquidlike densities that allow for solvation of many compounds. They exhibit changes in solvent density with small changes in temperature or pressure without altering solvent composition. 1 Because of these advantages. chemists have explored reaction mechanisms and solvent cage effects in supercritical fluids. 2. 3 Changing solvent quality also has substantial effects on reaction workup: it can affect the separation of the polymer from starting materials and catalysts and the polymer molecular weight fractionation. In addition. the low viscosity of supercritical fluids and their ability to plasticize glassy polymers have implications on polymer processing and kinetics. For example. conditions that give a low viscosity supercritical fluid result in diminished solvent cage effects in free-radical initiator decompositions. 4When carbon dioxide is used as the supercritical solvent. additional advantages can be realized.

Many lipophilic polymers such as polystyrene (PS) are insoluble in CO2. though polymerizations may be accomplished via the use of PS-fluoropolymer stabilizers. which act as emulsifying agents. Small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering have been used to show that these molecules form micelles with a CO2-phobic PS core and a CO2-philic fluoropolymer corona. When the PS block was fixed in length and the fluorinated corona block was varied. the number of block copolymer molecules per micelle (six to seven) remained constant.

Near-critical or supercritical carbon dioxide is rapidly becoming an attractive alternative as a continuous phase in homogeneous1 and heterogeneous radical polymerizations. 2 A review on chain polymerizations in supercritical fluids appeared recently. 3 At present. CO2 offers an environmentally sound solvent choice. Advantages offered include that the polymer can be easily separated from the reaction medium. the CO2 can easily be recycled. and there is effectively no chain transfer to CO2 for free-radical reactions. 3 In order to model the kinetics of homogeneous and heterogeneous free-radical polymerizations. it is necessary to obtain important kinetic coefficients like the initiation. propagation. and termination rate coefficients in CO2. It must be realized that CO2 is in general a poor solvent for most polymers except for amorphous or low-melting fluoropolymers and siloxanes.

This view has largely restricted drug design and selection to agents within a narrow log P range. Molecular transporters offer a strategy to circumvent these restrictions. In the case of guanidinium-rich transporters (GRTs). a typically highly water-soluble conjugate is found to readily pass through the non-polar membrane of a cell and for some across tissue barriers. This activity opens a field of opportunities for the use of GRTs to enable delivery of polar and non-polar drugs or probes as well as to enhance uptake of those of intermediate polarity. The field of transporter enabled or enhanced uptake has grown dramatically in the last decade. Some GRT drug conjugates have been advanced into clinical trials.

One of the most common mechanisms of resistance involves P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux. To address this problem. new agents have been sought that are less prone to inducing resistance and less likely to serve as substrates for Pgp efflux. An alternative to this approach is to deliver established agents as molecular transporter conjugates into cells through a mechanism that circumvents Pgp-mediated efflux and allows for release of free drug only after cell entry. Here we report that the widely used chemotherapeutic agent Taxol. ineffective against Taxol-resistant human ovarian cancer cell lines. can be incorporated into a releasable octaarginine conjugate that is effective against the same Taxol-resistant cell lines.

The circulation stability and intracellular release of disulfides are problematically coupled in that increasing stability causes a corresponding decrease in cleavage and payload release. However. an antibody offers the potential for a reversible stabilization. We examined this by attaching a small molecule directly to engineered cysteines in an antibody. At certain sites this unhindered disulfide was stable in circulation yet cellular internalization and antibody catabolism generated a disulfide catabolite that was rapidly reduced. We demonstrated that this stable connection and facile release is applicable to a variety of payloads.

The system combined an optical metal-clad leaky waveguide (MCLW) sensor with ultrasound standing waves (USW). The performance of a MCLW sensor for the detection of bacteria has been increased (>100 fold) by using USWs to drive bacteria onto the sensor surface. By forming the USW nodes at or within the surface of the MCLW. the diffusion-limited capture rate has been replaced by fast movement. Immobilized anti-BG antibody on the MCLW sensor surface was used to capture Bacillus subtilis var. niger (BG) bacterial spores driven to the surface.

The appearance of this stability condition depends both on the impurity distance and the dot radius. in a way that with an increase of the impurity distance we have an increase in the maximum dot radius where this stability condition appears.

The computed minimum energy structure of dpph• shows that the access to its divalent N is strongly hindered by an ortho H atom on each of the phenyl rings and by the o-NO2 groups of the picryl ring. Remarkably small Arrhenius pre-exponential factors for the phenols [range (1.3−19) × 105 M−1 s−1] are attributed to steric effects. Indeed. the entropy barrier accounts for up to ca. 70% of the free-energy barrier to reaction.

The materials were prepared by wet impregnation under excess acid conditions. Anchoring of the desired species on the support occurs via an exchange reaction between the vanadium complex and surface hydroxyl groups. The IR and UV-Vis spectra of these catalysts indicate the presence of monomeric vanadium species at 5 wt% V2O5 loading. along with small amounts of polymeric species at 5 and 10 wt% V2O5 loadings. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy reveals the presence of ferromagnetic VO2+ dimers following calcination at 773 K.

Both supports and catalysts have been extensively characterized by a number of advanced techniques; XRD. N2-adsortion. Raman spectroscopy. XPS. and H2-TPR. The catalytic results showed that when an ideal mixture of H2 and CO is used for the PROX reaction the gold supported on pure ceria behaves better than the others samples. However. when a typical reformate gas composition containing CO2 and H2O is used. the gold supported on Nb doped sample behaves better than gold supported in pure ceria.

The experimental results indicate that naphthalene is strongly affected by the zeolite host. This distortion is reflected in the bathochromic shift of the 0-0 transition. the shortening of the fluorescence lifetimes. the observation of vibronic couplings. the appearance of room temperature phosphorescence. and the shift to lower vibration energy of the Raman peaks due to the weakening of the naphthalene bonds. The electronic structure of naphthalene within different zeolites has been computed on periodic models by using both the Hartree−Fock and the Kohn−Sham theories and the theoretical 0-0 transitions evaluated from the valence and conduction bands.

The morphologies and properties of the magnetite microspheres were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Raman and infrared spectroscopy. field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). adsorption of nitrogen (BET method) and SQUID magnetometry. The results show that the microspheres consist of a single crystalline phase of magnetite.

1125593,Naturally occurring neuron death and its regulation by developing neural pathways,1982,Timothy J Cunningham,74,,,163-186,Academic Press,This chapter describes the naturally occurring neuron death and its regulation by developing neural pathways. The chapter describes degenerating neurons and shows how the morphological expression of cell death is closely related to a neuron's state of maturity. The timing of natural cell death is also considered to define where natural neuron death fits into other aspects of neural development and neuron differentiation. A large proportion of neurons that are destined to die naturally have a capacity to differentiate normally. Experimental studies show the dependence that a neuron has on the cell population with which it ultimately connects. Removal of targets for certain populations of neurons accentuates the normal attrition of neurons during development. The chapter also discusses the possible functions of cell death to provide a comprehensive explanation for this phenomenon.,True,WqHON70AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,344,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074769608611729,6671275652744982579,/scholar?cites=6671275652744982579,,,0,0,0

The additional uncrossed projection arises from areas of retina which would normally project only contralaterally and terminates in regions of geniculate and colliculus which would normally receive only crossed optic axons. The increased projection does not occur in animals enucleated at 10 days or older. It is suggested that the abnormal projection is due largely to axons which have not reached the optic chiasm at the time of the lesion being rerouted to the 'wrong' side of the brain.,True,WqHON70AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,312,https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/124347,16345632525840745249,/scholar?cites=16345632525840745249,,,0,0,0

The synaptic patterns formed by the optic terminals fall into three groups—complex encapsulated zones. simple encapstdated zones. and simple nonencapsulated zones. Terminal degenerative reactions in the geniculate after eye removal. seen by light and electron microscopy. differ in the complex and simple synaptic zones. The complex encapsulated zones occur only in an outer shell covering the geniculate; and this can be subdivided into two layers (1 and 2) in which the complex zones receive nonoverlapping crossed and uncrossed optic projections. The simple zones by contrast occur throughout all layers (1 to 3) and receive crossed and overlapping uncrossed optic projections. The relative distribution of complex and simple synaptic zones is similar in general pattern to that in the A and C laminae of the cat. Cortical lesions cause terminal and retrograde degeneration which is seen as an electron-dense reaction with the electron microscope. Terminal degeneration is not found within complex encapsulated zones. It is suggested that two parallel retinogeniculocortical pathways may exist.

Culture medium conditioned by explants of embryonic occipital cortex and diencephalon was concentrated by vacuum dialysis or ultrafiltration through membranes with at least a 10-kDa cut-off. This concentrated medium was loaded into polyacrylamide or sodium alginate gels which were then implanted into the cavity of the lesion.

The purpose of this study was to test the involvement of systemic secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) enzymes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). an MS model. and to determine if enzyme activity is elevated in MS patients. A non-invasive urinary assay was developed in order to monitor enzymatically active sPLA2 levels in Dark Agouti rats after induction of EAE. Some Rats were treated with nonapeptide CHEC-9. an uncompetitive sPLA2 enzyme inhibitor. during the initial rise in urinary enzyme levels. Body weight and clinical EAE score were measured for 18 days post immunization (PI). after which the rats were sacrificed for H&E and myelin staining. and for ED-1 immunocytochemistry. the latter to quantify macrophages and activated microglia. The urinary sPLA2 assay was also applied to un-timed samples collected from a cross section of 44 MS patients and 14 healthy controls. Mean levels of enzymatically active sPLA2 in the urine increased following immunization and peaked between days 8–10 PI which was just prior to the onset of EAE symptoms. At this time. a transient attenuation of activity was detected in the urine of CHEC-9 treated rats consistent with the activity-dependent properties of the inhibitor. The peptide also reduced or abolished EAE symptoms compared to vehicle-injected controls. Histopathological changes in the spinal cords of the EAE rats correlated generally with clinical score including a significant reduction in ED-1+ cells after peptide treatment …,True,WqHON70AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,55,https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-3-26,16265390845222398298,/scholar?cites=16265390845222398298,,https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-3-26,0,0,0

Paradoxically. reduced plasma lysoPC levels have been noted in sepsis patients and systemic treatment with lysoPCs is therapeutic in rodent models of sepsis and ischemia. These observations suggest that elevation of plasma levels of these lipids can actually help to relieve serious inflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that specific lysoPCs act as uncompetitive product inhibitors of plasma secreted PLA2 enzymes (sPLA2s). especially under conditions of elevated enzyme activity. thus providing a feedback mechanism for the observed anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds.

Their complexation with sodium adamantylacetate (free adamantane) and adamantane-grafted chitosan (AD-chitosan) was then studied by different complementary techniques and compared with their hydrophobic counterparts that contain an octamethylene spacer. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments have demonstrated that the use of hydrophilic spacers between the two CDs instead of aliphatic chains makes almost all of the CD cavities available for the inclusion of free adamantane. Investigation of the interaction of the CDs with AD-chitosan by viscosity measurements strongly suggests that the molecular conformation of the CD dimeric species plays a crucial role in their cross-linking with the biopolymer. The derivative doubly linked with hydrophilic arms. also called a duplex. has been shown to be a more efficient cross-linking agent than its singly bridged counterpart. referred to as a dimer. Hence. only 0.5 molar equivalents of the hydrophilic duplex with respect to adamantane was required to obtain the maximum viscosity. whereas in the case of the duplex with aliphatic spacers. the maximum viscosity was achieved with a [duplex]/[AD] ratio of about 1.7 (corresponding to a [CD]/[AD] ratio of 2.5). but with a higher value.

The synthesis of more than one siderophore and the production of multiple siderophore uptake systems by a single bacterial species are common place. The selective advantages conferred by the multiplicity of siderophore synthesis remains poorly understood. However. there is growing evidence suggesting that siderophores may have other physiological roles besides their involvement in iron acquisition.   Methods and Principal Findings Here we provide the first report that pyochelin displays antibiotic activity against some bacterial strains. Observation of differential sensitivity to pyochelin against a panel of bacteria provided the first indications that catecholate siderophores. produced by some bacteria. may have roles other than iron acquisition. A pattern emerged where only those strains able to make catecholate-type siderophores were resistant to pyochelin. We were able to associate pyochelin resistance to catecholate production by showing that pyochelin-resistant Escherichia coli became sensitive when biosynthesis of its catecholate siderophore enterobactin was impaired. As expected. supplementation with enterobactin conferred pyochelin resistance to the entE mutant. We observed that pyochelin-induced growth inhibition was independent of iron availability and was prevented by addition of the reducing agent ascorbic acid or by anaerobic incubation.

These hydroxynitrates are known to affect the global and regional formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). as well as affect the distribution of nitrogen. In the present study. we have synthesized three of the eight possible hydroxynitrates: 4-hydroxy-3-nitroxy isoprene (4.3-HNI) and E / Z-1-hydroxy-4-nitroxy isoprene (1.4-HNI). Oxidation of the 4.3-HNI isomer by the OH radical was monitored using a flow tube chemical ionization mass spectrometer (FT-CIMS). and its OH rate constant was determined to be (3.64 ± 0.41) × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The products of 4.3-HNI oxidation were monitored. and a mechanism to explain the products was developed. An isoprene epoxide (IEPOX) – a species important in SOA chemistry and thought to originate only from ""low-NOx"" isoprene oxidation – was found as a minor. but significant. product. Additionally. hydrolysis kinetics of the three synthesized isomers were monitored with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

Europium III compounds were used as luminescent probe. An organic-inorganic hybrid was obtained by hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS). The Eu III compounds were added in different ways. In the first. silica was prepared in the presence of Eu III. and in the second. Eu III was added on the silica surface. These materials were studied by luminescence. infrared spectroscopy and termogravimetric analysis. The results obtained for the hybrid material show different behavior for Eu III emission. which could be excited by the antenna effect and the influence of the surrounding in the luminescence quenching.

1125775,Coordination polymers: design. analysis and application,2008,Stuart R Batten and Suzanne M Neville and David R Turner,,,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,The field of coordination polymer research has undergone rapid expansion in recent years. No longer are these materials the vaguely defined'insoluble material'at the bottom of your vessel that spell death for your reaction. They have gone from'polymeric rubbish'to'materials of the future'. Great leaps in the deliberate design of coordination polymers were made in the 1990s. These were allied with similar advances in related areas such as organic crystal engineering. metallosupramolecular chemistry and X-ray diffraction. No longer did we assemble things atom by atom. Whole molecules were used as building blocks and new materials were made. This is the first book to provide a broad overview of all the major facets of coordination polymer research in one place. It combines chapters on nets and interpenetration with wide-ranging surveys of transition metal and lanthanoid coordination polymers and their properties. The aim is to provide a flavour of each aspect whilst introducing the important concepts and developments using carefully selected examples. After an introduction. the text is split into three sections:-Design (nets. interpenetration. malleability)-Analysis (transition metal coordination polymers. lanthanoid coordination polymers. organometallic networks. organic-inorganic hybrids)-Application (magnetic properties. porosity. acentric and chiral networks. reactive coordination polymers. other properties).

QDs are highly sensitive to charge-transfer processes. which can alter their optical properties. Here. we demonstrate that QD–dopamine–peptide bioconjugates can function as charge-transfer coupled pH sensors. Dopamine is normally characterized by two intrinsic redox properties: a Nernstian dependence of formal potential on pH and oxidation of hydroquinone to quinone by O 2 at basic pH.

The hydroquinone SAMs were diluted with octane-1-thiol. Cyclic voltammograms of the quinone/hydroquinone (Q/H2Q) couple allowed the peak-to-peak separation of the anodic and catholic peak potentials to be analyzed and apparent rate constants (kapp) to be determined using Laviron’s formalism. We found that a simple rate law containing one equilibrium constant (KAH) and two rate constants (kAH and kA) describes the dependence of kapp as a function of pH. From this model. the ratio of the rate constants for the protonated form H2Q. kAH (OPV)/kAH (alk) was ∼800. and the ratio of the de-protonated form. HQ−. kA(OPV)/kA(alk) was ∼2.

Various chiral selectors are used to prepare these CSPs. The preparation. properties. and applications of these CSPs are discussed in this paper. Attempts have been made to describe optimization strategies and the chiral recognition mechanisms. A comparison of chiral separations in CEC and HPLC is described. Efforts have also been made to predict the future perspectives and challenges of chiral monolithic stationary phases. The most effective chiral selectors include polysaccharides. cyclodextrins. and macrocyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.

The contamination of water by toxic heavy metals is a worldwide environmental problem. Unlike organic pollutants. the majority of which are susceptible to biological degradation. heavy metals do not degrade into harmless end products. Discharges containing cadmium. in particular. are strictly controlled because of the highly toxic nature of this element and its tendency to accumulate in the tissues of living organisms. This work aims to develop inexpensive. highly available. effective metal ion adsorbents from natural wastes as alternatives to existing commercial adsorbents. In particular. Tamrix articulata wastes were modified chemically by esterification with maleic acid to yield a carboxyl-rich adsorbent. The adsorption behavior of treated Tamrix articulata wastes toward cadmium ions in aqueous solutions in a batch system has been studied as a function of equilibration time. adsorbent dose. temperature and pH. Results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity was 195.5 mg/g in a pH 4 solution at 30 C with a contact time of 120 min. an initial concentration of 400 mg/L and an adsorbent dose of 0.3 g/L. The kinetic data were analyzed using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. It was shown that the adsorption of cadmium could be described by a pseudo-second-order equation. The experimental data were also analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich models of adsorption. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG o.

While in the first years the focus was on the new synthesis methods. new carbon sources and support materials. recently. the application possibilities are the principal arguments of the studies. The three main synthesis methods discussed in this review are the arc discharge. the laser ablation and the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) with a special regard to the latter one. In the early stage of the nanotube production the first two methods were utilized mainly for the production of SWNTs while the third one produced mainly MWNTs. The principle of CVD is the decomposition of various hydrocarbons over transition metal supported catalyst. Single-walled (SWNT). multi-walled (MWNT) and coiled carbon nanotubes are produced. In some case. interesting carbonaceous materials are formed during the synthesis process. such as bamboo-like tubes. onions. horn-like structures.

The observed reaction products were 5-(ethoxymethyl)furan-2-carbaldehyde (EMF). 1.1-dietoxy ethane (DE) and ethyl 4-oxopentanoate (EOP). The selectivity to EMF and EOP is closely related to the presence of Lewis and/or Brønsted acidity on the catalyst. while the formation of DE is probably related to defect sites. The latter. being less reactive. catalyze the side reaction to DE only when strong Lewis and/or Brønsted acid sites are absent.

This gas-phase process could be considered as a promising alternative for carbon dioxide recycling toward a (bio) fuel as DME. In this view. the production of DME from catalytic hydrogenation of CO 2 appears as a technology able to face also the ever-increasing demand for alternative. environmentally-friendly fuels and energy carriers. Basic considerations on thermodynamic aspects controlling DME production from CO 2 are presented along with a survey of the most innovative catalytic systems developed in this field. During the last years. special attention has been paid to the role of zeolite-based catalysts. either in the methanol-to-DME dehydration step or in the one-pot CO 2-to-DME hydrogenation. Overall. the productivity of DME was shown to be dependent on several catalyst features. related not only to the metal-oxide phase—responsible for CO 2 activation/hydrogenation—but also to specific properties of the zeolites (ie. topology. porosity. specific surface area. acidity. interaction with active metals. distributions of metal particles.…) influencing activity and stability of hybridized bifunctional heterogeneous catalysts. All these aspects are discussed in details. summarizing recent achievements in this research field.

The experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor operating at 5.0 MPa and temperature ranging from 200 to 260 °C. By appropriate physico-chemical characterization of systems it was revealed that morphology of zeolite crystallites significantly affects the surface distribution of metal-oxides and the nature of active sites created during the co-precipitation step.

MFI and FER structures in the temperature range 180 °C–300 °C. The aim of this study was to investigate how the zeolite catalyst characteristics affect the process performances in terms of methanol conversion and DME selectivity. It was found that the largest-pore 3-D framework zeolite (BEA) was very effective in converting methanol but the channel size and topological connection spaces allowed the fast formation of coke precursors that rapidly decreases the catalyst performances at higher temperatures. Even if lower in intensity. the same phenomenon was observed for MFI structure (medium pores 3-D framework) confirming stable performances in the temperature range used in the real processes.

The results suggest that only a small fraction of the iron is active in the selective oxidation of benzene to phenol in the presence of N2O. It is suggested that the active fraction is formed by isolated iron ions in a pseudo-octahedral configuration with the sites positioned in hydroxyl nests (defects) of the zeolite and is selective in phenol formation as a result of in situ reduction during the catalytic tests.

The energy terms of a helix-coil transition algorithm were used to evaluate helix stability. Helices of thermophilic proteins are more stable than the mesophilic homologues in 69% of cases.

Results demonstrate that Lys-100 is a preferential lactosylation site of β-LG during industrial milk treatment. These results were confirmed by an analysis of the three-dimensional model of the protein which showed that Lys-100 had the highest solvent accessibility and proximity to another amino group making Lys-100 the best candidate to lactosylation.

1125941,Flexibility plot of proteins,1989,R Ragone and F Facchiano and A Facchiano and AM Facchiano and G Colonna,2,"Protein Engineering, Design and Selection",7,497-504,Oxford University Press,The flexibility plot of a protein lies on the observation that amino acid residues with the highest turn potential. i.e. located in highly mobile regions of protein surface. also possess the smallest volumes as well as the lowest hydrophobicities. The plot is generated by shifting a five residue window along the protein sequence and calculating the value of the hydrophobicity–volume product for consecutive quintuplets of amino acid residues. The concomitant occurrence of small volumes and low hydrophobicities results in very deep minima. A threshold value has also been introduced in order to discriminate significant minima. To substantiate the interpretation that the selected minima actually indicate very flexible segments of a protein (loops. turns. etc.). we have compared plots obtained for model proteins (lysozyme. myoglobin. ribonuclease. trypsin. thermolysin and T4 lysozyme) with X-ray thermal factors profiles …,True,4kVppdQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,67,https://academic.oup.com/peds/article-abstract/2/7/497/1527190,8993166539399876639,/scholar?cites=8993166539399876639,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.888.3117&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Typically. this is achieved through the techniques of film rehydration or electroformation. We present a new method for generating polymer vesicles from double emulsions. We generate precision water-in-oil-in-water double emulsions from the breakup of concentric fluid streams; the hydrophobic fluid is a volatile mixture of organic solvent that contains dissolved diblock copolymers. We collect the double emulsions and slowly evaporate the organic solvent. which ultimately directs the self-assembly of the dissolved diblock copolymers into vesicular structures. Independent control over all three fluid streams enables precision assembly of polymer vesicles and provides for highly efficient encapsulation of active ingredients within the polymerosomes.

The particles are made of a soft polymeric core protected by a hydrophilic membrane. and they are dispersed in water. This dispersion is spread on a substrate. and water is removed to form a dry film. As the membranes of neighboring particles come into contact. they may break up to allow fusion of the particle cores. This is found to occur when the membranes are made of short-chain surfactant molecules; then all hydrophilic material is expelled to the film surface or to large isolated lumps. Alternatively. the membranes may remain until the film is completely dry; this is found to occur when they are made of hydrophilic polymers which are grafted onto the core.

For the lowest band. the ratio of the maximum to the minimum of the LDOS is shown to diverge as (ω c− ω)− 1 as ω approaches the band edge. Since. in the case of electromagnetic waves. the LDOS governs the spontaneous emission of light of embedded atoms and molecules. this may have profound implications for technology using photonic crystals.,True,63OkbGUAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,55,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/epl/i1999-00278-2/meta,289323766172453339,/scholar?cites=289323766172453339,,http://wave-scattering.com/minmax.ps,0,0,0

These “stuffed” vesicles and multiple emulsions are formed in a one-step process when we rehydrate stuffed films made of amphiphilic block copolymer and hydrophobic homopolymer. Without such homopolymer. this system forms micelles. With homopolymer. vesicles form; varying vesicle membrane thicknesses show that these structures incorporate different amounts of homopolymer. Multiple emulsions. containing more homopolymer than stuffed vesicles. are also fabricated using this single-amphiphile system. The system's incorporation of homopolymer to modify the properties and morphology of the resultant structures is a convenient strategy for preparing self-assembled macromolecular structures with controllable properties. ,True,63OkbGUAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,54,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma035638k,9496445593225990298,/scholar?cites=9496445593225990298,,https://sites.chemengr.ucsb.edu/~ceweb/ce/people/faculty/zasadzinski/pdfs/pub161.pdf,0,0,0

These three extracts were also evaluated in vitro for the ability to inhibit phagocytosis. the accumulation of total nitrites and nitrates in the serum. the total oxidative status. the total antioxidant response and the oxidative stress index. Pure extracts (100% concentration) had the best inhibitory activity on phagocytosis and oxidative stress.

The present work aims to investigate the intimate molecular-level mechanisms of this antioxidant reactivity. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-detectable free radical signals are described here for the first time in propolis extracts. The shape of these signals and the conditions in which they were obtained. point to polyphenolic flavonoids as the sites of the radicals. An inverse correlation between antioxidant capacity and free radical signal intensity is shown. The free radical reactivity of propolis is also illustrated by the effect it exerts on the biologically-relevant peroxide reactivity of hemoglobin. A new test of antioxidant ability in natural extracts such as propolis is proposed. based on modulation of the ascorbate peroxidase activity of hemoglobin (HAPX).

For benzene and HFB. average energies transferred per collision in the given energy range increase with energy. Besides weak collisions. more efficient ‘‘supercollisions’’ are also observed for all substrate–bath gas pairs. The histograms for vibrational energy transfer can be fitted by biexponential transition probabilities. Rotational energy transfer reveals similar trends for benzene and HFB. Cooling of rotationally hot ensembles is very efficient …,True,1vI_NocAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,187,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.470096,418686779386518269,/scholar?cites=418686779386518269,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:232385/UQ232385_OA.pdf?dsi_version=ca9914787f23052284c0d0743b1fdd17,0,0,0

1126158,The conservation of quantum zero‐point energies in classical trajectory simulations,1995,Kieran F Lim and Drew A McCormack,102,The Journal of chemical physics,4,1705-1715,American Institute of Physics,We propose a computational technique to constrain the vibrational modes of a classical molecule to have energy greater than the quantum zero‐point energy (ZPE). The trajectory of any mode with energy less than ZPE is projected to a neighboring point in phase space where the energy is equal to the ZPE and the phase angle of the mode is unchanged. All other modes are then perturbed in such a way as to conserve the total energy of the system. This technique is similar in principle to the method of holonomic constraints. We apply this ‘‘semiholonomic’’ TRAPZ (trajectory projection onto ZPE orbit) scheme to the two mode Hénon–Heiles system and find that it results in a decrease of ergodicity.

Although the motility of the cells increased significantly in the presence of bile. transcription of the ctxAB genes. encoding CT. and of the tcpA gene was drastically reduced. In toxR mutant strains. motility is higher than in the wild-type strain and was further increased. by about 150%. in the presence of bile. Bile represses CT production in strain 569B-55. a toxR mutant of strain 569B. which normally produces more than 80% of the amount of CT synthesized in the wild-type cells.

A linear model for the combined reduction of the transmit power and receiver sensitivity is presented. which suggests significant impact on the transmission range and network services. Path loss and link budget analysis indicate a communication range reduction of up to 60%. Network simulations show that the maximum range reduction severely decreases average node connectivity and disrupts multihop data collection. When the received signal strength (RSS) values are used for localization without temperature compensation. ranging error increases by up to 150%. Moreover.

India,2005,S Gupta and MK Bhowmick,4,Lathyrus Lathyrism Newsletter,,28-33,,The State of West Bengal in the eastern part of India. bordering Bangladesh. is a unique example where rice is cultivated in all the three seasons viz.. summer. autumn and winter. The State has to feed almost 70 million people with the support of only 5.8 million hectares of cultivable land. Since independence the state has. therefore. had to resort to more areas under rice than for other crops. especially pulses. the productivity of which are comparatively low. At present the area under rice occupies about 66 percent of the total gross cropped area. which is about 9.24 million hectares with an average cropping intensity of 171 percent (9). The total area under pulses has diminished gradually every year from 582.000 ha during 1957-58 to 242.000 ha during 2002-03 (11).It is a general practice of the farmers of this region to sow various winter pulse crops like lentil (Lens culinaris L.). lathyrus (Lathyrus sativus L.). chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and pea (Pisum sativum) in the standing rice crop field. just before the harvest to ensure germination using the residual moisture and to avoid tillage operations during pulse growing. Such a relay cropping operation (known by the terms utera or paira) is very popular for growing lathyrus. Subsequently due to high ODAP content of local land races and also with the advent of irrigation facilities. the farmers tended to shift from relay cropping of lathyrus to more remunerative crops like rapeseed. mustard. potato. other vegetables and winter rice which require more water. Thus the area under lathyrus. in particular. diminished drastically from 54.000 ha during 1981-82 to 40.000 ha during 2000-01 (10).,True,FSWhhDUAAAAJ:qCaWouos7ogC,31,https://www.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/919868/Gupta.pdf,9276089094448855054,/scholar?cites=9276089094448855054,,https://www.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/919868/Gupta.pdf,0,0,0

Low cost. transition metals such as nickel and iron-based oxides/hydroxides have been regarded as promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media with overpotentials as low as~ 200 mV to achieve 10 mA cm− 2. however. they are generally unsuitable for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein. we show a Janus nanoparticle catalyst with a nickel–iron oxide interface and multi-site functionality for a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction with a comparable performance to the benchmark platinum on carbon catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity of the nanoparticle is induced by the strong electronic coupling effect between the iron oxide and the nickel at the interface.

Although different siderophore structures have been characterized. the iron-binding moieties often contain catecholate or hydroxamate groups. Siderophores function because of their extraordinarily high stability constants (KSTAB = 1030−1049) and selectivity for Fe(III). yet the origin of these high stability constants has been difficult to quantify experimentally.

We explore the consequences for As by investigating the hydrology. porewater geochemistry. solid-phase speciation. and mineralogical partitioning of As across two tidal fringe toposequences. Seawater inundation induced a tidally controlled redox gradient. Maximum porewater As (∼400 μg/L) occurred in the shallow (<1 m). intertidal. redox transition zone between Fe-oxidizing and SO4-reducing conditions.

The ring contraction reduces the symmetry from D4h to C2v. changes the electronic structure of the heterocycle. and leads to a smaller central cavity with three protons rather than the two of a porphyrin. The differences between ferric corroles and porphyrins lead to a number of differences in reactivity including increased axial ligand lability and a tendency to form 5-coordinate complexes. The electronic structure origin of these differences has been difficult to study experimentally as the dominant porphyrin/corrole π → π* transitions obscure the electronic transitions of the metal.

ZnPcSmix is the most effective catalyst in terms of a high quantum yield for 4-Np degradation and the stability of the catalyst. However ZnPc(COOH)8 degrades readily during the catalysis. but it has a higher quantum yield (Φ4-Np) for 4-Np degradation than the rest of the complexes. The Φ4-Np values were closely related to the singlet oxygen quantum yields ΦΔ and hence aggregation.

Of these free radicals. the O2–· and particularly the ·OH radical can induce cellular damage including lipid peroxidation. Thus. the use of antioxidants to prevent such damage induced by UV irradiation has received much attention recently. One such antioxidant. which has the potential to be incorporated into sunscreens. is the pineal secretory product melatonin. One of the concerns of using melatonin in sunscreens is its photostability. In the present study. we investigated the photostability of melatonin subjected to UV irradiation. In addition. we used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC‐MS) to identify the degradants and we also assessed the ability of the degradants to inhibit O2–· generation as well as lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate.

This paper correlates the chemical composition of crude oil with the total acid number (TAN). which enables the development of prediction models using partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machines (SVMs) as alternative multivariate calibration methods that allow for the application of FT-ICR …,True,-l-oqf4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,65,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef301515y,8876346956364027793,/scholar?cites=8876346956364027793,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34163606/Predictive_Petroleomics__Measurement_of_the_Total_Acid_Number_by_Electrospray_Fourier_Transform_Mass_Spectrometry_and_Chemometric_Analys.pdf,0,0,0

In contrast to the other mammalian sirtuins. the primary enzymatic activity of mitochondrial sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) and its overall role in metabolic control have remained enigmatic.

The metabolites leading to these post-translational modifications are intermediates in leucine oxidation. and we show a primary role for SIRT4 in controlling this pathway in mice.
