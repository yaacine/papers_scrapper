Myxoma virus (MV) is a cytoplasmic DNA poxvirus that in nature infects only rabbits. Our previous studies have shown that MV infection of primary mouse cells is restricted by virus-induced type I interferon (IFN). However. little is known about the innate sensor(s) involved in activating signaling pathways leading to cellular defense responses in primary human immune cells. Here. we show that the complete restriction of MV infection in the primary human fibroblasts requires both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and type I IFN. We also demonstrate that MV infection of primary human macrophages (pHMs) activates the cytoplasmic RNA sensor called retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). which coordinately induces the production of both TNF and type I IFN. Of note. RIG-I sensing of MV infection in pHMs initiates a sustained TNF induction through the sequential involvement of the downstream IFN-regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3 and IRF7). Thus. RIG-I-mediated co-induction of TNF and type I IFN by virus-infected pHMs represents a novel innate defense mechanism to restrict viral infection in human cells. These results also reveal a new regulatory mechanism for TNF induction following viral infection.,True,m7j_EGYAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,95,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000099,14681273599661864447,/scholar?cites=14681273599661864447,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000099,0,0,0

Most of these immune escape mechanisms are highly host adapted and specific to a given virus species or family.

While this therapy is effective at rapidly debulking directly injected tumor masses. achieving complete eradication of established disease has proven difficult. One method to overcome this challenge is to use oncolytic viruses to induce secondary antitumor immune responses. Unfortunately. while the initial induction of these immune responses is typically robust. their subsequent efficacy is often inhibited through a variety of immunoregulatory mechanisms. including the PD1/PDL1 T-cell checkpoint pathway. To overcome this inhibition. we generated a novel recombinant myxoma virus (vPD1). which inhibits the PD1/PDL1 pathway specifically within the tumor microenvironment by secreting a soluble form of PD1 from infected cells.

While homologous proteins encoded by gamma-2 herpesviruses and leporipoxviruses have been studied extensively. limited information is available regarding the physiological targets of cellular MARCH proteins. To identify host cell proteins targeted by the human MARCH-VIII ubiquitin ligase we used stable isotope labeling of amino-acids in cell culture (SILAC) to monitor MARCH-dependent changes in the membrane proteomes of human fibroblasts. Unexpectedly. we observed that MARCH-VIII reduced the surface expression of Bap31. a chaperone that predominantly resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We demonstrate that Bap31 associates with the transmembrane domains of several MARCH proteins and controls intracellular transport of MARCH proteins. In addition. we observed that MARCH-VIII reduced the surface expression of the hyaluronic acid-receptor CD44 and both MARCH-VIII and MARCH-IV sequestered the tetraspanin CD81 in endo-lysosomal vesicles. Moreover. gene knockdown of MARCH-IV increased surface levels of endogenous CD81 suggesting a constitutive involvement of this family of ubiquitin ligases in the turnover of tetraspanins.

Evidence indicates that residual cancer cells contaminate autologous grafts and may contribute to early relapses after autologous stem cell transplantation. Here. we demonstrate that ex vivo treatment with an oncolytic poxvirus called myxoma virus results in specific elimination of human myeloma cells by inducing rapid cellular apoptosis while fully sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The specificity of this elimination is based on strong binding of the virus to myeloma cells coupled with an inability of the virus to bind or infect CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Significantly. we observed that a wide spectrum of transformed human cancer cells have universally lost the ability to induce the TNF/IFNβ synergistic state. as defined by three separate criteria.

For high-risk disease. hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) can be used. However. in the setting of autologous HCT. relapse due to contamination of the autograft with cancer cells remains a major challenge. Ex vivo manipulations of the autograft to purge cancer cells using chemotherapies and toxins have been attempted. Because these past strategies lack specificity for malignant cells and often impair the normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. prior efforts to ex vivo purge autografts have resulted in prolonged cytopenias and graft failure. The ideal ex vivo purging agent would selectively target the contaminating cancer cells while spare normal stem and progenitor cells and would be applied quickly without toxicities to the recipient. One agent which meets these criteria is oncolytic viruses.

The intracellular anti-viral states resulting from treatment of cultured cells with each of these molecules independently has been well studied; but. within complex tissues. the early inflammatory response is likely mediated by simultaneously expressed mixtures of these. and other. protective anti-viral cytokines. Such cytokine mixtures have been shown to induce potently synergistic anti-viral responses in vitro which are more complex than the simple summation of the individual cytokine response profiles. The physiological role of this ‘cytokine synergy’. however. remains largely unappreciated in vivo.

Although CAR T cell therapy mediates robust responses in patients with hematological malignancies. this approach has been less effective for treating patients with solid tumors. Additionally. toxicities post T cell infusion highlight the need for safer ACT protocols. Current protocols traditionally expand T lymphocytes isolated from patient tumors or from peripheral blood to large magnitudes in the presence of high dose IL-2 prior to infusion. Unfortunately. this expansion protocol differentiates T cells to a full effector or terminal phenotype in vitro. consequently reducing their long-term survival and antitumor effectiveness in vivo. Post-infusion. T cells face further obstacles limiting their persistence and function within the suppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic manipulation of T cells with common  chain cytokines. which are critical growth factors for T cells. may be the key to bypass such immunological hurdles. Herein. we discuss the primary functions of the common  chain cytokines impacting T cell survival and memory and then elaborate on how these distinct cytokines have been used to augment T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.,True,m7j_EGYAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,26,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00263/full,15516745818368291479,/scholar?cites=15516745818368291479,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00263/full,0,0,0

Several naturally occurring fusogenic viruses have been shown to possess strong oncolytic potential and have since been studied to gain insight into how this process benefits oncolytic virotherapy. Whereas these naturally fusogenic viruses have been beneficial. there are still challenges associated with their regular use.

These limitations are expected to become increasingly important in several coffee growing regions due to the recognized changes in global climate. and also because coffee cultivation has spread towards marginal lands. where water shortage and unfavourable temperatures constitute major constraints to coffee yield. In this review. we examine the impacts of such limitations on the physiology. and consequently on the production of mainly Coffea arabica and C. canephora. which account for about 99% of the world coffee bean production. The first section deals with climatic factors and the coffee plant’s requirements. The importance of controlling oxidative stress for the expression of drought and cold tolerance abilities is emphasized in the second section. In the third section. we examine the impacts of drought on cell-water relations. stomatal behaviour and water use. photosynthesis and crop yield. carbon and nitrogen metabolism. root growth and characteristics. and on drought tolerance. In the fourth section. the impacts of low positive and high temperatures on coffee physiology are discussed; some insights about effects of negative temperatures are also presented.

The evaluation of vegetative growth rates of three groups of plagiotropic branches and one group of orthotropic branches was performed along one year. in Rio Janeiro state. Brazil. The vegetative growth rates of the branches varied along the period of evaluation. and it seems to be related to the minimum air temperature (in the low growth phase). Higher growth rates were observed when the average of minimum air temperatures was higher than 17ºC and the average of the maximum temperatures lower than 31.5ºC. Below 17ºC the growth rate declined. The branches’ growth patterns appeared to be similar. but the plagiotropic branches of different ages presented different rates in the same period of the year. indicating that seasonal growth studies should not be based on a single branch group with the same age.,True,f-s6ZlMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,57,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/4457/445744097010.pdf,18219464679855479991,/scholar?cites=18219464679855479991,,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/4457/445744097010.pdf,0,0,0

That is why this review is focused mainly on recent information about the effects of drought on plant growth. water relations and photosynthesis. as well as mechanisms of adaptation. It is shown that plants have evolved a great number of adaptive mechanisms that allow the biochemical systems to cope with increased water deficit. The literature analyzed in this review shows the complexity of tolerance to water deficit and supports the statements of many authors that the flexibility of cell metabolism and its fast acclimation to changes in environmental conditions is a first essential step in stress avoidance.,True,G8YKH2sAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,295,http://www.ejfa.me/index.php/journal/article/view/731,3462421056545182902,/scholar?cites=3462421056545182902,,https://www.ejfa.me/index.php/journal/article/download/731/535/,0,0,0

Lidon,,Emirates Journal of Food and Agriculture,,481-501,,During the last few decades. there has been considerable concern over the depletion of stratospheric ozone as a result of anthropogenic pollutants. This has resulted in a concomitant increase in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (280? 320 nm). High levels of UV-B radiation are responsible for multiple biologically harmful effects in both plants and animals. Many different plant responses to supplemental UV-B radiation have been observed. mostly injurious but sometimes beneficial. UV-B can influence plant processes either through direct damage or via various regulatory effects. In plants. direct effects include DNA damage. membrane changes and protein denaturation. which often cause heritable mutations affecting various physiological processes. including the photosynthetic apparatus. These could adversely affect plant growth. development and morphology. especially the productivity of sensitive crop species.

The transpiration rates and the stomata functioning might also be inhibited [12. 6]. mostly due to disturbances in the vascular system mediated by xylem elements blockage. as it implicates low water content in the leaves [4]. It also seems that zinc can induce iron and magnesium deficit. concomitantly inducing a decreased accumulation of photosynthetic pigments [5. 6. 10]. since magnesium directly participates in chl synthesis and iron interacts as a co-factor [13-15]. According to Van Assche and Clijsters [16] the possible replacement of manganese for zinc in the OEC of PS2 can also inhibit the photosynthetic electron transport and the non-cyclic photophosphorilation.

Recent studies revealed that elevated air [CO2] mitigates the impact of heat on leaf physiology. However. the extent of the interaction between elevated air [CO2] and heat on coffee bean quality was never addressed. In this study. the single and combined impacts of enhanced [CO2] and temperature in beans of Coffea arabica cv. Icatu were evaluated. Plants were grown at 380 or 700 μL CO2 L-1 air. and then submitted to a gradual temperature rise from 25 ºC up to 40 ºC during ca. 4 months. Fruits were harvested at 25 ºC. and in the ranges of 30-35 ºC or 36-40 ºC. and bean physical and chemical attributes with potential implications on quality were then examined. These included: colour. phenolic content. soluble solids. chlorogenic. caffeic and p-coumaric acids. caffeine. trigonelline. lipids. and minerals. Most of these parameters were mostly affected by temperature (although without a strong negative impact on bean quality). and only marginally. if at all. by elevated [CO2]. However. the [CO2] vs. temperature interaction strongly attenuated some of the negative impacts promoted by heat (e.g.. total chlorogenic acids). thus maintaining the bean characteristics closer to those obtained under adequate temperature conditions (e.g.. soluble solids. caffeic and p-coumaric acids. trigonelline. chroma. Hue angle. colour index). and increasing desirable features (acidity). Fatty acid and mineral pools remained quite stable. with only few modifications due to elevated air [CO2] (e.g.. phosphorous) and/or heat.

Changes in leaf stomatal conductance (gs). membrane lipids composition and abscisic acid (ABA) content were determined under water stress. Membrane integrity was assessed through leaf discs dehydration with polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000.-1.3 MPa). and expressed as an injury index (I%).. In EPACE-1 and 1183. rapid stomatal closure at early stages of dehydration was related with the ability to accumulate endogenous ABA. On the contrary in Vg stomata closed at lower leaf relative water content as ABA increase was delayed. In 1183. high I% values occurred in PEG-dehydrated discs. and lipid degradation was observed even under moderate water stress (S1). becoming significant under more severe drought (S2). Also. along drought imposition this genotype presented a continuous leaf ABA increase that probably contributed to early visual tissue senescence. Vg and EPACE-1 presented lower I% values. probably denoting the ability to preserve membrane integrity. In EPACE-1 this was achieved through a quite stable lipid content. while in Vg new membrane lipids were synthesized.

Recent studies revealed that elevated air [CO2] mitigates the impact of heat on leaf physiology. However. the extent of the interaction between elevated air [CO2] and heat on coffee bean quality was never addressed. In this study. the single and combined impacts of enhanced [CO2] and temperature in beans of Coffea arabica cv. Icatu were evaluated. Plants were grown at 380 or 700 μL CO2 L-1 air. and then submitted to a gradual temperature rise from 25 ºC up to 40 ºC during ca. 4 months. Fruits were harvested at 25 ºC. and in the ranges of 30-35 ºC or 36-40 ºC. and bean physical and chemical attributes with potential implications on quality were then examined. These included: colour. phenolic content. soluble solids. chlorogenic. caffeic and p-coumaric acids. caffeine. trigonelline. lipids. and minerals. Most of these parameters were mostly affected by temperature (although without a strong negative impact on bean quality). and only marginally. if at all. by elevated [CO2]. However. the [CO2] vs. temperature interaction strongly attenuated some of the negative impacts promoted by heat (e.g.. total chlorogenic acids). thus maintaining the bean characteristics closer to those obtained under adequate temperature conditions (e.g.. soluble solids. caffeic and p-coumaric acids. trigonelline. chroma. Hue angle. colour index). and increasing desirable features (acidity). Fatty acid and mineral pools remained quite stable. with only few modifications due to elevated air [CO2] (e.g.. phosphorous) and/or heat.

Several studies. which have been almost exclusively based on temperature increase. have predicted extensive reductions (higher than half by 2050) of actual coffee cropped areas. However. recent studies showed that elevated [CO2] can strongly mitigate the negative impacts of heat stress at the physiological and biochemical levels in coffee leaves. In addition. it has also been shown that coffee genotypes can successfully cope with temperatures above what has been traditionally accepted. Altogether. this information suggests that the real impact of climate changes on coffee growth and production could be significantly lower than previously estimated.

The injurious effects of UV-B have been assessed mainly through in vitro studies and vary greatly according the dose received. the exposition period and the sensitivity of the species. Adaptive responses can include for example. synthesis of new compounds. increases of UV-B absorbing compounds or anti-oxidant enzymes. Morphological consequences are also documented such as reduced growth and thickening of leaves and cuticule. The main response of UV-B irradiation in indoor experiments is the formation of UV-B absorbing compounds such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids which function as protective screens. although in the natural habitat plants living at higher altitudes and latitudes are tolerant to UV-B due to the natural selection. The main conclusion derived from studies with terrestrial plants is that photosynthesis is not significantly affected by changes in UV-B radiation when plants grow under natural conditions.

In this context. the impacts of single and combined exposure to drought and cold were evaluated in three genotypes of the two major cropped species. Coffea arabica cv. Icatu. Coffea canephora cv. Apoatã. and the hybrid Obatã. Crucial traits of plant resilience to environmental stresses have been examined: photosynthesis. lipoperoxidation and the antioxidant response. Drought and/or cold promoted leaf dehydration. which was accompanied by stomatal and mesophyll limitations that impaired leaf C-assimilation in all genotypes. However. Icatu showed a lower impact upon stress exposure and a faster and complete photosynthetic recovery. Although lipoperoxidation was increased by drought (Icatu) and cold (all genotypes). it was greatly reduced by stress interaction. especially in Icatu. In fact. although the antioxidative system was reinforced under single drought and cold exposure (e.g.. activity of enzymes as Cu.Zn-superoxide dismutase. ascorbate peroxidase.

HSP70. raffinose). activities of antioxidant enzymes. such as superoxide dismutase (SOD). ascorbate peroxidase (APX). glutathione reductase (GR). catalase (CAT). and the upregulated expression of some genes (ELIP. Chaperonin 20). However. at 42/34 ºC a tolerance threshold was reached. mostly in the 380-plants and Icatu. Adjustments in raffinose. lutein. β-carotene. α-tocopherol and HSP70 pools. and the upregulated expression of genes related to protective (ELIPS. HSP70. Chape 20 and 60) and antioxidant (CAT. CuSOD2. APX Cyt. APX Chl) proteins were largely driven by temperature. However. enhanced [CO2] maintained higher activities of GR (Icatu) and CAT (Icatu and IPR108). kept (or even increased) the Cu.Zn-SOD. APX and CAT activities. and promoted a greater upregulation of those enzyme genes. as well as those related to HSP70. ELIPs. Chaperonins in CL153 and Icatu.. These changes likely favoured the maintenance of reactive …,True,YSCHfw8AAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C,77,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00947/full,15682037903983340364,/scholar?cites=15682037903983340364,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00947/full,0,0,0

L.) is an important economic crop in tropical and subtropical countries. It is a giant herbaceous species; maintaining adequate tissue turgidity and water availability is necessary to maintain the rigidity of the stem as well as increase productivity. Water-saving irrigation techniques for papaya will be needed in the future due to the possibility of water shortages related to climate change. The morphological and physiological responses of ‘Grand Golden’ papaya to partial root drying (PRD). regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and no irrigation followed by re-hydration (NI-gh) in a greenhouse study or no irrigation (NI-field) in a field study were compared with full irrigation (FI). In the greenhouse study. plants were grown in pot with roots split equally between two soil columns. In the field study. drip emitters on opposite sides of the plant delivered irrigation water. In FI. the whole root system was irrigated …,True,YSCHfw8AAAAJ:tHtfpZlB6tUC,71,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423814006785,16023963505388868449,/scholar?cites=16023963505388868449,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43535080/Partial_rootzone_drying_PRD_and_regula20160309-7922-4a0bpf.pdf,0,0,0

1051438,Estimation of papaya leaf area using the central vein length,2001,Eliemar Campostrini and Osvaldo Kiyoshi Yamanishi,58,Scientia Agricola,1,39-42,Scientia Agricola,Four genotypes of papaya (Carica papaya L.) two from the 'Solo' group (Sunrise Solo and Improved Sunrise Solo line 72/12) and two from the 'Formosa' group (Tainung 02 and Known-You 01). grown in Macaé. RJ. Brazil (lat. 22(0) 24' S. long. 41(0) 42' W). were used in this study. Twenty-five mature leaves from each genotype were sampled four and five months after seedling transplant to the field to determine the length of the leaf central vein (LLCV) and the leaf area (LA). According to covariance analyses there were no significant differences in the slope and intercept of the mathematical models calculated for each genotype. Thus. a single mathematical model (Log LA = 0.315 + 1.85 Log LLCV. R²=0.898) was adjusted to estimate the LA using the length of LLCV for the four genotypes. An unique model can be applied to estimate the LA for the four papaya genotypes using LLCV in the range from 0.25 to 0.60 m. and for papaya trees 150 to 180 days after transplanting.,True,YSCHfw8AAAAJ:zwpXiJ37cpgC,53,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-90162001000100007&script=sci_arttext,10850400266892082875,/scholar?cites=10850400266892082875,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-90162001000100007&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0
