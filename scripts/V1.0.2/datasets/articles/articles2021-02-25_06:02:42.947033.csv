By engineering the energy levels of the donor molecules and the PbS QDs through the use of different cross-linking ligands. we are able to control the characteristics of PbS field-effect transistors (FETs) from ambipolar to strongly n-type. Because the doping promotes trap filling. the charge carrier mobility is improved up to 0.64 cm2 V–1 s–1. which is the highest mobility reported for low-temperature processed PbS FETs …,True,KJJjCAUAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,21,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.7b02867,2415522765907142013,/scholar?cites=2415522765907142013,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsami.7b02867,0,0,0

Porphyrins. phthalocyanines. and other related organic dyes are well known for their use in photodynamic therapy (PDT).

The matrix of the so-called ureasils is a silica network to which oligopolyoxyethylene chains are grafted by means of urea cross-links. The ureasils preparedU(2000). U(900). and U(600)are obtained by reacting three diamines (containing about 40.5. 15.5. and 8.5 oxyethylene units. respectively) with 3-isocyanatepropyltriethoxysilane. The mid-infrared spectra of the diamines are examined. The FTIR spectrum of U(2000) shows that the polyether chains of the parent diamine become less ordered upon incorporation into the inorganic backbone. The assignment of the absorption bands originating from the urea moieties in the ureasils is proposed.

These results have been theoretically interpreted in terms of the Ω λ intensity parameters and their dependence on the nature and local symmetry of the chemical environment around the Eu 3+ ion. leading to the conclusion that the chemical environment is highly polarizable with a local symmetry corresponding to a slightly distorted D 4d coordination geometry.

No cases of microbial viability recovery or any resistance mechanisms against it are yet known. 5. 10. 15-tris (1-Methylpyridinium-4-yl)-20-(pentafluorophenyl)-porphyrin triiodide (Tri-Py+-Me-PF) was used as photosensitizer. Vibrio fischeri and recombinant Escherichia coli were the studied bacteria. To determine the bacterial recovery after treatment. Tri-Py+-Me-PF (5.0 µM) was added to bacterial suspensions and the samples were irradiated with white light (40 W m-2) for 270 minutes. Then. the samples were protected from light. aliquots collected at different intervals and the bioluminescence measured. To assess the development of resistance after treatment. bacterial suspensions were exposed to white light (25 minutes). in presence of 5.0 μM of Tri-Py+-Me-PF (99.99% of inactivation) and plated. After the first irradiation period. surviving colonies were collected from the plate and resuspended in PBS. Then. an identical protocol was used and repeated ten times for each bacterium. The results suggest that aPDT using Tri-Py+-Me-PF represents a promising approach to efficiently destroy bacteria since after a single treatment these microorganisms do not recover their viability and after ten generations of partially photosensitized cells neither of the bacteria develop resistance to the photodynamic process.

A thorough analysis toward the correlation between both structural and Raman modes parameters has been undertaken. Our results provide evidence for two main structural distortions of MnO 6 octahedra. arising from a cooperative Jahn-Teller and rotational distortions in these compounds. The temperature dependence of the B 1 g symmetric stretching mode of the MnO 6 units has revealed either a positive or negative shift regarding the pure anharmonic temperature dependence of the phonon frequency. which strongly depends on the Y concentration. This frequency renormalization is explained in terms of a competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.

In this context the lithium salt concentration is expressed in terms of the number of oxyethylene units in the organic component of the network per Li+ ion. Electrolyte samples with n ≥ 20 are thermally stable up to approximately 250 ºC. All the materials synthesized are semi-crystalline: in the composition range n ≥ 15 free crystalline POE exists and at 60 ≥ n ≥ 2.5 evidence of the presence of a crystalline POE/LiBF4 compound has been found. At n = 2.5 this latter crystalline phase coexists with free salt. The room temperature conductivity maximum of this electrolyte system is located at n = 10 (1.5x10-5 S cm-1 at 22 ºC). The electrochemical stability domain of the sample with n = 15 spans about 5.5 V versus Li/Li+. This new series of materials represents a promising alternative to the LiTFSI- and LiClO4-doped POE and POE/siloxane analogues. Preliminary tests performed with a prototype electrochromic device (ECD) comprising the sample with n = 8 as electrolyte and WO3 as cathodically coloring layer are extremely encouraging.

Cr(VI) is                 carcinogenic and mutagenic. although its in vivo and in vitro toxic effects are                 related to its intracellular fate. Inside the cells. Cr(VI) is rapidly reduced to                 stable Cr(III). As Cr(V) and Cr(IV) species have been reported to be formed in the                 Cr(VI) reduction pathways. Cr(VI)induced damage is thought. at least in part. to                 arise from these hypervalent species. The study of Cr(VI) reduction mechanisms and                 the characterization of the effects of each reactive intermediate constitute                 important steps towards a better understanding of chromium toxicity.

Using a typical ionic liquid [1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide]. we observed the existence of preferential specific interactions between the low electrical charge density (“apolar moiety”) parts of the ionic liquid cation and the inorganic salts. These a priori unexpected interactions become increasingly favorable as one moves from salting-out to salting-in effects.

These brushlike macromolecules have been prepared previously using the macromonomer method. 1-6 Macromonomers. usually prepared by anionic polymerization. were homopolymerized using conventional radical methods to maximize the number of branches possible from a linear backbone based on vinyl monomers. Upon fractionation of these materials using size exclusion chromatography. samples of narrow polydispersities were obtained which could then be cast on surfaces to form highly ordered thin films. To avoid the rigorous methods necessary for ionic polymerizations and sample fractionation. and to extend the variety of compositional content of these types of materials. atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been used to prepare similar macromolecular architectures. The approach described here involves grafting from a macroinitiator and can offer greater versatility in terms of both the length and the composition of the backbone and/or the side chains than previous methods which employed the synthesis of high molecular weight macromonomers and their subsequent polymerization by uncontrolled radical techniques; to obtain welldefined polymeric brushes required their fractionation. generally by SEC.

The model is tested against experiments on styrene at 60 °C with cyanoisopropyl dithiobezoate (CPDB) as the RAFT agent.

In both cases the secondary radical formed can transfer to polymer to generate a tertiary radical. which can propagate with monomer to re-form the secondary species. The critical difference between these two processes is that the exchange between tertiary and secondary species is supplemented in ATRP by additional activation and deactivation reactions for both the secondary and tertiary species. This leads to a competition between the activation–deactivation and exchange processes in ATRP. while there is no such competition in FRP.

The value for Tmol % significantly exceeded the values predicted for conventional termination between two radicals. The main reason for the additional loss of chain-end functionality was identified as a CuI-induced catalytic radical termination (CRT). The mechanism proposed for this CRT involves the formation of highly active R–CuII/L and/or H–CuII/L intermediates which react with radicals to form dead chains and regenerate the CuI activator. The contribution of CRT to the loss of terminal functionality can be significantly decreased by reducing [CuI] to <1 mM. according to recently developed new ATRP processes.,True,nmVsjxkAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,122,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma3024393,1756611928969063276,/scholar?cites=1756611928969063276,,,0,0,0

In this work. we employed a series of binary metal oxide catalysts with capsule-like morphology by anchoring ZrO2 on Cu oxide (CuOx) for the oxidation of methane.

Kinetic simulation,2013,Mingjiang Zhong and Yu Wang and Pawel Krys and Dominik Konkolewicz and Krzysztof Matyjaszewski,46,Macromolecules,10,3816-3827,American Chemical Society,Reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) of methyl acrylate in DMSO in the presence of Cu0 was studied by kinetic simulations. Kinetic simulations give access to the rates and contributions of all reactions. including those of activation of alkyl halides by CuI and Cu0 species. disproportionation of CuI species. and comproportionation between CuII and Cu0. Every relevant reaction was quantified by experimentally measured rate coefficients. The rates and contributions allow the exact roles of Cu0 and CuI species to be evaluated.

Both theoretical and experimental investigations have revealed that dissociative electron transfer to these alkyl halides proceeds exclusively via a concerted rather than stepwise manner. The reductive cleavage of all three alkyl halides requires a substantial activation barrier stemming mainly from the breaking C−X bond. The activation step during single electron transfer LRP (SET-LRP) was originally proposed to proceed via formation and decomposition of RX•− through an outer sphere electron transfer (OSET) process (Guliashvili.

They may thus serve as selective homogeneous catalysts for the reduction of CO2 in an aprotic medium. The catalytic enhancement of the cyclic voltammetric peaks of these catalysts is used to determine the rate constant of the electron transfer from these aromatic anion radicals to CO2 as a function of the catalyst standard potential. Substituted benzoic esters allowed a particularly detailed investigation of the resulting activation-driving force relationship. Using 14 different catalysts in this series made it possible to finely scan a range of reaction standard free energies of 0.4 eV.

One of these techniques. atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). makes use of a catalytic system. most commonly copper complexed by a nitrogen-based ligand. in which the L/CuI activator species cleaves a (macro) alkyl halide bond generating a carbon-centered radical and the oxidized L/CuII-X deactivator species. The radical propagates by adding to a few monomer units before being quickly deactivated by the L/CuII-X complex. As with any radical process. irreversible termination reactions are unavoidable and thus a gradual buildup of L/CuII-X is observed according to the persistent radical effect (PRE). leading to a suppressed rate of polymerization. Various systems with activator regeneration. also known as “low ppm Cu ATRP.” have been developed to overcome the PRE. but these require the use of highly active catalysts. At the forefront of ATRP research has been the development of new externally regulated systems as well as mechanistic understanding of the processes in order to select the best catalytic system.

The experiments show that all selected catalysts can be involved in the activation step. but not all of them participated efficiently in the deactivation step. The redox properties and the stability of radical cations derived from the catalysts were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Laser flash photolysis (LFP) was used to determine the lifetime and activity of photoexcited catalysts. Kinetic analysis of the activation reaction according to dissociative electron-transfer (DET) theory suggests that the activation occurs only with an excited state of catalyst.

However. the reason for this success and the intimate mechanism remained basically speculative. Herein. two mechanisms are shown to coexist: the reversible termination of the growing poly(vinyl acetate) chains by the Co(acac)2 complex (acac: acetylacetonato). and a degenerative chain‐transfer process. The importance of one contribution over the other strongly depends on the polymerization conditions. including complexation of cobalt by ligands. such as water and pyridine. This significant progress in the CMRP mechanism relies on the isolation and characterization of the very first cobalt adducts formed in the polymerization medium and their use as CMRP initiators.

The MM+ technique is more suited to search for the most stable conformations.

CRT proceeds via a L/CuII–Pn organometallic intermediate and results in saturated chain-ends. Thus. CRT can help to suppress gelation in the synthesis of densely grafted poly(n-butyl acrylate) molecular bottlebrushes using the “grafting-from” method by decreasing the fraction of chains terminated by conventional bimolecular radical combination. Molecular bottlebrushes by ATRP are typically prepared slowly in low yield and to limited monomer conversion to prevent radical combination. cross-linking. and gelation.

A pronounced increase of the fracture toughness (by approximately one order of magnitude) is observed as the degree of polymerization exceeds a threshold value that increases with particle size. The threshold value is interpreted as being related to the transition of tethered chains from stretched-to-relaxed conformation (and the associated entanglement of tethered chains) and agrees with predictions from scaling theory. The increase in toughness is reduced with increasing particle size – this effect is rationalized as a consequence of the decrease of entanglement density with increasing dimension of interstitial (void) space in particle array structures.

In a first step. PAN NPs are synthesized using miniemulsion polymerization. followed by grafting of 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TESPMA) to form well-defined core–shell structured PAN@PTESPMA nanospheres. The cross-linked PTESPMA brush layer suppresses cross-linking reactions during carbonization.

The synthesis of carbon/ZnO nanocomposites involved the uniform dispersion of octylamine (OA) capped ZnO nanocrystals into poly(styrene-r-acrylonitrile) (PSAN) copolymers and the subsequent pyrolysis of the nanocomposite precursor material to form the carbon/ZnO hybrid. PSAN copolymers with two different chain lengths were prepared to illustrate the effect of chain length on structure and properties of the composites.

1084815,Insight on the periodate oxidation of dextran and its structural vicissitudes,2011,João Maia and Rui A Carvalho and Jorge FJ Coelho and Pedro N Simões and M Helena Gil,52,Polymer,2,258-265,Elsevier,Periodate oxidized dextran has been widely studied in a broad range of biotechnological applications. regardless of this. usually little attention is paid to the oxidation extension consequences on the properties of the final modified dextran. Based on a bidimensional NMR analysis. we suggest that the two aldehydes groups. resulting from the periodate oxidation. are not fully reactive with N-nucleophiles. under certain pH conditions. The aldehyde group bonded to C3 appeared to be the only prone to react. The other aldehyde might be arrested in more stable hemiacetal structures. The hemiacetals are also responsible for oxidized dextran crosslinking. interfering in simple processing steps. such as dissolution and solubility. as well as increasing the viscosity of the solutions.

As the classic antibiotics exhibit an increasingly low capacity to effectively act on microorganisms. new solutions must be developed. The importance of this class of materials emerged from the uncontrolled use of antibiotics. which led to the advent of multidrug-resistant microbes. being nowadays one of the most serious public health problems. This review presents a critical discussion of the latest developments involving the use of different classes of antimicrobial polymers. The synthesis pathways used to afford macromolecules with antimicrobial properties. as well as the relationship between the structure and performance of these materials are discussed.

Model macroinitiators with low dispersity are prepared and extended to afford well‐defined block copolymers of various compositions. Combined cHE/SARA ATRP is therefore a simple and potent polymerization tool for the copolymerization of a wide range of monomers allowing the production of tailored block copolymers.,True,RJiL9T4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.202000532,,,,,0,0,0

1084854,Developments in Reversible Deactivation Radical Polymerization: New Ecofriendly Catalytic Systems and Vinyl Chloride (co) Polymerization Methods,2018,Carlos Miguel Rocha Abreu,,,,,,The aim of this work was the study and development of new ecofriendly catalytic systems for reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). It was also a goal the development of new vinyl chloride (VC) (co)polymerizations systems using RDRP methods.  Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is among the most efficient. versatile and robust RDRP techniques. The new generation of catalytic systems for RDRP of vinyl monomers should be non-toxic. inexpensive and provide fast polymerizations in environmentally friendly media. In this context. in the present work Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved inorganic sulfites such as sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4). sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5). and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) were found as a new class of very efficient reducing agents and supplemental activators (SARA) for ATRP. In combination with catalytic amounts of Cu(II)Br2/Me6TREN (Me6TREN: tris[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at ambient temperature (30 ºC). poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) with controlled molecular weight. low dispersity (Ð < 1.05). and well-defined chain-end functionality. was synthetized as a proof-of-concept. In addition. an unusual synergistic effect between an ionic liquid. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIM-PF6). and DMSO mixtures was found for this ecofriendly SARA ATRP.

Zn. Cr. Cu. etc.)[1]. Among them the removal of chromium is the most urgent. because its compounds. being strong oxidants. negatively affect the human vital organs such as kidneys. liver. and brain. The removal of Cr (VI) from aqueous (especially acidic) solutions by sorption is rather difficult. because it oxidizes functional groups of the sorbent and causes its degradation. In the literature. major attention has been concentrated on the treatment of industrial wastewaters using granular anionic AV-1708 [2] and EDE-10P [3] and some amphoteric ion exchangers [4]. The highest sorption of Cr (VI) on the AV-17 0 8 anion exchangers is observed at pH 134. and with increasing pH it gradually decreases. The EDE-10P anion exchanger is readily oxidized by dichromate ions. and thus is unsuitable for removing chromium from industrial wastewaters.,True,PDCHqrEAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,20,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gafurova_Dilfuza/publication/336641582_ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_OF_CHEMISTRY_AND_TECHNOLOGY_Sorption_of_CrVI_on_the_Anion-Exchange_Fibrous_Material_Based_on_Nitron/links/5da9848c92851c577eb82232/ENVIRONMENTAL-PROBLEMS-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-OF-CHEMISTRY-AND-TECHNOLOGY-Sorption-of-CrVI-on-the-Anion-Exchange-Fibrous-Material-Based-on-Nitron.pdf,16265578396569715993,/scholar?cites=16265578396569715993,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gafurova_Dilfuza/publication/336641582_ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_OF_CHEMISTRY_AND_TECHNOLOGY_Sorption_of_CrVI_on_the_Anion-Exchange_Fibrous_Material_Based_on_Nitron/links/5da9848c92851c577eb82232/ENVIRONMENTAL-PROBLEMS-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-OF-CHEMISTRY-AND-TECHNOLOGY-Sorption-of-CrVI-on-the-Anion-Exchange-Fibrous-Material-Based-on-Nitron.pdf,0,0,0

Zn. Cr. Cu. etc.)[1]. Among them the removal of chromium is the most urgent. because its compounds. being strong oxidants. negatively affect the human vital organs such as kidneys. liver. and brain. The removal of Cr (VI) from aqueous (especially acidic) solutions by sorption is rather difficult. because it oxidizes functional groups of the sorbent and causes its degradation. In the literature. major attention has been concentrated on the treatment of industrial wastewaters using granular anionic AV-1708 [2] and EDE-10P [3] and some amphoteric ion exchangers [4]. The highest sorption of Cr (VI) on the AV-17 0 8 anion exchangers is observed at pH 134. and with increasing pH it gradually decreases. The EDE-10P anion exchanger is readily oxidized by dichromate ions. and thus is unsuitable for removing chromium from industrial wastewaters.,True,M_bydpMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,20,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gafurova_Dilfuza/publication/336641582_ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_OF_CHEMISTRY_AND_TECHNOLOGY_Sorption_of_CrVI_on_the_Anion-Exchange_Fibrous_Material_Based_on_Nitron/links/5da9848c92851c577eb82232/ENVIRONMENTAL-PROBLEMS-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-OF-CHEMISTRY-AND-TECHNOLOGY-Sorption-of-CrVI-on-the-Anion-Exchange-Fibrous-Material-Based-on-Nitron.pdf,16265578396569715993,/scholar?cites=16265578396569715993,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gafurova_Dilfuza/publication/336641582_ENVIRONMENTAL_PROBLEMS_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII_OF_CHEMISTRY_AND_TECHNOLOGY_Sorption_of_CrVI_on_the_Anion-Exchange_Fibrous_Material_Based_on_Nitron/links/5da9848c92851c577eb82232/ENVIRONMENTAL-PROBLEMS-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-OF-CHEMISTRY-AND-TECHNOLOGY-Sorption-of-CrVI-on-the-Anion-Exchange-Fibrous-Material-Based-on-Nitron.pdf,0,0,0

Исследована кинетика винилирования пиридина и рассчитана энергия активации этого процесса. На основе полученных данных предложен предполагаемый механизм синтеза винилового производного пиридина. Образование данного соединения объясняется тем. что под действием электроноакцепторного атома азота в пиридиновом кольце атомы углерода приобретают частично положительный заряд. При щелочном винилировании пиридина процесс начинается электрофильным замещением атома водорода в положении 3 в пиридиновом кольце на катион калия из системе КОН-ДМСО с последующим установлением равновесия.

Results: The 1500 mg/kg dose. had a marked aphrodisiac action (prolongation of ejaculation latency) but no effect on libido (% mounting.% intromission an d% ejaculation). sexual vigour (mounting-and-intromission frequency). or sexu al performance (intercopulatory interval). In contrast. the higher dose (3000 mg/kg) reversibly inhibited all the parameters of sexual behaviour other than mounting-and-intro mission frequency and copulatory efficiency. The effects of high dose SS were not due to general toxicity. liver toxicity. haemotoxicity. stress. muscle deficiency. muscle incoordination. analgesia. hypoglycaemia or reduction in blood testosterone level. They were due to marked sedation. Conclusion: The kernel of T. catappa seeds has aphrodisiac activity and may be useful in the treatment of certain forms of sexual inadequacies. such as premature ejaculation.,True,qUSYC2YAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,209,http://www.asiaandro.com/archive/1008-682x/2/213.htm?iqeiahvqxbmpcvom?gmynzrihfkldezpo?bcvocvhomwsrpluo?egdxlwjcldxlgkuv?zarpvhfihfkbtmpv,17010405618224757610,/scholar?cites=17010405618224757610,,http://www.asiaandro.com/archive/1008-682x/2/213.htm?iqeiahvqxbmpcvom?gmynzrihfkldezpo?bcvocvhomwsrpluo?egdxlwjcldxlgkuv?zarpvhfihfkbtmpv,0,0,0

In traditional medicine and Ayurveda it is correlated with disease called Madhumeha. In Sri Lanka. Traditional and Ayurvedic physicians treat diabetes mellitus very effectively. Information was obtained from traditional and Ayurvedic physicians. Ayurvedic text books and old manuscripts. According to these. various parts of several herbs are used: flowers (Butea monospema). leaves (Adhathoda vasica). fruits (Momordica dioica). seeds (Syzygium cumini). stems (Tinospora cordifolia). stem bark (Ficus religiosa). root bark (Salacia reticulate) roots (Oryza sativa). aerial roots (Ficus benghalensis). rhizome (Alpinia galanga) bulb (Allium sativum). creeper (Passiflora foetida) and entire plant (Scoparia dulcis). These are prepared in different forms like powders. decoctions. juices and pastes. Decoctions are made using single or multiple herbs. Multiple decoctions usually contain hyperglycaemic herbs such as Cyperus rotundus. Aloe vera to minimize drastic hypoglycaemic complications as usually evident with allopathic drugs. In addition. patients are recommended to consume antidiabetic herbs as food or drinks: as chyme (Osbeckia octandra). curries (Lassia spinos). salads (Centella asiatica). spices (Trigonella foenumgraecu). fresh fruits (Phyllanthus embelica). or as a drink (Camellia sinesis).

1085076,Review on copper in male reproduction and contraception.,1992,KP Skandhan,87,,12,594-598,,The effect of copper on spermatozoa was studied as early as 1956 by Quatrefages. and has given rise to numerous studies and the assay findings have recurred in all the tissues of the male reproductive system. with considerable individual differences. the cause of which is not understood. Its role in the sperm is unclear. but it appears to be involved in spermatozoan mobility and it may also act at the pituitary receptors which control the release of LH. In the seminal fluid. the level of copper appears to fall in cases of azoospermia and to increase in oligo-and asthenozoospermia. but the findings of different authors are somewhat contradictory and some authors do not report any correlation between the seminal level of copper and the number of mobility of the gametes. It is true that the concentrations in the ejaculate vary considerably from one day to the next and that they also vary in different fractions from a single ejaculate. The toxic effects of copper on spermatozoa. which was demonstrated in 1850 by Quatrefages. has often been confirmed. Copper reduces the oxidative processes and glucose consumption. which reduces or abolishes mobility: this property is exploited in intrauterine devices. The use of copper for male contraception has given rise to experimental implantations at various sites within the male system: lumen of the deferens. epididymis. seminal vesicle scrotum and the mobility of the spermatozoa was abolished in all cases. Tissue toxicity makes it impossible to use this method in human practice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),True,qUSYC2YAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC,80,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1485076,11313334040082446208,/scholar?cites=11313334040082446208,,,0,0,0

The extract caused a concentration-related impairment of percentage sperm motility; with the EC 50 concentration being 2.29 mg ml. This effect on motility was essentially irreversible. With the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg ml). the onset of the antimotility action was almost immediate. In addition. this concentration impaired the functional integrity of the plasma membrane (hypoosmotic swelling test) and viability (nigrosin-eosin stain) of spermatozoa. In contrast. with a lower concentration (5.0 mg ml). such effects were not evident. It is concluded that at the lower concentrations the antimotility action may result from a rise in intracellular calcium (not via influx) and/or a decline in cAMP content and/or enhanced generation of a reactive oxygen species.,True,qUSYC2YAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,71,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037887419190166B,15201973916021899969,/scholar?cites=15201973916021899969,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45704463/Sperm_antimotility_properties_of_a_seed_20160517-25647-z2xwbc.pdf,0,0,0

Results: Treatment had no effect on fertility. but sexual competence was seriously impaired: libido (assessed in terms of pre-coital sexual behaviour. and numbers of mounting. intromission and ejaculation) sexual arousability/motivation (in terms of latencies for mounting. intromission and ejaculation). sexual vigour (judged by frequencies of mounting and intromission or copulatory efficiency). In addition. ICON suppressed intromission ratio. indicating erectile dysfunction. These effects on sexual function had a rapid onset and was reversible. ICON-induced sexual dysfunction was mediated by multiple mechanisms. mainly toxicity. stress. sedation and possibly via GABA and dopaminergic systems. Conclusion: Exposure to ICON may cause sexual dysfunction in male rats.,True,qUSYC2YAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,53,http://www.asiaandro.com/archive/1008-682X/4/35.htm,9967872526335484639,/scholar?cites=9967872526335484639,,http://www.asiaandro.com/archive/1008-682X/4/35.htm,0,0,0
1085089,Testosterone secretion. musth behaviour and social dominance in captive male Asian elephants living near the equator,1996,GA Lincoln and WD Ratnasooriya,108,Reproduction,1,107-113,Bioscientifica Ltd,Testosterone concentrations were measured in blood samples collected weekly over a 5 year period from six adult (19–40 year old) male Asian elephants (Elephas maximus maximus) living in captivity in Sri Lanka (7°N). to investigate the relationship between androgen secretion and the occurrence of musth (temporal gland secretion. drip urination and aggressive behaviour). The testosterone profiles were very variable both within and between animals. Long-term phasic changes in blood concentrations of testosterone. associated with periods of musth. occurred in three of the six elephants. with the most pronounced cyclicity in the oldest animal. Musth occurred annually after periods of high androgen secretion and there was a positive correlation between the duration of musth and mean concentrations of testosterone during the previous 2 months. The time of musth. while consistent for an individual. was variable …,True,qUSYC2YAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,51,https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/108/1/jrf_108_1_016.xml,3000938417225129933,/scholar?cites=3000938417225129933,,https://rep.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/rep/108/1/jrf_108_1_016.xml,0,0,0

Vipadika is a common skin ailment in geographically warm country like Sri Lanka. Large fissures with number of cracks in feet and hands with severe pain are the symptoms of Vipadika skin lesion according to Ayurveda texts. Though Vipadikahara Grita Taila is an effective treatment. two important plants (Leptadenia reticulate and Berberis aristata) are not available in Sri Lanka to prepare this medicated oil. Therefore. as an alternative. substitute oil was prepared introducing two newly identified substitute plants (Wattakaka volubilis and Berberis ceylanica). Still. researches are not attempted to evaluate the efficacy of this substitute oil on Vipadika skin disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of substitute oil on Vipadika skin lesion. A forty seven year old female house wife was presented to outpatient department (Kayachikitsa clinic). Ayurveda Teaching Hospital in 2014 with complaints of bilateral large cracks and fissures in feet since 05 years. According to clinical features of Ayurveda view. this case diagnosed as Vipadika skin lesion. To manage this. standardized substitute oil was applied over the affected area twice a day. in the morning and evening in dried feet after washing with Luke warm water for 6 weeks duration. The lesions progressively healed reducing with cardinal symptoms during the treatment period and gradually the skin of the feet became almost normal.

Despite the numerous preventative strategies and armories of medication. the management of diabetes remains grossly unsatisfactory. Diabetes is emerging as a pandemic. Therefore it is important to identify novel nutraceuticals or drugs for curing or preventing diabetes. which have fewer side effects. The present paper reviewed scientific information on mushrooms with regards to its anti-diabetic active compounds and/or pharmacological test results. which are commonly used as functional foods and ingredients used in the traditional medical system and which have demonstrated experimental or/and clinical anti-diabetic effectiveness. These functional foods might have a big potential for the prevention or cure of diabetes more than in other plant species.

Tamalakyadi decoction (TD) is a classical formulation mentioned in authentic traditional medicine text Sarasankshepaya under nasal diseases and used as a remedy for allergic rhinitis. It consists of 12 plant ingredients. Decoction preparations are widely used in Sri Lankan traditional system and considered effective and safe for treating many disorders. However. decoctions have to be used only in fresh state due to shorter shelf life and loss of stability. This decoction preparation method leads to decreasing the patient compliance and is also time consuming. Hence. the objective of the present study was to convert TD to consumer friendly novel dosage form. namely. freeze dried. spray dried. and traditional ganasara forms. Methodology. Therefore. we compared the phytochemical constituents and antioxidant activities of TD with its modified dosage forms. The chemical comparison of four dosage forms comprises phytochemical screening.

As family size and income are the most significant factors affecting the quantity of solid waste from household consumption. a study on the relationship among these is vital in the decision making on waste management strategies. Therefore. a study was conducted at Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat areas of Batticaloa district to find out the correlation among residential solid waste generation. family size and income. The household sector is one of the primary sources of solid wastes in the study area. This study covered 100 houses with different socioeconomic levels such as income level and family size. There were six components of solid waste; food waste. paper. polyethylene. plastic. glass and metal which were evaluated in this study.Present study revealed that residential solid waste generation showed nonsignificant positive correlation (r= 0.184. p> 0.05) with monthly income whereas significant positive correlation (r= 0.476. p< 0.01) was found with the family size. Based on monthly income. generation of food. paper. plastic and glass waste showed non-significant positive correlation while non-significant negative correlation was found with polyethylene waste. Further. residential waste generation such as food. paper. plastic and metal showed significant positive correlation with family size,True,sH9Z4y4AAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC,34,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muthucumaran_Sugirtharan/publication/260134474_IMPACT_OF_FAMILY_INCOME_AND_SIZE_ON_PER_CAPITA_SOLID_WASTE_GENERATION_A_CASE_STUDY_IN_MANMUNAI_NORTH_DIVISIONAL_SECRETARIAT_DIVISION_OF_BATTICALOA/links/0c96052fb520b2e4b6000000/IMPACT-OF-FAMILY-INCOME-AND-SIZE-ON-PER-CAPITA-SOLID-WASTE-GENERATION-A-CASE-STUDY-IN-MANMUNAI-NORTH-DIVISIONAL-SECRETARIAT-DIVISION-OF-BATTICALOA.pdf,4590852288733949699,/scholar?cites=4590852288733949699,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muthucumaran_Sugirtharan/publication/260134474_IMPACT_OF_FAMILY_INCOME_AND_SIZE_ON_PER_CAPITA_SOLID_WASTE_GENERATION_A_CASE_STUDY_IN_MANMUNAI_NORTH_DIVISIONAL_SECRETARIAT_DIVISION_OF_BATTICALOA/links/0c96052fb520b2e4b6000000/IMPACT-OF-FAMILY-INCOME-AND-SIZE-ON-PER-CAPITA-SOLID-WASTE-GENERATION-A-CASE-STUDY-IN-MANMUNAI-NORTH-DIVISIONAL-SECRETARIAT-DIVISION-OF-BATTICALOA.pdf,0,0,0

IgM-ELISA (Serion-Virion) and immunochromatography test (Leptocheck-WB) are two immunodiagnostic assays for leptospirosis. Their sensitivity. specificity and applicability in Sri Lanka have not been systematically evaluated.   Methods Clinically diagnosed leptospirosis patients (n = 919) were recruited from three hospitals in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. during June 2012 to December 2013. MAT. IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB were performed on all patient sera. MAT titer of ≥400 in single sample. four-fold rise or seroconversion ≥100 in paired samples were considered as positive for MAT. For diagnostic confirmation. MAT was performed during both acute and convalescent phases. Anti-leptospiral IgM ≥20 IU/ml and appearance of a band in the test window were considered as positive for IgM-ELISA and Leptocheck-WB test respectively. Patients with an alternative diagnosis (n = 31) were excluded.

The research base on leptospirosis is not as strong as other tropical infections such as malaria. However. it is a lethal infection that can attack many vital organs in its severe form. leading to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and death. There are many gaps in knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of leptospirosis and the role of host immunity in causing symptoms. This hinders essential steps in combating disease. such as developing a potential vaccine. Another major problem with leptospirosis is the lack of an easy to perform. accurate diagnostic tests. Many clinicians in resource limited settings resort to clinical judgment in diagnosing leptospirosis. This is unfortunate. as many other diseases such as dengue. hanta virus. rickettsial infections. and even severe bacterial sepsis. can mimic leptospirosis. Another interesting problem is the prediction of disease severity at the onset of the illness. The majority of patients recover from leptospirosis with only a mild febrile illness. while a few others have severe illness with multi-organ failure. Clinical features are poor predictors of potential severity of infection. and therefore the search is on for potential biomarkers that can serve as early warnings for severe disease.

Thus. the main aim of this study was to assess the damage to serum proteins and lipids. and their significance as biomarkers of oxidative stress in severe leptospirosis. In regions endemic for both leptospirosis and dengue. leptospirosis cases are often misdiagnosed as dengue during dengue epidemics.

Contamination by oil and oil products has caused serious harm. and increasing attention has been paid to the development and implementation of innovative technologies for the removal of these contaminants. Biosurfactants have been extensively used in the remediation of water and soil. as well as in the main stages of the oil production chain. such as extraction. transportation. and storage. This diversity of applications is mainly due to advantages such as biodegradability. low toxicity and better functionality under extreme conditions in comparison to synthetic counterparts. Moreover. biosurfactants can be obtained with the use of agro-industrial waste as substrate. which helps reduce overall production costs.

1085231,Organic-rich facies in the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian of the Lusitanian Basin. Portugal: Total Organic Carbon and relation to transgressive-regressive facies cycles,2010,Luís V Duarte and Ricardo L Silva and Luiz CV Oliveira and María José Comas-Rengifo and Francisco Silva,,,,,,The upper Sinemurian to Pliensbachian series of the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) correspond to marly limestone sediments rich in benthic and nektonic macrofauna. This sedimentary record includes several intervals of organicrich facies. which are particularly well developed in the western sectors of the basin. They correspond to grey and dark marls locally showing strong lamination (black shale type) and are recognized as one of the most important potential oil source rocks. This study shows the vertical and lateral distribution of these organic-rich intervals. supported by over 550 total organic carbon (TOC) determinations. The results presented reveal two important intervals. with several black shale occurrences. in the Oxynotum (?)–Raricostatum (Polvoeira Member of Água de Madeiros Formation) and at the top of the Ibex-upper part of Margaritatus zones (top of the Vale das Fontes Formation). showing in the distal (western) sectors up to 22% and 15% TOC. respectively. TOC values decrease progressively towards the proximal sectors. the youngest organic-rich interval being the most expressive at the basin scale. This lateral TOC distribution. the facies stacking patterns and the decrease observed in benthic macrofauna confirm that these intervals are related to 2nd-order transgressive phases. 2nd-order regressive phases. developed during the uppermost Raricostatum and Spinatum zones respectively. show lower TOC values. TOC distribution combined with other stratigraphic and sedimentological parameters enabled seven facies maps to be created for the time interval studied. At the regional scale. this study shows for the first time the …,True,e1w_Qj8AAAAJ:naSTrk-c4S8C,114,https://eg.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/20065/1/Duarte%20et%20al%202010.pdf,15760995566766838321,/scholar?cites=15760995566766838321,,https://eg.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/20065/1/Duarte%20et%20al%202010.pdf,0,0,0

Immunity to Phlebotomus papatasi or Lutzomyia longipalpis saliva or salivary components confers protection against an infection by Leishmania in the presence of the homologous saliva. However. immunization with Lutzomyia intermedia saliva did not protect mice against Leishmania braziliensis plus Lu. intermedia saliva. In the present study. we have studied whether the immunization with Lu. longipalpis saliva or a DNA plasmid coding for LJM19 salivary protein would be protective against L. braziliensis infection in the presence of Lu. intermedia saliva. the natural vector for L. braziliensis.   Methodology/Principal Findings Immunization with Lu. longipalpis saliva or with LJM19 DNA plasmid induced a Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) response against Lu. longipalpis as well as against a Lu. intermedia saliva challenge.

The device is based on the stable and selective cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNiR) from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. which has both high turnover and heterogeneous electron transfer rates. In opposition to previous efforts making use of several redox mediators. in this work we exploited the capacity of ccNiR to display a direct electrochemical response when interacting with pyrolytic graphite (PG) surfaces. To enable the analytical application of such bioelectrode the protein was successfully incorporated within a porous silica glass made by the sol–gel process. In the presence of nitrite. the ccNiR/sol–gel/PG electrode promptly displays catalytic currents indicating that the entrapped ccNiR molecules are reduced via direct electron transfer.

However. yield stimulants (viz. Ethephon) are to be applied to enhance the yield in each harvest as a compromise for the yield reduction due to less number of harvesting days. A system of harvesting the tree once in four days (S/2 d4) has recently been introduced and a weekly harvesting system (S/2 d7) is presently under investigation. In S/2 d4 and S/2 d7. the required doze of Ethephon has exactly not known and that would vary with the climatic condition. Therefore. the present study was aimed to identify the suitable concentrations of Ethephon required for S/2 d4 and S/2 d7 systems under two climatic regions. wet and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka.Ethephon was applied in four concentrations (ie 2%. 3%. 4% and 5%) and yield performance in each system was evaluated against that of the traditional harvesting systems of S/2 d2 (tapping the tree once in two days). In the Intermediate zone. S/2 d4 and S/2 d7 systems showed a yield increase of 7 and 14 grams per harvest per 1% increase in Ethephon concentration. respectively. In the Wet zone. respective increases were recorded as 4 and 7 grams.

1085321,Efficacy of insecticides used for rice leaffolder management on Sri Lanka,2001,L Nugaliyadde and T Hidaka and D Ahangama and S Wickremasinghe and K Jayatilake,,,,,Department of Agriculture: Peradeniya,It has been estimated that around 20% of Sri Lanka's annual rice area is damaged by leaffolders. against which approximately 30% of the insecticides used in rice are targeted. At present two organophospates.(chlorpyrifos and fenthion). a phenyl pyrazole (fipronil). two moult accelerating compounds (tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide). a chitin synthesis inhibitor (chlorfluzuron) and a botanical (azadirachtin) are recommended for the management of this pest. These insecticides were found to significantly reduce leaffolder larval populations in 7-days after treatment as compared to untreated control. However. in plots treated with organophospates leaffolder larval populations increased to significantly higher numbers in 4-weeks after treatment. Plots received no insecticides and those treated with tebufenozide. methoxyfenozide. chlorfluzuron and azadirachtin had significantly more spiders. LC50 values for the tested insecticides against leaffolder were determined approximately as chlorpyrifos (450). fenthion (870). fipronil (60). tebufenozide (220). methoxyfenozide (150).. chlorfluzuron (200) and azadirachtin (250). Chlorpyrifos and fenthion are highly toxic to aquatic fauna and less effective on leaffolders. Application of these insecticides found to cause resurgence of Brown planthopper and a potential danger of other pests becoming resistant to organophospate insecticides. These are in addition to the detrimental effects of these insecticides on the natural enemies and pollinators in particular and on the faunal diversity apart from the human health. In regulating the use of these insecticides to rice. considerations should be given to the large …,True,ZkQdCZ0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,http://doa.nsf.ac.lk/bitstream/handle/1/1981/ASDA-3-177.pdf?sequence=2,6663965164667071329,/scholar?cites=6663965164667071329,,http://doa.nsf.ac.lk/bitstream/handle/1/1981/ASDA-3-177.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

Spreng. leaf extract against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats,2020,Jayasinghe AN Sandamali and Ruwani P Hewawasam and Kamani APW Jayatilaka and Lakmini KB Mudduwa,2020,Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,,,Hindawi,Dose-dependent cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin may lead to irreversible congestive heart failure. Although multiple mechanisms are involved. generation of free radicals is the most commonly postulated mechanism. Therefore. free radical scavengers are considered as potential therapeutic agents. As Murraya koenigii leaves are a rich source of flavonoids and phenols. they have the ability to scavenge free radicals effectively. Therefore. the objective of this study was to investigate the cardioprotective potential of Murraya leaf extract against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Rats were randomly divided into five groups with 10 animals in each group. Doxorubicin was administered intraperitonially at 18 mg/kg while lyophilized plant extract was administered orally at 2 g/kg. Dexrazoxane. at 180 mg/kg. was used as the positive control. Cardiac damage of doxorubicin control was evident with a significant increase () in cardiac troponin I. NT-pro BNP. AST. and LDH compared to the normal control. Plant-treated group showed cardioprotective effect by significantly reducing (p < 0.05) all of the above parameters compared to doxorubicin control (). Increased oxidative stress in doxorubicin control was evident with a significant reduction in reduced glutathione. glutathione reductase. glutathione peroxidase. total antioxidant capacity. superoxide dismutase. and catalase activity and a significant increase in lipid peroxidation compared to the control. Interestingly. treatment with Murraya leaf extract showed a significant increase in all of the above antioxidant parameters and a significant reduction in lipid peroxidation by showing an antioxidant effect …,True,ZkQdCZ0AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,4,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2020/6023737/,9402150398280645202,/scholar?cites=9402150398280645202,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2020/6023737/,0,0,0

Ventricular arrhythmias are reportedly responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths and atrial fibrillation is responsible for 15% of all strokes in the USA. Recent evidence suggests a role for cholesterol in the development of these arrhythmias. In addition to its association with atherosclerotic plaques. high cholesterol has been shown to cause changes in membrane properties. including the function of hormone receptors. ion channels and pumps. These effects are mediated through direct interactions between cholesterol and the membrane proteins. through changes in membrane fluidity and/or an association with lipid rafts.

Parker hydrophilicity prediction. Emini surface accessibility prediction and Karplus & Schulz flexibility predictions were used to bioinformatically characterize antigenicity. The human antibody response to C protein was assessed by ELISA using immune sera and an array of overlapping DENV2 C peptides. DENV2 C protein peptides P1 (located on C protein at 2–18 a.a). P11 (79–95 a.a) and P12 (86–101 a.a) were recognized by most individuals exposed to infections with only one of the 4 DENV serotypes as well as people exposed to infections with two serotypes. These conserved peptide epitopes are located on the amino (1–40 a.a) and carboxy (70–100 a.a) terminal regions of C protein. which were predicted to be antigenic using different bioinformatic tools.

Ellipro. Bepipred and SVMTrip. Fifty sequences from each dengue serotype. representing a wide geographic area and a time span. were aligned using MEGA 6 software. The predictions were evaluated by comparing the results among the three tools and with currently available data on assay positive immunogenic epitopes of dengue NS1. A total of 22 regions on the NS1 protein ranging 6 to 21 amino acids in size were predicted as epitopes with a high probability score by the three prediction tools. Many were found to be predicted as epitopes by more than one tool. showing a good agreement in the predictions by the three tools. Further. many of the epitopes overlapped with. or partially constituted regions on the NS1 protein. which have been previously identified to be immunogenic as measured by various biochemical assays. Each of the 22 epitopes and the whole NS1 protein were then characterised for their percentages of conservation and phylogenetic relationship among and within each dengue serotypes. using IEDB and MEGA 6 analysis tools. Three epitopes were found to be highly conserved within the serotype but highly variable among the 04 dengue serotypes. suggesting that they could be used as possible serotype specific diagnostic marNers.

Sri Lanka,2015,MM Silva and SS Senevirathne and DK Weerakoon and CL Goonasekara,,Basic and Applied Sciences,,93,,The venom neutralizing ability of a herbal preparation used in traditional medicine was characterized. The preparation is known for successful treatment of Naja naja and Daboia russelii envenomation. particularly in the wet zone of the country. according to indigenous knowledge. The venom toxicity of Naja naja was evaluated using a 5-day-old chicken embryo model (n= 3). Preliminary venom neutralizing ability of the herbal preparation was investigated with application of Naja naja venom preincubated with the herbal preparation on the vitellinevein of the chick. for a period of 6 hours. Pre-incubation of venom with the herbal preparation prevented the appearance of pathophysiological symptoms in the embryo and the death within the 6 hours as compared to the control. where the venom was pre-incubated with saline water. The results indicated the ability of the herbal preparation to neutralize Naja naja venom toxin. The venom Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. a common toxin known to exist in snake venoms. was also evaluated by measuring the amount of sodium hydroxide required to neutralize fatty acids liberated from egg yolk lecithin within 30 min. In the presence of the herbal preparation. PLA2 activity of Naja naja venom was significantly reduced from 0.029 mMmin-1 to 0.018 mMmin-1. The herbal preparation was also shown to facilitate the blood coagulating toxicity of Naja naja venom.

Formulations made by plant materials have been used in traditional. complementary. and alternative medicine and remain widespread in both developing and developed countries. In developing countries. traditional medicines are widely practiced due to its accessibility and affordability. while in developed countries. complementary and alternative medicine are widely popular due to the adverse effects of chemical drugs. Tragia involucrata Linn. (family: Euphorbiaceae) is a highly used medicinal plant used in both Sri Lankan and Indian traditional medical systems. Since this plant is a weed. it is being extensively destroyed due to the lack of knowledge regarding the medicinal value of this plant. Hence. the objective of this study was to collect data on the medicinal value of this plant by correlating its scientifically validated biological activities with its ethnopharmacological uses. An attempt was made to gather as much information available regarding the ethnopharmacological uses and scientifically validated biological activities of Tragia involucrata through authentic traditional texts. scientific journals. and other authentic texts regarding medicinal plants. Thus. the review provides an insight to the capability of Tragia involucrata to be used as a monoherbal formulation for diseases pertaining to multiple systems of the body.

Malaria global elimination efforts will benefit from accurate and effective genotyping tools that will provide insight into the population genetics and diversity of this parasite. The recent sequencing of P. vivax isolates from South America. Africa. and Asia presents a new opportunity by uncovering thousands of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genotyping a selection of these SNPs provides a robust. low-cost method of identifying parasite infections through their unique genetic signature or barcode. Based on our experience in generating a SNP barcode for P. falciparum using High Resolution Melting (HRM). we have developed a similar tool for P. vivax. We selected globally polymorphic SNPs from available P. vivax genome sequence data that were located in putatively selectively neutral sites (i.e.. intergenic. intronic. or 4-fold degenerate coding). From these candidate SNPs we defined a barcode consisting of 42 SNPs. We analyzed the performance of the 42-SNP barcode on 87 P. vivax clinical samples from parasite populations in South America (Brazil. French Guiana). Africa (Ethiopia) and Asia (Sri Lanka). We found that the P. vivax barcode is robust. as it requires only a small quantity of DNA (limit of detection 0.3 ng/μl) to yield reproducible genotype calls. and detects polymorphic genotypes with high sensitivity.

Graded tea samples (BOP. BOPF and Dust No. 1) were organoleptically assessed and analyzed for chemical quality parameters such as theaflavins (TF) and thearubigins (TR). Results were statistically analyzed. Tasters' score results revealed that the blackness of Dust No. 1 was significantly low at 47% wither compared to 40%. However. there was no significant difference in blackness of BOP and BOPF grades at different degrees of wither. Overall quality of BOPF and Dust No. 1 was significantly low when the degree of wither was 36%. Further ungraded teas had significantly low TF content and significantly high TF: TR when the degree of wither reduced from 40% to 36%.

IκB kinase (IKK α/β) proteins. and TNFα and IL-6 expression was investigated in diethylnitrosamine- (DEN-) induced C3H mice-bearing early hepatocarcinogenic changes. Acute phase inflammatory response was evaluated by carrageenan-induced rat paw edema formation. Anti-inflammatory mechanisms were also assessed by determining effect on (a) membrane stabilization. (b) nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity. and (c) inhibition of leukocyte migration. A significant inhibition of the paw edema formation was observed in healthy rats as well as in rats bearing early hepatocarcinogenic changes with oral administration of the decoction. As with the positive control. indomethacin (10 mg/kg b.w.) the inhibitory effect was pronounced at 3rd and 4th h after carrageenan injection. A notable IKK α/β mediated hepatic NF-κB inactivation was associated with a significant hepatic TNFα downregulation among mice-bearing hepatocarcinogenic changes subjected to decoction treatment. Inhibition of NO production. leukocyte migration. and membrane stabilization are possible mechanisms by which anti-inflammatory effect is mediated by the decoction.

As with the positive control. indomethacin (10 mg/kg bw) the inhibitory effect was pronounced at 3rd and 4th h after carrageenan injection. A notable IKK α/β mediated hepatic NF-κB inactivation was associated with a significant hepatic TNFα downregulation among mice-bearing hepatocarcinogenic changes subjected to decoction treatment. Inhibition of NO production. leukocyte migration. and membrane stabilization are possible mechanisms by which anti-inflammatory effect is mediated by the decoction.

The extract caused a concentration-related impairment of percentage sperm motility; with the EC 50 concentration being 2.29 mg ml. This effect on motility was essentially irreversible. With the highest concentration tested (20.0 mg ml). the onset of the antimotility action was almost immediate. In addition. this concentration impaired the functional integrity of the plasma membrane (hypoosmotic swelling test) and viability (nigrosin-eosin stain) of spermatozoa. In contrast. with a lower concentration (5.0 mg ml). such effects were not evident. It is concluded that at the lower concentrations the antimotility action may result from a rise in intracellular calcium (not via influx) and/or a decline in cAMP content and/or enhanced generation of a reactive oxygen species.,True,p_K7jQwAAAAJ:FGHlONkF9GcC,71,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037887419190166B,15201973916021899969,/scholar?cites=15201973916021899969,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45704463/Sperm_antimotility_properties_of_a_seed_20160517-25647-z2xwbc.pdf,0,0,0

Plastic deformations are governed by the relaxation time of tangential stresses. Compared with alternative Eulerian conservative models. the governing system consists of fewer equations overall.
