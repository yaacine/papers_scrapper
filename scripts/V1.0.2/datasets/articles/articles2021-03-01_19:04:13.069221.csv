Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology,We hypothesized that in participants with a history of hypertension. lower late-life blood pressure (BP) will be associated with more brain pathology.Participants are 4.057 older men and women without dementia with midlife (mean age 50 ± 6 years) and late-life (mean age 76 ± 5 years) vascular screening. cognitive function. and brain structures on MRI ascertained as part of the Age. Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)–Reykjavik Study.The association of late-life BP to brain measures depended on midlife hypertension history. Higher late-life systolic and diastolic BP (DBP) was associated with an increased risk of white matter lesions and cerebral microbleeds. and this was most pronounced in participants without a history of midlife hypertension.

A substantial proportion of individuals with diabetes will develop kidney disease owing to their disease and/or other co-morbidity. including hypertension and ageing-related nephron loss.

We have investigated the meaning of Tp-Te and its diagnostic potential.We used a digital model of the left ventricular wall to simulate the effect of varying action potential durations on the timing of Tp and Te. Furthermore. we used the vectorcardiogram to explain the relationships between Tp locations in the precordial electrocardiogram leads.Prolongation or ischemic shortening of action potentials in our model did not result in substantial Tp shifts.

Organophosphate-hydrolysing enzyme in cardiovascular medicine. tunnel of the enzyme are two calcium atoms needed for the stabilisation of the structure and the catalytic activity. 11 Three α helices. located at the top of the propeller. are involved in the anchoring to the HDL particle. 11 The clarification of the crystal structure led to more understanding of the catalytic mechanisms underlying PON1’s wide substrate range. Furthermore. the crystal structure gave more information about the binding and orientation of PON1 to the HDL particle. revealing that the active site of the enzyme was directed towards the surface of the HDL particle. 11Since the compounds that can be hydrolysed by PON1. eg organophosphates (paraoxon and diazoxon). warfare agents (soman and sarin) and aromatic esters (phenyl acetate) are nonphysiological substrates. 12 these activities are not likely to be the physiological functions of PON1. Recent investigations have suggested that the hydrolytic activity towards lactones (cyclic esters) is the native activity of PON1: structure-activity studies show that lactones are PON1’s preferred substrate for hydrolysis. 13 In addition. all members of the PON family have lactonase activity. implying that this activity has been conserved throughout the evolution of the enzyme. 14 In vivo. there is a wide inter-individual variation in PON1 concentration and activity. This variation is for a major part determined by common genetic variants (polymorphisms) in the PON1 gene.

METHODS: Plasma homocysteine and MTHFR polymorphism were determined in a retrospective cohort of 175 patients with SLE. Associations between homocysteine levels and antiphospholipid antibodies. renal function. and drug therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with arterial thrombosis had higher homocysteine concentration than nonthrombotic patients (20.6+/-10.2 vs 13.2+/-6.8 micromol/l; p< 0.001). The crude odds ratio for arterial thrombosis for the highest versus lowest quartile of homocysteine was 4.4 (95% CI 1.3-14.9). After adjustment for other risk factors the odds ratio remained significant (3.7; 95% CI 1.2-13.0). Increased plasma homocysteine was not associated with venous thrombosis. A significant correlation was found between homocysteine and creatinine (r= 0.57. p< 0.0001) or the use of methotrexate. Homocysteine levels were higher in patients using corticosteroids and lower in patients using oral contraceptive drugs. This finding may be biased by impaired renal function in patients using corticosteroids and the advice to stop estrogen-containing contraceptives in female patients upon an episode of thrombosis.

Here. we present a reversed releasate proteomics approach to determine unambiguously and quantitatively proteins released from activated platelets.Isolated platelets were mock and fully stimulated after which the released proteins in the supernatant were removed. Using high-end proteomics technology (2D chromatography. stable isotope labeling. electron transfer dissociation. and high collision dissociation fragmentation) allowed us to quantitatively discriminate the released proteins from uncontrolled lysis products.

The factor V Leiden mutation is an important risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Whether this mutation also predisposes patients fitted with a central venous catheter to subclavian vein thrombosis is not known. The occurrence of central venous catheter‐associated thrombosis was investigated in 277 consecutive patients receiving an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. All patients received a tunnelled double or triple catheter positioned in the subclavian vein. Catheter‐associated thrombosis was diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs of thrombosis. i.e. swelling and/or redness of the limb or venous engorgement and was confirmed with a colour‐flow Doppler ultrasound.

While several of their components. like caffeine. have strong pharmacological effects. the effect on the unborn fetus remains unclear. Caffeine intake has been associated with abortion. preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. but a general consensus on caffeine restriction is still lacking. We aimed to investigate antenatal coffee. tea and caffeine consumption and the effect on birth weight and length. gestational age at birth and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.   Methods A total of 936 healthy pregnancies from the WHISTLER birth cohort with data on coffee and tea consumption were included. Maternal and child characteristics as well as antenatal coffee and tea consumption were obtained through postpartum questionnaires. Reported consumption was validated using available preconceptional data. Caffeine intake was calculated from coffee and tea consumption. Linear and logistic regression was used to assess the association with birth outcome and hypertensive disorders.   Results After adjustment for smoking and maternal age. a daily consumption of more than 300mg of caffeine compared to less than 100mg of caffeine was significantly associated with an increased gestational age (linear regression coefficient = 2.00 days. 95%CI = 0.12–4.21.

Reducing maternal morbidity and mortality demands optimizing quality of care. Criteria-based audits are a tool to define. assess and improve quality of care. The aim of this study was to determine applicability of a criteria-based audit to assess quality of care delivered to women with severe hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. and to assess adherence to protocols and quality of care provided at a regional hospital in Accra. Ghana.   Methods Checklists for management of severe preeclampsia. hypertensive emergency and eclampsia were developed in an audit cycle based on nine existing key clinical care protocols. Fifty cases were audited to assess quality of care. defined as adherence to protocols. Analysis was stratified for complicated cases. defined as (imminent) eclampsia. perinatal mortality and/or one or more WHO maternal near miss C-criteria.

In contrast to high-resource settings. almost 50% of stillbirths occur intrapartum. The aim of this study was to synthesise available evidence of strategies for foetal surveillance in low-resource settings and associated neonatal and maternal outcomes. including barriers to their implementation.   Methods and findings The review was registered with Prospero (CRD42016038679). Five databases were searched up to May 1st. 2016 for studies related to intrapartum foetal monitoring strategies and neonatal outcomes in low-resource settings. Two authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. The outcomes were narratively synthesised. Strengths. weaknesses. opportunities and threats analysis (SWOT) was conducted for each monitoring technique to analyse their implementation. There were 37 studies included: five intervention and 32 observational studies. Use of the partograph improved perinatal outcomes. Intermittent auscultation with Pinard was associated with lowest rates of caesarean sections (10–15%) but with comparable perinatal outcomes to hand-held Doppler and Cardiotocography (CTG). CTG was associated with the highest rates of caesarean sections (28–34%) without proven benefits for perinatal outcome. Several tests on admission (admission tests) and adjunctive tests including foetal stimulation tests improved the accuracy of foetal heart rate monitoring in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes.

Cham,                 This empirical chapter provides a systematic review of literature relevant to the inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials. In particular. it addresses barriers to fair inclusion identified within the literature. The 31 articles reviewed discuss the exclusion of pregnant women from clinical trials. Reasons given for such exclusion were grouped under several themes. including: foetal safety. collective memory or social controversies. liability. regulations. research ethics committee interpretations. research design. willingness to participate and consent. The discussion reviews arguments in the literature for how many of these barriers to fair inclusion can be surmounted.

In this series. we integrate the theoretical design options with the practice of conducting pragmatic trials. For most new market-approved treatments. the clinical evidence is insufficient to fully guide physicians and policy makers in choosing the optimal treatment for their patients. Pragmatic trials can fill this gap. by providing evidence on the relative effectiveness of a treatment strategy in routine clinical practice. already in an early phase of development. while maintaining the strength of randomized controlled trials. Selecting the setting. study population. mode of intervention. comparator. and outcome are crucial in designing pragmatic trials. In combination with monitoring and data collection that does not change routine care. this will enable appropriate generalization to the target patient group in clinical practice.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of CAP and in 10% the infection may be fatal. Although the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (23vPs) is considered effective in the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in the elderly population. the evidence is mainly from nonrandomised observational studies and effects on the occurrence of pneumonia have not been demonstrated. Conjugated pneumococcal vaccines which also stimulate T-cell dependent immune responses induced antibody responses in elderly persons which are similar to those induced by a primary series of 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (7vPnC) in infants. and the response appeared similar or superior for all vaccine serotypes to that induced by 23vPs. The primary objective of the planned trial entitled CAPiTA (Community Acquired Pneumonia immunization Trial in Adults) is to establish the efficacy of a 13-valent PnC vaccine in the prevention of a first episode of vaccine-serotype specific pneumococcal CAP in 85.000 community-dwelling adult persons aged 65 years and older.

In the absence of phase 3 trials using clinical end points. notably post-influenza complications. alternative non-experimental designs to evaluate vaccine effects or safety are often used. The application of these designs may. however. lead to invalid estimates of vaccine effectiveness or safety. As patients with poor prognosis are more likely to be immunised. selection for vaccination is confounded by patient factors that are also related to clinical end points. This paper describes several design and analytical methods aimed at limiting or preventing this confounding by indication in non-experimental studies.

Although protective effects of this intervention for nursing home patients have been demonstrated in some clinical trials. the exact relationship between increased vaccine uptake among HCWs and protection of patients remains unknown owing to variations between study designs. settings. intensity of influenza seasons. and failure to control all effect modifiers. Therefore. we use a mathematical model to estimate the effects of HCW vaccination in different scenarios and to identify a herd immunity threshold in a nursing home department.   Methods and Findings We use a stochastic individual-based model with discrete time intervals to simulate influenza virus transmission in a 30-bed long-term care nursing home department. We simulate different levels of HCW vaccine uptake and study the effect on influenza virus attack rates among patients for different institutional and seasonal scenarios. Our model reveals a robust linear relationship between the number of HCWs vaccinated and the expected number of influenza virus infections among patients. In a realistic scenario. approximately 60% of influenza virus infections among patients can be prevented when the HCW vaccination rate increases from 0 to 1. A threshold for herd immunity is not detected. Due to stochastic variations. the differences in patient attack rates between departments are high and large outbreaks can occur for every level of HCW vaccine uptake.

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices. and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions. which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.,True,d27Ji6kAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,38668,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/286/5439/509.abstract,10638755925462666384,/scholar?cites=10638755925462666384,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9910332.pdf%3Forigin%3Dpublication_detail,0,0,0

This unregulated growth leads to a huge and complex web. which becomes a large directed graph whose vertices are documents and whose edges are links (URLs) that point from one document to another. The topology of this graph determines the web's connectivity and consequently how effectively we can locate information on it.

For example. relatively simple organisms grow. persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions. an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network 1. Complex communication networks 2 display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction. local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components.

We model the power grid using its actual topology and plausible assumptions about the load and overload of transmission substations. Our results indicate that the  loss of a single substation can result in up to  loss of transmission efficiency by triggering  an overload cascade in the network. The actual transmission loss depends on the overload tolerance of the network and the connectivity of the  failed substation.  We systematically study the damage inflicted by the loss of single nodes.  and find three universal behaviors. suggesting that  of the transmission  substations lead to cascading failures when disrupted.

1097789,Predicting essential components of signal transduction networks: a dynamic model of guard cell abscisic acid signaling,2006,Song Li and Sarah M Assmann and Réka Albert,4,,10,e312,Public Library of Science,Plants both lose water and take in carbon dioxide through microscopic stomatal pores. each of which is regulated by a surrounding pair of guard cells. During drought. the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits stomatal opening and promotes stomatal closure. thereby promoting water conservation. Dozens of cellular components have been identified to function in ABA regulation of guard cell volume and thus of stomatal aperture. but a dynamic description is still not available for this complex process. Here we synthesize experimental results into a consistent guard cell signal transduction network for ABA-induced stomatal closure. and develop a dynamic model of this process. Our model captures the regulation of more than 40 identified network components. and accords well with previous experimental results at both the pathway and whole-cell physiological level. By simulating gene disruptions and pharmacological interventions we find that the network is robust against a significant fraction of possible perturbations. Our analysis reveals the novel predictions that the disruption of membrane depolarizability. anion efflux. actin cytoskeleton reorganization. cytosolic pH increase. the phosphatidic acid pathway. or K+ efflux through slowly activating K+ channels at the plasma membrane lead to the strongest reduction in ABA responsiveness. Initial experimental analysis assessing ABA-induced stomatal closure in the presence of cytosolic pH clamp imposed by the weak acid butyrate is consistent with model prediction. Simulations of stomatal response as derived from our model provide an efficient tool for the identification of candidate …,True,d27Ji6kAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,454,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040312,13600486769780752201,/scholar?cites=13600486769780752201,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040312,0,0,0

Theoretical studies often describe these interactions using continuous. stochastic. or logical approaches. We propose a new modeling framework for gene regulatory networks. that combines the intuitive appeal of a qualitative description of gene states with a high flexibility in incorporating stochasticity in the duration of cellular processes. We apply our methods to the regulatory network of the segment polarity genes. thus gaining novel insights into the development of gene expression patterns.

Within the theoretical models Boolean networks occupy an increasing role as they are eminently suited at mapping biological observations and hypotheses into a mathematical formalism. The conceptual underpinnings of Boolean modeling are very accessible even without a background in quantitative sciences. yet it allows life scientists to describe and explore a wide range of surprisingly complex phenomena. In this paper we provide a clear overview of the concepts used in Boolean simulations. present a software library that can perform these simulations based on simple text inputs and give three case studies.

The theory they present. however. is inconsistent with empirically observed properties of the Web link structure. Barabási and Albert write that because “of the preferential attachment. a vertex that acquires more connections than another one will increase its connectivity at a higher rate; thus. an initial difference in the connectivity between two vertices will increase further as the network grows.... Thus older... vertices increase their connectivity at the expense of the younger... ones. leading over time to some vertices that are highly connected. a ‘rich-get-richer’phenomenon”[figure 2C of (1)]. It is this prediction of the Barabási-Albert (BA) model. however. that renders it unable to account for the power-law distribution of links in the WWW [figure 1B of (1)]. We studied a crawl of 260.000 sites. each one representing a separate domain name. We counted how many links the sites received from other sites. and found that the distribution of links followed a power law (Fig. 1A). Next. we queried the InterNIC database (using the WHOIS search tool at www. networksolutions. com) for the date on which the site was originally registered. Whereas the BA model predicts that older sites have more time to acquire links and gather links at a faster rate than newer sites. the results of our search (Fig. 1B) suggest no correlation between the age of a site and its number of links.The absence of correlation between age and the number of links is hardly …,True,-Jhj6swAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,1392,https://www.academia.edu/download/53506232/Power-Law_Distribution_of_the_World_Wide20170614-2918-1yvwkwf.pdf,12603588357175591075,/scholar?cites=12603588357175591075,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53506232/Power-Law_Distribution_of_the_World_Wide20170614-2918-1yvwkwf.pdf,0,0,0

Measurements on four networks. namely the science citation network. Internet. actor collaboration and science coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links depends on the node's degree. offering direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment.

To investigate the mechanism of Bcl-2's effect. we examined whether Bcl-2 interacted with other proteins. We identified an associated 21 kd protein partner. Bax. that has extensive amino acid homology with Bcl-2. focused within highly conserved domains I and II. Bax is encoded by six exons and demonstrates a complex pattern of alternative RNA splicing that predicts a 21 kd membrane (α) and two forms of cytosolic protein (β and γ).

The importance of both positive and negative regulators of cell growth has been well documented in neoplasia. Bcl-2 argues for the existence of a new category of oncogenes. regulators of cell death. The bcl-2 gene was identified at the chromosomal breakpoint of t (14; 18) bearing B cell lymphomas. Bcl-2 has proved to be unique among protooncogenes in blocking programmed cell death rather than promoting proliferation. In adults. bcl-2 is topographically restricted to progenitor cells and longlived cells but is much more widespread in the developing embryo. Transgenic mice that overexpress bcl-2 in the B cell lineage demonstrate extended cell survival. and progress to high grade lymphomas.

We also demonstrate the inherent existence of two distinct classes of subgraphs. and show that. in contrast to the low-density type II subgraphs. the highly abundant type I subgraphs cannot exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters.

1097847,Catabolic efficiency of aerobic glycolysis: the Warburg effect revisited,2010,Alexei Vazquez and Jiangxia Liu and Yi Zhou and Zoltán N Oltvai,4,BMC systems biology,1,1-9,BioMed Central,Cancer cells simultaneously exhibit glycolysis with lactate secretion and mitochondrial respiration even in the presence of oxygen. a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. The maintenance of this mixed metabolic phenotype is seemingly counterintuitive given that aerobic glycolysis is far less efficient in terms of ATP yield per moles of glucose than mitochondrial respiration. Here. we resolve this apparent contradiction by expanding the notion of metabolic efficiency. We study a reduced flux balance model of ATP production that is constrained by the glucose uptake capacity and by the solvent capacity of the cell's cytoplasm. the latter quantifying the maximum amount of macromolecules that can occupy the intracellular space. At low glucose uptake rates we find that mitochondrial respiration is indeed the most efficient pathway for ATP generation. Above a threshold glucose uptake rate. however. a gradual activation of aerobic glycolysis and slight decrease of mitochondrial respiration results in the highest rate of ATP production. Our analyses indicate that the Warburg effect is a favorable catabolic state for all rapidly proliferating mammalian cells with high glucose uptake capacity. It arises because while aerobic glycolysis is less efficient than mitochondrial respiration in terms of ATP yield per glucose uptake. it is more efficient in terms of the required solvent capacity.

However. the interaction of such motifs with each other. and their form of integration into the full network has not been previously examined. By studying the transcriptional regulatory network of the bacterium. Escherichia coli. we demonstrate that the two previously identified motif types in the network (i.e.. feed-forward loops and bi-fan motifs) do not exist in isolation. but rather aggregate into homologous motif clusters that largely overlap with known biological functions. Moreover. these clusters further coalesce into a supercluster. thus establishing distinct topological hierarchies that show global statistical properties similar to the whole network. Targeted removal of motif links disintegrates the network into small. isolated clusters. while random disruptions of equal number of links do not cause such an effect. Individual motifs aggregate into homologous motif clusters and a supercluster forming the backbone of the E. coli transcriptional regulatory network and play a central role in defining its global topological organization.,True,tDSnpO4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,262,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-10,1458849596692787521,/scholar?cites=1458849596692787521,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-10,0,0,0

It contains a COOH-terminal signal anchor sequence that is selective for import and insertion of Bcl-2 into the mitochondrial outer membrane and. by a different mechanism. can also direct the protein to other membrane sites. Deletion of the signal anchor sequence rendered Bcl-2 cytosolic and impaired its ability to prevent apoptotic death of human KB cells infected with a mutant form of adenovirus type 5 that does not make E1B 19-kDa protein.

Here. we use flux-balance analysis to thoroughly assess the activity of Escherichia coli. Helicobacter pylori. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism in 30.000 diverse simulated environments. We identify a set of metabolic reactions forming a connected metabolic core that carry non-zero fluxes under all growth conditions. and whose flux variations are highly correlated. Furthermore. we find that the enzymes catalyzing the core reactions display a considerably higher fraction of phenotypic essentiality and evolutionary conservation than those catalyzing noncore reactions.

The exponents nu and nu'describing. respectively. the divergence of the radius and the active zone of the Eden clusters on percolation networks appear to be the same within the statistical errors.

1097863,Simulation of pedestrian crowds in normal and evacuation situations,2002,Dirk Helbing and Illes J Farkas and Peter Molnar and Tamás Vicsek,21,Pedestrian and evacuation dynamics,2,21-58,Springer,Starting with a short review of the available literature in the field of pedestrian and evacuation research. an overview is given over the observed collective phenomena in pedestrian crowds. This includes lane formation in corridors and oscillations at bottlenecks in normal situations. while different kinds of blocked states are produced in panic situations. By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics. the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches. this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations. the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the “rational” normal behavior and the apparently “irrational” panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter. the “nervousness”. which influences fluctuation strengths. desired speeds. and the tendency of herding. Thereby. it causes paradoxial effects like “freezing by heating”.“faster is slower”. and the ignorance of available exits. Nevertheless. there are measures to improve pedestrian flows. both in normal and panic situations. For example. the suitable placement of columns can help. although they reduce the accessible space.,True,s8jTkkAAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1087,https://www.academia.edu/download/50782098/Simulation_of_pedestrian_crowds_in_norma20161208-29424-sliu52.pdf,8040255829365123031,/scholar?cites=8040255829365123031,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50782098/Simulation_of_pedestrian_crowds_in_norma20161208-29424-sliu52.pdf,0,0,0

1097864,Dynamics of fractal surfaces,1991,Fereydoon Family and Tam s Vicsek,,,,,World Scientific,In the last few years there has been an explosion of activity in the field of the dynamics of fractal surfaces. which. through the convergence of important new results from computer simulations. analytical theories and experiments. has led to significant advances in our understanding of nonequilibrium surface growth phenomena. This interest in surface growth phenomena has been motivated largely by the fact that a wide variety of natural and industrial processes lead to the formation of rough surfaces and interfaces. This book presents these developments in a single volume by bringing together the works containing the most important results in the field. The material is divided into chapters consisting of reprints related to a single major topic. Each chapter has a general introduction to a particular aspect of growing fractal surfaces. These introductory parts are included in order to provide a scientific background to the papers reproduced in the main part of the chapters. They are written in a pedagogical style and contain only the most essential information. The contents of the reprints are made more accessible to the reader as they are preceded by a short description of what the editors find to be the most significant results in the paper.,True,s8jTkkAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1044,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-rHqHnwwVyYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:CybaX927mGIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=zIoj50Mzfn&sig=V3XaHPMZou8E5-sfwWa_e_SqEMQ,7104634971647256075,/scholar?cites=7104634971647256075,,,0,0,0

In a protein assocation network modules appear as groups of densely interconnected nodes. also called communities or clusters. These modules often overlap with each other and form a network of their own. in which nodes (links) represent the modules (overlaps). We introduce CFinder. a fast program locating and visualizing overlapping. densely interconnected groups of nodes in undirected graphs. and allowing the user to easily navigate between the original graph and the web of these groups. We show that in gene (protein) association networks CFinder can be used to predict the function(s) of a single protein and to discover novel modules.

To do so. they have developed sophisticated modes of cooperative behaviour 3–10. It has been found that such behaviour can cause bacterial colonies to exhibit complex growth patterns similar to those observed during non-equilibrium growth processes in non-living systems 11; some of the qualitative features of the latter may be invoked to account for the complex patterns of bacterial growth 12–18. Here we show that a simple model of bacterial growth can reproduce the salient features of the observed growth patterns. The model incorporates random walkers. representing aggregates of bacteria. which move in response to gradients in nutrient concentration and communicate with each other by means of chemotactic'feedback'.

1097870,Clique percolation in random networks,2005,Imre Derényi and Gergely Palla and Tamás Vicsek,94,Physical review letters,16,160202,American Physical Society,The notion of k-clique percolation in random graphs is introduced. where k is the size of the complete subgraphs whose large scale organizations are analytically and numerically investigated. For the Erdős-Rényi graph of N vertices we obtain that the percolation transition of k-cliques takes place when the probability of two vertices being connected by an edge reaches the threshold p c (k)=[(k− 1) N]− 1/(k− 1). At the transition point the scaling of the giant component with N is highly nontrivial and depends on k.

Networks have constantly been in the focus of research for the past decade. with considerable advances in the description of their structural and dynamical properties. However. much less effort has been devoted to studying the controllability of the dynamics taking place on them. Here we introduce and evaluate a dynamical process defined on the edges of a network. and demonstrate that the controllability properties of this process significantly differ from simple nodal dynamics.

The authors illustrate the scaling concepts used in probability theory. critical phenomena. and fully developed turbulent fluids. These concepts are then applied to financial time series. The authors also present a stochastic model that displays several of the statistical properties observed in empirical data. Statistical physics concepts such as stochastic dynamics. short-and long-range correlations. self-similarity and scaling permit an understanding of the global behaviour of economic systems without first having to work out a detailed microscopic description of the system. Physicists will find the application of statistical physics concepts to economic systems interesting. Economists and workers in the financial world will find useful the presentation of empirical analysis methods and well-formulated theoretical tools that might help describe systems composed of a huge number of interacting subsystems.,True,1fatN9EAAAAJ:ZxXHo_Hcam8C,5082,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SzgXWCS7Nr8C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:J45cLZD6_6sJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9Hh8D7knVF&sig=1LdfcoQkZ7MOoW9daHXKuw5bEKk,12393900196690169383,/scholar?cites=12393900196690169383,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/H_Stanley/publication/235361270_An_Introduction_to_Econophysics_Correlations_and_Complexity_in_Finance/links/544a76ad0cf2d6347f400e01.pdf,0,0,0

We address the question of whether such correlations may be a trivial consequence of the known mosaic structure (‘‘patchiness’’) of DNA. We analyze two classes of controls consisting of patchy nucleotide sequences generated by different algorithms—one without and one with long-range power-law correlations. Although both types of sequences are highly heterogeneous. they are quantitatively distinguishable by new fluctuation analysis method that differentiates local patchiness from long-range correlations. Application of this analysis to selected DNA sequences demonstrates that patchiness is not sufficient to account for long-range correlation properties.,True,1fatN9EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,4763,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.49.1685,14976518963498805615,/scholar?cites=14976518963498805615,,https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.49.1685,0,0,0

By analyzing several examples we show that the new method can reliably determine the multifractal scaling behavior of time series. By comparing the multifractal DFA results for original series with those for shuffled series we can distinguish multifractality due to long-range correlations from multifractality due to a broad probability density function.

These are calculated in the first Born approximation. and explicit expressions are given for surfaces whose roughness can be described as self-affine over finite length scales. Expressions are also given for scattering from liquid surfaces. where it is shown that ‘‘specular’’reflections only exist by virtue of a finite length cutoff to the mean-square height fluctuations. Expressions are also given for the scattering from randomly oriented surfaces. as studied in a typical small-angle scattering experiment.

We propose here a method for studying the stochastic properties of nucleotide sequences by constructing a 1: 1 map of the nucleotide sequence onto a walk. which we term a'DNA walk'. We then use the mapping to provide a quantitative measure of the correlation between nucleotides over long distances along the DNA chain. Thus we uncover in the nucleotide sequence a remarkably long-range power law correlation that implies a new scale-invariant property of DNA. We find such long-range correlations in intron-containing genes and in nontranscribed regulatory DNA sequences. but not in complementary DNA sequences or intron-less genes.,True,1fatN9EAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1611,https://www.nature.com/articles/356168a0,13515548007991570398,/scholar?cites=13515548007991570398,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32570654/Long-Range_Correlations_in_Nucleotide_Sequences_Nature_356__168-171_(1992)._PDF__--_Accompanied_by_News___Views_editorial_(in_a_subseque.pdf,0,0,0

It is often assumed in foraging theory that the flight lengths of a forager have a characteristic scale: from this assumption gaussian. Rayleigh and other classical distributions with well-defined variances have arisen. However. such theories cannot explain the long-tailed power-law distributions 1. 2 of flight lengths or flight times 3. 4. 5. 6 that are observed experimentally. Here we study how the search efficiency depends on the probability distribution of flight lengths taken by a forager that can detect target sites only in its limited vicinity.

Joseph Ford quoting Tolstoy (Gleick. 1987) We are used to thinking that natural objects have a certain form and that this form is determined by a characteristic scale. If we magnify the object beyond this scale. no new features are revealed. To correctly measure the properties of the object. such as length. area. or volume. we measure it at a resolution finer than the characteristic scale of the object. We expect that the value we measure has a unique value for the object. This simple idea is the basis of the calculus. Euclidean geometry. and the theory of measurement. However. Mandelbrot (1977. 1983) brought to the world's attention that many natural objects simply do not have this preconceived form. Many of the structures in space and processes in time of living things have a very different form. Living things have structures in space and fluctuations in time that cannot be characterized by one spatial or temporal scale.

Many noisy signals in real systems display trends. so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically study the effects of three types of trends—linear. periodic. and power-law trends. and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend. and study how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior. We find that crossovers result from the competition between the scaling of the noise and the “apparent” scaling of the trend.

We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can. compared to their static counterparts. reach controllability faster. demand orders of magnitude less control energy. and have control trajectories. that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks.

We find that clustering and modularity have no discernible impact. but the symmetries of the underlying matching problem can produce linear. quadratic or no dependence on degree correlation coefficients. depending on the nature of the underlying correlations. The results are supported by numerical simulations and help narrow the observed gap between the predicted and the observed number of driver nodes in real networks.,True,84FUioAAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,178,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01067,5180927503481704116,/scholar?cites=5180927503481704116,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01067,0,0,0

Here. we characterize the structural controllability of a large directed human PPI network comprising 6.339 proteins and 34.813 interactions. This network allows us to classify proteins as “indispensable.” “neutral.” or “dispensable.” which correlates to increasing. no effect. or decreasing the number of driver nodes in the network upon removal of that protein. We find that 21% of the proteins in the PPI network are indispensable.

However. existing methods require assuming a particular population dynamics model. which is not known a priori. Moreover. those methods require fitting longitudinal abundance data. which are often not informative enough for reliable inference. To overcome these limitations. here we develop a new method based on steady-state abundance data. Our method can infer the network topology and inter-taxa interaction types without assuming any particular population dynamics model. Additionally. when the population dynamics is assumed to follow the classic Generalized Lotka–Volterra model. our method can infer the inter-taxa interaction strengths and intrinsic growth rates.

1097920,Prospect theory for online financial trading,2014,Yang-Yu Liu and Jose C Nacher and Tomoshiro Ochiai and Mauro Martino and Yaniv Altshuler,9,PLOS ONE,10,e109458,Public Library of Science,Prospect theory is widely viewed as the best available descriptive model of how people evaluate risk in experimental settings. According to prospect theory. people are typically risk-averse with respect to gains and risk-seeking with respect to losses. known as the “reflection effect”. People are much more sensitive to losses than to gains of the same magnitude. a phenomenon called “loss aversion”. Despite of the fact that prospect theory has been well developed in behavioral economics at the theoretical level. there exist very few large-scale empirical studies and most of the previous studies have been undertaken with micro-panel data. Here we analyze over 28.5 million trades made by 81.3 thousand traders of an online financial trading community over 28 months. aiming to explore the large-scale empirical aspect of prospect theory. By analyzing and comparing the behavior of winning and losing trades and traders. we find clear evidence of the reflection effect and the loss aversion phenomenon. which are essential in prospect theory. This work hence demonstrates an unprecedented large-scale empirical evidence of prospect theory. which has immediate implication in financial trading. e.g.. developing new trading strategies by minimizing the impact of the reflection effect and the loss aversion phenomenon. Moreover. we introduce three novel behavioral metrics to differentiate winning and losing traders based on their historical trading behavior. This offers us potential opportunities to augment online social trading where traders are allowed to watch and follow the trading activities of others. by predicting potential winners based on their …,True,84FUioAAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC,85,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109458,2207415032985172476,/scholar?cites=2207415032985172476,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109458,0,0,0

Despite recent advances in studying the impact of network topology on controllability. a comprehensive understanding of the synergistic effect of network topology and individual dynamics on controllability is still lacking. Here we offer a theoretical study with particular interest in the diversity of dynamic units characterized by different types of individual dynamics. Interestingly. we find a global symmetry accounting for the invariance of controllability with respect to exchanging the densities of any two different types of dynamic units. irrespective of the network topology. The highest controllability arises at the global symmetry point. at which different types of dynamic units are of the same density. The lowest controllability occurs when all self-loops are either completely absent or present with identical weights.

Those nodes play key roles in ensuring connectivity of many real-world networks. from infrastructure networks to protein interaction networks and terrorist communication networks.

Here we develop analytical tools to study key issues pertinent to articulation points. such as the expected number of them and the network vulnerability against their removal. in an arbitrary complex network. We find that a greedy articulation point removal process provides us a different perspective on the organizational principles of complex networks.

However. in UHMM. only the calculated FRET trajectory is analyzed. On the basis of the analysis of both synthetic and experimental data. we find that. if the noise in the signal is described with a proper probability distribution. MHMM generally outperforms UHMM.

Here. we rigorously derive the necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix.

Despite this potential. the existence of community types and the degree of their distinctness have been highly debated. Here we adopted a dynamic systems approach and found that heterogeneity in the interspecific interactions or the presence of strongly interacting species is sufficient to explain community types. independent of the topology of the underlying ecological network. By controlling the presence or absence of these strongly interacting species we can steer the microbial ecosystem to any desired community type. This open-loop control strategy still holds even when the community types are not distinct but appear as dense regions within a continuous gradient.

Indeed. the uninformative temporal measurements and the compositional nature of the relative abundance data raise serious challenges in inference.

Previous studies ignored the effect that a node outside the percolating cluster may actively induce its inside neighbours to exit the percolating cluster. Here we study this inducing effect on the classical site percolation and K-core percolation. showing that the inducing effect always causes a discontinuous percolation transition. We precisely predict the percolation threshold and core size for uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. For low-dimensional lattices the percolation threshold fluctuates considerably over realizations. yet we can still predict the core size once the percolation occurs.

Reduced thiol species are candidates for this role. reacting readily in the presence of NO to yield biologically active S-nitrosothiols that are more stable than NO itself. Because sulfhydryl groups in proteins represent an abundant source of reduced thiol in biologic systems. we examined the reaction of several sulfhydryl-containing proteins of diverse nature and function upon exposure to authentic NO and EDRF.

These cells may be derived from stem cells (circulating or within the vessel wall) or differentiation of existing cells. such as smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or pericytes. Several factors induce this transition. including bone morphogenetic proteins. oxidant stress. high phosphate levels. parathyroid hormone fragments. and vitamin D. Once the osteogenic phenotype is induced. cells gain a distinctive molecular fingerprint. marked by the transcription factor core binding factor α1.

Here. based on the finding that renormalization can be applied to bionetworks. we develop a scaling theory of transport in self-similar networks. We demonstrate the networks invariance under length scale renormalization. and we show that the problem of transport can be characterized in terms of a set of critical exponents. The scaling theory allows us to determine the influence of the modular structure on transport in metabolic and protein-interaction networks. We also generalize our theory by presenting and verifying scaling arguments for the dependence of transport on microscopic features. such as …,True,YqpNyFUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,196,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/19/7746.short,15449885964892327711,/scholar?cites=15449885964892327711,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/19/7746.full.pdf,0,0,0

To characterize these processes. we have reconstructed aggregate intellectual mobility over two millennia through the birth and death locations of more than 150.000 notable individuals. The tools of network and complexity theory were then used to identify characteristic statistical patterns and determine the cultural and historical relevance of deviations. The resulting network of locations provides a macroscopic perspective of cultural history. which helps us to retrace cultural narratives of Europe and North America using large-scale visualization and quantitative dynamical tools and to derive historical trends of cultural centers beyond the scope of specific events or narrow time intervals.,True,YqpNyFUAAAAJ:eAUscmXIlQ8C,192,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6196/558.abstract,9598984399882597778,/scholar?cites=9598984399882597778,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.568.5073&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Despite recent studies in online domains. little is known about factors that could affect the dissemination of a single piece of information.

We find that the social and organizational context significantly impacts to whom and how fast people forward information.

The RG flow readily identifies a small-world–fractal transition by finding (i) a trivial stable fixed point of a complete graph.(ii) a nontrivial point of a pure fractal topology that is stable or unstable according to the amount of long-range links in the network. and (iii) another stable point of a fractal with shortcuts that exist exactly at the small-world–fractal transition. As a collateral. the RG technique explains the coexistence of the seemingly contradicting fractal and small-world phases and allows us to extract information on the distribution of shortcuts in real-world networks. a problem of importance for information flow in the system.,True,YqpNyFUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,142,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.025701,1069130973412842650,/scholar?cites=1069130973412842650,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4832,0,0,0

Using the box-covering technique. it was shown that many networks present a fractal behavior. which is seemingly in contrast to their small-world property. Moreover. even non-fractal networks have been shown to present a self-similar picture under renormalization of the length scale.

How to predict these cascades is highly nontrivial in several vital applications. such as viral marketing. epidemic prevention and traffic management. Most previous works mainly focus on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are typical dynamic processes. it is always interesting and important to predict the cascade size at any time. or predict the time when a cascade will reach a certain size (e.g. an threshold for outbreak). In this paper. we unify all these tasks into a fundamental problem: cascading process prediction. That is. given the early stage of a cascade. how to predict its cumulative cascade size of any later time? For such a challenging problem. how to understand the micro mechanism that drives and generates the macro phenomena (i.e. cascading process) is essential.

While several empirical studies exist. there is no general theoretical analysis that can explain the largely varying behavior of real networks. Here. we use scaling theory to quantify the degree of correlations in the particular case of networks with a power-law degree distribution. These networks are classified in terms of their correlation properties. revealing additional information on their structure. For instance. the studied social networks and the Internet at the router level are clustered around the line of random networks. implying a strongly connected core of hubs. On the contrary. some biological networks and the WWW exhibit strong anticorrelations.

1097987,Connected: the surprising power of our social network and how they shape our lives,2009,Nicholas A and Fowler James H Christakis,,,,,Little Brown,Celebrated scientists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler explain the amazing power of social networks and our profound influence on one another's lives. Your colleague's husband's sister can make you fat. even if you don't know her. A happy neighbor has more impact on your happiness than a happy spouse. These startling revelations of how much we truly influence one another are revealed in the studies of Dr. Christakis and Fowler. which have repeatedly made front-page news nationwide. In Connected. the authors explain why emotions are contagious. how health behaviors spread. why the rich get richer. even how we find and choose our partners. Intriguing and entertaining. Connected overturns the notion of the individual and provides a revolutionary paradigm-that social networks influence our ideas. emotions. health. relationships. behavior. politics. and much more.

College students and adolescents routinely provide personal information on profiles that can be viewed by large numbers of unknown people and potentially used in harmful ways. SNSs like Facebook and MySpace allow users to control the privacy level of their profile. thus limiting access to this information.

Methods A Working Group of the Research Network of the European Association for Palliative Care identified clinically significant topics. reviewed the studies. and assigned the level of evidence. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible because of the heterogeneity of published studies and the lack of minimal standards in reporting results. A systematic electronic literature search within the main available medical literature databases was performed for each of the following four areas identified: clinical prediction of survival (CPS). biologic factors. clinical signs and symptoms and psychosocial variables. and prognostic scores. Only studies on patients with advanced cancer and survival ≤ 90 days were included.  Results A total of 38 studies were evaluated. Level A evidence-based recommendations of prognostic correlation could be formulated for CPS (albeit with a series of limitations of which clinicians must be aware) and prognostic scores.

Students' perceptions of their ethical environment and personal development.,1994,Chris Feudtner and Dimitri A Christakis and Nicholas A Christakis,69,Academic medicine: journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,8,670-679,,BACKGROUND: Little is known about the ethical dilemmas that medical students believe they encounter while working in hospitals or how students feel these dilemmas affect them. The authors examine how clinical students perceive their ethical environment. their feelings about their dilemmas. and whether these dilemmas erode students' ethical principles. METHOD: An anonymous mail survey was sent in 1992-93 to the 1.853 third-and fourth-year medical students enrolled at six Pennsylvania medical schools. The survey addressed whether students had encountered situations they felt were ethically problematic. their attitudes toward these situations. and their perceptions of their personal ethical development. Data were analyzed with logistic regression; respondents' comments were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Of the 665 students (36%) who responded. 58% reported having done something they believed was unethical. and 52% reported having misled a patient; 80% reported at least one of these two behaviors. In addition. 98% had heard physicians refer derogatorily to patients; 61% had witnessed what they believed to be unethical behavior by other medical team members. and of these students. 54% felt like accomplices. Many students reported dissatisfaction with their actions and ethical development: 67% had felt bad or guilty about something they had done as clinical clerks; 62% believed that at least some of their ethical principles had been eroded or lost.

In fact. in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas. four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95% of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence. even coarse datasets provide little anonymity.

To understand the growth of economies. Hidalgo argues. we first need to understand the growth of order. At first glance. the universe seems hostile to order. Thermodynamics dictates that over time. order-or information-disappears. Whispers vanish in the wind just like the beauty of swirling cigarette smoke collapses into disorderly clouds. But thermodynamics also has loopholes that promote the growth of information in pockets. Although cities are all pockets where information grows. they are not all the same. For every Silicon Valley. Tokyo. and Paris. there are dozens of places with economies that accomplish little more than pulling rocks out of the ground. So. why does the US economy outstrip Brazil's. and Brazil's that of Chad? Why did the technology corridor along Boston's Route 128 languish while Silicon Valley blossomed? In each case. the key is how people. firms. and the networks they form make use of information.

But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics. network science. and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products—as measured by the Economic Complexity Index—have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis. we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income. institutions. export concentration. and human capital.

Manila or Caracas does not need a report to learn that these cities are unequal; she can see it directly from the taxicab window. This is because in most cities inequality is conspicuous. but also. because cities express different forms of inequality that are evident to casual observers. Cities are highly heterogeneous and often unequal with respect to the income of their residents. but also with respect to the cleanliness of their neighborhoods. the beauty of their architecture. and the liveliness of their streets. among many other evaluative dimensions. Until now. however. our ability to understand the effect of a city's built environment on social and economic outcomes has been limited by the lack of quantitative data on urban perception. Here. we build on the intuition that inequality is partly conspicuous to create quantitative measure of a city's contrasts. Using thousands of geo-tagged images. we measure the perception of safety. class and uniqueness; in the cities of Boston and New York in the United States. and Linz and Salzburg in Austria. finding that the range of perceptions elicited by the images of New York and Boston is larger than the range of perceptions elicited by images from Linz and Salzburg.

In this paper we explore this question by combining techniques of networks science with 42 years of trade data and find that. while the Product Space remains relatively stable during this period. the dynamics of countries' productive structures is characterized by a few highly dynamic economies. In particular we identify Brazil. Indonesia. Turkey. Malaysia. Thailand. Korea. Singapore and China. as countries that transformed their productive structures considerably during these four decades. albeit following different trajectories. For instance. the economic complexity of Korea. Singapore and China was relatively high at the beginning of the observation period and continued to increase during these forty two years. moving these countries into the top spots of the economic complexity rankings for the beginning of this millennium. Brazil. Indonesia and Turkey. on the other hand. transformed their productive structures significantly during the same period of time. but did so starting from a less sophisticated foundation. We conclude the paper by moving from this and other observations into the policy implications of this view of economic development and argue that the government involvement in the private sector should be to help catalyze market activities and solve coordination problems that emerge naturally when countries try to accumulate capabilities. This represents an alternative to more traditional views of the role of government that postulate. in their extremes. that the public sector should either have no involvement in private sector activities or. on the other hand. substantial …,True,xhCWdtMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,182,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37366208,4049348987116778220,/scholar?cites=4049348987116778220,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37366208/189.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1098033,The Dynamics of Nestedness Predicts the Evolution of Industrial Ecosystems,2012,Sebastian Bustos and Charles Gomez and Ricardo Hausmann and Hidalgo Cesar A,7,PLoS One,11,e49393,,In economic systems. the mix of products that countries make or export has been shown to be a strong leading indicator of economic growth. Hence. methods to characterize and predict the structure of the network connecting countries to the products that they export are relevant for understanding the dynamics of economic development. Here we study the presence and absence of industries in international and domestic economies and show that these networks are significantly nested. This means that the less filled rows and columns of these networks' adjacency matrices tend to be subsets of the fuller rows and columns. Moreover. we show that their nestedness remains constant over time and that it is sustained by both. a bias for industries that deviate from the networks' nestedness to disappear. and a bias for the industries that are missing according to nestedness to appear. This makes the appearance and disappearance of individual industries in each location predictable. We interpret the high level of nestedness observed in these networks in the context of the neutral model of development introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009). We show that the model can reproduce the high level of nestedness observed in these networks only when we assume a high level of heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities available in countries and required by products. In the context of the neutral model. this implies that the high level of nestedness observed in these economic networks emerges as a combination of both. the complementarity of inputs and heterogeneity in the number of capabilities available in countries and required by products …,True,xhCWdtMAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,106,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049393,12134445829988329876,/scholar?cites=12134445829988329876,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049393,0,0,0

While the mechanism for long time scales has been studied. the underlying mechanism on the daily scale is still unrevealed.

Using the concept of motifs from network theory. we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks. called here motifs. are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries.

While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography. it has been impossible. due to practical difficulties. to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes. and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight. but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members.

We find that the major usage of each road segment can be traced to its own-surprisingly few-driver sources. Based on this finding we propose a network of road usage by defining a bipartite network framework. demonstrating that in contrast to traditional approaches. which define road importance solely by topological measures. the role of a road segment depends on both: its betweeness and its degree in the road usage network. Moreover. our ability to pinpoint the few driver sources contributing to the major traffic flow allows us to create a strategy that achieves a significant reduction of the travel time across the entire road system. compared to a benchmark approach.,True,YAGjro8AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,373,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01001?subId1=xid:fr1581530346259dcj,10481199413841678436,/scholar?cites=10481199413841678436,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01001?subId1=xid:fr1581530346259dcj,0,0,0

Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control. but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales. obtained from (i) official census surveys. (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records. and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well. accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated. however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks. once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model. however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models. and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns …,True,YAGjro8AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,207,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003716,7119157003266842745,/scholar?cites=7119157003266842745,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003716,0,0,0

1098055,Discovering urban activity patterns in cell phone data,2015,Peter Widhalm and Yingxiang Yang and Michael Ulm and Shounak Athavale and Marta C González,42,Transportation,4,597-623,Springer US,Massive and passive data such as cell phone traces provide samples of the whereabouts and movements of individuals. These are a potential source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are sparsely sampled in time. which requires a precise set of techniques for mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by analyzing relational signatures of activity time. duration. and land use. First. we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second. we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies between activity type. trip scheduling. and land use types via a Relational …,True,YAGjro8AAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,175,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-015-9598-x,16343666857644175446,/scholar?cites=16343666857644175446,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/104005/11116_2015_Article_9598.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES,2015,Serdar Çolak and Lauren P Alexander and Bernardo Guatimosim Alvim and Shomik R Mehndiretta and Marta C González,,,15-5279,,,Travelers today use technology that generates vast amounts of data at low cost. These data could supplement most outputs of regional travel demand models. New analysis tools could change how data and modeling are used in the assessment of travel demand. Recent work has shown how processed origin–destination trips. as developed by trip data providers. support travel analysis. Much less has been reported on how raw data from telecommunication providers can be processed to support such an analysis or to what extent the raw data can be treated to extract travel behavior. This paper discusses how cell phone data can be processed to inform a four-step transportation model. with a focus on the limitations and opportunities of such data. The illustrated data treatment approach uses only phone data and population density to generate trip matrices in two metropolitan areas: Boston.

Not much is known. however. about the set of mechanisms needed to generate complete mobility profiles if only using passive datasets with mostly sparse traces of individuals. In this study. we present a mechanistic modeling framework (TimeGeo) that effectively generates urban mobility patterns with resolution of 10 min and hundreds of meters. It ties together the inference of home and work activity locations from data. with the modeling of flexible activities (e.g.. other) in space and time. The temporal choices are captured by only three features: the weekly home-based tour number. the dwell rate. and the burst rate.

This model distinguishes itself from existing models via its capability of modeling the arrival process of popularity and its remarkable power at predicting the popularity of individual items.

This has a wide array of potential applications. ranging from emergency response and detection to traffic control and management. Previous studies have shown that human communications are both temporally and spatially localized following the onset of emergencies. indicating that social propagation is a primary means to propagate situational awareness. We study real anomalous events using country-wide mobile phone data. finding that information flow during emergencies is dominated by repeated communications.

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers. they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality. raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work.

This is comparable to the income disparity in the United States. known as the 1% phenomenon. where 1% of the population earns a disproportionate 17.4% of total income (see go. nature. com/yajthu).The number of citations acquired by a paper is a proxy of its impact. We found that of all papers published in five leading journals in 1990. the most highly cited 1% in each collected around 17% of citations in 2010 (see ‘The 1% effect’; data from Thomson Reuters Science Citation Index). Changes over time in the citation share of the top 1% are evidence of endogenous shifts in underlying processes. These trends are particularly pronounced for citations of older papers. For example. the top 1% of 1990 papers collected only about 5% of citations in 1991. This shift of attention over time towards the top 1% may reflect the fact that. although the number of research papers has exploded. the time scientists devote to reading them has not.

Here. we use a large-scale biomedical literature database to construct a symptom-based human disease network and investigate the connection between clinical manifestations of diseases and their underlying molecular interactions.

Here. we take advantage of our increasing understanding of the network-based origins of diseases to introduce a drug-disease proximity measure that quantifies the interplay between drugs targets and diseases. By correcting for the known biases of the interactome. proximity helps us uncover the therapeutic effect of drugs. as well as to distinguish palliative from effective treatments. Our analysis of 238 drugs used in 78 diseases indicates that the therapeutic effect of drugs is localized in a small network neighborhood of the disease genes and highlights efficacy issues for drugs used in Parkinson and several inflammatory disorders.

1098093,A DIseAse MOdule Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm derived from a systematic analysis of connectivity patterns of disease proteins in the human interactome,2015,Susan Dina Ghiassian and Jörg Menche and Albert-László Barabási,11,PLoS Comput Biol,4,e1004120,Public Library of Science,The observation that disease associated proteins often interact with each other has fueled the development of network-based approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of human disease. Such approaches build on the assumption that protein interaction networks can be viewed as maps in which diseases can be identified with localized perturbation within a certain neighborhood. The identification of these neighborhoods. or disease modules. is therefore a prerequisite of a detailed investigation of a particular pathophenotype. While numerous heuristic methods exist that successfully pinpoint disease associated modules. the basic underlying connectivity patterns remain largely unexplored. In this work we aim to fill this gap by analyzing the network properties of a comprehensive corpus of 70 complex diseases. We find that disease associated proteins do not reside within locally dense communities and instead identify connectivity significance as the most predictive quantity. This quantity inspires the design of a novel Disease Module Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm to identify the full disease module around a set of known disease proteins. We study the performance of the algorithm using well-controlled synthetic data and systematically validate the identified neighborhoods for a large corpus of diseases.,True,jHDsgE0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,212,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004120,6957138259615631251,/scholar?cites=6957138259615631251,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004120,0,0,0

Although some disease genes are expressed only in selected tissues. the expression patterns of disease genes alone cannot explain the observed tissue specificity of human diseases.

Driven by this hypothesis. we conducted a systematic study of the expression patterns of disease genes within the human interactome.

Relating clinical and molecular differences may allow us to define more specific subtypes of patients that respond differently to therapeutic interventions. We developed a novel unbiased method called diVIsive Shuffling Approach (VIStA) that identifies subgroups of patients by maximizing the difference in their gene expression patterns. We tested our algorithm on 140 subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and found four distinct. biologically and clinically meaningful combinations of clinical characteristics that are associated with large gene expression differences. The dominant characteristic in these combinations was the severity of airflow limitation. Other frequently identified measures included emphysema. fibrinogen levels. phlegm. BMI and age. A pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the identified subtypes suggests that VIStA is capable of capturing specific molecular signatures within in each group. The introduced methodology allowed us to identify combinations of clinical characteristics that correspond to clear gene expression differences. The resulting subtypes for COPD contribute to a better understanding of its heterogeneity.,True,jHDsgE0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,20,https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-8-S2-S8,12368906322920556724,/scholar?cites=12368906322920556724,,https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-8-S2-S8,0,0,0

Measurements on four networks. namely the science citation network. Internet. actor collaboration and science coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links depends on the node's degree. offering direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment.

Although this particular space tessellation is intensively studied by mathematicians. in two-and three-dimensional (3D) spaces there is no exact result known for the size distribution of Voronoi cells. Motivated by the simple form of the distribution function in the 1D case. a simple and compact analytical formula is proposed for approximating the Voronoi cell's size-distribution function in the practically important 2D and 3D cases as well. Denoting the dimensionality of the space by d (d= 1. 2. 3) the f (y)= Const* y (3 d-1)/2 exp (-(3 d+ 1) y/2) compact form is suggested for the normalized cell-size distribution function.

The network structure is not a priori introduced in the model. it is generated in parallel with the wealth values through simple and realistic dynamical rules. The model has two main parameters. governing the wealth exchange in the network. Choosing their values realistically. leads to wealth distributions in good agreement with measured data. The cumulative wealth distribution function has an exponential behavior in the low and medium wealth limit. and shows the Pareto-like power-law tail for the upper 5% of the society. The obtained Pareto indexes are in good agreement with the measured ones. The generated family networks also converge to a statistically stable topology with a simple Poissonian degree distribution.

This behavior depends on both the solid fraction and the shear rate. The concept of effective volume fraction (EVF) is used to decorrelate the influence of these two parameters. At high shear rate the slurry behaves like a suspension of hard spheres. whereas at lower shear rate particles tend to aggregate in clusters. entrapping liquid and thus increasing the EVF and the viscosity. A lattice model is introduced to simulate the aggregation/break-up processes within a slurry under shear. When the steady state is reached. the entrapped liquid fraction is calculated. leading to a viscosity estimation. Simulation results for the viscosity and structure of the three-dimensional cluster are in good agreement with experimental results.,True,_NDvgjsAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,64,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645400001610,10791897602228327018,/scholar?cites=10791897602228327018,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0006405,0,0,0

We introduce subgraph “intensity” as the geometric mean of its link weights and “coherence” as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures. motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks.

In recent studies such bursty behavior has been characterized by a fat-tailed inter-event time distribution. while temporal correlations were measured by the autocorrelation function.

Here we show that the distribution of the number of events in a bursty period serves as a good indicator of the dependencies. leading to the universal observation of power-law distribution for a broad class of phenomena.

A natural application of this would be the prediction of the society's reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adoption rate. However. bridging the gap between “real time monitoring” and “early predicting” remains a big challenge. Here we report on an endeavor to build a minimalistic predictive model for the financial success of movies based on collective activity data of online users.

The activity of various elements is often different and the fluctuation in the activity of an element grows monotonically with the average activity. This relationship is often of the form ‘fluctuations ≈ constant × averageα’. where the exponent α is predominantly in the range [1/2. 1]. This power law has been observed in a very wide range of disciplines. ranging from population dynamics through the Internet to the stock market and it is often treated under the names Taylor's law or fluctuation scaling.

These fluctuations can be damped by Monte Carlo averaging. Increasing its amount. the effective anisotropy becomes larger and a crossover from tip splitting typical for continuum DLA to stable tips is observed. in analogy with a number of recent experiments. The simulations suggest the following scenario for the transitions which take place as a function of the increasing effective anisotropy: disordered patterns to dendritic structures to needle crystals. It is shown that DLA clusters go through the same sequence of transitions as a function of their size.

We address the question of whether such correlations may be a trivial consequence of the known mosaic structure (‘‘patchiness’’) of DNA. We analyze two classes of controls consisting of patchy nucleotide sequences generated by different algorithms—one without and one with long-range power-law correlations. Although both types of sequences are highly heterogeneous. they are quantitatively distinguishable by new fluctuation analysis method that differentiates local patchiness from long-range correlations. Application of this analysis to selected DNA sequences demonstrates that patchiness is not sufficient to account for long-range correlation properties.,True,mB6GO8UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4763,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.49.1685,14976518963498805615,/scholar?cites=14976518963498805615,,https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.49.1685,0,0,0

By analyzing several examples we show that the new method can reliably determine the multifractal scaling behavior of time series.

Although most results in the field have been obtained by analysing isolated networks. many real-world networks do in fact interact with and depend on other networks. The set of extensive results for the limiting case of non-interacting networks holds only to the extent that ignoring the presence of other networks can be justified. Recently. an analytical framework for studying the percolation properties of interacting networks has been developed.

To answer this question. we consider all 33 301 coding and all 29 453 noncoding eukaryotic sequences—each of length larger than 512 base pairs (bp—in the present release of the GenBank to determine whether there is any statistically significant distinction in their long-range correlation properties. Standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis indicates that coding sequences have practically no correlations in the range from 10 bp to 100 bp (spectral exponent β= 0.00±0.04. where the uncertainty is two standard deviations).

Because of the coupling between the networks. when nodes in one network fail they cause dependent nodes in the other network to also fail. This invokes an iterative cascade of failures in both networks. When a critical fraction of nodes fail. the iterative process results in a percolation phase transition that completely fragments both networks. We show both analytically and numerically that reducing the coupling between the networks leads to a change from a first order percolation phase transition to a second order percolation transition at a critical point.

Annealing at the optimal temperature of 250 °C for less than 2 h significantly enhances the conductivity and ferromagnetism. but continuing the annealing for longer times suppresses both. These data indicate that such annealing induces the defects in Ga1−xMnxAs to evolve through at least two different processes. and they point to a complex interplay between the different defects and ferromagnetism in this material.,True,kI5W8PwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,435,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1398619,9285693976272831490,/scholar?cites=9285693976272831490,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0105541,0,0,0

1098201,Colloquium: Artificial spin ice: Designing and imaging magnetic frustration,2013,Cristiano Nisoli and Roderich Moessner and Peter Schiffer,85,,4,1473,American Physical Society,Frustration. the presence of competing interactions. is ubiquitous in the physical sciences and is a source of degeneracy and disorder. which in turn gives rise to new and interesting physical phenomena. Perhaps nowhere does it occur more simply than in correlated spin systems. where it has been studied in the most detail. In disordered magnetic materials. frustration leads to spin-glass phenomena. with analogies to the behavior of structural glasses and neural networks. In structurally ordered magnetic materials. it has also been the topic of extensive theoretical and experimental studies over the past two decades. Such geometrical frustration has opened a window to a wide range of fundamentally new exotic behavior. This includes spin liquids in which the spins continue to fluctuate down to the lowest temperatures. and spin ice. which appears to retain macroscopic entropy even in the low-temperature limit …,True,kI5W8PwAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C,401,https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.85.1473,96208048862112917,/scholar?cites=96208048862112917,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0825,0,0,0

1098203,Slow drag in a granular medium,1999,R Albert and MA Pfeifer and A-L Barabási and P Schiffer,82,Physical review letters,1,205,American Physical Society,We have studied the drag force acting on an object moving with low velocity through a granular medium. Although the drag force is a dynamic quantity. its behavior in this regime is dominated by the inhomogeneous distribution of stress in static granular media. We find experimentally that the drag force on a vertical cylinder is linearly dependent on the cylinder diameter. quadratically dependent on the depth of insertion. and independent of velocity. An accompanying analytical calculation based on the static distribution of forces arrives at the same result. demonstrating that the local theory of stress propagation in static granular media can be used to predict this bulk dynamic property.,True,kI5W8PwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,342,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.205,3466136327655053158,/scholar?cites=3466136327655053158,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fec3/d1d617a589447bf03644108eec6fe7e35813.pdf,0,0,0

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state. a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network. identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system’s entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks. finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network’s degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks. which emerge in many real complex systems. are the most difficult to control. but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes.

The methodology uses in its idealized form piecewise continuous feedback control. resulting in the state trajectory sliding along a time-varying sliding surface in the state space. This idealized control law achieves perfect tracking; however. non-idealities in its implementation result in the generation of an undesirable high-frequency component in the state trajectory. To rectify this. it is shown how continuous control laws may be used to approximate the discontinuous control law to obtain robust tracking to within a prescribed accuracy without generating undesirable high-frequency signal.

The control law is adaptive in that it uses sensor measurements to learn the distribution of sensory information in the environment. It is decentralized in that it requires only information local to each robot. The controller is then improved by introducing a consensus algorithm to propagate sensory information from every robot throughout the network. Convergence and consensus of parameters is proven with a Lyapunovtype proof. The controller with and without consensus is demonstrated in numerical simulations. These techniques are suggestive of broader applications of adaptive control methodologies to decentralized control problems in unknown dynamic environments.,True,TcREpMQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,451,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0278364908100177,9554531230709253317,/scholar?cites=9554531230709253317,,http://groups.csail.mit.edu/drl/wiki/images/2/22/SchwagerIJRR07Submitted.pdf,0,0,0

The model shows that the thruster behaves like a sluggish nonlinear filter. where the speed of response depends on the commanded thrust level.

In this control method. the robots move as a group inside a desired region while maintaining a minimum distance among themselves. Various shapes of the desired region can be formed by choosing the appropriate objective functions. The robots in the group only need to communicate with their neighbors and not the entire community. The robots do not have specific identities or roles within the group. Therefore. the proposed method does not require specific orders or positions of the robots inside the region and yet different formations can be formed for a swarm of robots.

Current modeling approaches. such as constraint-based flux-balance analysis. have proved highly successful in analyzing the capabilities of cellular metabolism. including its capacity to predict deletion phenotypes. the ability to calculate the relative flux values of metabolic reactions. and the capability to identify properties of optimal growth states. Here. we use flux-balance analysis to thoroughly assess the activity of Escherichia coli. Helicobacter pylori. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism in 30.000 diverse simulated environments. We identify a set of metabolic reactions forming a connected metabolic core that carry non-zero fluxes under all growth conditions. and whose flux variations are highly correlated. Furthermore. we find that the enzymes catalyzing the core reactions display a considerably higher fraction of phenotypic essentiality and evolutionary conservation than those catalyzing noncore reactions. Cellular metabolism is characterized by a large number of species-specific conditionally active reactions organized around an evolutionary conserved. but always active. metabolic core.

Many approaches based on gene therapy aim to repair the defective gene or to insert genes with compensatory function. Here. we propose an alternative. network‐based strategy that aims to restore biological function by forcing the cell to either bypass the functions affected by the defective gene. or to compensate for the lost function. Focusing on the metabolism of single‐cell organisms. we computationally study mutants that lack an essential enzyme. and thus are unable to grow or have a significantly reduced growth rate. We show that several of these mutants can be turned into viable organisms through additional gene deletions that restore their growth rate.

The structure of the protein domain network. where individual domains correspond to nodes and their co-occurrences in a protein are interpreted as links. also falls into this category. suggesting that domains involved in the maintenance of increasingly developed. multicellular organisms accumulate links. Here. we take the next step by studying link based properties of the protein domain co-occurrence networks of the eukaryotes S. cerevisiae. C. elegans. D. melanogaster. M. musculus and H. sapiens. We construct the protein domain co-occurrence networks from the PFAM database and analyze them by applying a k-core decomposition method that isolates the globally central (highly connected domains in the central cores) from the locally central (highly connected domains in the peripheral cores) protein domains through an iterative peeling process. Furthermore. we compare the subnetworks thus obtained to the physical domain interaction network of S. cerevisiae.

1098256,Scaling properties of random walks on small-world networks,2003,E Almaas and RV Kulkarni and D Stroud,68,Physical Review E,5,056105,American Physical Society,Using both numerical simulations and scaling arguments. we study the behavior of a random walker on a one-dimensional small-world network. For the properties we study. we find that the random walk obeys a characteristic scaling form. These properties include the average number of distinct sites visited by the random walker. the mean-square displacement of the walker. and the distribution of first-return times. The scaling form has three characteristic time regimes. At short times. the walker does not see the small-world shortcuts and effectively probes an ordinary Euclidean network in d dimensions. At intermediate times. the properties of the walker shows scaling behavior characteristic of an infinite small-world network. Finally. at long times. the finite size of the network becomes important. and many of the properties of the walker saturate.

Recently. the necessity to expand the current range of constraint-based methods to incorporate high-throughput experimental data has been acknowledged by the proposal of several methods. However. these methods have rarely been used to address cellular metabolic responses to some relevant perturbations such as antimicrobial or temperature-induced stress. Here. we present a new method for combining gene-expression data with FBA (GX-FBA) that allows modeling of genome-level metabolic response to a broad range of environmental perturbations within a constraint-based framework. The method uses mRNA expression data to guide hierarchical regulation of cellular metabolism subject to the interconnectivity of the metabolic network. We applied GX-FBA to a genome-scale model of metabolism in the gram negative bacterium Yersinia pestis and analyzed its metabolic response to (i) variations in temperature known to induce virulence. and (ii) antibiotic stress. Without imposition of any a priori behavioral constraints. our results show strong agreement with reported phenotypes. Our analyses also lead to novel insights into how Y. pestis uses metabolic adjustments to counter different forms of stress. Comparisons of GX-FBA predicted metabolic states with fluxomic measurements and different reported post-stress phenotypes suggest that mass conservation constraints and network connectivity can be an …,True,a0-oaWEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,65,https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-6-150,9667727177881493604,/scholar?cites=9667727177881493604,,https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-6-150,0,0,0

Until recently. studies of complex networks have mainly focused on their network topology. However. in many real world applications. the edges and vertices have associated attributes that are frequently represented as vertex or edge weights. Furthermore. these weights are often not static. instead changing with time and forming a time series. Hence. to fully understand the dynamics of the complex network. we have to consider both network topology and related time series data. In this work. we propose a motif mining approach to identify trend motifs for such purposes. Simply stated. a trend motif describes a recurring subgraph where each of its vertices or edges displays similar dynamics over a user- defined period.

We define a dynamic network module to be a set of proteins satisfying two conditions: (1) they form a connected component in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network; and (2) their expression profiles form certain structures in the temporal domain.

Network growth is governed by preferential attachment in which a newly added node attaches to a node of degree k with rate A k= k+ λ. For general values of θ and λ. we compute the total weight of a network as a function of the number of nodes N and the distribution of link weights. Generically. the total weight grows as N for λ> θ− 1 and superlinearly otherwise. The link weight distribution is predicted to have a power-law form that is modified by a logarithmic correction for the case λ= 0.

Localization of the AlgE protein was found to depend on the presence of other proteins in the multiprotein complex. No correlation was found between the number of alginate factories and the alginate production level. nor were the numbers of these factories affected in an algC mutant that is unable to produce the precursor needed for alginate biosynthesis.

We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process. resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that. when it comes to information diffusion. weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.,True,gMndACUAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,2052,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7332.short,15533097824337540304,/scholar?cites=15533097824337540304,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/18/7332.full.pdf,0,0,0

Management‐based regulation directs regulated organizations to engage in a planning process that aims toward the achievement of public goals. offering firms flexibility in how they achieve public goals. In this article. we develop a framework for assessing conditions for using management‐based regulation as opposed to the more traditional technology‐based or performance‐based regulation. Drawing on case studies of management‐based regulation in the areas of food safety. industrial safety. and environmental protection. we show how management‐based regulation can be an effective strategy when regulated entities are heterogeneous and regulatory outputs are relatively difficult to monitor. In addition to analyzing conditions for the use of management‐based regulation. we assess the range of choices regulators …,True,gMndACUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,709,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0023-9216.2003.03703001.x,6042190849152104413,/scholar?cites=6042190849152104413,,http://www.davidlazer.com/sites/default/files/23%20Coglianese%20Lazer%202003.pdf,0,0,0

This paper examines how the structure of communication networks among actors can affect system-level performance. We present an agent-based computer simulation model of information sharing in which the less successful emulate the more successful. Results suggest that when agents are dealing with a complex problem. the more efficient the network at disseminating information. the better the short-run but the lower the long-run performance of the system. The dynamic underlying this result is that an inefficient network maintains diversity in the system and is thus better for exploration than an efficient network. supporting a more thorough search for solutions in the long run.

Using two large national samples investigating people's hypothetical willingness to deliberate and their actual participation in response to a real invitation to deliberate with their member of Congress. we find that (1) willingness to deliberate in the United States is much more widespread than expected. and (2) it is precisely those people less likely to participate in traditional partisan politics who are most interested in deliberative participation.

A long stream of research has focused on the relationship between attitudes and social affiliations. However. in most of this research the causal relationship between views and affiliations is difficult to discern definitively: Do people influence each other's views so that they converge over time or do they primarily affiliate (by choice or happenstance) with those of similar views? Here we use longitudinal attitudinal and whole network data collected at critical times (notably. at the inception of the system) to identify robustly the determinants of attitudes and affiliations.

We examine how collective patterns of user behavior under conditions of shared attention are distinct from other “bursts” of activity like breaking news events. Using 290 million tweets from a panel of 193.532 politically active Twitter users. we compare features of their behavior during eight major events during the 2012 U.S. presidential election to examine how patterns of social media use change during these media events compared to “typical” time and whether these changes are attributable to shifts in the behavior of the population as a whole or shifts from particular segments such as elites. Compared to baseline time periods. our findings reveal that media events not only generate large volumes of tweets. but they are also associated with (1) substantial declines in interpersonal communication. (2) more highly concentrated attention by replying to and retweeting particular users. and (3) elite users predominantly benefiting from this attention. These findings empirically demonstrate how bursts of activity on Twitter during media events significantly alter underlying social processes of interpersonal communication and social interaction. Because the behavior of large populations within socio-technical systems can change so dramatically. our findings suggest the need for further research about how social media responses to media events can be used to support collective sensemaking. to promote informed deliberation. and to remain resilient in the face of misinformation.,True,gMndACUAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC,150,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094093,16888943982697323396,/scholar?cites=16888943982697323396,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094093,0,0,0

And how does information flow determine which lobbyists get access in policy-making? Drawing upon the `strength of weak ties' argument. the authors argue that policy information passes more through acquaintances (`weak ties') than through close. trusted. contacts (`strong ties'). They support this argument in an analysis of data on lobbying networks in health-care policy-making in the 1970s and 1980s.

Big data represents the data being generated by the digitization of social life. which we break down into three domains: digital life. digital traces. and digitalized life. We argue that there is enormous potential in using big data to study a variety of phenomena that remain difficult to observe. However. there are some recurring vulnerabilities that should be addressed. We also outline the role institutions must play in clarifying the ethical rules of the road.

This volume argues for a shift from the narrow focus of"" electronic government"" on technology and transactions to the broader perspective of information government—the information flows within the public sector. between the public sector and citizens. and among citizens—as a way to understand the changing nature of governing and governance in an information society. Contributors discuss the interplay between recent technological developments and evolving information flows. and the implications of different information flows for efficiency. political mobilization. and democratic accountability. The chapters are accompanied by short case studies from around the world. which cover such topics as electronic government efforts in Singapore and Switzerland. the US Environmental Protection Agency's effort to solicit input on planned regulations over the Internet. and online activism"" cyberprotesting"" globalization.

However. for such large data sets even a moderate exploration of the tree space needed to identify the optimal tree is virtually impossible. For these cases the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used because of its demonstrated accuracy for smaller data sets and its computational speed. As data sets grow. however. the fraction of the tree space examined by the NJ algorithm becomes minuscule. Here. we report the results of our computer simulation for examining the accuracy of NJ trees for inferring very large phylogenies.

1098307,Estimation of the number of nucleotide substitutions when there are strong transition-transversion and G+ C-content biases,1992,Koichiro Tamura,9,Mol Biol Evol,4,678-687,,In the study of molecular evolution. it is important to know the number of nucleotide substitutions per site (d) between DNA sequences. There are many different methods for estimating this number (for reviews. see Nei 1987. chap. 5; Gojobori et al. 1990)) but all of them depend on some simplifying assumptions and do not always give reliable estimates. Two important factors that should be considered in the estimation of d are the inequality of the rates of transitional and transversional nucleotide substitution (transition-transversion bias) and the deviation of the G+ C content (0) from 0.5 (G+ C-content bias).Kimura (1980) developed a method of estimating d for the case where the transition-transversion bias exists. In his method. however. the frequencies of the four nucleotides A. T. C. and G are all assumed to be equal to 0.25. throughout the evolutionary time. In practice. this assumption usually does not hold. For example. the G+ C content at the third-codon positions of the coding region of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is-GO. 1 (Clary and Wolstenholme 1985). It is therefore useful to develop a method that will take care of both the transition-transversion and G+ C-content biases. In the following.

Vigilant et al.(1) recently presented"" the strongest support yet for the placement of [their] common mtDNA [mitochondrial DNA] ancestor in Africa some 200.000 years ago."" This support stems from a tree estimated by maximum parsimony from mtDNA sequence data with the use of the computer program PAUP (2).

Increasingly larger datasets encompassing greater taxonomic diversity are becoming available to generate molecular timetrees by using sophisticated methods that model rate variation among lineages.

If this assumption is violated. the evolutionary distance estimated will be biased. which may result in biased estimates of divergence times and substitution rates. and may lead to erroneous branching patterns in the inferred phylogenies.

Animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is of particular interest in these studies. due partly to the relative ease with which it can be isolated (Arise. 1986). Ultracentrifugation involving cesium chloride gradients is commonly used for the isolation of mtDNA (Lansman et al.. 1981). however. expensive equipment and relatively long experimental times are required for this method. Simplified and more rapid isolation procedures were presented by Powell and Z6fiiga (1983) and Carr and Griffith (1987). In spite of these methods. the isolation of mtDNA is still laborious and is. therefore. becoming the limiting factor for the study of mtDNA in population biology. where numerous samples need to be analyzed for the particular characteristic of interest.,True,o5f46UgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,200,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02395525.pdf,5861052106285626078,/scholar?cites=5861052106285626078,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Koichiro_Tamura/publication/19912792_Rapid_isolation_method_of_animal_mitochondrial_DNA_by_the_alkaline_lysis_procedure/links/0deec53520cef0dceb000000/Rapid-isolation-method-of-animal-mitochondrial-DNA-by-the-alkaline-lysis-procedure.pdf,0,0,0

With rapidly decreasing sequencing costs. phylogenomics is becoming synonymous with evolutionary analysis of genome-scale and taxonomically densely sampled data sets. In phylogenetic inference applications. this translates into very large data sets that yield evolutionary and functional inferences with extremely small variances and high statistical confidence (P value). However. reports of highly significant P values are increasing even for contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses depending on the evolutionary model and inference method used. making it difficult to establish true relationships.

1098326,Molecular evolutionary genetics,1987,Masatoshi Nei,,,,,Columbia university press,During the last ten years. spectacular progress has occurred in the study of molecular evolution and variation mainly because of the introduction of new biochemical techniques such as gene cloning. DNA sequencing. and restriction enzyme methods. Studies at the DNA level have led to many intriguing discoveries about the evolutionary change of genes and populations. These discoveries have in turn generated several new evolutionary theories. Furthermore. the molecular approach is now being used for studying the evolution of morphological. physiological. and behavioral characters.The purpose of this book is to summarize and review recent developments in this area of study. Previously. molecular evolution and population genetics were studied as separate scientific disciplines. In this book. an attempt will be made to unify these two disciplines into one which may be called molecular evolutionary genetics. While emphasis is placed on the theoretical framework. experimental data will also be discussed to present a comprehensive view of the subject. There are highly developed mathematical theories related to the study of molecular evolution and variation. To make the book accessible to a wide audience. however. only those theories that are useful for interpretation and analysis of data are presented. When a sophisticated theory is needed. the meaning of the theory is discussed without going into detail.

1098331,Genetic distance between populations,1972,Masatoshi Nei,106,The American Naturalist,949,283-292,University of Chicago Press,A measure of genetic distance (D) based on the identity of genes between populations is formulated. It is defined as D = -logeI. where I is the normalized identity of genes between two populations. This genetic distance measures the accumulated allele differences per locus. If the rate of gene substitution per year is constant. it is linearly related to the divergence time between populations under sexual isolation. It is also linearly related to geographical distance or area in some migration models. Since D is a measure of the accumulated number of codon differences per locus. it can also be estimated from data on amino acid sequences in proteins even for a distantly related species. Thus. if enough data are available. genetic distance between any pair of organisms can be measured in terms of D.

In this volume. the culmination of their research. the authors explain their pathbreaking use of genetic data. which they integrate with insights from geography. ecology. archaeology. physical anthropology. and linguistics to create the first full-scale account of human evolution as it occurred across all continents. This interdisciplinary approach enables them to address a wide range of issues that continue to incite debate: the timing of the first appearance of our species. the problem of African origins and the significance of work recently done on mitochondrial DNA and the popular notion of an African Eve. the controversy pertaining to the peopling of the Americas. and the reason for the presence of non-Indo-European languages--Basque.

However. for such large data sets even a moderate exploration of the tree space needed to identify the optimal tree is virtually impossible. For these cases the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used because of its demonstrated accuracy for smaller data sets and its computational speed.

This problem is studied mathematically. and the results obtained indicate that the amount of reduction in average heterozygosity per locus depends not only on the 'size of bottleneck' but also on the rate of population growth. If population size increases rapidly after going through a bottleneck. the reduction in average heterozygosity is rather small even if bottleneck size is extremely small. On the other hand. the loss in the average number of alleles per locus is profoundly affected by bottleneck size but not so much by the rate of population growth. This difference occurs mainly because random genetic drift eliminates many low frequency alleles.

One of the important factors that cause this difference is genetic polymorphism in the ancestral species. Under the assumption of neutral mutations. this problem can be studied by evaluating the probability (P) that a gene tree has the same topology as that of the species tree. When one gene (allele) is used from each of the species involved. the probability can be expressed as a simple function of Ti = ti/(2N). where ti is the evolutionary time measured in generations for the ith internodal branch of the species tree and N is the effective population size.

1098346,DNA polymorphism detectable by restriction endonucleases,1981,Masatoshi Nei and Fumio Tajima,97,Genetics,1,145-163,Oxford University Press,Data on DNA polymorphisms detected by restriction endonucleases are rapidly accumulating. With the aim of analyzing these data. several different measures of nucleon (DNA segment) diversity within and between populations are proposed. and statistical methods for estimating these quantities are developed. These statistical methods are applicable to both nuclear and non-nuclear DNAs. When evolutionary change of nucleons occurs mainly by mutation and genetic drift. all the measures can be expressed in terms of the product of mutation rate per nucleon and effective population size. A method for estimating nucleotide diversity from nucleon diversity is also presented under certain assumptions. It is shown that DNA divergence between two populations can be studied either by the average number of restriction site differences or by the average number of nucleotide differences.

1098347,A simple method for estimating and testing minimum-evolution trees,1992,Andrey Rzhetsky and Masatoshi Nei,9,,5,945,,The neighbor-joining (NJ) method of phylogenetic inference (Saitou and Nei 1987) seems to be quite efficient in obtaining the correct tree. compared with maximum parsimony and several other methods (Saitou and Nei 1987; Sourdis and Nei 1988; Saitou and Imanishi 1989). In this method pairwise distances with multiple-hit corrections are used. and a tree is constructed by the principle of minimum evolution (ME). ie. searching for the tree topology that gives the minimum sum of branch lengths. The ME principle used here is different from that of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967). whose purpose was to construct a Steiner tree. Unlike Saitou and Imanishi’s ME method. however. it does not compute the sum (S) of branch lengths for all possible topologies. Instead. examination of different topologies is imbedded in the algorithm. so that only one final tree is produced. Conducting a computer simulation. Saitou and Imanishi (1989) showed that the tree obtained by this method is almost always identical with the ME tree obtained by Saitou and Imanishi’s procedure.

In an effort to generate a genomic view of the human–chimpanzee divergence. we have analyzed 167 nuclear protein-coding genes and built a reliable confidence interval around the calculated time by applying a multifactor bootstrap-resampling approach. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of neutral DNA substitutions show that the human–chimpanzee divergence is close to 20% of the ape–Old World monkey (OWM) divergence. Therefore. the generally accepted range of 23.8–35 millions of years ago for the ape–OWM divergence yields a range of 4.98–7.02 millions of years ago for human–chimpanzee divergence.

Correct placement allows us to easily identify or classify the sequences in the sample as to taxonomic position or function. Here we propose a novel method (PhyClass). based on the Minimum Evolution (ME) phylogenetic inference criterion. for determining the appropriate phylogenetic position of each read. Without using heuristics. the new approach efficiently finds the optimal placement of the unknown read in a reference phylogenetic tree given a sequence alignment for the taxa in the tree. In short. the total resulting branch length for the tree is computed for every possible …,True,qiMGuC4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-16-S1-S13,10068724789496524487,/scholar?cites=10068724789496524487,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-16-S1-S13,0,0,0

In the process. a review is provided for the structure. organization. and composition of the primary eukaryotic genomes that have been sequenced thus far. Although the word “genome.” meaning the total hereditary material of an organism. was coined in 1920. the general concept of genome arose before 4th century. when Aristotle implicated blood as the heredity substance. The notions of “blood relations” and characteristics being “in one's blood” persist; it is now known that the blood of mammals actually contains very little genetic material because their erythrocytes contain neither nuclei nor mitochondria.

1098366,Molecular clock: testing,2011,Fabia Ursula Battistuzzi and Alan J Filipski and Sudhir Kumar,,eLS,,,American Cancer Society,The molecular clock hypothesis originally rested on the assumption of rate constancy across lineages of a phylogeny. which would produce an approximately steady rate of accumulation of deoxyribonucleic acid or amino acid changes through time. This assumption has been questioned on the basis of increasingly large data sets. which have shown significant variability of rates in evolutionary lineages. To address this issue. tests have been developed to examine whether rates of molecular evolution vary significantly among taxonomic groups or phylogenetic lineages. Two major types of tests exist: those based on comparisons of genetic distances and those based on likelihood ratios. The first ones compare genetic distances between two species (or groups of species) relative to an outgroup; the latter ones compare maximum likelihood values for the same phylogeny calculated with and without the constant rate …,True,qiMGuC4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,7,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001803.pub2,13577207534227219138,/scholar?cites=13577207534227219138,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.414.3763&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1098367,Molecular clock: testing,2001,Sudhir Kumar and Alan J Filipski,,e LS,,,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,‘Molecular clock’refers to the approximately steady rate of accumulation of changes in DNA (or protein amino acid) sequences over evolutionary time. A consequence of this rate constancy is a nearly linear relationship between evolutionary distance and time of species divergence. The hypothesis applies only to orthologous sequences of a given gene; evolutionary rates are known to vary widely from gene to gene at the protein sequence level and also in different types of DNA (eg mitochondrial versus nuclear). Margoliash (1963) and Zuckerkandl and Pauling (1965) appear to have been the first to observe that the rates of amino acid substitution in some genes are roughly the same in several lineages. This led to the hypothesis of steady accumulation of amino acid substitutions at the molecular level. Its utility for estimating times of species divergence was immediately recognized. especially for organisms that left few or no traces in the fossil record. For example. divergence times were estimated between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and among eukaryotic kingdoms using molecular clocks (McLaughlin and Dayhoff. 1970; Dickerson. 1971).As more molecular sequence data became available. the initial optimism about the universality of the molecular clock was questioned by reports of significant difference in evolutionary rates among species in some genes and in some lineages. For instance. hominids (humans and their close relatives) seemed to be evolving much more slowly than other mammals. whereas rodents (mouse and rat) were shown to be evolving much faster (reviewed in Nei and Kumar. 2000).

At the same time. suggestions were made that evolutionary changes could be random as well as adaptive. This was given a mathematical basis by Sewall Wright's description of random evolutionary change in populations in the form of what is now called random genetic drift (Wright 1931). The relative importance of genetic drift and natural selection on the evolution of protein sequences was much debated at that time. Because of the belief that most protein changehad selective impact and that effective population sizes were so large that random effects would be smoothed out. the effect of genetic drift tended to be underappreciated.In the 1960s. the genetic code was deciphered and more protein …,True,qiMGuC4AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,5,https://kumarlab.net/downloads/papers/FilipskiKumar07.pdf,4760115975975778916,/scholar?cites=4760115975975778916,,https://kumarlab.net/downloads/papers/FilipskiKumar07.pdf,0,0,0

As the ability to measure molecules in high-throughput ways has improved over the past decade. it is logical that such data might be useful for enabling drug repositioning through computational methods. Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems. though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review. we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based. where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective. or disease based. where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes. will take advantage of newer types of …,True,206DEM0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,407,https://academic.oup.com/bib/article-abstract/12/4/303/241121,17017205415864295096,/scholar?cites=17017205415864295096,,https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/12/4/303/241121,0,0,0

Consequently. these studies are limited in their discovery of new and unknown disease relationships. We present the first quantitative framework to compare and contrast diseases by an integrated analysis of disease-related mRNA expression data and the human protein interaction network. We identified 4.620 functional modules in the human protein network and provided a quantitative metric to record their responses in 54 diseases leading to 138 significant similarities between diseases. Fourteen of the significant disease correlations also shared common drugs. supporting the hypothesis that similar diseases can be treated by the same drugs. allowing us to make predictions for new uses of existing drugs. Finally. we also identified 59 modules that were dysregulated in at least half of the diseases. representing a common disease-state “signature”. These modules were significantly enriched for genes that are known to be drug targets.

Systems genetics to understand heritability of coronary artery disease and other common complex disorders,2015,Johan LM Björkegren and Jason C Kovacic and Joel T Dudley and Eric E Schadt,65,,8,830-845,American College of Cardiology Foundation,Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been extensively used to study common complex diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). revealing 153 suggestive CAD loci. of which at least 46 have been validated as having genome-wide significance. However. these loci collectively explain <10% of the genetic variance in CAD. Thus. we must address the key question of what factors constitute the remaining 90% of CAD heritability. We review possible limitations of GWAS. and contextually consider some candidate CAD loci identified by this method.

Here. we develop a novel synthetic human reference sequence that is ethnically concordant and use it for the analysis of genomes from a nuclear family with history of familial thrombophilia. We demonstrate that the use of the major allele reference sequence results in improved genotype accuracy for disease-associated variant loci. We infer recombination sites to the lowest median resolution demonstrated to date (<1.000 base pairs). We use family inheritance state analysis to control sequencing error and inform family-wide haplotype phasing. allowing quantification of genome-wide compound heterozygosity. We develop a sequence-based methodology for Human Leukocyte Antigen typing that contributes to disease risk prediction. Finally. we advance methods for analysis of disease and pharmacogenomic risk across the coding and non-coding genome that incorporate phased variant data. We show these methods are capable of identifying multigenic risk for inherited thrombophilia and informing the appropriate pharmacological therapy.

Great disparity persists between the pattern suggested by the fossil record and that estimated by molecular clocks. especially for plants. animals. fungi. and the deepest branches of the eukaryote tree. Here. we used all available protein sequence data and molecular clock methods to place constraints on the increase in complexity through time.

(iii) choanoflagellates are closer to animals than to fungi or plants. (iv) diplomonads. euglenozoans. and alveolates each are basal to plants+animals+fungi. and (v) diplomonads are basal to other eukaryotes (including alveolates and euglenozoans).

Evidence is provided by the near-absence of fossils representing modern orders before the K/T boundary 4. 5. However. fossil-based estimates of divergence time are known to be conservative because of sampling biases 6. and some molecular/time estimates point to earlier divergences among orders 7–10. In an attempt to resolve this controversy. we have estimated times of divergence among avian and mammalian orders with a comprehensive set of genes that exhibit a constant rate of substitution. Here we report molecular estimates of divergence times that average about 50–90% earlier than those predicted by the classical hypothesis. and show that the timing of these divergences coincides …,True,tIpAgQkAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC,546,https://www.nature.com/articles/381226a0,2551123202341461977,/scholar?cites=2551123202341461977,,,0,0,0

1098414,The number of replications needed for accurate estimation of the bootstrap P value in phylogenetic studies.,1992,S Blair Hedges,9,Molecular Biology and Evolution,2,366-369,,The bootstrap is a statistical method for obtaining a nonparametric estimate of error (Efron 1979. 1982). Felsenstein (1985) was the first to apply this method to phylogeny estimation. and his approach is now widely used. Taxa are held constant. and the characters (for sequence data. nucleotide or amino acid sites) are resampled randomly with replacement. A phylogeny is constructed from each replication of the data. and the frequency of appearance of particular phylogenetic groups (groups of alleles or taxa) among all of the trees constructed by this resampling is the bootstrap confidence limit. or bootstrap P value (BP). The BPS of different nodes within a tree can be used to assess the relative stability of those phylogenetic groups or. if applied strictly. to test their statistical significance (eg. at the 95% or 99% level). The application of bootstrapping to phylogeny estimation is a tradeoff between the maximum number of replications that can be performed by the researcher in a reasonable amount of time and the minimum number of replications needed for accurate estimation of the BP. The purpose of the present report is to explore the variance (and hence the accuracy) of the phylogenetic BP and to establish guidelines for efficient bootstrap sampling.BP is the proportion of trees containing a particular phylogenetic group. It therefore follows the binomial distribution. which has a variance of o2=[P (1-P)/n]. where P is the BP and II is the number of replications. Although Li and Gouy (1990) recently suggested that more replications are needed for larger numbers of taxa. the accuracy of the BP is a function only of P and n.

1098417,The timetree of life,2009,S Blair Hedges and Sudhir Kumar,,,,,OUP Oxford,The evolutionary history of life includes two primary components: phylogeny and timescale. Phylogeny refers to the branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of traits and for erecting classifications. However. a timescale is equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny directly with the evolution of other organisms and with planetary history such as geology. climate. extraterrestrial impacts. and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past. biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to infer an evolutionary timescale. However. recent revolutionary advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms. but also to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The routine estimation and utilization of these so-called'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby foster greater communication between molecular and traditional systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable associations between causal historical processes and biological outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues of thought in many arenas …,True,tIpAgQkAAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC,435,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9rt1c1hl49MC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:06Ap8nAUPnIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=PW-GU7hrzg&sig=mFCdxCTZVsyaQ4ArtfYAgyK1qMc,8232039644211552467,/scholar?cites=8232039644211552467,,,0,0,0

Despite this emphasis and the completion of its nuclear genome sequence. the timing of major speciation events leading to the origin of this fruit fly remain elusive because of the paucity of extensive fossil records and biogeographic data. Use of molecular clocks as an alternative has been fraught with non-clock-like accumulation of nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. Here we present a novel methodology in which genomic mutation distances are used to overcome these limitations and to make use of all available gene sequence data for constructing a fruit fly molecular time scale.

Currently. mutation rate is thought to vary many fold among genes within a genome and among lineages in mammals. We have conducted a computational analysis of 5.669 genes (17.208 sequences) from species representing major groups of placental mammals to characterize the extent of mutation rate differences among genes in a genome and among diverse mammalian lineages. We find that mutation rate is approximately constant per year and largely similar among genes. Similarity of mutation rates among lineages with vastly different generation lengths and physiological attributes points to a much greater contribution of replication-independent mutational processes to the overall mutation rate.

These disease-associated mutations (DAMs) are known to occur predominantly in positions essential to the structure and function of the proteins. Here. we examine how the relative perpetuation and conservation of amino acid positions modulate the genome-wide patterns of 8.627 human disease-associated mutations (DAMs) reported in 541 genes. We compare these patterns with 5.308 non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nSNPs) in 2.592 genes from primary SNP resources. The abundance of DAMs shows a negative relationship with the evolutionary rate of the amino acid positions harboring them. An opposite trend describes the distribution of nSNPs. DAMs are also preferentially found in the amino acid positions that are retained (or present) in multiple vertebrate species. whereas the nSNPs are over-abundant in the positions that have been lost (or absent) in the non-human vertebrates. These observations are consistent with the effect of purifying selection on natural variation. which also explains the existence of lower minor nSNP allele frequencies at highly-conserved amino acid positions. The biochemical severity of the inter-specific amino acid changes is also modulated by natural selection. with the fast-evolving positions containing more radical amino acid differences among species. Similarly. DAMs associated with early-onset diseases are more radical than those associated with the late-onset diseases.

1098443,The effects of sample size on population genomic analyses–implications for the tests of neutrality,2016,Sankar Subramanian,17,BMC genomics,,123,BioMed Central,One of the fundamental measures of molecular genetic variation is the Watterson’s estimator (θ). which is based on the number of segregating sites. The estimation of θ is unbiased only under neutrality and constant population growth. It is well known that the estimation of θ is biased when these assumptions are violated. However. the effects of sample size in modulating the bias was not well appreciated. We examined this issue in detail based on large-scale exome data and robust simulations. Our investigation revealed that sample size appreciably influences θ estimation and this effect was much higher for constrained genomic regions than that of neutral regions. For instance. θ estimated for synonymous sites using 512 human exomes was 1.9 times higher than that obtained using 16 exomes. However. this difference was 2.5 times for the nonsynonymous sites of the same data. We observed a positive correlation between the rate of increase in θ estimates (with respect to the sample size) and the magnitude of selection pressure. For example. θ estimated for the nonsynonymous sites of highly constrained genes (dN/dS < 0.1) using 512 exomes was 3.6 times higher than that estimated using 16 exomes. In contrast this difference was only 2 times for the less constrained genes (dN/dS > 0.9).

This assumption is fundamental to estimating the fraction of harmful protein mutations and to identifying adaptive evolution at individual codons and proteins. We show that the assumption is not justifiable because a much larger fraction of codon positions is involved in hypermutable CpG dinucleotides as compared with the introns. leading to a higher expected replacement mutation rate per site in a vast majority of the genes. Consideration of this difference reveals a higher intensity of purifying natural selection than previously inferred in human genes.

The timing of the origin of these extant penguins remains controversial. Previous studies based on DNA sequences and fossil records have suggested widely differing times for the origin of the group.

Using these data and other available DNA sequences. together with the ages of multiple penguin fossils to calibrate the molecular clock. we estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant penguins to be 20.4 Myr (17.0–23.8 Myr).

1098454,SLEP: Sparse learning with efficient projections,2009,Jun Liu and Shuiwang Ji and Jieping Ye,6,Arizona State University,491,7,,The underlying representations of many real-world processes are often sparse. For example. in disease diagnosis. even though humans have a large number of genes. only a small number of them contribute to certain disease [16. 17]. In neuroscience. the neural representation of sounds in the auditory cortex of unanesthetized animals is sparse. since the fraction of neurons that are active at a given instant is typically small [20]. In signal processing. many natural signals are sparse in that they have concise representations when expressed under a proper basis [7]. Therefore. finding sparse representations is fundamentally important in many fields of science. The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in the search for sparse representations of data. l1-Norm Regularization Most existing work on sparse learning are based on a variant of the l1 norm regularization due to its sparsity-inducing property. convenient convexity. strong theoretical guarantees. and great empirical success in various applications.

We consider the l2. 1-norm regularized regression model for joint feature selection from multiple tasks. which can be derived in the probabilistic framework by assuming a suitable prior from the exponential family. One appealing feature of the l2. 1-norm regularization is that it encourages multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns. However. the resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve due to the non-smoothness of the l2. 1-norm regularization. In this paper. we propose to accelerate the computation by reformulating it as two equivalent smooth convex optimization problems which are then solved via the Nesterov's method-an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. A key building block in solving the reformulations is the Euclidean projection. We show that the Euclidean projection for the first reformulation can be analytically computed. while the Euclidean projection for the second one can be computed in linear time.

Many existing approaches formulate this problem as a general low-rank matrix approximation problem. Since the rank operator is nonconvex and discontinuous. most of the recent theoretical studies use the nuclear norm as a convex relaxation. One major limitation of the existing approaches based on nuclear norm minimization is that all the singular values are simultaneously minimized. and thus the rank may not be well approximated in practice.

An accurate prediction model can help the city pre-allocate resources to meet travel demand and to reduce empty taxis on streets which waste energy and worsen the traffic congestion. With the increasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing (in China). we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously. How to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting and critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly rely on time series forecasting techniques. which fail to model the complex non-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as image classification by learning the complex features and correlations from large-scale data. This breakthrough has inspired researchers to explore deep learning techniques on traffic prediction problems. However. existing methods on traffic prediction have only considered spatial relation (eg. using CNN) or temporal relation (eg. using LSTM) independently. We propose a Deep Multi-View Spatial-Temporal Network (DMVST-Net) framework to model both spatial and temporal relations. Specifically. our proposed model consists of three views: temporal view (modeling correlations between future demand values with near time points via LSTM). spatial view (modeling local spatial correlation via local CNN). and semantic view (modeling correlations among regions sharing similar temporal patterns …,True,T9AzhwcAAAAJ:Eu_4uSHeUgAC,399,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11836,6257175571523374999,/scholar?cites=6257175571523374999,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11836/11695,0,0,0

ULDA was previously proposed for feature extraction and dimension reduction. whereas OLDA is a novel algorithm proposed in this paper. The features in the reduced space of ULDA are uncorrelated. while the discriminant vectors of OLDA are orthogonal to each other.

1098461,Malsar: Multi-task learning via structural regularization,2011,Jiayu Zhou and Jianhui Chen and Jieping Ye,21,Arizona State University,,,,In many real-world applications we deal with multiple related classification/regression/clustering tasks. For example. in the prediction of therapy outcome (Bickel et al.. 2008). the tasks of predicting the effectiveness of several combinations of drugs are related. In the prediction of disease progression. the prediction of outcome at each time point can be considered as a task and these tasks are temporally related (Zhou et al.. 2011b). A simple approach is to solve these tasks independently. ignoring the task relatedness. In multitask learning. these related tasks are learnt simultaneously by extracting and utilizing appropriate shared information across tasks. Learning multiple related tasks simultaneously effectively increases the sample size for each task. and improves the prediction performance. Thus multi-task learning is especially beneficial when the training sample size is small for each task. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between traditional single task learning (STL) and multi-task learning (MTL). In STL. each task is considered to be independent and learnt independently. In MTL. multiple tasks are learnt simultaneously. by utilizing task relatedness.,True,T9AzhwcAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC,313,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.310.4106&rep=rep1&type=pdf,9777987872107599831,/scholar?cites=9777987872107599831,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.310.4106&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

It has been used widely in many applications involving high-dimensional data. such as image and text classification. An intrinsic limitation of classical LDA is the so-called singularity problems; that is. it fails when all scatter matrices are singular. Many LDA extensions were proposed in the past to overcome the singularity problems. Among these extensions. PCA+LDA. a two-stage method. received relatively more attention. In PCA+LDA. the LDA stage is preceded by an intermediate dimension reduction stage using principal component analysis (PCA). Most previous LDA extensions are computationally expensive. and not scalable. due to the use of singular value decomposition or generalized singular value decomposition.

It is applicable regardless of the relative sizes of the data dimension and sample size. overcoming a limitation of classical LDA. The optimization problem can be solved analytically by applying the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) technique. The pseudoinverse has been suggested and used for undersampled problems in the past. where the data dimension exceeds the number of data points.

Alternating structure optimization (ASO) is a popular MTL method that learns a shared low-dimensional predictive structure on hypothesis spaces from multiple related tasks.

1098470,A general iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm for non-convex regularized optimization problems,2013,Pinghua Gong and Changshui Zhang and Zhaosong Lu and Jianhua Huang and Jieping Ye,,,,37-45,PMLR,Non-convex sparsity-inducing penalties have recently received considerable attentions in sparse learning. Recent theoretical investigations have demonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse learning settings. However. solving the non-convex optimization problems associated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used approach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming). which relaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This approach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its computational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem. In this paper. we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem for a large class of non-convex penalties. The GIST algorithm iteratively solves a proximal operator problem. which in turn has a closed-form solution for many commonly used penalties. At each outer iteration of the algorithm. we use a line search initialized by the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) rule that allows finding an appropriate step size quickly. The paper also presents a detailed convergence analysis of the GIST algorithm.

However. the relatively large number of genome sequences currently available has provided a better opportunity to control for potential biases such as horizontal gene transfer and rate differences among lineages. We assembled a data set of sequences from 32 proteins (~7600 amino acids) common to 72 species and estimated phylogenetic relationships and divergence times with a local clock method. Our phylogenetic results support most of the currently recognized higher-level groupings of prokaryotes. Of particular interest is a well-supported group of three major lineages of eubacteria (Actinobacteria.

Increasingly larger datasets encompassing greater taxonomic diversity are becoming available to generate molecular timetrees by using sophisticated methods that model rate variation among lineages.

In phylogenetic inference applications. this translates into very large data sets that yield evolutionary and functional inferences with extremely small variances and high statistical confidence (P value).

Previous studies on the mitochondrial genome concluded that Plasmodium in primates. including those parasitic to humans. radiated relatively recently during a process where host switches were common. Those investigations. however. assumed constant rate of evolution and tightly bound (fixed) calibration points based on host fossils or host distribution. We investigate the effect of such assumptions using different molecular dating methods. We include parasites from Lemuroidea since their distribution provides an external validation to time estimates allowing us to disregard scenarios that cannot explain their introduction in Madagascar.

Previous studies have shown contrasting evidence in favor of both neutral and selective mechanisms of evolution for different sets of LCRs suggesting that modes of identification of these regions may play a role in our ability to discern their evolutionary history. To further investigate this issue. we used a multiple threshold approach to identify species-specific profiles of proteome complexity and. by comparing properties of these sets. determine the influence that starting parameters have on evolutionary inferences. We find that. although qualitatively similar. quantitatively each species has a unique LCR profile which represents the frequency of these regions within each genome. Inferences based on these profiles are more accurate in comparative analyses of genome complexity as they allow to determine the relative complexity of multiple genomes as well as the type of repetitiveness that is most common in each. Based on the multiple threshold LCR sets obtained. we identified predominant evolutionary mechanisms at different complexity levels. which show neutral mechanisms acting on highly repetitive LCRs (e.g.. homopolymers) and selective forces becoming more important as heterogeneity of the LCRs increases. Our results show how inferences based on LCRs are influenced by the parameters used to identify these regions.

At the core of the uncertainty is a poor understanding of the mechanisms that regulate their retention in genomes. whether driven by natural selection or neutral evolution. Applying a comparative approach of LCRs to multiple strains and species is a powerful approach to identify patterns of conservation in these regions. Using this method. we investigate the evolutionary history of LCRs in the genus Plasmodium based on orthologous protein coding genes shared by 11 species and strains from primate and rodent-infecting pathogens. We find multiple lines of evidence in support of natural selection as a major evolutionary force shaping the composition and conservation of LCRs through time and signatures that their evolutionary paths are species specific.

1098497,Molecular clock: testing,2011,Fabia Ursula Battistuzzi and Alan J Filipski and Sudhir Kumar,,eLS,,,American Cancer Society,The molecular clock hypothesis originally rested on the assumption of rate constancy across lineages of a phylogeny. which would produce an approximately steady rate of accumulation of deoxyribonucleic acid or amino acid changes through time. This assumption has been questioned on the basis of increasingly large data sets. which have shown significant variability of rates in evolutionary lineages. To address this issue. tests have been developed to examine whether rates of molecular evolution vary significantly among taxonomic groups or phylogenetic lineages. Two major types of tests exist: those based on comparisons of genetic distances and those based on likelihood ratios. The first ones compare genetic distances between two species (or groups of species) relative to an outgroup; the latter ones compare maximum likelihood values for the same phylogeny calculated with and without the constant rate …,True,6mr6eWQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001803.pub2,13577207534227219138,/scholar?cites=13577207534227219138,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.414.3763&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The estimation of the pangenome of a species is a solution to this issue as it provides an overview of genes that are shared by all strains and genes that are present in only some of the genomes. These different sets of genes can then be analyzed functionally to explore correlations with unique phenotypes and adaptations. This protocol presents the usage of Roary. a Linux-native pangenome application. Roary is a straightforward software that provides 1) an overview about core and accessory genes for those interested in general trends and. also. 2) detailed information on gene presence/absence in each genome for in-depth analyses.

Correlated and independent branch rates have emerged as two major competing models. The independent branch rate (IBR) model posits that evolutionary rates vary randomly throughout a phylogeny. in contrast to the alternative that these rates are correlated (CBR). However. currently available statistical tests lack sufficient power to reject the IBR model. which has caused many controversies because very different biological inferences are produced by the use of these models.We have developed a new method (CorrTest) to accurately detect the correlation of branch rates in large phylogenies. CorrTest is computationally efficient. and it performs better than the available state-of-the-art methods. CorrTest9s application to multigene and genome-scale sequence alignments from mammals. birds. insects. metazoans. plants. fungi. and prokaryotes. suggests that DNA and amino acid sequence evolutionary rates are correlated throughout the tree of life.

1098500,Quantifying the error of secondary vs. distant primary calibrations in a simulated environment,2020,Christopher Lowell Edward Powell and Sydney Waskin and Fabia Ursula Battistuzzi,11,Frontiers in genetics,,252,Frontiers,Using calibrations to obtain absolute divergence times is standard practice in molecular clock studies. While the use of primary (e.g.. fossil) calibrations is preferred. this approach can be limiting because of their rarity in fast-growing datasets. Thus. alternatives need to be explored. such as the use of secondary (molecularly-derived) calibrations that can anchor a timetree in a larger number of nodes. However. the use of secondary calibrations has been discouraged in the past because of concerns in the error rates of the node estimates they produce with an apparent high precision. Here. we quantify the amount of errors in estimates produced by the use of secondary calibrations relative to true times and primary calibrations placed on distant nodes. We find that. overall. the inaccuracies in estimates based on secondary calibrations are predictable and mirror errors associated with primary calibrations and their confidence intervals. Additionally. we find comparable error rates in estimated times from secondary calibrations and distant primary calibrations. although the precision of estimates derived from distant primary calibrations is roughly twice as good as that of estimates derived from secondary calibrations. This suggests that increasing dataset size to include primary calibration may produce divergence times that are about as accurate as those from secondary calibrations. albeit with a higher precision. Overall. our results suggest that secondary calibrations may be useful to explore the parameter space of plausible evolutionary scenarios when compared to time estimates obtained with distant primary calibrations.,True,6mr6eWQAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,1,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00252/full?report=reader,4728877985858261124,/scholar?cites=4728877985858261124,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00252/full?report=reader,0,0,0

1098503,Evolutionary Dynamics of Overlapped Genes in Salmonella,2013,Yingqin Luo and Fabia Battistuzzi and Kui Lin,8,Plos one,11,e81016,Public Library of Science,Presence of overlapping genes (OGs) is a common phenomenon in bacterial genomes. Most frequently. overlapping genes share coding regions with as few as one nucleotide to as many as thousands of nucleotides. Overlapping genes are often co-regulated. transcriptionally and translationally. Overlapping genes are also subject to the whims of evolution. as the gene overlap is known to be disrupted in some species/strains and participating genes are sometimes lost in independent lineages. Therefore. a better understanding of evolutionary patterns and rates of the disruption of overlapping genes is an important component of genome structure and evolution of gene function. In this study. we investigate the fate of ancestrally overlapping genes in complete genomes from 15 contemporary strains of Salmonella species. We find that the fates of overlapping genes inside and outside operons are distinctly different. A larger fraction of overlapping genes inside operons conserves their overlap as compared to gene pairs outside of the operons (average 0.89 vs. 0.83 per genome). However. when overlapping genes in the operons separate. one partner is lost more frequently than in those separated genes outside of operons (average 0.02 vs. 0.01 per genome). We also investigate the fate of a pan set of overlapping genes at the present and ancestral nodes over a phylogenetic tree based on genome sequence data. respectively. We propose that co-regulation plays important roles on the fates of genes. Furthermore. a vast majority of disruptions occurred prior to the common ancestor of all 15 Salmonella strains. which enables us to obtain an …,True,6mr6eWQAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081016,18229606315650758511,/scholar?cites=18229606315650758511,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081016,0,0,0

For example. in disease diagnosis. even though humans have a large number of genes. only a small number of them contribute to certain disease [16. 17]. In neuroscience. the neural representation of sounds in the auditory cortex of unanesthetized animals is sparse. since the fraction of neurons that are active at a given instant is typically small [20]. In signal processing. many natural signals are sparse in that they have concise representations when expressed under a proper basis [7]. Therefore. finding sparse representations is fundamentally important in many fields of science. The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in the search for sparse representations of data. l1-Norm Regularization Most existing work on sparse learning are based on a variant of the l1 norm regularization due to its sparsity-inducing property. convenient convexity. strong theoretical guarantees. and great empirical success in various applications.

We consider the l2. 1-norm regularized regression model for joint feature selection from multiple tasks. which can be derived in the probabilistic framework by assuming a suitable prior from the exponential family. One appealing feature of the l2. 1-norm regularization is that it encourages multiple predictors to share similar sparsity patterns. However. the resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve due to the non-smoothness of the l2. 1-norm regularization. In this paper. we propose to accelerate the computation by reformulating it as two equivalent smooth convex optimization problems which are then solved via the Nesterov's method-an optimal first-order black-box method for smooth convex optimization. A key building block in solving the reformulations is the Euclidean projection. We show that the Euclidean projection for the first reformulation can be analytically computed. while the Euclidean projection for the second one can be computed in linear time.

1098512,Hypergraph spectral learning for multi-label classification,2008,Liang Sun and Shuiwang Ji and Jieping Ye,,,,668-676,,A hypergraph is a generalization of the traditional graph in which the edges are arbitrary non-empty subsets of the vertex set. It has been applied successfully to capture high-order relations in various domains. In this paper. we propose a hypergraph spectral learning formulation for multi-label classification. where a hypergraph is constructed to exploit the correlation information among different labels. We show that the proposed formulation leads to an eigenvalue problem. which may be computationally expensive especially for large-scale problems. To reduce the computational cost. we propose an approximate formulation. which is shown to be equivalent to a least squares problem under a mild condition.

1098514,Graph U-Nets,2019,Hongyang Gao and Shuiwang Ji,,,,2083-2092,,We consider the problem of representation learning for graph data. Convolutional neural networks can naturally operate on images. but have significant challenges in dealing with graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with nodes lie on 2D lattices. graph embedding tasks have a natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder architectures like U-Nets have been successfully applied on many image pixel-wise prediction tasks. similar methods are lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To address these challenges. we propose novel graph pooling (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this work. The gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable projection vector. We further propose the gUnpool layer as the inverse operation of the gPool layer. The gUnpool layer restores the graph into its original structure using the position information of nodes selected in the corresponding gPool layer. Based on our proposed gPool and gUnpool layers. we develop an encoder-decoder model on graph. known as the graph U-Nets.

In CNNs. the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However. the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs. thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here. we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL).

1098522,Multi-class Discriminant Kernel Learning via Convex Programming.,2008,Jieping Ye and Shuiwang Ji and Jianhui Chen,9,Journal of Machine Learning Research,4,,,Regularized kernel discriminant analysis (RKDA) performs linear discriminant analysis in the feature space via the kernel trick. Its performance depends on the selection of kernels. In this paper. we consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL) for RKDA. in which the optimal kernel matrix is obtained as a linear combination of pre-specified kernel matrices. We show that the kernel learning problem in RKDA can be formulated as convex programs. First. we show that this problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP). Based on the equivalence relationship between RKDA and least square problems in the binary-class case. we propose a convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) formulation for kernel learning in RKDA. A semi-infinite linear programming (SILP) formulation is derived to further improve the efficiency. We extend these formulations to the multi-class case based on a key result established in this paper. That is. the multi-class RKDA kernel learning problem can be decomposed into a set of binary-class kernel learning problems which are constrained to share a common kernel. Based on this decomposition property. SDP formulations are proposed for the multi-class case. Furthermore. it leads naturally to QCQP and SILP formulations. As the performance of RKDA depends on the regularization parameter. we show that this parameter can also be optimized in a joint framework with the kernel.

We further extend the equivalence relationship to the case when regularization is employed for both sets of variables. In addition. we show that the CCA projection for one set of variables is independent of the regularization on the other set of variables. We have performed experimental studies using both synthetic and real data sets and our results confirm the established equivalence relationship. The presented analysis provides novel insights into the connection between these two existing algorithms as well as the effect of the regularization.,True,BZGj6sAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,72,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jieping_Ye/publication/220812172_On_the_Equivalence_between_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_and_Orthonormalized_Partial_Least_Squares/links/00b7d51ae9869366ef000000/On-the-Equivalence-between-Canonical-Correlation-Analysis-and-Orthonormalized-Partial-Least-Squares.pdf,17357310362997797772,/scholar?cites=17357310362997797772,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jieping_Ye/publication/220812172_On_the_Equivalence_between_Canonical_Correlation_Analysis_and_Orthonormalized_Partial_Least_Squares/links/00b7d51ae9869366ef000000/On-the-Equivalence-between-Canonical-Correlation-Analysis-and-Orthonormalized-Partial-Least-Squares.pdf,0,0,0

This paper reviews many of the methods and describes the relationships among them. both mathematically. using the cross‐product as a unifying principle. and conceptually. based on the form of a moving window or template used in calculation.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Phylogenetic trees from multiple genes can be obtained in two fundamentally different ways. In one. gene sequences are concatenated into a super‐gene alignment. which is then analyzed to generate the species tree. In the other. phylogenies are inferred separately from each gene. and a consensus of these gene phylogenies is used to represent the species tree. Here. we have compared these two approaches by means of computer simulation. using 448 parameter sets. including evolutionary rate. sequence length. base composition. and transition/transversion rate bias.

Researchers should use caution when making inferences about gene flow. especially when the spatial extent of the study area is limited.

Insufficient taxon sampling is often cited as a significant source of error in phylogenetic studies. and consequently. acquisition of large data sets is advocated. To test this assertion. we have conducted computer simulation studies by using natural collections of evolutionary parameters—rates of evolution. species sampling. and gene lengths—determined from data available in genomic databases.

Comparisons between hypothesized alignments and true alignments enabled determination of two measures of alignment accuracy. that of the total data set and that of individual branches.

Almost all previous studies. however. have concentrated on intraspecific variation and have not examined claw variation among species. In this study. modern methods of describing shape and size. geometric morphometrics. are used to study claw variation across the genus.

1098548,Taxon sampling. bioinformatics. and phylogenomics,2003,Michael S Rosenberg and Sudhir Kumar,52,Systematic biology,1,119-124,NIH Public Access,Taxon sampling is often thought to be of extreme importance for phylogenetic inference. and increased sampling of taxa is commonly advocated as a solution to resolving problematic phylogenies. Another solution is to increase the number of sites (by sequencing additional genes) sampled for each taxon. In an ideal world. one would like to increase samples of both taxa and genes. but taxon sampling has not kept up with the pace of gene sampling increase because of the increasing ease and emphasis on genome sequencing.The question of taxon sampling is necessarily driven by resource limitation. The precise scope of “sufficient” taxon sampling is always dependent on questions being addressed. If we need to know the complete phylogeny of a genus. we must sample the genus exhaustively. In experimental design. partial sampling is an issue only when certain taxa can stand as proxies for the clades to …,True,exyen9EAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,136,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796430/,1525835959113306773,/scholar?cites=1525835959113306773,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796430/,0,0,0

1098549,Publication and Related Biases,2013,Michael D Jennions and Christopher J Lortie and Michael S Rosenberg and Hannah R Rothstein,,Handbook of Meta-analysis in Ecology and Evolution,,207,Princeton University Press,INCREASED USE OF META-ANALYSIS in ecology and evolution has stimulated greater consideration of the occurrence of publication bias in the scientific literature. A search of Web of Science showed that prior to 1995 no papers in ecology or evolution journals used the term “publication bias” in their title. abstract. or keywords (Fig. 14.1). More frequent occurrence of this term since 1995 seems to coincide with the promotion of meta-analysis in widely read ecology and evolution journals (eg. Arnqvist and Wooster 1995a) and a subsequent increase in the publication of meta-analyses (Chapter 25). It is noteworthy that of the 84 papers we located using the search term “publication bias.” 54 also had “meta-analysis” in the title or as a keyword. Clearly. publication of meta-analyses has prompted researchers to reevaluate publication practices in ecology and evolution (Møller and Jennions 2001). It is ironic that the quantitative methods associated with meta-analysis have shed the most light on the problem (Song and Gilbody 1998). because the very quantification of potential problems has led to claims that meta-analysis itself is flawed if publication bias is so rife that we cannot estimate the true magnitude. or sources of variance. in effect sizes. Blaming meta-analysis is akin to shooting the messenger (Alex Sutton. pers. comm.). Unfortunately. when publication bias is suspected. this has led some to throw the baby out with bathwater and suggest that meta-analysis is of little value (for an example of this debate. see Kotiaho and Tomkins 2002. Jennions et al. 2004. and Tomkins and Kotiaho 2004).We offer five short responses to this pessimistic view …,True,exyen9EAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC,115,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=y-BjX58AXsQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA207&dq=info:Zoih5jHkXyEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_jesLyyXlL&sig=RSO-oma9e1YrVdD-Hd916MjOL4o,2404891629013010534,/scholar?cites=2404891629013010534,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jakelyne_Sousa2/post/Is-there-any-minimum-number-for-studies-that-should-be-included-in-meta-analysis/attachment/5ee909274c18f900012a1d89/AS%3A903113871474694%401592330534970/download/Koricheva_2013_Handbook+of+meta-analysis+in+ecology+and+evolution.pdf#page=224,0,0,0

1098551,Effect sizes: conventional choices and calculations,2013,M Rosenberg and H Rothstein and Jessica Gurevitch,,Handbook of Meta-analysis in Ecology and Evolution,,61-71,Princeton University Press,ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL concepts in meta-analysis is that of the effect size. It is this concept that allowed the development of modern meta-analysis. An effect size is a statistical parameter that can be used to compare. on the same scale. the results of different studies in which a common effect of interest has been measured. There is no universal effect size measure in metaanalysis; it depends on a number of considerations. including the nature of dependent variables (eg. binary or continuous) and whether we are comparing two groups or looking at one group (eg. over time). In experimental studies. the effect size is a measurement of the response of the subjects to an experimental treatment relative to a control group or another treatment. In observational studies. the effect size may be the relationship between two variables of interest. The choice of effect size depends. in part. on the type of data available from primary studies and on the common ways of expressing outcomes in a given field. Different methods of estimating effect size have been developed for different questions and types of data; for some data sets multiple effect sizes may be possible. for others there is likely to be only one choice. For example. one may be interested in the effect of increased (measured as total biomass). One might use the ratio of biomass atmospheric production CO2 on in plant growth ambient and elevated the difference slope of a CO regression 2 conditions in mean of biomass as a measure production of effect; in ambient alternatively. and elevated this effect CO2 could treatments. be measured or as the asAll of these can be valid biomass production …,True,exyen9EAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC,107,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=y-BjX58AXsQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA61&dq=info:8M8NT16whsYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_jesLyyXlP&sig=YC2Vtt46DzbP0eklY5uGXoDNp_w,14305315185488678896,/scholar?cites=14305315185488678896,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jakelyne_Sousa2/post/Is-there-any-minimum-number-for-studies-that-should-be-included-in-meta-analysis/attachment/5ee909274c18f900012a1d89/AS%3A903113871474694%401592330534970/download/Koricheva_2013_Handbook+of+meta-analysis+in+ecology+and+evolution.pdf#page=78,0,0,0

Changes in nucleotide frequency among different lineages in a data set are thought to lead to erroneous phylogenetic inference because unrelated clades may appear similar because of evolutionarily unrelated similarities in nucleotide frequencies.

They coded ontogenetic regressions of shape on size to obtain discrete characters. which they used as input into a parsimony analysis. As shape variables. they used partial warp scores obtained from an analysis based on thin-plate splines (TPS). which. they had previously argued. could be considered homologous characters and could be used to determine synapomorphies on a phylogenetic tree (Zelditch et al.. 1995). Here we discuss several aspects of their protocol that call into question their assertion that the ontogeny of shape (as represented by discrete characterizations of regressions of partial warp scores) is a suitable character set for phylogeny estimation.

Tubulins are a family of eukaryotic structural genes that form microtubules. fundamental components of the cytoskeleton that mediate cell division. shape. motility. and intracellular trafficking. Previous in vivo studies in Drosophila find a stringent relationship between tubulin structure and function; small. biochemically similar changes in the major alpha 1 or testis-specific beta 2 tubulin protein render each unable to generate a motile spermtail axoneme. This has evolutionary implications. not a single non-synonymous substitution is found in beta 2 among 17 species of Drosophila and Hirtodrosophila flies spanning 60 Myr of evolution. This raises an important question. How do tubulins evolve while maintaining their function? To answer. we use molecular evolutionary analyses to characterize the evolution of insect tubulins. Sixty-six alpha tubulins and eighty-six beta tubulin gene copies were retrieved and subjected to molecular evolutionary analyses. Four ancient clades of alpha and beta tubulins are found in insects. a major isoform clade (alpha 1. beta 1) and three minor. tissue-specific clades (alpha 2-4. beta 2-4).

These rearrangements disrupt the structural similarity between genomes. with each rearrangement producing additional. albeit shorter. conserved segments. Here we propose a simple statistical approach on the basis of the distribution of the number of markers in contiguous sets of autosomal markers (CSAMs) to estimate the number of conserved segments. CSAM identification requires information on the relative locations of orthologous markers in one genome and only the chromosome number on which each marker resides in the other genome. We propose a simple mathematical model that can account for the effect of the nonuniformity of the breakpoints and markers on the observed distribution …,True,JvQXCy8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,25,https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/157/3/1387/6048336,1901499093260432774,/scholar?cites=1901499093260432774,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/157/3/1387.full.pdf,0,0,0

1098565,The impact of sequence parameter values on phylogenetic accuracy,2009,Bhakti Dwivedi and Sudhindra R Gadagkar,1,Biol Med,3,50-62,,An accurately inferred phylogeny is important to the study of molecular evolution. Factors affecting the accuracy of a phylogenetic tree can be traced to several sequential steps leading to the inference of the phylogeny. I examine here the features of the sequences in the alignment which impact phylogenetic (topological) accuracy rather than any source of error during the process of sequence alignment or choice of the method of inference. Specifically. I study the implications of the following five parameters. individually and in combination: sequence length. substitution rate. nucleotide base composition. the transition-transversion rate ratio and the rate heterogeneity among the sites. It is found that the transition-transversion rate ratio or kappa has a significant impact on phylogenetic accuracy. with a strong positive interaction with accuracy at high substitution rates. contrary to general belief. This work on known expected tree has implications for the researcher in field and would enable them to choose from among the multiple genes typically available today for an accurate phylogenetic inference. In addition. the increased accuracy with increase in kappa suggest that the phylogenetic signal may be strong in the nucleotide sites that have experienced considerable number of transversion than transition substitutions and thus can be useful in inference of a meaningful phylogeny.,True,JvQXCy8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,9,https://biolmedonline.com/Articles/vol1_3_50-63.pdf,18308785103732692820,/scholar?cites=18308785103732692820,,https://biolmedonline.com/Articles/vol1_3_50-63.pdf,0,0,0

1098571,Women in fisheries in India,1990,Sudhindra R Gadagkar,,Proceedings of the Workshop on Women in Indian Fisheries,,,,Ours has been a man-dominated world from the very beginning. In earlier times. the role of women was largely restricted to the household and their participation in other spheres of activities was practically non-existent. This situation was mainly due to ignorance and a misconception about the skills of women and man’s own conception of his superiority. This situation is very aptly reflected by the commonly used expression of ̒ ‘weaker sex’while referring to women. In spite of the very impressive technological and sociological progress the world has witnessed during the present century. women are yet to participate in various activities on an equal footing with men. Misconceptions. taboos and superstitions still persist in many of the underdeveloped and developing countries. This prompted the United Nations to declare the 1980s as the ‘Decade of the Women'. during which period activities were initiated all over the world to uplift the status. role and welfare of women. This declaration was due to the realization of the enormous loss of economic and social benefits by not involving women adequately in the development process in general. and the agricultural and rural sectors in particular.The involvement of women in the fisheries sector in India in earlier times was largely restricted to retail sale of fish and simple indigenous methods of fish processing. The emergence of modern fish processing industries provided a new avenue of employment to innumerable women.

This is generally easily achieved when the harvest is meant to cater only to the homestead. as it still is in many parts of the third world. In eastern India. for instance. the culture pond is generally a multi-purpose backyard pond from which a ﬁsh or two are caught periodically. for home consumption (pers. obs.). It is easy to visualize a situation where. if the ﬁsh caught on any given day is suﬁﬁciently large for that day’s meal supplement. it gets eaten; if not it goes back into the pond and another is ﬁshed out.

The fluctuation in the landings in all the fisheries was very high with the coefficient of variation attaining a minimum value of 61.53%. The inverse relationship between the landings of oil sardine and mackerel was found to be statistically significant. It is suggested that fishing effort be further increased in fisheries that have demonstrated a rising trend (about 73% of the total annual landings) as also in the case of the fisheries whose trends appear stagnant (about 21% of the annual landings).

1098577,Investigating the possible role of roadways in the dispersal of the invasive shrub Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) in southwestern Ohio.,2007,Sudhindra R Gadagkar and Mary K Roberts and Donald R Geiger,,,,,,The Amur Honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) was introduced into North America in arboreta from its native northeast Asia approximately one hundred years ago. However. with time. it escaped cultivation and became invasive. spreading and displacing native flora in the eastern United States and parts of Canada. Today. it is considered noxious in 24 states in the eastern United States. This study was undertaken to determine the mode of spread of the honeysuckle in southwestern Ohio. focusing mainly on the role of disturbed areas. particularly roadways. in aiding its dispersal. Surveys of the presence and the density of the shrub were conducted along major and minor roadways radiating out from the city of Dayton. Locations of discrete fronts (sites along a roadway beyond which the shrub was no longer seen). were determined by recording the geographical coordinates with a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. Fronts were found to the north. northeast. east and southeast of Dayton. The distribution was very extensive to the south and southwest of Dayton. showing no readily discernible front in a survey radius of over 80 km (50 miles) in these directions. This pattern of distribution is consistent with the reported dispersal of the shrub from centers of origin in the Oxford. Ohio area and southern Hamilton County. where L. maackii was first introduced in horticultural plantings in the 1960s.

Nonetheless. IgD was detectable in some but not all of the Holstein cattle examined. Membrane-bound IgD was detected in the spleen by western blotting. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that IgD-positive B cells constituted a much lower percentage of B cells in the bovine spleen (∼6.8% of total B cells). jejunal Peyer's patches (∼0.8%). and peripheral blood leukocytes (∼1.2%) than in humans and mice. Furthermore. IgD-positive B cells were almost undetectable in bovine bone marrow and ileal Peyer's patches.

Accordingly. bovine δ germline transcription. which involves an Iδ exon and is highly homologous to Iμ. was confirmed.

They reveal the temporal history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is. temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here. we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches. and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets. we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets. RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD. TreeTime. and treedater). we found that no method performed the best in every scenario. So. we provide a brief guideline for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis.

1098598,Molecular dating for phylogenies containing a mix of populations and species by using Bayesian and RelTime approaches,2021,Beatriz Mello and Qiqing Tao and Jose Barba‐Montoya and Sudhir Kumar,,Molecular Ecology Resources,,,,Simultaneous molecular dating of population and species divergences is essential in many biological investigations. including phylogeography. phylodynamics and species delimitation studies. In these investigations. multiple sequence alignments consist of both intra‐ and interspecies samples (mixed samples). As a result. the phylogenetic trees contain interspecies. interpopulation and within‐population divergences. Bayesian relaxed clock methods are often employed in these analyses. but they assume the same tree prior for both inter‐ and intraspecies branching processes and require specification of a clock model for branch rates (independent vs. autocorrelated rates models). We evaluated the impact of a single tree prior on Bayesian divergence time estimates by analysing computer‐simulated data sets.

However. the actual extent of the difference between time estimates produced by highly complex models compared with those from simple models is yet to be quantified for contemporary data sets that frequently contain sequences from many species and genes. In a reanalysis of many large multispecies alignments from diverse groups of taxa. we found that the use of the simplest models can produce divergence time estimates and credibility intervals similar to those obtained from the complex models applied in the original studies. This result is surprising because the use of simple models underestimates sequence divergence for all the data sets analyzed.

No software tools for molecular dating allow researchers to relax these two assumptions in their data analyses. Frequently the same General Time Reversible (GTR) model across lineages along with a gamma (+Γ) distributed rates across sites is used in relaxed clock analyses. which assumes time-reversibility and stationarity of the substitution process.

1098601,Molecular and morphological clocks for estimating evolutionary divergence times,2020,Jose Barba-Montoya and Qiqing Tao and Sudhir Kumar,,,,,,Background: Matrices of morphological characters are frequently used for dating species divergence 20 times in systematics. In some studies. morphological and molecular character data from living taxa 21 are combined. whereas others use morphological characters from extinct taxa as well. We investigated 22 whether morphological data produce time estimates that are concordant with molecular data. If true. it 23 will justify the use of morphological characters alongside molecular data in divergence time 24 inference. 25Results: We systematically analyzed three empirical datasets from different species groups to test the 26 concordance of dates of species divergence inferred using molecular and discrete morphological data 27 from extant taxa as test cases. We found a high correlation between their divergence time estimates. 28 despite a poor linear relationship between branch lengths for morphological and molecular data 29 mapped onto the same phylogeny. This was because node-to-tip distances showed a much higher 30 correlation than branch lengths. because of an averaging effect over multiple branches. We found that 31 nodes with a large number of taxa often benefit from such averaging. but some considerable 32 discordance between time estimates from molecules and morphology may still occur because some 33 deeper branches show large difference from two types of data. 34 Conclusions: Our findings suggest that node-and tip-calibration approaches may be better suited for 35 nodes with a large number of taxa.

Fine mapping of regulatory variants at these loci is a daunting task due to the juxtaposition of causal and linked variants at a locus as well as the likelihood of interactions among multiple variants. This problem is exacerbated in genes with multiple cis-acting eQTL. where superimposed effects of adjacent loci further distort the association signals. Results: We developed a novel algorithm. TreeMap. that identifies putative causal variants in cis-eQTL accounting for multisite effects and genetic linkage at a locus. Guided by the hierarchical structure of linkage disequilibrium. TreeMap performs an organized search for individual and multiple causal variants. Via extensive simulations. we show that TreeMap detects co-regulating variants more accurately than current methods. Furthermore. its high computational efficiency enables genome-wide analysis of long-range eQTL. We applied TreeMap to GTEx data of brain hippocampus samples and transverse colon samples to search for eQTL in gene bodies and in 4 Mbps gene-flanking regions. discovering numerous distal eQTL. Furthermore. we found concordant distal eQTL that were present in both brain and colon samples. implying long-range regulation of gene expression.

Our comparative genomic analyses reveal that amino acid substitutions at “disease-causing” sites are widespread in the rodent genomes and that identical substitutions in long-lived rodents are associated with common adaptive phenotypes. e.g.. enhanced resistance to DNA damage and cellular stress. By employing a newly developed substitution model and likelihood ratio test. we find that energy and fatty acid metabolism pathways are enriched for signals of positive …,True,BfrQYskAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472030930X,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472030930X,0,0,0

Increasingly larger datasets encompassing greater taxonomic diversity are becoming available to generate molecular timetrees by using sophisticated methods that model rate variation among lineages.

However. training a deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data. which is an expensive process in terms of time. labor and human expertise. Domain adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging labeled data in a different. but related source domain. to develop a model for the target domain. Further. the explosive growth of digital data has posed a fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage and retrieval efficiency. recent years have witnessed a wide application of hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper. we first introduce a new dataset. Office-Home. to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms. The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple domains.

To the best of our knowledge. this is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain adaptation problem.

The complexity of the technique can be reduced by representing the histogram by its moments.

1098632,Biased manifold embedding: A framework for person-independent head pose estimation,2007,Vineeth Nallure Balasubramanian and Jieping Ye and Sethuraman Panchanathan,,,,1-7,IEEE,The estimation of head pose angle from face images is an integral component of face recognition systems. human computer interfaces and other human-centered computing applications. To determine the head pose. face images with varying pose angles can be considered to be lying on a smooth low-dimensional manifold in high-dimensional feature space. While manifold learning techniques capture the geometrical relationship between data points in the high-dimensional image feature space. the pose label information of the training data samples are neglected in the computation of these embeddings. In this paper. we propose a novel supervised approach to manifold-based non-linear dimensionality reduction for head pose estimation.

While changes in the properties of SEMG signals with respect to muscle fatigue have been reported in the literature. the large variation in these signals across different individuals makes the task of modeling and classification of SEMG signals challenging.

Often times we have very few or no labeled data from the test or target distribution but may have plenty of labeled data from multiple related sources with different distributions. The difference in distributions may be both in marginal and conditional probabilities. Most of the existing domain adaptation work focuses on the marginal probability distribution difference between the domains. assuming that the conditional probabilities are similar. However in many real world applications. conditional probability distribution differences are as commonplace as marginal probability differences. In this paper we propose a two-stage domain adaptation methodology which combines weighted data from multiple sources based on marginal probability differences (first stage) as well as conditional probability differences (second stage). with the target domain data. The weights for minimizing the marginal probability differences are estimated independently. while the weights for minimizing conditional probability differences are computed simultaneously by exploiting the potential interaction among multiple sources. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization performance of the proposed multi-source domain adaptation formulation using the weighted Rademacher complexity measure.

A majority of indexing techniques are based on pixel domain features such as histogram. color. texture. and shape. However. with recent advances in image compression. compressed domain indexing techniques are gaining popularity due to their low complexity. Recently. a wavelet histogram technique which exploits the directional properties of wavelet transform has been proposed in the literature. Although. this technique provides a good retrieval performance for texture images. its complexity is very high.

A piecewise spatial warping technique is used to calculate a set of correction lookup tables which store the row and column subpixel spatial shifts. based on a reference grid image. Pixel amplitudes in the corrected image are determined from bilinear interpolation of the four surrounding pixels in the observed image. The method has been tested using an x-ray imaging chain with a 30-cm image intensifier positioned at various angular orientations and x-ray source distances.

This paper presents a haptic (vibrotactile) belt to assist individuals who are blind or visually impaired by communicating non-verbal cues during social interactions. We focus on non-verbal communication pertaining to the relative location of the communicators with respect to the user in terms of direction and distance. Results from two experiments show that the haptic belt is effective in using vibration location and duration to communicate the relative direction and distance. respectively. of an individual in the userpsilas visual field.,True,GKTKZ8kAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,87,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4685291/,12141667565647710836,/scholar?cites=12141667565647710836,,https://www.academia.edu/download/7211708/haptic_belt_%20to_convey_non-verbal_cues.pdf,0,0,0

1098650,Experiments on block-matching techniques for video coding,1994,Eric Chan and Arturo A Rodriguez and Rakeshkumar Gandhi and Sethuraman Panchanathan,2,Multimedia Systems,5,228-241,Springer-Verlag,Video compression is becoming increasingly important with the advent of compression standards and broadband networks. Recently. several block-based motion-estimation algorithms to exploit the temporal redundancies in a video sequence have been reported in the literature. Some of these algorithms tend to be either computationally expensive or to converge to a local optimum. In this paper. we present results for various block-matching techniques and propose a low-complexity block-matching motion-estimation algorithm that is useful for hybrid video coding schemes. including MPEG video. This algorithm consists of a layered structure search. and. unlike other fast block-matching methods. it does not converge to a local optimum. The proposed method employs a novel matching criterion. namely. the modified pixeldifference classification (MPDC). that offers simplicity with other potential advantages.,True,GKTKZ8kAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,84,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01215400.pdf,3840317533304536085,/scholar?cites=3840317533304536085,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46449695/bf0121540020160613-24537-1i21vmx.pdf,0,0,0

1098651,Ecological stoichiometry: the biology of elements from molecules to the biosphere,2002,Robert W Sterner and James J Elser,,,,,Princeton university press,"All life is chemical. That fact underpins the developing field of ecological stoichiometry. the study of the balance of chemical elements in ecological interactions. This long-awaited book brings this field into its own as a unifying force in ecology and evolution. Synthesizing a wide range of knowledge. Robert Sterner and Jim Elser show how an understanding of the biochemical deployment of elements in organisms from microbes to metazoa provides the key to making sense of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. After summarizing the chemistry of elements and their relative abundance in Earth's environment. the authors proceed along a line of increasing complexity and scale from molecules to cells. individuals. populations. communities. and ecosystems. The book examines fundamental chemical constraints on ecological phenomena such as competition. herbivory. symbiosis. energy flow in food webs. and organic matter sequestration. In accessible prose and with clear mathematical models. the authors show how ecological stoichiometry can illuminate diverse fields of study. from metabolism to global change. Set to be a classic in the field. Ecological Stoichiometry is an indispensable resource for researchers. instructors. and students of ecology. evolution. physiology. and biogeochemistry.

Under low N deposition. phytoplankton growth is generally N-limited; however. in high–N deposition lakes. phytoplankton growth is consistently P-limited.

Ltd,Biological stoichiometry theory considers the balance of multiple chemical elements in living systems. whereas metabolic scaling theory considers how size affects metabolic properties from cells to ecosystems. We review recent developments integrating biological stoichiometry and metabolic scaling theories in the context of plant ecology and global change. Although vascular plants exhibit wide variation in foliar carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus ratios. they exhibit a higher degree of ‘stoichiometric homeostasis’ than previously appreciated. Thus. terrestrial carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus stoichiometry will reflect the effects of adjustment to local growth conditions as well as species’ replacements. Plant stoichiometry exhibits size scaling. as foliar nutrient concentration decreases with increasing plant size. especially for phosphorus. Thus. small plants have lower nitrogen: phosphorus ratios. Furthermore. foliar nutrient …,True,4FVc21wAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,579,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03214.x@10.1002/(ISSN)1469-8137(CAT)VirtualIssues(VI)Ecologicalstoichiometryglobalchange,18048556753594348188,/scholar?cites=18048556753594348188,,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03214.x%4010.1002/%28ISSN%291469-8137%28CAT%29VirtualIssues%28VI%29Ecologicalstoichiometryglobalchange,0,0,0

In relative terms. nutrient limitation implies excess C. yet the fate of this C may be quite different in autotrophs and heterotrophs. For autotrophs nutrient limitation means less fixation of inorganic C or excretion of organic C. while for heterotrophs nutrient limitation means that more of ingested C will “go to waste” in the form of egestion or respiration. There is in general a mismatch between autotrophs and decomposers that have flexible but generally high C:element ratios. and consumers that have lower C:element ratios and tighter stoichiometric regulation. Thus. C‐use efficiency in food webs may be governed by the element ratios in autotroph biomass and tend to increase when C:element ratios in food approach those of consumers.

Here. we examine the relative balance of light and phosphorus in a set of freshwater pelagic ecosystems. We calculated a ratio of light: phosphorus by putting mixed‐layer mean light in the numerator and total P concentration in the denominator. This light: phosphorus ratio was a good predictor of the C:P ratio of particulate matter (seston). with a positive correlation demonstrated between these two ratios. We argue that the balance between light and nutrients controls “nutrient use efficiency” at the base of the food web in lakes. Thus. when light energy is high relative to nutrient availability. the base of the food web is carbon rich and phosphorus poor. In the opposite case. where light is relatively less available compared to nutrients. the base of the food web is relatively P rich.

A sustainable phosphorus supply is not assured. though. and food production depends on mineral phosphorus supplies that are nonrenewable and are being depleted. Phosphorus is effectively a nonsubstitutable necessity for all life. Because mineral phosphorus deposits are not distributed evenly. future phosphorus scarcity may have national security implications. Some projections show economically viable mineral reserves becoming depleted within a few decades. Phosphorus-induced food shortages are therefore a possibility. particularly in developing countries where farmers are more vulnerable to volatile fertilizer prices.

Advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing and mutagenesis techniques have enabled measurement of the effects of nearly all possible amino acid substitutions in many proteins.

Over 10 000 such laboratory-induced mutations have been reported in the UniProt database along with the outcomes of functional assays. Here. we explore the performance of state-of-the-art computational tools (Condel. PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) in correctly annotating the function-altering potential of 10 913 laboratory-induced mutations from 2372 proteins. We find that computational tools are very successful in diagnosing laboratory-induced mutations that elicit significant functional change in the laboratory (up to 92% accuracy). But. these tools consistently fail in correctly annotating laboratory-induced mutations that show no functional impact in the laboratory assays.

Despite their functional importance and reported involvement in many diseases. evolutionary analyses have produced enigmatic results because only weak or no selective pressures have been attributed to many types of PTMs. In a large-scale analysis of 16.836 PTM positions from 4.484 human proteins. we find that positions harboring PTMs show evidence of higher purifying selection in 70% of the phosphorylated and N-linked glycosylated proteins. The purifying selection is up to 42% more severe at PTM residues as compared with the corresponding unmodified amino acids. These results establish extensive selective pressures in the long-term history of positions that experience PTMs in the human proteins.

Hundreds of thousands of PTMs have been reported for the human proteome. with multiple PTMs known to affect tens of thousands of lysine (K) residues.

In contrast. short-term evolutionary trends revealed in an analysis of human population variation exhibited a much larger difference. Lysine residues with three PTMs show 1.8-fold enrichment of Mendelian disease-associated variants when compared with K residues with two PTMs. with the latter showing 1.7-fold enrichment of these variants when compared with the K residues with one PTM.

1098689,The Evolutionary History of Amino Acid Variations Mediating Increased Resistance of S. aureus Identifies Reversion Mutations in Metabolic Regulators,2013,Sudhir Kumar Mia D. Champion and Vanessa Gray and Carl Eberhard,8,PLOS ONE,2,,,The evolution of resistance in Staphylococcus aureus occurs rapidly. and in response to all known antimicrobial treatments. Numerous studies of model species describe compensatory roles of mutations in mediating competitive fitness. and there is growing evidence that these mutation types also drive adaptation of S. aureus strains. However. few studies have tracked amino acid changes during the complete evolutionary trajectory of antibiotic adaptation or been able to predict their functional relevance. Here. we have assessed the efficacy of computational methods to predict biological resistance of a collection of clinically known Resistance Associated Mutations (RAMs). We have found that >90% of known RAMs are incorrectly predicted to be functionally neutral by at least one of the prediction methods used. By tracing the evolutionary histories of all of the false negative RAMs. we have discovered that a significant number are reversion mutations to ancestral alleles also carried in the MSSA476 methicillin-sensitive isolate. These genetic reversions are most prevalent in strains following daptomycin treatment and show a tendency to accumulate in biological pathway reactions that are distinct from those accumulating non-reversion mutations. Our studies therefore show that in addition to non-reversion mutations. reversion mutations arise in isolates exposed to new antibiotic treatments. It is possible that acquisition of reversion mutations in the genome may prevent substantial fitness costs during the progression of resistance.

Alanine was chosen because it is physicochemically innocuous and constitutes a deletion of the side chain at the β- carbon. Alanine is also thought to best represent the effects of other mutations; however. this assumption has not been formally tested. To determine whether alanine substitutions are always the best choice. we analyzed 34.373 mutations in fourteen proteins whose effects were measured using large-scale mutagenesis approaches. We found that several substitutions. including histidine and asparagine. are better at recapitulating the effects of other substitutions. Histidine and asparagine also correlated best with the effects of other substitutions in different structural contexts. Furthermore. we found that alanine is among the worst substitutions for detecting ligand interface positions. despite its frequent use for this purpose.

1098697,PAML: a program package for phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood,1997,Ziheng Yang,13,Computer applications in the biosciences: CABIOS,5,555-556,Oxford University Press,PAML. currently in version 1.2. is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA and protein sequences using the method of maximum likelihood (ML). The programs can be used for (i) maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary parameters such as branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree. the transition/transversion rate ratio. the shape parameter of the gamma distribution for variable evolutionary rates at sites. and rate parameters for different genes;(ii) likelihood ratio test of hypotheses concerning sequence evolution. such as rate constancy and independence among sites and rate constancy among lineages (the molecular clock);(iii) calculation of substitution rates at sites and reconstruction of ancestral nucleotide or amino acid sequences; and (iv) phylogenetic tree reconstruction by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.The strength of PAML. in comparison with other phylogenetic packages currently available. is its implementation of a variety of evolutionary models. These include several models of variable evolutionary rates among sites. models for combined analyses of multiple gene sequence data and models for amino acid sequences. Multifurcating trees are supported. as well as trees in which some sequences are ancestral to some others.

1098698,Maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation from DNA sequences with variable rates over sites: approximate methods,1994,Ziheng Yang,39,Journal of Molecular evolution,3,306-314,Springer-Verlag,Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation. which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first. called the “discrete gamma model.” uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution. with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good. and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum. or near-optimum fit by the model to the data. and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method. called “fixed-rates model.” classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree.

However. positive selection is difficult to detect because it often operates episodically on a few amino acid sites. and the signal may be masked by negative selection.

These models are also applied to examine the adequacy of the model of Hasegawa et al. (J. Mol. Evol. 1985;22:160–174) (HKY85). Two data sets are analyzed.

The commonly used method for estimating ancestral population sizes. based on counting mismatches between the species tree and the inferred gene trees. is highly biased as it ignores uncertainties in gene tree reconstruction. In this article. we develop a Bayes method for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times and current and ancestral population sizes. The method uses DNA sequence data from multiple loci and extracts information about conflicts among gene tree topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral population sizes. The topology of the species tree is assumed known. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate over uncertain gene trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times) at each locus as …,True,Ke7yUWEAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,913,https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/164/4/1645/6050371,12463590357646288067,/scholar?cites=12463590357646288067,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/164/4/1645.full.pdf,0,0,0

A model of nucleotide or amino acid substitution was employed to analyze data of the present-day sequences. and maximum likelihood estimates of parameters such as branch lengths were used to compare the posterior probabilities of assignments of character states (nucleotides or amino acids) to interior nodes of the tree; the assignment having the highest probability was the best reconstruction at the site. The lysozyme c sequences of six mammals were analyzed by using the likelihood and parsimony methods. The new likelihood-based method was found to be superior to the parsimony method.

The ω ratio is commonly calculated as an average over sites. As every functional protein has some amino acid sites under selective constraints. averaging rates across sites leads to low power to detect positive selection. Recently developed models of codon substitution allow the ω ratio to vary among sites and appear to be powerful in detecting positive selection in empirical data analysis. In this study. we used computer simulation to investigate the accuracy and power of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in detecting positive selection at amino acid sites.

A birth-death process with species sampling is used to specify a prior for divergence times. which allows easy assessment of the effects of that prior on posterior time estimates. We propose a new approach for specifying calibration points on the phylogeny. which allows the use of arbitrary and flexible statistical distributions to describe uncertainties in fossil dates. In particular. we use soft bounds. so that the probability that the true divergence time is outside the bounds is small but nonzero.

Phylogenetic trees can be reconstructed reliably using small data sets and the same has been assumed for the estimation of divergence time with molecular clocks. However. we show here that undersampling of molecular data results in a bias expressed as disproportionately shorter branch lengths and underestimated divergence times in the youngest nodes and branches. termed the small sample artifact. In turn. this leads to increasing speciation and diversification rates towards the present.

Recent molecular genetic studies of the genus have identified high levels of cryptic diversity within many taxa. suggesting true species diversity is greatly underestimated. Anilios leptosoma is a slender blindsnake endemic to the mid-west of Western Australia. Although morphological variation has been identified within the species in the past. the systematics and true diversity remained unstudied. Here we use recent molecular data to guide a reappraisal of morphology in order to provide a taxonomic revision of the A. leptosoma species complex. We redescribe A. leptosoma and describe two new species that occur to the south of most of true A. leptosoma’s distribution: A. systenos sp. nov. and A. obtusifrons sp. nov. Anilios systenos sp. nov. is known from the Geraldton region with the furthest record only 100 km to the north-east. a very small range for a species of snake. Anilios obtusifrons sp. nov. has an even smaller distribution. as it is only known from a small coastal area south of Kalbarri and may represent a range-restricted taxa. All species are genetically divergent from each other and can be distinguished by consistent morphological characteristics. including the shape of the snout. the termination point of the rostral cleft and number of mid-body scale rows and ventral scales.,True,E17ERJQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Vidal/publication/319928179_Worms_in_the_sand_Systematic_revision_of_the_Australian_blindsnake_Anilios_leptosoma_Robb_1972_species_complex_Squamata_Scolecophidia_Typhlopidae_from_the_Geraldton_Sandplain_with_description_of_two_n/links/59c240b6a6fdcc69b92fbdc6/Worms-in-the-sand-Systematic-revision-of-the-Australian-blindsnake-Anilios-leptosoma-Robb-1972-species-complex-Squamata-Scolecophidia-Typhlopidae-from-the-Geraldton-Sandplain-with-description-of-two.pdf,10083258245262853692,/scholar?cites=10083258245262853692,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Vidal/publication/319928179_Worms_in_the_sand_Systematic_revision_of_the_Australian_blindsnake_Anilios_leptosoma_Robb_1972_species_complex_Squamata_Scolecophidia_Typhlopidae_from_the_Geraldton_Sandplain_with_description_of_two_n/links/59c240b6a6fdcc69b92fbdc6/Worms-in-the-sand-Systematic-revision-of-the-Australian-blindsnake-Anilios-leptosoma-Robb-1972-species-complex-Squamata-Scolecophidia-Typhlopidae-from-the-Geraldton-Sandplain-with-description-of-two.pdf,0,0,0

Although largely neglected in vertebrate research. knowledge of their biogeographical history is crucial for evaluating hypotheses of snake origins. We constructed a molecular dataset for scolecophidians with detailed sampling within the largest family. Typhlopidae (blindsnakes). Our results demonstrate that scolecophidians have had a long Gondwanan history. and that their initial diversification followed a vicariant event: the separation of East and West Gondwana approximately 150 Ma. We find that the earliest blindsnake lineages. representing two new families described here. were distributed on the palaeolandmass of India+ Madagascar named here as Indigascar. Their later evolution out of Indigascar involved vicariance and several oceanic dispersal events. including a westward transatlantic one. unexpected for burrowing animals.

Healthy males performed three 5-min bouts of light knee-extensor exercise. Skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen uptake were measured at rest and during the exercise using PET with H2O15 and 15O2 during: 1) control conditions; 2) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition by arterial infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA). and 3) combined NOS and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition by arterial infusion of l-NMMA and indomethacin. At rest. inhibition of NOS alone and in combination with indomethacin reduced (P < 0.05) muscle blood flow.

MD,Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen. Oxygen is provided by blood flow. and. in essence. changes in organ perfusion are also closely associated with alterations in tissue metabolism. In response to acute exercise. blood flow is markedly increased in contracting skeletal muscles and myocardium. but perfusion in other organs (brain and bone) is only slightly enhanced or is even reduced (visceral organs). Despite largely unchanged metabolism and perfusion. repeated exposures to altered hemodynamics and hormonal milieu produced by acute exercise. long-term exercise training appears to be capable of inducing effects also in tissues other than muscles that may yield health benefits.

In the present study. we tested whether glucose uptake is enhanced in trained men during low-. moderate-. and high-intensity exercise as compared with untrained men. METHODS: Seven trained and untrained men were studied without any dietary manipulation during bicycle exercise at relative intensities of 30%. 55%. and 75% of maximal oxygen consumption ([OV0312] O (2max)) on three separate days. Glucose uptake in the quadriceps femoris muscle was directly measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ([18F] FDG).[18F] FDG was injected 10 min after the start of the exercise.

Previous studies have applied surface electromyography (SEMG); however. recent gains in three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) have rendered an alternative approach to investigate muscle activation. The purpose of the present study was to examine muscle use during double poling (DP) at two work intensities by use of PET. Eight male subjects performed two 20-min DP bouts on separate days. Work intensity was ∼53 and 74% of peak oxygen uptake (V̇o2peak). respectively. During exercise 188 ± 8 MBq of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) was injected. and subsequent to exercise a full-body PET scan was conducted.

FDG-PET results depend partly on the lumped constant (LC). which accounts for the differences in the transport and phosphorylation between [18F]FDG and glucose. In this study. we estimated the LC for [18F]FDG directly in normal and in insulin-resistant obese subjects by combining FDG PET with the microdialysis technique. Eight obese [age 29.4 ± 1.0 yr. body mass index (BMI) 33.6 ± 1.0 kg/m2] and eight nonobese (age 25.0 ± 1.0 yr.

Healthy males performed three 5-min bouts of light knee-extensor exercise. Skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen uptake were measured at rest and during the exercise using PET with H2O15 and 15O2 during: 1) control conditions; 2) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition by arterial infusion of NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA). and 3) combined NOS and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition by arterial infusion of l-NMMA and indomethacin. At rest. inhibition of NOS alone and in combination with indomethacin reduced (P < 0.05) muscle blood flow.

The first cohort consisted of 86 patients (19 protected LM) treated with bare metal stents (pre-DES group); the second cohort comprised 95 patients (15 protected LM) treated exclusively with DES. The 2 cohorts were well balanced for all baseline characteristics. At a median follow-up of 503 days (range. 331 to 873 days). the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was lower in the DES cohort than in patients in the pre-DES group (24% versus 45%. respectively; hazard ratio [HR]. 0.52 [95% CI. 0.31 to 0.88]; P=0 …,True,Px-XBoEAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC,463,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.0000158486.20865.8B,14300566833915978370,/scholar?cites=14300566833915978370,,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.CIR.0000158486.20865.8B,0,0,0

If the “raw material” is flawed then the conclusions of systematic reviews cannot be trusted. Many reviewers formally assess the quality of primary trials by following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and other experts. 1 2 However. the methodology for both the assessment of quality and its incorporation into systematic reviews and meta-analysis are a matter of ongoing debate. 3–5 In this article we discuss the concept of study quality and the methods used to assess quality. Quality is a multidimensional concept. which could relate to the design. conduct. and analysis of a trial. its clinical relevance. or quality of reporting. 6 The validity of the findings generated by a study clearly is an important dimension of quality.

Here. we report the isolation of “beige” cells from murine white fat depots. Beige cells resemble white fat cells in having extremely low basal expression of UCP1. but. like classical brown fat. they respond to cyclic AMP stimulation with high UCP1 expression and respiration rates.

Here. we offer a comprehensive review of BAT energy metabolism in humans. Considerable advances in methods to measure BAT energy metabolism. including nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). chylomicron-triglycerides (TG). oxygen. Krebs cycle rate. and intracellular TG have led to very good quantification of energy substrate metabolism per volume of active BAT in vivo. These studies have also shown that intracellular TG are likely the primary energy source of BAT upon activation by cold. Current estimates of BAT’s contribution to energy expenditure range at the lower end of what would be potentially clinically relevant if chronically sustained. Yet. 18FDG PET/CT remains the gold-standard defining method to quantify total BAT volume of activity. used to calculate BAT’s total energy expenditure. Unfortunately. BAT glucose metabolism better reflects BAT’s insulin sensitivity and blood flow. It is now clear that most glucose taken up by BAT does not fuel mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and that BAT glucose uptake can therefore be disconnected from thermogenesis. Furthermore. BAT thermogenesis is efficiently recruited upon repeated cold exposure. doubling to tripling its total oxidative capacity. with reciprocal reduction of muscle thermogenesis …,True,n0XTfAcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,102,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00447/full,251925912188880159,/scholar?cites=251925912188880159,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00447/full,0,0,0

Here. we identified the gut hormone secretin as a non-sympathetic BAT activator mediating prandial thermogenesis. which consequentially induces satiation. thereby establishing a gut-secretin-BAT-brain axis in mammals with a physiological role of prandial thermogenesis in the control of satiation. Mechanistically. meal-associated rise in circulating secretin activates BAT thermogenesis by stimulating lipolysis upon binding to secretin receptors in brown adipocytes. which is sensed in the brain and promotes satiation.

A reliable prediction of outcome on admission is of great clinical relevance. We aimed to develop prognostic models with readily available traditional and novel predictors.   Methods and Findings Prospectively collected individual patient data were analyzed from 11 studies. We considered predictors available at admission in logistic regression models to predict mortality and unfavorable outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 6 mo after injury. Prognostic models were developed in 8.509 patients with severe or moderate TBI. with cross-validation by omission of each of the 11 studies in turn. External validation was on 6.681 patients from the recent Medical Research Council Corticosteroid Randomisation after Significant Head Injury (MRC CRASH) trial. We found that the strongest predictors of outcome were age. motor score. pupillary reactivity. and CT characteristics. including the presence of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prognostic model that combined age. motor score. and pupillary reactivity had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between 0.66 and 0.84 at cross-validation. This performance could be improved (AUC increased by approximately 0.05) by considering CT characteristics. secondary insults (hypotension and hypoxia). and laboratory parameters (glucose and hemoglobin). External validation confirmed that the discriminative ability of the model was adequate (AUC 0.80). Outcomes were systematically worse than predicted. but less so in 1.588 patients who were from high-income countries in the …,True,V577MRQAAAAJ:Zbx7W2Xs4QsC,1176,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050165,8184219186857228039,/scholar?cites=8184219186857228039,,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050165,0,0,0

Three independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genome-wide significant (rs9320913. rs11584700. rs4851266). and all three replicate. Estimated effects sizes are small (coefficient of determination R2 ≈ 0.02%). approximately 1 month of schooling per allele. A linear polygenic score from all measured SNPs accounts for ≈2% of the variance in both educational attainment and cognitive function. Genes in the region of the loci have previously been associated with health. cognitive. and central nervous system phenotypes. and bioinformatics analyses suggest the involvement of the anterior caudate nucleus.

However. it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P< 5× 10− 8 for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First. we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels. and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second. we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD.
