1211829,Ovarian cancer marker of 11.7 kDa detected by proteomics is a serum amyloid A1,2005,Sergei A Moshkovskii and Marina V Serebryakova and Konstantin B Kuteykin‐Teplyakov and Olga V Tikhonova and Eugene I Goufman and Victor G Zgoda and Irina N Taranets and Oleg V Makarov and Alexander I Archakov,5,Proteomics,14,3790-3797,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,In this study. to reduce the number of major plasma components. we examined thermostable plasma fractions to search for a biomarker of ovarian cancer. An apparent cancer biomarker of 11.7 kDa was detected in these fractions using ProteinChip SELDI‐TOF mass spectrometry system. This peak invariably appeared with another close peak of about 11.5 kDa. suggesting that it is a derivative of a larger mass molecule. Of 27 cancer plasma specimens. 15 (55.6%) demonstrated this peak pair. whereas only 2 of 34 controls specimens (5.8%) were shown to express it with low intensity. Using a method involving cysteine modification by 4‐vinylpyridine (4‐VP). 2‐DE and HPLC. these peaks were identified by mass spectrometry as serum amyloid A1 (11.68 kDa) and its N‐terminal arginine‐truncated form (11.52 kDa).,True,Ft1TMZ8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,156,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pmic.200401205,12614242801466037251,/scholar?cites=12614242801466037251,,,0,0,0
1211830,The size of the human proteome: the width and depth,2016,Elena A Ponomarenko and Ekaterina V Poverennaya and Ekaterina V Ilgisonis and Mikhail A Pyatnitskiy and Arthur T Kopylov and Victor G Zgoda and Andrey V Lisitsa and Alexander I Archakov,2016,,,,Hindawi,This work discusses bioinformatics and experimental approaches to explore the human proteome. a constellation of proteins expressed in different tissues and organs. As the human proteome is not a static entity. it seems necessary to estimate the number of different protein species (proteoforms) and measure the number of copies of the same protein in a specific tissue. Here. meta-analysis of neXtProt knowledge base is proposed for theoretical prediction of the number of different proteoforms that arise from alternative splicing (AS). single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs). and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Three possible cases are considered:  PTMs and SAPs appear exclusively in the canonical sequences of proteins. but not in splice variants;  PTMs and SAPs can occur in both proteins encoded by canonical sequences and in splice variants;  all modification types (AS. SAP. and PTM) occur as independent events. Experimental validation of proteoforms is limited by the analytical sensitivity of proteomic technology. A bell-shaped distribution histogram was generated for proteins encoded by a single chromosome. with the estimation of copy numbers in plasma. liver. and HepG2 cell line. The proposed metabioinformatics approaches can be used for estimation of the number of different proteoforms for any group of protein-coding genes.,True,Ft1TMZ8AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC,143,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijac/2016/7436849/abs/,17049265961086766263,/scholar?cites=17049265961086766263,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijac/2016/7436849/abs/,0,0,0
1211831,AFM fishing nanotechnology is the way to reverse the Avogadro number in proteomics,2007,Alexander Ivanovich Archakov and Yurii Dmitrievich Ivanov and Andrey Valerevich Lisitsa and Victor Gavrilovich Zgoda,7,Proteomics,1,4-9,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,Future development of proteomics may be hindered by limitations in the concentration sensitivity of widespread technological approaches. The concentration sensitivity limit (CSL) of currently used approaches. like 2‐DE/LC separation coupled with MS detection. etc.. varies from 10−9 to 10−12 M. Therefore. proteomic technologies enable detection of up to 20% of the protein species present in the plasma. New technologies. like atomic force microscopy (AFM molecular detector). enable the counting of single molecules. whereas biospecific fishing can be used to capture these molecules from the biomaterial. At the same time. fishing also has thermodynamic limitations due to the reversibility of the binding. In cases where the fishing becomes irreversible. its combination with an AFM detector enables the registration of single protein molecules. and that opens up a way to lower the CSL down to the reverse …,True,Ft1TMZ8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,117,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pmic.200600467,2899036780213207753,/scholar?cites=2899036780213207753,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pmic.200600467,0,0,0

The problem may be solved by means of a combination of biospecific irreversible fishing with atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM offers the ability to register individual molecules and their complexes. while biospecific fishing takes advantage of an affine interaction between analyte molecules spread over a large volume of biomaterial and ligand molecules immobilized on the chip surface. Fishing may be conducted in Kd‐dependent reversible mode and in Kd‐independent irreversible mode. In this study. the DLs of two previously applied proteomic approaches were determined and compared to the DL of a newly developed analytical method.

Although good evidence exists that amyloid-β accumulates inside cells. intracellular brain amyloid-binding proteins remain poorly characterized. Proteomic profiling of rat brain homogenates. performed in this study. resulted in identification of 89 individual intracellular amyloid-binding proteins. and approximately 25% of them were proteins that we had previously identified as specifically binding to isatin. an endogenous neuroprotector molecule. A significant proportion of the amyloid-binding proteins (more than 30%) are differentially expressed or altered/oxidatively modified in AD patients. Incubation of brain homogenates with 70 µM hydrogen peroxide significantly influenced the profile of amyloid-β binding proteins and 0.1 mM isatin decreased the number of identified amyloid-β binding proteins both in control and hydrogen peroxide treated brain homogenates. The effects of hydrogen peroxide and isatin have been confirmed in optical biosensor experiments with purified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. one of the known crucial amyloid-β binding proteins (also identified in this study). Data obtained suggest that isatin protects crucial intracellular protein targets against amyloid binding. and possibly favors intracellular degradation of this protein via preventing formation of amyloid-β oligomers described in the literature for some isatin derivatives.

Homology modelling of the three-dimensional structures of these cytochromes was performed based on crystallographic coordinates of two bacterial P450s. CYP102 (P450BM-3) and CYP108 (P450terp). Principal attention was given to the modelling of the active sites and a comparison of the active site structures of CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 was performed. It can be demonstrated that key residue contacts within the active site appear to depend on the orientation of the heme.

Although good evidence exists that amyloid-β accumulates inside cells. intracellular brain amyloid-binding proteins remain poorly characterized. Proteomic profiling of rat brain homogenates. performed in this study. resulted in identification of 89 individual intracellular amyloid-binding proteins. and approximately 25% of them were proteins that we had previously identified as specifically binding to isatin. an endogenous neuroprotector molecule. A significant proportion of the amyloid-binding proteins (more than 30%) are differentially expressed or altered/oxidatively modified in AD patients. Incubation of brain homogenates with 70 µM hydrogen peroxide significantly influenced the profile of amyloid-β binding proteins and 0.1 mM isatin decreased the number of identified amyloid-β binding proteins both in control and hydrogen peroxide treated brain homogenates. The effects of hydrogen peroxide and isatin have been confirmed in optical biosensor experiments with purified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. one of the known crucial amyloid-β binding proteins (also identified in this study). Data obtained suggest that isatin protects crucial intracellular protein targets against amyloid binding. and possibly favors intracellular degradation of this protein via preventing formation of amyloid-β oligomers described in the literature for some isatin derivatives.

The qualitative information (steric and electrostatic coefficients) from the 3D-QSAR with CoMFA models for MAO-A and -B are different. and this information can be used to determine the structural features influencing inhibitor selectivity. ,True,8jTppFcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,50,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci9802068,8066967128997266342,/scholar?cites=8066967128997266342,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39904579/Inhibition_of_monoamine_oxidase_by_pirli20151111-28832-1bt61rv.pdf,0,0,0

Computer modelling of the substrate/inhibitory binding region of the active site includes consensus overlay of several series of fully reversible and/or tightly bound inhibitors onto a rigid referent inhibitor(s). The shape of resultant mould obviously reflects spatial characteristic features of the substrate/inhibitor binding region. The comparison of the active site mould of MAO B with its crystal structure revealed correctness of this approach.

Numerous investigations have shown that PPI play a key role in the virus’s life cycle and that blocking or modulating them has a significant therapeutic potential. Here we summarize the recent progress in computer-aided design of PPI inhibitors. mainly focusing on the selection of the drug targets (HIV enzymes and virus entry machinery) and the …,True,8jTppFcAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,13,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1062936X.2014.898689,7632214234368190836,/scholar?cites=7632214234368190836,,,0,0,0

Cells synthesize all known isoforms of human renalase (1 and 2) as flavoproteins. Accommodation of FAD in the renalase protein requires the presence of its N-terminal peptide. However. in secretory proteins. such peptides are usually cleaved during their export from the cell. In the present study. we have isolated human renalase from urinary samples of healthy volunteers and human recombinant renalases 1 and 2 expressed in Escherichia coli cells. In these proteins. we investigated the presence of the renalase N-terminal peptide and the FAD cofactor and performed computer-aided molecular analysis of the renalase crystal structure to evaluate possible consequences of removal of the N-terminal peptide.

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible effect of isatin on interaction of human CYP with cytochrome b5 (CYB5A). Using the optical biosensor test system employing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) we have investigated interaction of immobilized CYB5A with various CYP in the absence and in the presence of isatin. The SPR-based experiments have shown that a high concentration of isatin (270 mM) increases Kd values for complexes CYB5A/CYP3А5 and CYB5A/CYP3A4 (twofold and threefold. respectively). but has no influence on complex formation between CYB5A and other CYP (including indol-metabolizing CYP2C19 and CYP2E1). Isatin injection to the optical biosensor chip with the preformed molecular complex CYB5A/CYP3A4 caused a 30%-increase in its dissociation rate. Molecular docking manipulations have shown that isatin can influence interaction of CYP3А5 or CYP3A4 with CYB5A acting at the contact region of CYB5A/CYP.,True,8jTppFcAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,10,https://europepmc.org/article/med/28414290,15775623355403976977,/scholar?cites=15775623355403976977,,,0,0,0

It was shown also that dissolved holotransketolase can bind aldose (the acceptor substrate) even in the absence of ketose (the donor substrate). The holotransketolase conformation did not change upon aldose binding unlike in the case of ketose binding/cleavage. Therefore the conformation of a catalytic complex of holotransketolase with an intermediate—i.e.. a glycolaldehyde residue formed upon binding and subsequent cleavage of ketose—differed. at least in solution. from the conformation of both the free and aldose-complexed holotransketolase.

Australia. In accordance with the gene-centric approach. the goals of the HPP are to prepare an inventory of all human proteins and decipher the network of cellular protein interactions. The greater complexity of the proteome in comparison to the genome gives rise to three bottlenecks in the implementation of the HPP. The main bottleneck is the insufficient sensitivity of proteomic technologies. hampering the detection of proteins with low- and ultra-low copy numbers. The second bottleneck is related to poor reproducibility of proteomic methods and the lack of a so-called ‘gold’ standard. The last bottleneck is the dynamic nature of the proteome: its instability over time.

We used MM-PBSA (MM-GBSA) energy terms calculated for the complexes obtained after modeling of 30 variants of neuraminidase structures. subsequent docking and simulation of molecular dynamics as independent variables in prediction equations. The structures of known neuraminidase-inhibiting drugs (oseltamivir. zanamivir and peramivir) and a neuraminidase substrate (MUNANA) were used as ligands. The correlation equation based on calculated energetic parameters of inhibitor complexes with neuraminidase did not result in the prediction of IC50 with acceptable parameters (R2£ 0.3). However. if information about binding energy of the substrate used for neuraminidase assay (and IC50 detection) is included the resulting IC50 prediction equations become significant (R2³0. 55). It is concluded that models based on IC50 values as a predictable variable and combining information about binding of different ligands to different variants of the target proteins must take into account the binding properties of the substrate (used for IC50 determination).

Here. redox proteomics investigation of the DDW action in A549 cells revealed an increased level of oxidative stress. whereas expression proteomics in combination with thermal profiling uncovered crucial role of mitochondrial proteins. In the proposed scenario. reversal of the normally positive deuterium gradient across the inner membrane leads to an increased export of protons from the matrix to intermembrane space and an increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential. enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

During the last decade. we demonstrated that vaccination of advanced melanoma patients with autologous tumor antigen presenting cells (TAPCells) loaded with an allogeneic heat shock- (HS-) conditioned melanoma cell-derived lysate (called TRIMEL) is able to induce an antitumor immune response associated with a prolonged patient survival. TRIMEL provides not only a broad spectrum of potential melanoma-associated antigens but also danger signals that are crucial in the induction of a committed mature DC phenotype. However. potential changes induced by heat conditioning on the proteome of TRIMEL are still unknown.

The mechanism by which b5 stimulates the catalytic activity of CYP3A4 is controversial. Recent data report that apo-cytochrome b5 (apo-b5) can substitute for holo-b5 by serving as an allosteric effector. These authors concluded that b5 is not directly involved in electron transfer reactions to CYP3A4.

Excess aldosterone levels can arise from dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and are implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension and heart failure. Aldosterone synthase (cytochrome P450 11B2. CYP11B2) is the sole enzyme responsible for the production of aldosterone in humans. Blocking of aldosterone synthesis by mediating aldosterone synthase activity is thus a recently emerging pharmacological therapy for hypertension. yet a lack of structural information has limited this approach.

This process proceeds via three sequential monooxygenation reactions: two hydroxylations of Ch first form 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (HC) and then 20α.22(R)-dihydroxycholesterol (DHC); a lyase reaction then cleaves the C20–C22 bond to form pregnenolone.

Risk evaluation is not new since for decades the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has set threshold limit values for occupational exposures and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established acceptable daily intakes for pesticide residues and food additives. In 1958. the US Congress instructed the FDA in the Delaney Clause to prohibit the addition to the food supply of all substances found to cause cancer in animals or humans. Pragmatically. this policy allowed food sources that had nondetectable levels of these additives to be declared “safe.” As advances in analytic chemistry revealed that “nondetects” were not equivalent to “not present.” regulatory agencies were forced to develop “tolerance levels” and “acceptable risk levels.” Risk assessment methodologies blossomed in the 1970s with the rising need to address these issues and statues (Albert. 1994).,True,DfcJpIIAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,278,https://www.academia.edu/download/50659101/CASARETT_AND_DOLULLS_TOXICOLOGY_THE_BASIC_SCIENCE_OF_POISONS_17_ED_2008.pdf#page=127,1172566206545242688,/scholar?cites=1172566206545242688,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50659101/CASARETT_AND_DOLULLS_TOXICOLOGY_THE_BASIC_SCIENCE_OF_POISONS_17_ED_2008.pdf#page=127,0,0,0

Poor coupling of the P450 catalytic cycle results in continuous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). which affects signaling pathways and other cellular functions. P450 generation of ROS is tightly controlled by regulation of gene transcription as well as by modulation of interactions between protein constituents of the monooxygenase that affects its activity. coupling. and stability. Malfunction of these mechanisms may result in a burst of ROS production. which can cause lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.

Application of factor analysis to the spectral changes in the Soret region allowed us to resolve two particular pressure-induced processes in 2B4 oligomers. The first process was identified as the conversion of the low-spin P450 into the P420 state. At 25° C it was followed by decay (bleaching) about 50% of the newly formed P420.

Although simultaneous occupancy of the active site by multiple ligands is now well established. there is increasing evidence that the mechanistic basis of cooperativity also involves an important ligand-induced conformational transition. Moreover. recent studies demonstrate that the conformational heterogeneity of the enzyme is stabilized by ligand-dependent interactions of several P450 molecules.

However. there are important inconsistencies in the concept that the biological role of MMO is limited to the catalysis of these reactions.

Functional consequences of these interactions are often underestimated.  Areas covered:  This article provides a comprehensive overview of available experimental material regarding P450-P450 interactions. Special emphasis is given to the interactions between different P450 species and to the functional consequences of homo- and heterooligomerization.  Expert opinion:  Recent advances provide conclusive evidence for a substantial degree of P450 oligomerization in membranes. Interactions between different P450 species resulting in the formation of mixed oligomers with altered activity and substrate specificity have been demonstrated clearly.

When P-450 was incorporated into membranes or when it was succinylated. the proportion of the pressure sensitive fraction was slightly higher (about 75%). Dissocation of P-450 oligomers into monomers was made by addition of 0.2% Triton N-101. Monomers were the most sensitive to pressure; they could be completely converted to P-420. These results have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of two different conformers of P-450 LM2. which differ in pressure stability.

When taken separately. these hemoproteins reveal quite distinct barotropic behavior. While the 2B4(Fe2+)-CO complex is very sensitive to hydrostatic pressures and undergoes P450 → P420 transition at rather low pressures (P1/2 = 297 MPa. ΔV0 = −61 ml/mol). the 1A2(Fe2+)-CO is extremely resistant to barotropic inactivation. Only about 8% of the 1A2 was exposed to pressure-induced P450 → P420 transition (P1/2 = 420 MPa. ΔV0 = −28 ml/mol). The formation of the mixed oligomers of 2B4 and 1A2 was found to have a dramatic effect on the barotropic behavior of 2B4. In the heterooligomers of 1A2 and 2B4. the 2B4 hemoprotein appears to be largely protected from barotropic inactivation.

The statistical nature of the maximum likelihood method and the Bayesian approach is well recognized. but many other methods (multiple regression. factor analysis. pattern recognition methods such as linear discriminant analysis. linear learning machine. support vector machines etc.) 1–3 can also be considered as probabilistic ones. 4. 5 An informational search in PubMed Central with the queries ‘‘(probabilistic approach) OR (probabilistic method)’’or ‘‘(statistical approach) OR (statistical method)’’. will ﬁnd 3477 documents and 180475 documents. respectively. It is impossible to analyze all these publications. particularly taking into account that. despite of the presence of this term in their titles. many of them are not really probabilistic (see. for instance. refs 6–20). We propose the following deﬁnition of probabilistic approaches:‘‘The methods that use probabilities as an essential part of the algorithm. and/or for which the results of application are presented as probability estimates.’’Thus. many approaches that do not correspond strictly to the deﬁnition are not considered in this chapter.

The identification of candidate genes for marker‐assisted selection (MAS) could greatly improve the efficiency of breeding for increased drought tolerance. Drought‐induced changes in the proteome could highlight important genes. Two genotypes of sugar beet (7112 and 7219‐P.69) differing in genetic background were cultivated in the field. A line‐source sprinkler irrigation system was used to apply irrigated and water deficit treatments beginning at the four‐leaf stage.

Proteomic analysis provides a broad view of plant responses to stress at the level of proteins. In recent years this approach has increased in sensitivity and power as a result of improvements in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2DE). protein detection and quantification. fingerprinting and partial sequencing of proteins by mass spectrometry (MS). bioinformatics. and methods for gene isolation. 2DE provides information on changes in abundance and electrophoretic mobility of proteins. the latter reflecting post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and free-radical cleavage.

To achieve meaningful results. these approaches must be linked with suitable phenotyping protocols at all stages. such as the screening of germplasm collections. mutant libraries. mapping populations. transgenic lines and breeding materials and the design of OMICS and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) experiments. Here we present a conceptual framework for molecular breeding for drought tolerance based on the Passioura equation of expressing yield as the product of water use (WU). water use efficiency (WUE) and harvest index (HI).

One obstacle. a robust feeder-and serum-free system to generate and expand hiPSCs in culture is still unavailable. Here. for the first time. we describe a novel establishment and maintenance culture technique that uses human dermal fibroblasts to generate hiPSCs by introducing four factors. Klf4. Oct4.

We have used a serum replacement product. conditioned medium (CM). or feeder-free medium (FFM) supplemented with high elevated basic-fibroblast growth factor in the absence or presence of Matrigel. Our FFM system in the presence of Matrigel enhanced the efficiency of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies at a frequency at least 10-fold greater than the conventional method on feeder cells. The established hiPSCs are similar to human embryonic stem cells in many aspects including morphology. passaging. surface and pluripotency markers. normal karyotype. gene expression. ultrastructure. and in vitro differentiation.

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were functionalized with three different cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP1A2. CYP2B6. and CYP3A4). A model used to effectively describe the cytochrome P450 deposition onto carbon nanotubes was confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Voltammetric measurements were performed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as well as in human serum. giving well-defined current responses upon addition of increasing concentrations of anti-cancer drugs. The results assert the capability to measure concentration of drugs in the pharmacological ranges in human serum.

Capacitance detection was used successfully to develop an immunosensor. Rigorous probe immobilization was implemented to obtain reliable capacitance measurements. The commonly considered alkanethiols for proteins immobilization do not allow sufficiently stable capacitance measurements.

Continuous monitoring of several human metabolites can be addressed by using fully integrated and minimally invasive devices located in the sub-cutis. typically in the peritoneal region. This extends the techniques of continuous monitoring of glucose currently being pursued with diabetic patients. However. several issues have to be considered in order to succeed in developing fully integrated and minimally invasive implantable devices. These innovative devices require a high-degree of integration. minimal invasive surgery. long-term biocompatibility. security and privacy in data transmission. high reliability. high reproducibility. high specificity. low detection limit and high sensitivity. Recent advances in the field have already proposed possible solutions for several of these issues. The aim of the present paper is to present a broad spectrum of recent results and to propose future directions of development in order to obtain fully implantable systems for the continuous monitoring of the human metabolism in advanced healthcare applications.

Introduction,1998,EV Dyatlovitskaya and VV Bezuglov,63,Biochemistry-New York-English Translation of Biokhimiya,1,1-3,New York: Consultants Bureau. c1956-,"The term"" lipids"" encompasses a great number of slightly polar natural compounds with various chemical structures. such as free fatty acids. neutral glycerides. waxes. phospholipids. sphingolipids (including glycosphingolipids). oxylipins. sterols. etc. For an appreciable length of time it was thought that lipids play a relatively conservative role in cell activity. They were considered mainly as metabolic fuel stores. Later. it was established that lipids also play another vital function: they are the main structural component of cell membranes [1-3]. However. the reason for the existence of such large amounts of compounds of lipid nature. which differ in chemical structure. remained unclear. Reviewing of the role of lipids in vital systems was initiated at the beginning of the 1960s. after establishing the structure. biosynthetic pathways. and physiological role of prostaglandins. During the two last decades. especially in the 1990s. many studies have shown that other lipids also act as important biological effectors. regulators. and mediators which participate in virtually all biological processes in an organism as a whole (such as immune response. transmission of neuronal information. regulation of vessel and muscle tonus. homeostasis. inflammation. etc.) and in biochemical reactions of animal and human cells. As second messengers they provide transduction of various external signals into the cell. and they simultaneously act as intercellular mediators [4-11].By now numerous data on the bioeffector role of lipids both at the whole-body level and in a cell have been published. Some of these data are discussed in detail in this issue of Biochemistry (Moscow).",True,E3y55xIAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,30,http://www.protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v63/full/63010003.html,5552956443055496954,/scholar?cites=5552956443055496954,,http://www.protein.bio.msu.ru/biokhimiya/contents/v63/full/63010003.html,0,0,0

The development of an analytical approach to the study of variation of glycosylation patterns in serum samples has been hindered by the structural heterogeneity of this post-translational modification and the complexity of serum proteome.

For naming each gene. it is recommended that the root symbol UGT for human (Ugt for mouse and Drosophila). denoting'UDP glycosyltransferase.'be followed by an Arabic number representing the family. a letter designating the subfamily. and an Arabic numeral denoting the individual gene within the family or subfamily. eg'human UGT2B4'and'mouse Ugt2b5'.

Whole-genome approaches (1) and human expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing (2) have started to exert profound in  uence on biology and medicine. The need for robust. high-throughput methods to replace the elegant Sanger method. described more than 20 years ago (3). has led to the development of several new principles. such as array methods based on sequencing by hybridization (4). New applications. such as population-based biodiversity projects and brute-force genotyping using single-nucleotide polymorphism. make such e orts even more urgent. in particular. for simple and robust methods for sequencing short"" tags""(1 to 20 bases) such as ESTs or biallelic markers and methods suitable for routine diagnostic applications.Sequencing-by-synthesis is based on the detection of nucleotide incorporation. using a primer-directed polymerase extension.

Therefore. to assess degrees of this correlation we compared the RNA profiles (determined using both cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays) and protein profiles (determined immunohistochemically in tissue microarrays) of 1066 gene products in 23 human cell lines. A high mean correlation coefficient (0.52) was obtained from the pairwise comparison of RNA levels determined by the two platforms. Significant correlations. with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.445. between protein and RNA levels were also obtained for a third of the specific gene products. However. the correlation coefficients between levels of RNA and protein products of specific genes varied widely. and the mean correlations between the protein and corresponding RNA levels determined using the cDNA- and oligo-based microarrays were 0.25 and 0.20. respectively. Significant correlations were found in one third of the examined RNA species and corresponding proteins. These results suggest that RNA profiling might provide indirect support to antibodies' specificity. since whenever a evident correlation between the RNA and protein profiles exists. this can sustain that the antibodies used in the immunoassay recognized their cognate antigens.,True,becVyZ4AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,426,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-365,9456870233662720203,/scholar?cites=9456870233662720203,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-365,0,0,0

1212364,Yellow mosaic of mungbean and urdbean: current status and future strategies,2016,MOHD AKRAM and NP SINGH NAIMUDDIN,29,Journal of Food Legumes,2,77-93,ISPRD,The yellow mosaic disease (YMD) is known to affect a number of legumes in the country. However. mungbean and urdbean are the most important grain legume crops which are widely affected by this disease. Symptoms of the disease are broadly similar not only in mungbean and urdbean but also in other host plants and hence it is quite often taken as caused by the same virus. However. in the last decade rapid advancement has been made towards understanding of viruses involved in YMD. At present three distinct viruses viz.. Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV). Mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) and Horsegram yellow mosaic virus (HgYMV) are known to cause YMD in mungnean and urdbean. Another common virus. Dolichos yellow mosaic virus (DoYMV) is known to cause YMD in Dolichos beans only. These four viruses along with some recently described begomoviruses from leguminous plant species are together termed as Legume Yellow Mosaic Viruses (LYMVs). Mungbean and urdbean also known as greengram and blackgram. respectively are important food grain legume crops (pulse crops) grown throughout India. These two legumes along with other legumes serve as an important source of protein to a large portion of the Indian population that traditionally practices vegetarianism. Mungbean and urdbean are primarily cultivated as Kharif (rainy season) crop. occupying about 25% of the total area under all pulse crops.
