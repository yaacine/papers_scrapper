Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms. we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior. suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly.

To identify Ipl1p targets. we first purified 28 kinetochore proteins from yeast protein extracts. These studies identified five previously uncharacterized kinetochore proteins and defined two additional kinetochore subcomplexes. We then used mass spectrometry to identify 18 phosphorylation sites in 7 of these 28 proteins. Ten of these phosphorylation sites are targeted directly by Ipl1p. allowing us to identify a consensus phosphorylation site for an Aurora kinase.

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex. and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process.

In this method. the mixture of proteins is digested with a proteolytic enzyme to produce a large collection of peptides. The complex peptide mixture is then separated on-line with a tandem mass spectrometer. acquiring large numbers of tandem mass spectra. The tandem mass spectra are then used to search a protein database to identify the proteins present. Results from standard protein mixtures show that proteins present in simple mixtures can be readily identified with a 30-fold difference in molar quantity. that the identifications are reproducible. and that proteins within the mixture can be identified at low femtomole levels.

We now report that an Arg–His substitution at residue 117 of the cationic trypsinogen gene is associated with the HP phenotype. This mutation was observed in all HP affected individuals and obligate carriers from five kindreds. but not in individuals who married into the families nor in 140 unrelated individuals. X-ray crystal structure analysis. molecular modelling. and protein digest data indicate that the Arg 117 residue is a trypsin-sensitive site.

Cloning of the Arabidopsis EIN2 gene identifies a central component of the ethylene signaling pathway. The amino-terminal integral membrane domain of EIN2 shows similarity to the disease-related Nramp family of metal-ion transporters. Expression of the EIN2 CEND is sufficient to constitutively activate ethylene responses and restores responsiveness to jasmonic acid and paraquat-induced oxygen radicals to mutant plants. EIN2 is thus recognized as a molecular link between previously distinct hormone response pathways.

Plants express disease resistance (R) proteins that respond specifically to a particular type III effector by activating immune responses. We demonstrated previously that two unrelated type III effectors from Pseudomonas syringae target and modify the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein. Here. we show that AvrRpt2. a third. unrelated type III effector. also targets RIN4 and induces its posttranscriptional disappearance. This effect is independent of the presence of RPS2. the Arabidopsis R protein that senses AvrRpt2. RIN4 overexpression inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function. Conversely. disruption of RIN4 results in RPS2-dependent lethality. RPS2 and RIN4 physically associate in the plant. We suggest that RIN4 is the target of the AvrRpt2 virulence function. and that perturbation of RIN4 activates RPS2.

However. genetic mutants in Ca2+ sensors that impair guard cell or plant ion channel signaling responses have not been identified. and whether Ca2+-independent ABA signaling mechanisms suffice for a full response remains unclear. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) have been proposed to contribute to central signal transduction responses in plants. However. no Arabidopsis CDPK gene disruption mutant phenotype has been reported to date. likely due to overlapping redundancies in CDPKs. Two Arabidopsis guard cell–expressed CDPK genes. CPK3 and CPK6. showed gene disruption phenotypes. ABA and Ca2+ activation of slow-type anion channels and. interestingly. ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells. Furthermore. ABA- and Ca2+-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However. rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected. consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network.

The defect. a decrease in the normal inhibition of the P50 auditory-evoked response to the second of paired stimuli. is associated with attentional disturbances in schizophrenia. Decreased P50 inhibition occurs not only in most schizophrenics. but also in many of their nonschizophrenic relatives. in a distribution consistent with inherited vulnerability for the illness. Neurobiological investigations in both humans and animal models indicated that decreased function of the α7-nicotinic cholinergic receptor could underlie the physiological defect.

Obstetric and perinatal hazards were also invoked as environmentally determined aetiological factors. The first British twin sample has been re-examined and a second total population sample of autistic twins recruited. In the combined sample 60% of monozygotic (MZ) pairs were concordant for autism versus no dizygotic (DZ) pairs; 92% of MZ pairs were concordant for a broader spectrum of related cognitive or social abnormalities versus 10% of DZ pairs. The findings indicate that autism is under a high degree of genetic control and suggest the involvement of multiple genetic loci.

The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia’s genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome. and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random. and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication.

In this paper. we study the problems of learning hash functions in the context of multimodal data for cross-view similarity search. We put forward a novel hashing method. which is referred to Collective Matrix Factorization Hashing (CMFH).

Two bulked DNA samples are generated from a segregating population from a single cross.

Genes for resistance (R genes) to diverse pathogens cloned from several species encode proteins that have motifs in common. These motifs indicate that R genes are part of signal-transduction systems. Most of these R genes encode a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region. Sequences encoding putative solvent-exposed residues in this region are hypervariable and have elevated ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions; this suggests that they have evolved to detect variation in pathogen-derived ligands.

A limitation of such tests is that they generally are not valid tests of association when data from related nuclear families from larger pedigrees are used. Standard methods require selection of a single nuclear family from any extended pedigrees when testing for linkage disequilibrium. Often data are available for larger pedigrees. and it would be desirable to have a valid test of linkage disequilibrium that can use all potentially informative data. In this study. we present the pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT) for analysis of linkage disequilibrium in general pedigrees.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Multiple testing is a challenging issue in genetic association studies using large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. many of which exhibit linkage disequilibrium (LD). Failure to adjust for multiple testing appropriately may produce excessive false positives or overlook true positive signals. The Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons is easy to compute. but is well known to be conservative in the presence of LD. On the other hand. permutation‐based corrections can correctly account for LD among SNPs. but are computationally intensive. In this work. we propose a new multiple testing correction method for association studies using SNP markers. We show that it is simple. fast and more accurate than the recently developed methods and is comparable to permutation‐based corrections using both simulated and real data.

The chromosome 13 gene (FKHR) is identified as a member of the fork head domain family of transcription factors characterized by a conserved DNA binding motif. Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrates that a 5′ PAX3–3′ FKHR chimaeric transcript is expressed in all eight alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas investigated. Immunoprecipitation experiments detect the predicted fusion protein. These findings indicate that the t (2; 13) generates a potentially tumorigenic fusion transcription factor consisting of intact PAX3 DNA binding domains. a truncated fork head DNA binding domain and C–terminal FKHR regions.,True,awHA63oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,957,https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1193-230,6504356994904623346,/scholar?cites=6504356994904623346,,,0,0,0

The rearrangement breakpoints occur within an intron downstream of the paired box and homeodomain–encodingregions. Upstream PAX3 sequences hybridize to a novel transcript in t (2; 13)–containing lines. Cloning and characterization of this novel transcript indicate that the translocation juxtaposes the PAX3 DNA binding elements with chromosome 13 sequences. suggesting formation of a hybrid transcription factor.

We have identified a small region on chromosome 7q that shows strong linkage disequilibrium between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and PTC taste sensitivity in unrelated subjects. This region contains a single gene that encodes a member of the TAS2R bitter taste receptor family. We identified three coding SNPs giving rise to five haplotypes in this gene worldwide. These haplotypes completely explain the bimodal distribution of PTC taste sensitivity. thus accounting for the inheritance of the classically defined taste insensitivity and for 55 to 85% of the variance in PTC sensitivity.

To explore gene overexpression phenotypes systematically. we assembled an array of 5280 yeast strains. each containing an inducible copy of an S. cerevisiae gene. covering >80% of the genome. Approximately 15% of the overexpressed genes (769) reduced growth rate. This gene set was enriched for cell cycle-regulated genes. signaling molecules. and transcription factors. Overexpression of most toxic genes resulted in phenotypes different from known deletion mutant phenotypes. suggesting that overexpression phenotypes usually reflect a specific regulatory imbalance rather than disruption of protein complex stoichiometry.

Certain of these loci are highly polymorphic. and the mechanisms responsible for this polymorphism have been intensely debated. Four independent lines of evidence support the hypothesis that MHC polymorphisms are selectively maintained: (a) The distribution of allelic frequencies does not fit the neutral expectation. (b) The rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution significantly exceeds the rate of synonymous substitution in the codons encoding the peptide-binding region of the molecule. (c) Polymorphisms have been maintained for long periods of time (“trans-species polymorphism”).

Therefore. a protein's position in a network may indicate how central it is to cellular function and. hence. how constrained it is evolutionarily. To look for an effect of position on evolutionary rate. we examined the protein-protein interaction networks in three eukaryotes: yeast. worm. and fly. We find that the three networks have remarkably similar structure. such that the number of interactors per protein and the centrality of proteins in the networks have similar distributions. Proteins that have a more central position in all three networks. regardless of the number of direct interactors. evolve more slowly and are more likely to be essential for survival.

Mutated T24 Ha-ras was also studied in a near-diploid cell derived from early passage Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CHL). In contrast to the parental fibroblasts. cells expressing any of the human oncogenes engendered rapidly growing tumours in immune-suppressed animals. Blood-and lymph-borne metastases were observed from both ras-and myc-expressing cells. In general ras-expressing cells were more aggressive than those expressing myc. In the 208F background. expression of c-myc was associated with an incidence of mitosis similar to that in tumours expressing T24 Ha-ras. but incidence of single cell death by apoptosis was higher.

The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are commonly associated with defects in folate dependent homocysteine metabolism and have been implicated as risk factors for recurrent embryo loss in early pregnancy. In the present study we have determined the prevalence of combined MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in DNA samples from spontaneously aborted embryos (foetal death between sixth and twentieth week after conception) and adult controls using solid-phase minisequencing technique. There was a significant odds ratio of 14.2 (95% CI 1.78-113) in spontaneously aborted embryos comparing the prevalence of one or more 677T and 1298C alleles vs the wild type combined genotype (677CC/1298AA …,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,213,https://www.nature.com/articles/5200767,3396188391806530218,/scholar?cites=3396188391806530218,,https://www.nature.com/articles/5200767,0,0,0

Here. we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated. but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular. cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize. forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop.

1232098,The Humboldt current system of northern and central Chile,2007,Martin Thiel and Juan Carlos Castilla and Miriam Fernández and Sergio Navarrete,,,,,,The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth. It extends along the west coast of South America from southern Chile (~ 42 S) up to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands near the equator. The general oceanography of the HCS is characterised by a predominant northward flow of surface waters of subantarctic origin and by strong upwelling of cool nutrient-rich subsurface waters of equatorial origin. Along the coast of northern and central Chile. upwelling is localised and its occurrence changes from being mostly continuous (aseasonal) in northern Chile to a more seasonal pattern in southern-central Chile. Several important upwelling centres along the Chilean coast are interspersed with long stretches of coast without or with sporadic and less intense upwelling. Large-scale climatic phenomena (El Niño Southern Oscillation. ENSO) are superimposed onto this regional pattern. which results in a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. complicating the prediction of ecological processes along the Chilean coast. This limited predictability becomes particularly critical in light of increasing human activities during the past decades. at present mainly in the form of exploitation of renewable resources (fish. invertebrates and macroalgae). This review examines current knowledge of ecological processes in the HCS of northern and central Chile. with a particular focus on oceanographic factors and the influence of human activities. and further suggests conservation strategies for this high-priority large marine ecosystem.

The technique is a simple conjoining of the Maxam-Gilbert DNA-sequencing method and the technique of DNAase-protected fragment isolation. Fragments of a 5′ end-labelled. double-stranded DNA segment. partially degraded by DNAase in the presence and absence of the binding protein. are visualized by eletrophoresis and autoradiography alongside the base-specific reaction products of the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing method. It is then possible to see the protective “footprint” of the binding protein on the DNA sequence. The binding of lac repressor to lac operator is visualized by “footprinting” as an example.

In Arabidopsis. gain-of-function alleles of PHAVOLUTA and PHABULOSA. members of the class III HD-ZIP gene family. result in adaxialization of lateral organs. Conversely. loss-of-function alleles of the KANADI genes cause an adaxialization of lateral organs. Thus. the class III HD-ZIP and KANADI genes comprise a genetic system that patterns abaxial-adaxial polarity in lateral organs produced from the apical meristem.Results: We show that gain-of-function alleles of REVOLUTA. another member of the class III HD-ZIP gene family. are characterized by adaxialized lateral organs and alterations in the radial patterning of vascular bundles in the stem.

In Arabidopsis. the establishment of polarity in the leaf probably requires the generation and perception of positional information along the radial (adaxial versus abaxial or central versus peripheral) dimension of the plant. This is because the future upper (adaxial) side of the leaf develops from cells closer to the centre of the shoot. whereas the future under (abaxial) side develops from cells located more peripherally. Here we implicate the Arabidopsis PHABULOSA and PHAVOLUTA genes in the perception of radial positional information in the leaf primordium. Dominant phabulosa (phb) 1 and phavoluta (phv) mutations cause a dramatic transformation of abaxial leaf fates into adaxial leaf fates.

Few studies 1. 2. 3 have focused on identifying genes that regulate this process. in spite of the agronomic value of controlling seed dispersal in crop plants such as canola 4. 5. Here we show that the closely related SHATTERPROOF (SHP1) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2) MADS-box genes are required for fruit dehiscence in Arabidopsis. Moreover.

These effects become manifest as a partial conversion of flowers into inflorescence shoots and a disruption of sepal and petal development. We describe the changes in an allelic series of nine apetala1 mutants and show that the two functions of APETALA1 are separable. We have also studied the interaction between APETALA1 and other floral genes by examining the phenotypes of multiply mutant plants and by in situ hybridization using probes for several floral control genes. The results suggest that the products of APETALA1 and another gene. LEAFY. are required to ensure that primordia arising on the flanks of the inflorescence apex adopt a floral fate. as opposed to becoming an inflorescence shoot.

In plant roots the radial tissue organization is highly conserved with a central vascular cylinder in which two water conducting cell types. protoxylem and metaxylem. are patterned centripetally. We show that this patterning occurs through crosstalk between the vascular cylinder and the surrounding endodermis mediated by cell-to-cell movement of a transcription factor in one direction and microRNAs in the other. SHORT ROOT. produced in the vascular cylinder. moves into the endodermis to activate SCARECROW. Together these transcription factors activate MIR165a and MIR166b.

Mutations in this homeotic gene cause the transformation of stamens to petals in floral whorl 3 and of carpels to another ag flower in floral whorl 4. We found that AG RNA is present in the stamen and carpel primordia but is undetectable in sepal and petal primordia throughout early wild-type flower development. consistent with the mutant phenotype. We also analyzed the distribution of AG RNA in apetela2 (ap2) mutant flowers. AP2 is a floral homeotic gene that is necessary for the normal development of sepals and petals in floral whorls 1 and 2. In ap2 mutant flowers. AG RNA is present in the organ primordia of all floral whorls.

Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) plays a role in the hepatic uptake of metformin. but its role in the therapeutic effects of the drug. which involve activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). is unknown. Recent studies have shown that human OCT1 is highly polymorphic. We investigated whether OCT1 plays a role in the action of metformin and whether individuals with OCT1 polymorphisms have reduced response to the drug. In mouse hepatocytes. deletion of Oct1 resulted in a reduction in the effects of metformin on AMPK phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis.

We show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies. shed light on structural variation and recombination. and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution.,True,LM_QwbUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1089,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04226,2620722641977240148,/scholar?cites=2620722641977240148,,,0,0,0

This paper reports recommendations of a two‐year project group funded by NIH to study how to manage IFs in genetic and genomic research. as well as imaging research. We conclude that researchers have an obligation to address the possibility of discovering IFs in their protocol and communications with the IRB. and in their consent forms and communications with research participants. Researchers should establish a pathway for handling IFs and communicate that to the IRB and research participants.

Uniquely among current mapping tools. MOSAIK can align reads generated by all the major sequencing technologies. including Illumina. Applied Biosystems SOLiD. Roche 454. Ion Torrent and Pacific BioSciences SMRT. Indeed. MOSAIK was the only aligner to provide consistent mappings for all the generated data (sequencing technologies. low-coverage and exome) in the 1000 Genomes Project. To provide highly accurate alignments. MOSAIK employs a hash clustering strategy coupled with the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This method is well-suited to capture mismatches as well as short insertions and deletions. To support the growing interest in larger structural variant (SV) discovery. MOSAIK provides explicit support for handling known-sequence SVs. e.g. mobile element insertions (MEIs) as well as generating outputs tailored to aid in SV discovery. All variant discovery benefits from an accurate description of the read placement confidence. To this end. MOSAIK uses a neural-network based training scheme to provide well-calibrated mapping quality scores. demonstrated by a correlation coefficient between MOSAIK assigned and actual mapping qualities greater than 0.98. In order to ensure that studies of any genome are supported. a training pipeline is provided to ensure optimal mapping quality scores for the genome under investigation.

First. although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes. similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare.

Examination of data from 18 independent studies of plants and animals using both standard statistical and meta‐analytical methods revealed a number of interesting points.

However. controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First. it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second. whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third. inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing – and exclusion – of other potential drivers.

For example. fisheries targeting large individuals are expected to select for early maturation at smaller sizes. leading to reduced fecundity and thus also reduced fisheries yield. These predicted phenotypic shifts have been observed in several fish stocks. but disentangling the environmental and genetic causes behind them has proved difficult. Here. we review recent studies investigating phenotypic shifts in exploited populations and strategies for minimizing fisheries-induced evolution.

Hence. early comparative studies revealing lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits were first framed in terms of giving empirical support for this prediction. but subsequent treatments have effectively reversed this view. Fitness traits seem to have higher levels of additive genetic variance than nonfitness traits—an observation that has been explained in terms of the larger number loci influencing fitness as compared to nonfitness traits. This hypothesis about the larger functional architecture of fitness than nonfitness traits is supported by their higher mutational variability. which is hard to reconcile without evoking capture of …,True,cZJ7ifQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,436,https://www.nature.com/articles/6885850,15402797450602896899,/scholar?cites=15402797450602896899,,https://www.nature.com/articles/6885850,0,0,0

Its ubiquity can be inferred from the observation that quantitative genetic divergence among populations usually exceeds that to be expected due to genetic drift alone. and from numerous observations and experiments consistent with local adaptation. Experimental manipulations in natural populations have provided evidence that rapid evolutionary responses may occur in the wild.
