1186312,Pre-existing clusters of the adaptor Lat do not participate in early T cell signaling events,2011,David J Williamson and Dylan M Owen and Jérémie Rossy and Astrid Magenau and Matthias Wehrmann and J Justin Gooding and Katharina Gaus,12,Nature immunology,7,655-662,Nature Publishing Group,Engaged T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) initiate signaling through the adaptor protein Lat. In quiescent T cells. Lat is segregated into clusters on the cell surface. which raises the question of how TCR triggering initiates signaling. Using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. we found that pre-existing Lat domains were neither phosphorylated nor laterally transported to TCR activation sites. which suggested that these clusters do not participate in TCR signaling. Instead. TCR activation resulted in the recruitment and phosphorylation of Lat from subsynaptic vesicles. Studies of Lat mutants confirmed that recruitment preceded and was essential for phosphorylation and that both processes were independent of surface clustering of Lat. Our data suggest that TCR ligation preconditions the membrane for vesicle recruitment and bulk activation of the Lat signaling network.,True,6vul7vEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,307,https://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v12/n7/abs/ni.2049.html,7369752763957858960,/scholar?cites=7369752763957858960,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremie_Rossy/publication/51193216_Pre-existing_clusters_of_the_adaptor_Lat_do_not_participate_in_early_T_cell_signaling_events/links/0912f4fdfb8f8a45a8000000/Pre-existing-clusters-of-the-adaptor-Lat-do-not-participate-in-early-T-cell-signaling-events.pdf,0,0,0

A high degree of membrane order is the biophysical hallmark of cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. which may induce the lateral sorting of proteins within the membrane. Here we describe a quantitative fluorescence microscopy technique for imaging localized lipid environments and measuring membrane lipid order in live and fixed cells. as well as in intact tissues. The method is based on the spectral ratiometric imaging of the polarity-sensitive membrane dyes Laurdan and di-4-ANEPPDHQ. Laurdan typically requires multiphoton excitation. making it suitable for the imaging of tissues such as whole. living zebrafish embryos. whereas di-4-ANEPPDHQ imaging can be achieved with standard confocal microscopes.

Here we provide the first direct evidence that the plasma membrane of intact. live cells is comprised of a sub-resolution mixture of approximately 76% ordered and 24% disordered lipid domains. which correspond to liquid-ordered and-disordered model membranes. These measurements were based on the unmixing of fluorescence lifetime decays (phasor analysis) obtained from environmentally sensitive membrane dyes that report the degree of lipid packing.

Because Lck is constitutively active. spatial organization may regulate TCR signaling. Here we found that Lck distributions on the molecular level were controlled by the conformational states of Lck. with the open. active conformation inducing clustering and the closed. inactive conformation preventing clustering. In contrast. association with lipid domains and protein networks were not sufficient or necessary for Lck clustering.

1186318,The lipid raft hypothesis revisited–New insights on raft composition and function from super‐resolution fluorescence microscopy,2012,Dylan M Owen and Astrid Magenau and David Williamson and Katharina Gaus,34,,9,739-747,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,Recently developed super‐resolution microscopy techniques are changing our understanding of lipid rafts and membrane organisation in general. The lipid raft hypothesis postulates that cholesterol can drive the formation of ordered domains within the plasma membrane of cells. which may serve as platforms for cell signalling and membrane trafficking. There is now a wealth of evidence for these domains. However. their study has hitherto been hampered by the resolution limit of optical microscopy. making the definition of their properties problematic and contentious. New microscopy techniques circumvent the resolution limit and. for the first time. allow the fluorescence imaging of structures on length scales below 200 nm.

In this study. we use liposome coreconstitution to examine the effects of different types of lipids on MscS and MscL mechanosensitivity simultaneously using the patch-clamp technique and confocal microscopy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)-FRET microscopy demonstrated that coreconstitution of MscS and MscL led to clustering of these channels causing a significant increase in the MscS activation threshold.

However. their role in regulating T cell differentiation and function remains controversial. In this study. by applying a new approach involving microscopy and flow cytometry. we characterize membrane lipid order in ex vivo primary human CD4+ T cells. We reveal that differential membrane lipid order dictates the response to TCR stimulation. T cells with high membrane order formed stable immune synapses and proliferated robustly. intermediate order cells had reduced proliferative ability accompanied by unstable immune synapse formation. whereas low order T cells were profoundly unresponsive to TCR activation.

In order to understand the regulation and formation of fenestrations. the relationship between membrane rafts and fenestrations was investigated in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells where fenestrations are grouped into sieve plates. Three dimensional structured illumination microscopy. scanning electron microscopy. internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy and two-photon fluorescence microscopy were used to study liver sinusoidal endothelial cells isolated from mice. There was an inverse distribution between sieve plates and membrane rafts visualized by structured illumination microscopy and the fluorescent raft stain. Bodipy FL C5 ganglioside GM1. 7-ketocholesterol and/or cytochalasin D increased both fenestrations and lipid-disordered membrane. while Triton X-100 decreased both fenestrations and lipid-disordered membrane. The effects of cytochalasin D on fenestrations were abrogated by co-administration of Triton X-100. suggesting that actin disruption increases fenestrations by its effects on membrane rafts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) depleted lipid-ordered membrane and increased fenestrations.

Aims To estimate the per-event probability of HCV infection during a sharing event. and the transmission probability of HCV from contaminated injecting apparatus.  Methods Estimates were obtained using a maximum likelihood method with estimated IDU and sharing events obtained from behavioural data.  Settings Cohort study in multiple correction centres in New South Wales. Australia  Participants Subjects (N = 500) with a lifetime history of injecting drug use (IDU) who were followed up between 2005 and 2012. During follow-up. interviews for risk behaviours were taken and blood sampling (HCV-antibody and RNA testing) was performed.  Measurements Self-reported frequencies of injecting drugs and sharing events. as well as other risk behaviours and details on the nature of injecting events.  Findings The best estimate of the per-event probability of infection was 0.57% (CI: 0.32–1.05%). A sensitivity analysis on the likely effect of under-reporting of sharing of the injecting apparatus indicated that the per event infection probability may be as low as 0.17% (95% CI: 0.11%–0.25%). The transmission probability was similarly shown to range up to 6%. dependent on the presumed prevalence of the virus in injecting equipment.  Conclusions The transmission probability of HCV during a sharing event is small. Hence. strategies to reduce the frequency and sharing of injecting equipment are required. as well as interventions focused on decreasing the per event risk.,True,sJ5lnmcAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100749,15872798647583719021,/scholar?cites=15872798647583719021,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100749,0,0,0

It has been hypothesised that a self-renewing population of T cells. named stem cell–like memory T (TSCM) cells. are responsible for maintaining memory. However. it is not clear if the dynamics of TSCM cells in vivo are compatible with this hypothesis. To address this issue. we investigated the dynamics of TSCM cells under physiological conditions in humans in vivo using a multidisciplinary approach that combines mathematical modelling. stable isotope labelling. telomere length analysis. and cross-sectional data from vaccine recipients. We show that. unexpectedly. the average longevity of a TSCM clone is very short (half-life < 1 year. degree of self-renewal = 430 days): far too short to constitute a stem cell population. However. we also find that the TSCM population is comprised of at least 2 kinetically distinct subpopulations that turn over at different rates. Whilst one subpopulation is rapidly replaced (half-life = 5 months) and explains the rapid average turnover of the bulk TSCM population. the half-life of the other TSCM subpopulation is approximately 9 years. consistent with the longevity of the recall response. We also show that this latter population exhibited a high degree of self-renewal. with a cell residing without dying or differentiating for 15% of our lifetime. Finally. although small. the population was not subject to excessive stochasticity. We conclude that the majority of TSCM cells are not stem cell–like but that there is a subpopulation of TSCM cells whose dynamics are compatible with their putative …,True,sJ5lnmcAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005523,12377128481236144962,/scholar?cites=12377128481236144962,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005523,0,0,0

Alter et al hypothesise that variant peptide. in complex with HLA class I molecules binds KIR receptors and either increases NK cell inhibition or decreases NK cell activation compared to wild type peptide thus leading to virus escape from the NK cell response. According to this hypothesis. in order for NK cells to select for an escape variant. an individual must carry both the KIR and an HLA ligand that binds the variant peptide. In this study we estimate the proportion of the population that is capable of selecting for escape variants and use both epidemiological modelling and a model-free approach to investigate whether this proportion explains the observed variant enrichment. We found that the fraction of individuals within whom the variant would have a selective advantage was low and was unable to explain the high degree of enrichment observed. We conclude that whilst Alter et al’s data is consistent with selection pressure. the mechanism that they postulate is unlikely. The importance of this work is two-fold. Firstly. it forces a re-evaluation of some of the clearest evidence that NK cells exert a protective effect in HIV-1 infection. Secondly. it implies that there is a significant aspect of immunology that is not understood: it is possible that KIRs bind much more widely than was previously appreciated; that a gene in linkage with the KIR genes is responsible for considerable peptide-dependent selection or …,True,sJ5lnmcAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,8,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006361&rev=2,2994487802102368394,/scholar?cites=2994487802102368394,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006361&rev=2,0,0,0

MHC class I molecules assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with chaperones. including calnexin and calreticulin. before binding to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP).

Post mortem brain samples from patients with ASC display neuroglial activation and inflammatory markers in cerebro-spinal fluid. although little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) is a protein found in almost all cell types and mediates regulation of immune response by inducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. establishing a feedback mechanism that can produce chronic or excessive inflammation.

We find cigarette taxes are less than fully passed through to consumer prices. suggesting consumers and producers split the excess burden of these taxes. Using information on consumer location. we show the availability of lower-tax goods across state borders creates significant differences in the pass-through rate. Tax avoidance opportunities also have a sizable effect on purchasing behavior by altering consumer search. prices paid and quantities purchased. Finally. we demonstrate that the incidence of cigarette taxes and the border effect varies by household income and education. (JEL D12. H22. H25. H26. H71.

1186414,Penalized quantile regression with semiparametric correlated effects: An application with heterogeneous preferences,2017,Matthew Harding and Carlos Lamarche,32,Journal of Applied Econometrics,2,342-358,,This paper proposes new ℓ1‐penalized quantile regression estimators for panel data. which explicitly allows for individual heterogeneity associated with covariates. Existing fixed‐effects estimators can potentially suffer from three limitations which are overcome by the proposed approach: (i) incidental parameters bias in nonlinear models with large N and small T; (ii) lack of efficiency; and (iii) inability to estimate the effects of time‐invariant regressors. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to assess the small‐sample performance of the new estimators and provide comparisons of new and existing penalized estimators in terms of quadratic loss. We apply the technique to an empirical example of the estimation of consumer preferences for nutrients from a demand model using a large transaction‐level dataset of household food purchases.

1186415,Estimating the number of factors in large dimensional factor models,2013,Matthew Harding,,,,,mimeo. April,This paper develops a new spectral approach to the estimation of the number of latent factors in large dimensional factor models. It shows that by imposing restrictions on the error terms we can derive a consistent procedure with improved finite sample performance in the presence of weak factors. The paper uses free probability theory to derive analytic expressions for the limiting moments of the spectral distribution. which greatly simplifies the computational burden. The new approach performs very well in a series of Monte Carlo simulations against the leading competing approaches. This procedure is also shown to provide realistic estimates of the number of latent factors in applications of factor models to asset pricing and data reduction of macroeconomic indicators.,True,BiEu8UcAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,19,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10051063281043516378&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10051063281043516378,/scholar?cites=10051063281043516378,,,0,0,0

Enrollment requires certification by a physician that the patient has a life expectancy of less than six months. We examined how long before death patients enrolled in hospice programs.Using 1990 Medicare claims data. we analyzed the characteristics and survival of 6451 hospice patients followed for a minimum of 27 months with respect to mortality.The patients' mean age was 76.4 years; 92.4 percent were white.

Methods A Working Group of the Research Network of the European Association for Palliative Care identified clinically significant topics. reviewed the studies. and assigned the level of evidence. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible because of the heterogeneity of published studies and the lack of minimal standards in reporting results. A systematic electronic literature search within the main available medical literature databases was performed for each of the following four areas identified: clinical prediction of survival (CPS). biologic factors. clinical signs and symptoms and psychosocial variables. and prognostic scores. Only studies on patients with advanced cancer and survival ≤ 90 days were included.  Results A total of 38 studies were evaluated. Level A evidence-based recommendations of prognostic correlation could be formulated for CPS (albeit with a series of limitations of which clinicians must be aware) and prognostic scores. Recommendations on the use of other prognostic factors. such as performance status. symptoms associated with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome (weight loss. anorexia. dysphagia. and xerostomia). dyspnea. delirium. and some biologic factors (leukocytosis. lymphocytopenia. and C-reactive protein). reached level B.

The authors examine how clinical students perceive their ethical environment. their feelings about their dilemmas. and whether these dilemmas erode students' ethical principles. METHOD: An anonymous mail survey was sent in 1992-93 to the 1.853 third-and fourth-year medical students enrolled at six Pennsylvania medical schools. The survey addressed whether students had encountered situations they felt were ethically problematic. their attitudes toward these situations. and their perceptions of their personal ethical development. Data were analyzed with logistic regression; respondents' comments were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Of the 665 students (36%) who responded. 58% reported having done something they believed was unethical. and 52% reported having misled a patient; 80% reported at least one of these two behaviors. In addition. 98% had heard physicians refer derogatorily to patients; 61% had witnessed what they believed to be unethical behavior by other medical team members. and of these students. 54% felt like accomplices. Many students reported dissatisfaction with their actions and ethical development: 67% had felt bad or guilty about something they had done as clinical clerks; 62% believed that at least some of their ethical principles had been eroded or lost.

Here we introduce a new phenotypic database summarizing correlations obtained from the disease history of more than 30 million patients in a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). We present evidence that the structure of the PDN is relevant to the understanding of illness progression by showing that (1) patients develop diseases close in the network to those they already have; (2) the progression of disease along the links of the network is different for patients of different genders and ethnicities; (3) patients diagnosed with diseases which are more highly connected in the PDN tend to die sooner than those affected by less connected diseases; and (4) diseases that tend to be preceded by others in the PDN tend to be more connected than diseases that precede other illnesses. and are associated with higher degrees of mortality. Our findings show that disease progression can be represented and studied using network methods. offering the potential to enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of human diseases.

It would be natural to suppose that warring groups form alliances based on shared identity considerations-such as Christian groups allying with Christian groups. or Muslim groups with their fellow co-religionists-but this is not what we see. Two groups that identify themselves as bitter foes one day. on the basis of some identity narrative. might be allies the next day and vice versa. Nor is any group. however homogeneous. safe from internal fractionalization. Rather. looking closely at the civil wars in Afghanistan and Bosnia and testing against the broader universe of fifty-three cases of multiparty civil wars.

The results indicate that the program generally has a positive effect on all three measures. but has no effects in areas with high levels of initial violence.

This article explores how electoral rules. such as district magnitude. mediate this trade-off and affect the composition of representative bodies and the quality of policy outcomes. We show formally that anticipation of bargaining over policy causes voters in elections with multiple single-member districts to prefer candidates with polarized policy positions over more competent candidates. Results from a unique field experiment in Afghanistan are consistent with these predictions.

Observables associated with economic well being include the presence of commercial infrastructure. house size. presence of vehicles. crop conditions. and access to transportation. The transportation and communication infrastructure also indicates the expected level of interactions among elements of the society.

Communityoriented policing is a widely celebrated reform that aims to do so. and advocates are calling for its adoption around the world. However. the evidence base is limited to a small number of countries. does not generally study the bundle of practices commonly implemented together. and is largely silent on effects on trust. We designed six field experiments with police agencies in the Global South to study locally designed models of community policing. with coordinated measures of crime and the attitudes and behaviors of citizens and police from both surveys and administrative data. In a preregistered meta-analysis. we find that these interventions largely failed to improve citizen-police relations and do not reduce crime.

This reflects a worldwide trend in the use of service provision by non-state actors to gain political support. Existing works attribute the notable local-level variation in such provision to strategic choice or low state capacity. Focusing on the Gulen Movement. the largest Islamist group in contemporary Turkey. we find no evidence that state weakness increases Islamist service provision. Rather we show that service allocation is highly dependent on a group’s ability to marshal local resources. specifically through the associational mobilization of local business elites. For our inferences. we exploit spatial variation in Islamist service delivery across Turkey’s 970 districts and use data on the Erdogan government’s purge of thousands of non-state education institutions and bureaucrats. along with original data on business associations. endowments. public service infrastructure. and early Republican associations.,True,lgA6NO0AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3729388,7391991556627961963,/scholar?cites=7391991556627961963,,https://fotini.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/BC_ImamsBusinessmen.pdf,0,0,0

Because states implemented welfare reform at different times starting in 1992. the cross-state variation over time permits us to quasi-experimentally separate out the effect of mothers' welfare participation during childhood on daughters' economic outcomes in adulthood in the pre-and post-welfare reform periods. We find that a mother's welfare participation increased her daughter's odds of participation as an adult by roughly 30 percentage points. but that welfare reform attenuated this transmission by at least 50 percent. or at least 30 percent over the baseline odds of participation. While we find comparable-sized transmission patterns in daughters' adult use of the broader safety net and other outcomes such as educational attainment and income. there is no diminution of transmission after welfare reform.

Existing fixed‐effects estimators can potentially suffer from three limitations which are overcome by the proposed approach: (i) incidental parameters bias in nonlinear models with large N and small T; (ii) lack of efficiency; and (iii) inability to estimate the effects of time‐invariant regressors. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to assess the small‐sample performance of the new estimators and provide comparisons of new and existing penalized estimators in terms of quadratic loss.

1186485,Industry-wide work rules and productivity: evidence from Argentine union contract data,2013,Carlos Lamarche,2,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,1,1-25,SpringerOpen,In the early 1990’s. the Argentine government promoted a framework for productivity-based negotiations between firms and unions at low levels of organization. The policy weakened the industry-wide collective bargaining system. which sets working conditions for all firms in an industry. This paper employs newly developed quantile regression approaches to investigate the effect of union practices on productivity within the context of the reform. The findings show that (i) industry-wide practices on displacement of workers and training have a negative impact on productivity; (ii) work practices do not appear to restrict economic efficiency in the post-reform period; (iii) union practices on technology acquisition have an adverse effect on high-productivity growth industries. Productivity seems to improve in an economy promoting policies to weaken industry-wide collective bargaining.

The paper adopts the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) approach proposed in the literature and demonstrates that the extension to the estimation of dynamic quantile regression models is feasible under similar conditions to the ones used in the literature. The new quantile regression estimator is shown to be consistent and its asymptotic distribution is derived.

Applying quantile regression. they report that increases in test scores are not observed in the lower quantiles of the conditional educational attainment distribution. They also estimate a classical Gaussian random effects model to account for individual heterogeneity. but this approach precludes estimating effects other than the mean. To get around the problem. we employ the quantile regression panel methods.

In particular. contractors may adjust bids to compensate for renegotiation. resequencing of tasks. and other costs associated with project modifications.

Texas sharply reduced its spending on change orders starting in the mid-2000s.

Elbow injuries in this population continue to rise in parallel with the increase in youth participation in sports both throughout the calendar year and across multiple sports. Many of these injuries are noncontact and are attributed to overuse. Evaluation and management of youth and adolescent athletic elbow injuries requires knowledge of developmental anatomy. injury pathophysiology. and established treatment algorithms.

1186581,The role of breast-feeding in the development of allergies and asthma,2005,Noah J Friedman and Robert S Zeiger,115,,6,1238-1248,Mosby,Breast-feeding is the preferred method of infant nutrition for numerous reasons. However. its role in the prevention of allergic disease remains controversial. Reasons for this controversy include methodological differences and flaws in the studies performed to date. the immunologic complexity of breast milk itself and. possibly. genetic differences among patients that would affect whether breast-feeding is protective against the development of allergies or is in fact sensitizing. The preponderance of evidence does suggest. however. that there would be much to lose by not recommending breast-feeding. In general. studies reveal that infants fed formulas of intact cow's milk or soy protein compared with breast milk have a higher incidence of atopic dermatitis and wheezing illnesses in early childhood.

1186636,Permutation polynomials for interleavers in turbo codes,2003,CJ Corrada Bravo and PV Kumar,,,,318-318,IEEE,In 1993 a class of near channel capacity achieving codes were introduced by Berrou et al [l]. In the original implementation. a random interleaver is used. Reference [4] introduced a class of semi-random interleavers. These have been shown to have the best performance. whenever a suitable semi-random interleaver with the desired parameters exists. However. existence is not always guaranteed and even when they do exist one has to resort to computer searches to identify them. The fact that these interleavers (random and s-random) are found by computer search implies that they have to be stored in memory. To avoid this problem. researchers have considered deterministic constructions that can be generated on the fly and that perform as well as random interleavers. In this work. we study algebraically constructed deterministic interleavers and the composition of permutation polynomials.

1186640,Audio segmentation using Flattened Local Trimmed Range for ecological acoustic space analysis,2016,Giovany Vega and Carlos J Corrada-Bravo and T Mitchell Aide,2,PeerJ Computer Science,,e70,PeerJ Inc.,The acoustic space in a given environment is filled with footprints arising from three processes: biophony. geophony and anthrophony. Bioacoustic research using passive acoustic sensors can result in thousands of recordings. An important component of processing these recordings is to automate signal detection. In this paper. we describe a new spectrogram-based approach for extracting individual audio events. Spectrogram-based audio event detection (AED) relies on separating the spectrogram into background (ie. noise) and foreground (ie. signal) classes using a threshold such as a global threshold. a per-band threshold. or one given by a classifier. These methods are either too sensitive to noise. designed for an individual species. or require prior training data. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that is not sensitive to noise. does not need any prior training data and works with any type of audio event. To do this. we propose:(1) a spectrogram filtering method. the Flattened Local Trimmed Range (FLTR) method. which models the spectrogram as a mixture of stationary and non-stationary energy processes and mitigates the effect of the stationary processes. and (2) an unsupervised algorithm that uses the filter to detect audio events. We measured the performance of the algorithm using a set of six thoroughly validated audio recordings and obtained a sensitivity of 94% and a positive predictive value of 89%. These sensitivity and positive predictive values are very high. given that the validated recordings are diverse and obtained from field conditions. The algorithm was then used to extract audio events in three datasets.

Traditionally. the biologists and field experts were in charge of manually categorizing audio with species annotations. With advances in data capture. the quantity of data available is overwhelming to be manually classified and categorized. Thus. biologists started using intelligent classification algorithms to automatically categorize audio with species annotations. Automatic species classification utilizes computer resources to replace the time consuming work of manually categorizing audio data. In addition. the automatic approach can be used to categorize large audio archives or real-time audio data. hence enabling the possibility of automatic retrieval.

Furthermore. we show that insect richness was the best predictor of variation in total ASU. and that insect richness was proportionally greater at high-diversity sites. In addition. insects used a broad range of frequencies. including high frequencies (> 8000 Hz). which contributed to greater ASU.

Within the Neotropics. the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however. recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately. very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon. sampled first in 1984–1985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22 years at this site.

Maintaining canopy connectivity through preservation of connecting branches (ie natural canopy bridges) may help mitigate that impact. Using camera traps. we evaluated crossing rates of a pipeline right-of-way in a control area with no bridges and in a test area where 13 bridges were left by the pipeline construction company. Monitoring all canopy crossing points for a year (7.102 canopy camera nights). we confirmed bridge use by 25 mammal species from 12 families. With bridge use beginning immediately after exposure and increasing over time. use rates were over two orders of magnitude higher than on the ground.

About half of the variation in frog biomass (48%) could be attributed to stem turnover rate. while over two-thirds of the variation in lizard biomass (69%) was explained by primary productivity.

Here. we examine the effect of preservation on one of the most common measurement of frogs. snout-urostyle length (SUL). Preservation had significant effects on the SUL of 13 of the 14 species of North American frogs included in this study. with all species decreasing in SUL by 0.31-5.62%. Smaller frog species did not shrink proportionally more or less than larger species. Absolute shrinkage was correlated with SUL and was greater in larger species. Within species. percent shrinkage was not significantly correlated with SUL in 10 species. but significantly greater for larger individuals in 3 species. and decreased with size in 1 species. Absolute shrinkage was statistically greater for larger individuals in 4 species. Our results agree with studies of morphological permutations in fish which show that most preservation-related changes take place within the first few months after initial preservation.

Despite the large body of research stemming from this region. little is known about the effects of geomorphology and primary productivity on the fauna of Amazonia. and on reptiles and amphibians in particular. In my dissertation. I examine differences in the abundance. biomass and species richness of secondary consumers in the leaf litter herpetofauna communities on young and ancient soils. Herein. I develop methods to utilize existing data sets and museum collections in new studies involving community biomass. I found that. although the process of preservation does change the size of specimens. for most species the differences are less than 4%. Furthermore. these changes can be quantified and taken into account when applying measurements made on preserved specimens to studies of living individuals. I also derive equations which can be used to calculate mass from length in anurans. Snout-vent length (SVL) has been measured on thousands of herps. some released in the field and many housed in research collections. Estimated using SVL measurements. mass of individuals can now be used to determine community biomass of populations that were initially sampled for other purposes. In the second half of this dissertation. I assess the effects of geomorphology on leaf litter herpetofauna in Neotropical lowland rainforests.

However. opportunities to study them are relatively rare. Here we report on the effects of the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano on the forest bird community of the Lesser Antillean island of Montserrat. The island's species‐poor avifauna includes 11 restricted‐range species. including the Critically Endangered endemic Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi. Analysis of monitoring data from 1997 to 2005 indicates that counts of most species were substantially lower following major ashfalls. However. this effect was short‐lived. with rapid population recovery in subsequent years. Furthermore. levels of seasonal rainfall appear to have been at least as important in determining population trends as ashfall. Overall. most species were at least as abundant at the end of the study as at the start. and no forest bird …,True,zL7naiIAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,46,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00631.x,6307007457231762196,/scholar?cites=6307007457231762196,,https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/download/30012.pdf,0,0,0

Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills. In July 1995. a long-dormant volcano on Chances Peak in the Soufriere Hills began to erupt. Since then the forest habitat of the oriole on the Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills has been devastated by pyroclastic flows and surges. heavy ash eruptions and rock falls. The Montserrat Oriole populations that inhabited these two mountain ranges have probably been lost.

Since then. the eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano has destroyed more than half of the species’ range. Recent intensive monitoring has indicated that the species has also declined dramatically within the remaining intact forest. and is now critically threatened. Different monitoring and analytical methods indicate a decline of 8–52% p.a.. and a remaining global population of ca. 100–400 pairs. This case study justifies the use of the restricted range criterion in designating threatened species.

Unlike systematic mist-net generated survival rates (see following discussion of annual survival in a dry-forest thrasher population). my mark-recapture (and resight) study of a rain-forest thrasher population allowed me to look more closely at the concerns outlined in Sandercock et al.(2000) such as demography. transience. heterogeneous mortality rates between the sexes. reproductive performance. and breeding status (see also chapter 7). Three survival analyses were performed (fig. 6.1 a): sexes combined (n= 213). males only (n= 91). and females only (n= 122). For combined sexes. the mean annual rate of local survival was ϕ= 0.85 (SE=+ 0.04; range: 0.40 to 0.98) over a 12-year period. Except for 1990. the first posthurricane year in which survival dropped precipitously for both sexes (see below). the average annual survival for the resultant 11-year period jumped to ϕ= 0.90 for the combined sexes. mainly owing to the high rate of survival in males. Even with the inclusion of 1990. almost 90 percent of all males survived to the next year (mean= 89 percent; SE=+ 0.05; range: 31 to 100 percent). In contrast. however. on average only 82 percent of all females survived to the following year (SE=+ 0.04; range: 40 to 98 percent). The mean annual survival rate of males was significantly higher (MW RS: T= 110; P= 0.02) than that of females because breeding females suffer higher annual mortality. mostly owing to owl predation by the Puerto Rican screech-owl (Megascops nudipes) and dipteran ectoparasitism involving philornid botflies (see Arendt 2000.

In many tropical regions seed dispersal by animals is the predominant form of dissemination of propagules and has the potential to facilitate recolonization of native vegetation on degraded sites. The site traits relevant for attracting seed dispersers include the availability of perches. the structural complexity of the vegetation and the presence of food resources. especially fruit. as an attractant. Tree plantations with these traits will be particularly attractive to animal seed dispersers and. therefore. will have higher rates of seed rain than plantations lacking these traits. The efficacy of animal seed dispersal to restoration sites can be limited by the degree of isolation from a seed source. absence of animal seed dispersers in the region and by large seed size.

1186962,Age-specific foraging proficiency in birds,1991,Joseph M Wunderle,8,Current ornithology,,273-324,,The fact that most birds exhibit high mortality during the juvenile period (Lack. 1954) suggests that this is a critical time in their life history. Much juvenile mortality may be attributed to a lack of proficiency in some aspects of behavior. For instance. juveniles must acquire skills in predator avoidance. foraging. and social interaction. particularly with competitors (Brown. 1975; Galef. 1976; Slater. 1983). Further-more. they must learn to efficiently allocate time and energy to these activities so as to balance conflicting demands in reducing their vul-nerability to both predation and starvation (Weathers and Sullivan. 1989). Thus the rate at which these behaviors develop is critical to the survival of juveniles and has implications for a variety of avian life history traits. particularly the extent of parental care (Ashmole and Tovar. 1968) and delayed maturation (Lack. 1968).

Although the impact of fire in the Amazon forest has been discussed in past decades (Uhl and Kauffman 1990; Nepstad et al. 1999; Cochrane 2003). the spike in fire activity during August 2019 was unprecedented and the fires’ impact on biodiversity has yet to be addressed. Fire activity is strongly correlated to selective logging and deforestation caused by the expansion of the agricultural frontier (Andrade 2019; Escobar 2019). However. as compared to fires in previous years. recent fire events were not attributable to deforestation alone. given that fires occurred within protected areas (Barlow et al. 2020).The Brazilian Amazon is a highly diverse area. harboring an extraordinary number of plants and other organisms. Of the Amazon’s 126 plant species that are currently threatened with extinction. the IUCN has recognized 54 as Vulnerable. 55 as Endangered. and 17 as Critically Endangered (Martinelli and Moraes 2013; MMA 2014). Moreover. more than half of these species are endemic to the region (Martinelli and Moraes 2013; MMA 2014). The Brazilian Amazon comprises a mosaic of private lands and 145 national protected areas (MMA 2000); however. the conservation of flora by this system of protected areas is not always guaranteed. Although habitat loss (eg deforestation due to agriculture. logging. and mining) was suggested as the main threat to plants at risk of extinction in Brazilian Amazon (Martinelli and Moraes 2013). these endangered species are now imperiled by increased fire activity.

Biodiversidade do médio Madeira: Bases científicas para propostas de conservação,2007,Mario Cohn-Haft and Catherine L Bechtoldt and Morton Arboretum and Marcela Torres and Alexandre M Fernandes,,,,,,A bacia do rio Madeira tem um apelo especial na ornitologia. O próprio rio Madeira há tempos é conhecido como um dos principais divisores de avifauna na Amazônia (Haffer 1974. 1978). Apesar disso. houve pouquíssimas análises de sua avifauna desde o trabalho clássico de Hellmayr (1910). As vastas extensões de matas de terra firme a cada lado do rio se configuram entre os lugares menos estudados na região amazônica (Oren & Albuquerque 1991). Além disso. mesmo sendo o maior dos afluentes de água barrenta do sistema Solimões-Amazonas. suas várzeas também são quase totalmente inexploradas cientificamente. Mais curioso ainda. o padrão típico de distribuição de aves amazônicas. baseado em áreas de endemismo delimitadas pelos grandes rios (Haffer 1978; Cracraft 1985). parece ser mais complexo na região do interflúvio Madeira-Tapajós. Ao contrário da situação comum em outros interflúvios. várias espécies ocupam somente partes pequenas deste interflúvio. às vezes havendo substituição por espécies próximas dentro dele (Willis 1968. 1969; Haffer 1997).

It is the goal of this review to present and discuss the results obtained concerning the sign and magnitude of the volume changes accompanying the unfolding of proteins. The vast majority of cases point to a significant decrease in volume upon unfolding.

Unfolding by pressure implies that the molar volume of the unfolded state of a protein is smaller than that of the folded state. This decrease in volume has been proposed to arise from differences between the density of bulk water and water associated with the protein. from pressure-dependent changes in the structure of bulk water. from the loss of internal cavities in the folded states of proteins. or from some combination of these three factors. Here. using 10 cavity-containing variants of staphylococcal nuclease. we demonstrate that pressure unfolds proteins primarily as a result of cavities that are present in the folded state and absent in the unfolded one.

This constitutive repression is crucial in metazoan reproduction. development and homeostasis. However. its specific molecular determinants had remained obscure. Using structural. biochemical and cell-based assays. we show that the basal repressive activity of RAR is conferred by an extended β-strand that forms an antiparallel β-sheet with specific corepressor residues.

The sum of the individual contributions differs 1.0 kcal mol-1 from the binding energy of the wild-type protein. This difference corresponds to the contribution from the deformability of the DNA. known as “indirect readout.” Thus. we can dissect the energetic contribution to DNA binding into 90% direct and 10% indirect readout components.

Unfolding by pressure implies that the molar volume of the unfolded state of a protein is smaller than that of the folded state.

Oxidation increased with increasing pH. as shown by the reduced amount of ferricyanide necessary for the oxidation of hemoglobin. This behavior was the opposite of that of vertebrate hemoglobins. The potential of half oxidation (E1 / 2) changed from − 65.3 to + 146.8 mV when the pH increased from 4.50 to 8.75. The functional properties indicated a reduction in the log P50 from 1.28 to 0.28 in this pH range.

Pressure-induced dissociation of viral particles involves a reduction in the Gibbs free energy of dissociation and a negative change in volume. In this work. we investigated the combined effect of high pressure and temperature on the dissociation of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). We assumed the presence of two states of TMV with different tendencies to dissociate. Thus one form presents a low tendency (L) and the other a high tendency (H) to dissociate.

Treatment of the disease is challenging because there are over 180 heritable mutations of SOD1 and virtually no well-defined binding sites addressable by traditional ligand identification strategies. These mutations ultimately cause the protein to adopt toxic conformations that aggregate and damage cellular functions within the central nervous system.

Charge regulation is likely to be impacted mainly by local sequence contexts of ionizable residues. This can lead to context-dependent pK a values for ionizable residues that engender cryptic order-to-disorder or disorder-to-order transitions that cannot be modeled using simulations based on fixed charges or anticipated using sequence-based disorder predictors. To remedy this. we introduced the q-canonical sampling method for simulations of the linkage between charge regulation and conformational equilibria for IDPs with multiple ionizable residues.

1187270,Uncovering Differences in Hydration Free Energies for Model Compound Mimics of Charged Sidechains of Amino Acids,2021,Martin J Fossat and Xiangze Zeng and Rohit V Pappu,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Free energies of hydration are fundamental quantities that are relevant for modeling and understanding sequence-specific conformational and phase equilibria of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Of particular importance are accurate values for the free energies of hydration of model compounds that mimic the charged sidechains of Arg. Lys. Asp. and Glu. Direct measurements of these quantities are challenging. and accordingly the values used to date rely on decompositions of measurements of whole salts. This has created considerable uncertainty regarding the desired quantities. Here. we adapt and deploy a Thermodynamic Cycle based Proton Dissociation in conjunction with published data from direct measurements along the relevant thermodynamic cycle to obtain new values for the free energies of hydration for model compounds that mimic the sidechains of Arg. Lys. Asp. and Glu. We obtain independent assessments for these inferred values using direct free energy calculations based on the polarizable AMOEBA forcefield and water model. The TCPD and AMOEBA derived values agree with one another. The new numbers suggest that Arg has the least favorable free energy of solvation. followed by Lys. On average. the sidechains of Asp and Glu have free energies of hydration that are ~1.8 times more favorable than Arg and ~1.5 times more favorable than Lys. Calculations used to extract the temperature dependence of free energies of hydration reveal positive heat capacities of hydration for Arg and Lys and negative heat capacities of hydration for Asp and Glu.

These polypeptides usually fold up into non-globular. elongated architectures that are stabilized by the interactions within each repeat and those between adjacent repeats. but that lack contacts between residues distant in sequence. The inherent symmetries both in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure are reflected in a folding landscape that may be analyzed as a quasi–one-dimensional problem. We present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons. whose collective ensemble are treated as spin variables. The overall folding properties of a complete “domain” (the stability and cooperativity of the repeating array) can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies there are simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy (ΔGwater) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value). which do not ordinarily apply for globular proteins.

The sum of the individual contributions differs 1.0 kcal mol-1 from the binding energy of the wild-type protein. This difference corresponds to the contribution from the deformability of the DNA. known as “indirect readout.” Thus. we can dissect the energetic contribution to DNA binding into 90% direct and 10% indirect readout components. The lack of high energy interactions indicates the absence of “hot spots.” such as those found in protein-protein interfaces.

Usually implicated in specific protein-protein interactions. these proteins are readily amenable for design. with promising biotechnological and biomedical applications.

Surprisingly. direct sequence readout establishes in the transition state and constitutes the bottleneck of complex formation. Although a few nonspecific ionic interactions are formed at this early stage. they mainly play a stabilizing role in the final consolidated complex. The interface is fairly plastic in the transition state. likely because of a high level of hydration. The overall picture of this two-state route largely agrees with a smooth energy landscape for binding that speeds up DNA recognition.

Apparently. the function of human FXN (hFXN) depends on the cooperative formation of crucial interactions between helix α1. helix α2. and the C-terminal region (CTR) of the protein. In this work we quantitatively explore these relationships using a purified recombinant fragment hFXN90–195. This variant shows the hydrodynamic behavior expected for a monomeric globular domain. Circular dichroism. fluorescence. and NMR spectroscopies show that hFXN90–195 presents native-like secondary and tertiary structure. However. chemical and temperature induced denaturation show that CTR truncation significantly destabilizes the overall hFXN fold. Accordingly. limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the native-state dynamics of hFXN90–195 and hFXN90–210 are indeed different. being the former form much more sensitive to the protease at specific sites. The overall folding dynamics of hFXN fold was further explored with structure-based protein folding simulations. These suggest that the native ensemble of hFXN can be decomposed in at least two substates. one with consolidation of the CTR and the other without consolidation of the CTR. Explicit-solvent all atom simulations identify some of the proteolytic target sites as flexible regions of the protein. We propose that the local unfolding of CTR may be a critical step for the global unfolding of hFXN. and that modulation of the CTR interactions may strongly affect hFXN physiological function.,True,p-4uBKIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,22,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045743,7024650821380556686,/scholar?cites=7024650821380556686,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045743,0,0,0

It results from dipole–dipole cross‐relaxation between nuclei. and its usefulness arises because the strength of a given NOE enhancement is approximately correlated with internuclear separation (actually r −6 where r is the internuclear distance).  However. this relationship is approximate as the NOE also depends on other factors. particularly molecular motions.  In small molecules in solution. the NOE is positive (i.e.. it causes affected resonances to increase in intensity) and is generally measured using one‐dimensional experiments.

Astringency arises from precipitation of polyphenol/peptide complexes. which is an important protective mechanism in animals that consume polyphenols. This paper presents biophysical studies of the interactions between chemically defined polyphenols and peptides. It is shown that intermolecular binding is dominated by stacking of polyphenolic rings onto planar hydrophobic surfaces and is strengthened by multiple cooperative binding of polyphenolic rings. Affinities weaken at higher temperatures and are unaffected by pH between pH 3.8 and 6.0. Measurements of self-diffusion rates for peptides with increasing concentrations of polyphenol demonstrate that peptides become increasingly coated with polyphenol.

The temperaturecoefficients can be rationalized by the assumption that heating causesincreases in thermal motion in the protein.

Some of these. such as tl noise. have been ascribed to random variations in temperature or pulse length and phase. while others. such as quadrature images. phantoms. and ghosts are related to missettings of pulse lengths or phase shifts. It has been pointed out that many of these latter artifacts can be removed or substantially reduced by the use of suitable phase cycling of pulses and receiver (I. 2). There is also a third class of artifacts. which is related to relaxation effects. Examples of this class are axial peaks. which arise from relaxation of magnetization during the pulse sequence. and which may be removed by a simple phase cycle consisting of inversion of the first pulse and the receiver (3).

This is thought to be caused by the interaction of polyphenols with basic salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs). It is widely assumed that the molecular origin of astringency is the precipitation of PRPs following polyphenol binding and the consequent change to the mucous layer in the mouth. Here. we use a variety of biophysical techniques on a simple model system. the binding of β-casein to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). We show that at low EGCG ratios. small soluble polydisperse particles are formed. which aggregate to form larger particles as EGCG is added. There is an initial compaction of the protein as it binds to the polyphenol. but the particle subsequently increases in size as EGCG is added because of the incorporation of EGCG and then to aggregation and precipitation.

EA1 and Sap. are components of the Bacillus anthracis surface layer (S‐layer). Their corresponding genes have been cloned. shown to be clustered on the chromosome and sequenced. EA1 and Sap each possess three ‘S‐layer homology’ motifs. Single and double disrupted mutants were constructed. EA1 and Sap were co‐localized at the cell surface of both the non‐capsulated and capsulated bacilli. When present. the capsule is exterior to. and completely covers. the S‐layer proteins. which form an array beneath it.

The factors that determine protein molar expansivities and the large differences in thermal expansivity for proteins of similar molar volume are not well understood. Model compound studies have suggested that a major contribution is made by differences in the molar volume of water molecules as they transfer from the protein surface to the bulk upon heating. The expansion of internal solvent-excluded voids upon heating is another possible contributing factor.

However. most small size proteins are poorly immunogenic. and adjuvants. whose mode of action remains to be fully clarified. are needed for increasing their immunogenicity. Here. we report the effects of short solubility controlling peptide tags (SCP-tags) on the immunogenicity of DENV3 envelope protein domain 3 (3ED3; 103 residues. 11.46 kDa) in ICR and Swiss albino model mice. The attachment of a 4-Ile SCP-tag (C4I-tag) increased the hydrodynamic radius of 3ED3 from 2.2±0.09 to 111±146 nm as assessed by Dynamic Light Scattering in PBS at 37°C. indicating that the C4I-tag oligomerized 3ED3. Immunization at 30µg/dose showed that the untagged 3ED3 was not or poorly immunogenic. whereas the C4I-tag increased its immunogenicity by up to 39 fold as assessed by IgG level using ELISA. Moreover. the increased antibody level was sustained for over six months after immunization and a high number of effector and central memory T-cells were generated. These observations provide direct and quantitative evidence for the hypothesis that subvisible aggregates with hydrodynamic radii of 100 nm can increase immunogenicity and that SCP-tag can establish a long-term. target-specific immune response in a way adequate for the development of a peptide/protein-based DENV vaccine.,True,dKS4v_gAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00333/full?report=reader,10707216250318372253,/scholar?cites=10707216250318372253,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00333/full?report=reader,0,0,0

Differential scanning calorimetry indicated a two-state thermal unfolding. typical of a native protein with densely packed interior. Surprisingly. increasing the number of alanines induced enthalpy stabilization. which was however over-compensated by entropy destabilization. X-ray crystallography indicated that the alanine substitutions caused the recruitment of novel water molecules facilitating the formation of protein–water hydrogen bonds and improving the hydration shells around the alanine’s methyl groups. both of which presumably contributed to enthalpy stabilization.

The stoichiometry and subnanomolar affinity of E7 indicated that it can bind RbAB as a monomer.

HPV 16 E7 forms spherical oligomers that display chaperone activity in thermal denaturation and chemical refolding assays of two model polypeptide substrates. citrate synthase and luciferase. and it does so at substoichiometric concentrations. We show that the E7 chaperone can stably bind model polypeptides and hold them in a state with significant tertiary structure. but does not bind the fully native proteins. The E7 oligomers bind native in vitro translated pRb without the requirement of it being unfolded. since the N-terminal domain of E7 containing the LXCXE binding motif is exposed.

The intrinsically disordered (E7N) and globular (E7C) domains of E7 show similar degrees of conservation and co-evolution. We found that E7N can be described in terms of conserved and coevolving linear motifs separated by variable linkers. while sequence evolution of E7C is compatible with the known homodimeric structure yet suggests other activities for the domain. Within E7N. inter-residue relationships such as residue co-evolution and restricted intermotif distances map functional coupling and co-occurrence of linear motifs that evolve in a coordinate manner. Within E7C. additional cysteine residues proximal to the zinc-binding site may allow redox regulation of E7 function. Moreover. we describe a conserved binding site for disordered domains on the surface of E7C and suggest a putative target linear motif. Both homodimerization and peptide binding activities of E7C are also present in the distantly related host PHD domains. showing that these two proteins share not only structural homology but also functional similarities. and strengthening the view that they evolved from a common ancestor.

Host linear motifs and pathogen mimics differ in sequence. leading to thermodynamic and structural differences in the resulting protein–protein interactions. Moreover. the functional output of a mimic depends on the motif and domain repertoire of the pathogen protein. Regulatory evolution mediated by linear motifs can be understood by measuring evolutionary rates. quantifying positive and negative selection and performing phylogenetic reconstructions of linear motif natural history.

We have chosen the papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein as a model system for the evolution of functional linear motifs.

In order to gain insight into its structure-function relationships. we carried out a comprehensive analysis of structural propensities within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain from the human papillomavirus type-16 E7 oncoprotein (E7N). Two E7N segments located within the conserved CR1 and CR2 regions present transient α-helix structure. The helix in the CR1 region spans residues L8 to L13 and overlaps with the E2F mimic linear motif. The second helix. located within the highly acidic CR2 region. presents a pH-dependent structural transition. At neutral pH the helix spans residues P17 to N29. which include the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor LxCxE binding motif (residues 21–29). while the acidic CKII-PEST region spanning residues E33 to I38 populates polyproline type II (PII) structure. At pH 5.0. the CR2 helix propagates up to residue I38 at the expense of loss of PII due to charge neutralization of acidic residues. Using truncated forms of HPV-16 E7. we confirmed that pH-induced changes in α-helix content are governed by the intrinsically disordered E7N domain. Interestingly. while at both pH the region encompassing the LxCxE motif adopts α-helical structure. the isolated 21–29 fragment including this stretch is unable to populate an α-helix even at high TFE concentrations. Thus. the E7N domain can populate dynamic but discrete structural ensembles by sampling α-helix-coil-PII-ß-sheet structures.

RNA. polysaccharides or proteins. Processive enzymes can make multiple rounds of modification without releasing the substrate/partner. making their operation extremely effective and economical. The molecular mechanism of processivity is rather well understood in cases when the enzyme structurally confines the substrate. such as the DNA replication factor PCNA. and also when ATP energy is used to confine the succession of molecular events. such as with mechanochemical motors. Processivity may also result from the kinetic bias of binding imposed by spatial confinement of two binding elements connected by an intrinsically disordered (ID) linker.(2) Method: By statistical physical modeling. we show that this arrangement results in processive systems. in which the linker ensures an optimized effective concentration around novel binding site (s). favoring rebinding over full release of the polymeric partner.(3) Results: By analyzing 12 such proteins. such as cellulase. and RNAse-H. we illustrate that in these proteins linker length and flexibility. and the kinetic parameters of binding elements. are fine-tuned for optimizing processivity. We also report a conservation of structural disorder. special amino acid composition of linkers. and the correlation of their length with step size.(4) Conclusion: These observations suggest a unique type of entropic chain function of ID proteins. that may impart functional advantages on diverse enzymes in a variety of biological contexts.

Replication and transcription of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) relies on a RNA polymerase complex with a phosphoprotein cofactor P as the structural scaffold. which consists of a four-helix bundle tetramerization domain flanked by two domains predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Because intrinsic disorder cannot be reduced to a defined atomic structure. we tackled the experimental dissection of the disorder–order transitions of P by a domain fragmentation approach. P remains as a tetramer above 70 °C but shows a pronounced reversible secondary structure transition between 10 and 60 °C. While the N-terminal module behaves as a random coil-like IDP in a manner independent of tetramerization. the isolated C-terminal module displays a cooperative and …,True,eRWZ1JcAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,7,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01332,688525256263427073,/scholar?cites=688525256263427073,,,0,0,0

Binding of trimeric HIV-1 BaL Env to either soluble CD4 or 17b alone. is sufficient to trigger formation of the open quaternary conformation of Env. In contrast.

Denmark© Department of Lake and Estuarine Ecology,"This protocol handbook has been prepared in order to standardise sampling. analysis and calculations within the project ""Nitrogen Cycling in Estuaries"" (NICE). The protocol handbook is based on a workshop held from 30 September to 9 October. 1996 at the Aarhus University. Marine Biology Field Station in Rønbjerg. Denmark. The project aimed at investigating benthic nitrogen cycling in shallow coastal European waters with special emphasis on nitrogen removal via denitrification. In order to elucidate the regulating mechanisms for denitrification on a European scale a number of other variables and processes were also measured. Two of the major variables on a European scale affecting nitrogen cycling were expected to be tidal amplitude and climate and sites were selected to represent these differences. The sediments of shallow waters are very often inhabited by benthic primary producers and previous studies indicated that they have the capacity to control the sediment nitrogen cycling. One of the major aims of the project was therefore to investigate the role of benthic primary producers on the sediment nitrogen cycle. The benthic primary producers were divided into three functional groups: the benthic microalgae. the floating macroalgae and the rooted macrophytes. The experimental procedures needed to measure nitrogen cycling and associated variables in these three groups of primary producers are very different. Therefore there is a chapter for each of the groups detailing the experimental procedures. The chemical analysis and calculations are the same for all the groups and they are dealt with in the next chapters.",True,MLg0Y-oAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,144,https://iris.unife.it/handle/11392/1732321,833436115576304738,/scholar?cites=833436115576304738,,,0,0,0

These major gaps in using ocean color to estimate phytoplankton community structure were identified as: a) the mismatch between satellite. in situ and model data on phytoplankton composition. b) the lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates provided with satellite data. c) the spectral limitation of current sensors to enable the full exploitation of backscattered sunlight. and d) the very limited applicability of satellite algorithms determining phytoplankton composition for regional. especially coastal or inland. waters.

The activities have included detailed prelaunch sensor calibration and characterization experiments. in situ measurement protocol definition and development. calibration round-robins. advanced instrument technology development. and advanced atmospheric correction algorithm development.

Our results clearly showed that H. germanica was capable of using its kleptoplasts for more than 1 week while A. tepida showed very limited kleptoplastic ability with maximum photosystem II quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm  =  0.4). much lower than H. germanica and decreasing to zero in only 1 day. Only H. germanica showed net oxygen production with a compensation point at 24 µmol photon m−2 s−1 and a production up to 1000 pmol O2 cell−1 day−1 at 300 µmol photon m−2 s−1. Haynesina germanica Fv/Fm slowly decreased from 0.65 to 0.55 in 7 days when kept in darkness; however. it quickly decreased to 0.2 under high light. Kleptoplast functional time was thus estimated between 11 and 21 days in darkness and between 7 and 8 days at high light.

Goddard Space Flight Center,"O ne of the primary objectives of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project. as stated in Volume 1 of the prelaunch Sea WiFS Technical Report Series (Hooker et al. 1992) is to"" achieve radiometric accuracy of 5% absolute and 1% relative. water-leaving radiances to within 5% absolute. and chlorophyll a concentration to within 35% over the range of 0.05-50.0 mg m-3.” Much of the SeaWiFS Project's efforts have been devoted to meeting the rather stringent radiometric accuracy goals. The activities have included detailed prelaunch sensor calibration and characterization experiments. in situ measurement protocol definition and development. calibration round-robins. advanced instrument technology development. and advanced atmospheric correction algorithm development. The radiometric goals. rather than the chlorophyll a concentration objective. were set as the highest priority because these are challenging requirements and the ocean bio-optics community had never demonstrated an ability to make measurements at this level of accuracy. In addition. accurate in situ radiometry is required for the chlorophyll a algorithm.More recently. the Sea WiFS Project has turned its attention to the uncertainties in the pigment measurements used for algorithm development and postlaunch validation because steady progress has been made in the radiometry arena and it has become clear that the pigment analyses are subject to more uncertainty than originally thought.

However. direct analyses of photosystem II (PSII) D1 protein (the main target of photoinhibition) in diatoms are scarce. In this study. the response of the diatom model species Phaeodactylum tricornutum to short-term exposure to high light was examined and the levels of D1 protein determined immunochemically. Low light (LL) acclimated cells (40 µmol photons m−2 s−1) subjected to high light (HL. 1.250 µmol photons m−2 s−1) showed rapid induction of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and ca. 20-fold increase in diatoxanthin (DT) concentration. This resulted from the conversion of diadinoxanthin (DD) to DT through the activation of the DD-cycle. D1 protein levels under LL decreased about 30% after 1 h of the addition of lincomycin (LINC). a chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor. showing significant D1 degradation and repair under low irradiance. Exposure to HL lead to a 3.2-fold increase in D1 degradation rate. whereas average D1 repair rate was 1.3-x higher under HL than LL. leading to decreased levels of D1 protein under HL. There were significant effects of both HL and LINC on P. tricornutum maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm). showing a reduction of active PSII reaction centres. Partial recovery of Fv/Fm in the dark demonstrates the photosynthetic resilience of this diatom to changes in the light regime.

In this study. the extraction efficiencies of major pig-ments from a benthic microalgae community of an intertidal sediment by acetone and methanol are compared. The inﬂuence of extraction time and the use of sonication on pigment recovery is also examined. Extraction with acetone underestimated chloro—phyll—Cg and pheophorbide—a. while methanol extraction underestimated pheophythins—a and B-carotene. In methanol. long extraction times (6—24 h) generally yielded lower pigment concentrations. possibly due to isomerization andlor pigment degradation. Acetone is a better option if long extraction times are used. For extraction times of 15 min. higher pigment concentrations were usually found in sonicated extracts.

Although these coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities. little is known on the effects of climate change variables on the structure and productivity of MPB communities. In this study. the effects of elevated temperature and CO2 on intertidal MPB biomass. species composition and photosynthetic performance were studied using a flow-through experimental life support system. Elevated temperature had a detrimental effect on MPB biomass and photosynthetic performance under both control and elevated CO2. Furthermore. elevated temperature led to an increase of cyanobacteria and a change in the relative abundance of major benthic diatom species present in the MPB community. The most abundant motile epipelic species Navicula spartinetensis and Gyrosigma acuminatum were in part replaced by tychoplanktonic species (Minidiscus chilensis and Thalassiosira cf. pseudonana) and the motile epipelic Nitzschia cf. aequorea and N. cf. aurariae. Elevated CO2 had a beneficial effect on MPB biomass. but only at the lower temperature. It is possible that elevated CO2 alleviated local depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon resulting from high cell abundance at the sediment photic layer. No significant effect of elevated CO2 was detected on the relative abundance of major groups of microalgae and benthic diatom species.

There was no significant increase in phytoplankton chlorophyll a during the period of the study. The phytoplankton communities were dominated (> 10%) by diatoms and flagellates throughout the study. The average number of diatoms increased significantly from 301 cells· ml-1. prior to the release. to a maximum of 3 856 cells· ml-1 by the end of the first spring tidal cycle.

1187594,Response of micro-algae in the Kromme Estuary to managed freshwater inputs,2006,GC Snow and JB Adams,32,Water SA,1,71-80,,The Kromme is a permanently open estuary that receives little freshwater input because the capacity of the dams is equivalent to the mean annual runoff from the catchment. The estuary is marine dominated and phytoplankton chlorophyll a is low because of the low freshwater pulses that introduce nutrient-rich freshwater. Water released (2 x 106 m3) from the Mpofu Dam in 1998 produced little micro-algal response in the estuary. The study reported here addresses further runoff scenarios to see which might be beneficial in stimulating microalgal production. Recent surveys together with past research were used to describe the present state and reference condition of the estuary. Average intertidal chlorophyll a was 12.9±2.5 μg· g-1 of sediment and 4.9±0.4 μg· g-1 of sediment during November 2003 and July 2004. These concentrations are relatively low but comparable to those found in intertidal sediments in other South African estuaries and might indicate that intertidal microalgal biomass is not severely limited by low freshwater inputs. Average water column chlorophyll a concentrations have ranged from 0.6±0.1 to 5.6±0.3 μg· ℓ-1. Present state conditions can thus be described as those where water column chlorophyll a seldom exceeds 5 μg· ℓ-1 and small flagellates (3.5 μm x 2.8 μm) dominate the phytoplankton.

This process sets the Management Class (describing the degree of use and desired condition of a water resource). the freshwater quality and quantity allocation (the “Reserve”) and the Resource Quality Objectives for all water resources. A major challenge in this process is the EcoClassification of South Africa’s diverse range of estuaries. Currently. such information is available for only 15% of the country’s estuaries collected over a period of more than ten years as part of Ecological Water Requirement (EWR) studies. In the short-term. therefore. it is unrealistic to rely on the rollout of EWR studies to inform strategic water resource planning processes. Historical practices of using desktop river methods to determining estuary water requirements led to gross underestimations of flows. For example. unlike rivers. estuaries need significantly higher base flows and major flood events to maintain connectivity with the sea and to reset on-going marine sedimentation processes. Therefore. unless innovative methods are developed to realistically reflect the water requirements of estuaries in strategic water resource planning the biodiversity. an array of services provided by these ecosystems may be severely compromised.In the light of the above. the aim of this project was to develop a desktop method for the Provisional EcoClassification (the term used for the Ecological classification process under the NWA) for estuaries that provided for a comparative. regional scale assessment …,True,lsvwDEAAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,14,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gavin_Snow2/publication/312044930_DESKTOP_PROVISIONAL_ECOCLASSIFICATION_OF_THE_TEMPERATE_ESTUARIES_OF_SOUTH_AFRICA/links/586cbb1f08aebf17d3a5c271/DESKTOP-PROVISIONAL-ECOCLASSIFICATION-OF-THE-TEMPERATE-ESTUARIES-OF-SOUTH-AFRICA.pdf,18288681197226599154,/scholar?cites=18288681197226599154,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gavin_Snow2/publication/312044930_DESKTOP_PROVISIONAL_ECOCLASSIFICATION_OF_THE_TEMPERATE_ESTUARIES_OF_SOUTH_AFRICA/links/586cbb1f08aebf17d3a5c271/DESKTOP-PROVISIONAL-ECOCLASSIFICATION-OF-THE-TEMPERATE-ESTUARIES-OF-SOUTH-AFRICA.pdf,0,0,0
1187599,Contributions to the use of microalgae in estuarine freshwater reserve determinations,2007,Gavin Charles Snow,,,,,,There are five main types of estuarine systems in southern Africa: Permanently open. temporarily open/closed (TOCE). river mouths. estuarine lakes and estuarine bays. Permanently open estuaries. the focus of this study. generally have a steady discharge of riverwater maintaining a longitudinal salinity gradient between the head and mouth of the estuary (Whitfield 1992). Rivers that meander to the sea form vast intertidal flats with soft or semi-soft sandy or muddy substrates. These intertidal flats are ideal shallow water habitats. which become colonised by a wide variety of fauna and flora. Sediments accumulate and the rich nutrient influx and shallow warm waters results in a highly productive ecosystem (Lubke & de Moor 1998). Many South African estuaries such as the Gamtoos Estuary (Snow 2000a) have channellike morphologies. As a result. the intertidal zones are steep and narrow restricting the overall area available for benthic microalgal production and the transfer of autochthonous energy to higher trophic levels.The process of flocculation is important as this leads to the sedimentation of organic matter. fine sediment. microalgal cells and nutrients. The process provides an allochthonous supply of energy for resident micro-and macrobenthic fauna and has been the focus of a number of recent studies; van der Lee (2000). Winterwerp (2002). Jiang et al.(2004). Garcia (2005) and Manning et al.(2006).

1187600,Deterioration in the water quality of an urbanised estuary with recommendations for improvement,2019,JB Adams and L Pretorius and GC Snow,45,Water SA,1,86-96,Water Research Commission (WRC),Water quality characteristics of the heavily urbanised and industrialised Swartkops River and Estuary in the Eastern Cape have been the focus of several studies since the 1970s. Overloaded and poorly maintained wastewater treatment works (WWTWs). polluted stormwater runoff and solid waste have all contributed to the deterioration in the water quality of the river and estuary. The objective of this study was to determine the current water quality status of the Swartkops Estuary. by investigating spatial and temporal variability in physico-chemical parameters and phytoplankton biomass and where possible relate this to historical water quality data. The present study found evidence suggesting that water is not flushed as efficiently from the upper reaches of the estuary as was previously recorded. Reduced vertical mixing results in strong stratification and persistent eutrophic conditions with phytoplankton blooms (> 20 μg chl a· L− 1). extending from the middle reaches to the tidal head of the estuary. The Motherwell Canal was and still is a major source of nitrogen (particularly ammonium) to the estuary. but the Swartkops River is the primary source of phosphorus with excessive inputs from the cumulative effect of three WWTWs upstream. An analysis of historical water quality data in the Swartkops Estuary (1995 to 2013) shows that all recorded dissolved inorganic phosphorus measurements were classified as hypertrophic (> 0.1 mg P· L− 1). whereas 41% of dissolved inorganic nitrogen measurements were either mesotrophic or eutrophic.

This adaptation to seasonal fluctuations in hydrology may contribute to its invasive potential in natural and man-made water bodies. where stranded plants can take root.

This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa. isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France). to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested.

Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than that of airborne instrument spatial resolution. leading to a “mixed pixel” problem. Moreover. some microphytobenthic species form. at low tide. a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures.

Our aim was to show that nickel and vanadium concentrations in marine organisms could be used as tracers of their exposure to oil deposits along the coast. Two biomarkers were determined. condition index (CI) and metallothionein levels. Samples were collected monthly from January to May 2000 from five sites along the coast of Vendée and Loire Atlantique: (1) Lérat. (2) La Govelle. (3) Saint Gildas. (4) La Bernerie and (5) La Fosse. Among benthic invertebrates. mussels Mytilus edulis (filter-feeders). periwinkles Littorina littorea (grazing-feeders) and dogwhelks Nucella lapillus (carnivora. bivalve predators) were selected.

Owing to tidal cycles. intertidal MPB diatoms are subjected to environmental conditions far more variable than the ones experienced by pelagic diatoms (e.g. light. temperature. salinity. desiccation and nutrient availability). Nevertheless. benthic diatoms evolved adaptation mechanisms to these harsh conditions. including the capacity to move within steep physical and chemical gradients. allowing them to perform photosynthesis efficiently.

Increases in irradiance were followed by decreases in α and increases in ETRm. resulting in significant correlations between the light-saturation parameter Ek and E.

These ‘stolen’ chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) can survive in the absence of the plant cell and continue to photosynthesize. in some cases for as long as one year. Within the Metazoa. this phenomenon (kleptoplasty) seems to have only evolved among sacoglossan sea slugs. Known for over a century. the mechanisms of interaction between the foreign organelle and its host animal cell are just now starting to be unravelled. In the study of sacoglossan sea slugs as photosynthetic systems. it is important to understand their relationship with light.

In this study the effects on coral assemblage structure and tissue mortality in native competitors by alien coral were investigated. We compared native coral cover in zones with and without T. tagusensis and evaluated the mortality of native coral species in natural encounters with T. tagusensis. Additionally. we evaluated the effects of contact with this invader on two native corals. Siderastrea stellata and Montastraea cavernosa. using a manipulative experiment. Multivariate analyses detected significant differences between coral assemblages in invaded and non-invaded zones.

It represents a biologically unique condition for chloroplast and photosynthesis functioning. occurring in different phylogenetic lineages. namely dinoflagellates. ciliates. foraminiferans and. most interestingly. a single taxon of metazoans. the sacoglossan sea slugs. In the case of sea slugs. chloroplasts from macroalgae are often maintained as intracellular organelles in cells of these marine gastropods. structurally intact and photosynthetically competent for extended periods of time.

Although these coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities. little is known on the effects of climate change variables on the structure and productivity of MPB communities. In this study. the effects of elevated temperature and CO2 on intertidal MPB biomass. species composition and photosynthetic performance were studied using a flow-through experimental life support system. Elevated temperature had a detrimental effect on MPB biomass and photosynthetic performance under both control and elevated CO2. Furthermore. elevated temperature led to an increase of cyanobacteria and a change in the relative abundance of major benthic diatom species present in the MPB community. The most abundant motile epipelic species Navicula spartinetensis and Gyrosigma acuminatum were in part replaced by tychoplanktonic species (Minidiscus chilensis and Thalassiosira cf. pseudonana) and the motile epipelic Nitzschia cf. aequorea and N. cf. aurariae. Elevated CO2 had a beneficial effect on MPB biomass. but only at the lower temperature. It is possible that elevated CO2 alleviated local depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon resulting from high cell abundance at the sediment photic layer. No significant effect of elevated CO2 was detected on the relative abundance of major groups of microalgae and benthic diatom species.

The MPB biomass in the photic zone (0–0.5 mm) of the sediment exposed to low irradiance (150 μmol photons m–2 s–1) showed a >2-fold increase during the first hours of the emersion period. reaching >0.2 mg Chl a cm-3. Concentrations of Chl a started to decrease half-way through the emersion period. almost 2 h before tidal inundation. Similarly. O2 concentrations and volumetric gross photosynthesis in the photic zone increased during the first half of the emersion period and then decreased towards the timing of incoming tide/darkness. The results suggest that intertidal MPB community-level photosynthesis is mainly controlled by changes in the productive biomass of the photic zone determined by cell migration. A diel pattern in the photosynthesis vs. irradiance parameters α (photosynthetic efficiency at limiting irradiance) and ETRmax (photosynthetic capacity at saturating irradiance) was also observed. suggesting photoacclimation of MPB photosynthesis. Under high light exposure (2000 μmol photons m–2 s–1). lower α. ETRmax and sediment O2 concentrations were observed when cell migration was inhibited with the diatom motility inhibitor latrunculin A (Lat A). showing that migration is also used by MPB to maximize photosynthesis by reducing exposure to potentially photoinhibitory light levels.

Whether light interaction with the nano‐structure of the frustule also affects diatom photosynthesis has remained unclear due to lack of information on frustule optical properties under more natural conditions. Here we demonstrate that the optical properties of the frustule valves in water affect light harvesting and photosynthesis in live cells of centric diatoms (Coscinodiscus granii). Microscale cellular mapping of photosynthesis around localized spot illumination demonstrated optical coupling of chloroplasts to the valve wall.

This is partially explained by their capacity to exploit environments with variable light conditions. but there is limited knowledge on how diatoms cope with changes in the spectral composition and intensity of light. In this study. the influence of light quality and high irradiance on photosynthesis in the centric diatom Coscinodiscus granii was investigated with microscopic imaging and variable chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. Determination of the wavelength-dependent functional absorption cross-section of photosystem (PS) II revealed that absorption of blue light (BL) and red light (RL) was 2.3-fold and 0.8-fold that of white light (WL). respectively. Hence. BL was more efficiently converted into photo-chemical energy. Excessive energy from BL was dissipated via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms. while RL apparently induced only negligible NPQ even at high irradiance. A dose dependent increase of cells exhibiting an altered chloroplast distribution was observed after exposure to high levels of BL and WL. but not RL. However. no effective quantum yield of PSII was measured in the majority of cells with an altered chloroplast distribution. and positive Sytox green® death staining confirmed that most of these cells were dead. We conclude that although Coscinodiscus granii can sustain high irradiance it does not perform chloroplast high-light avoidance movements for photo-protection.,True,7XVqu_IAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2015.00115/full,15869331543070286237,/scholar?cites=15869331543070286237,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2015.00115/full,0,0,0

China Tidal estuaries are regarded as highly important ecosystems. mostly due to their high primary productivity and associated role as carbon sinks. In these ecosystems. primary productivity is mainly due to the photosynthetic carbon fixation by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. The productivity of the two communities has been mostly studied separately. and directly comparable estimates of their carbon fixation rates in the same estuary are relatively scarce. The present study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal variability of the productivity of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos in a tidal estuary. the Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). The productivity of the two communities was determined using a common methodological approach. based on measurements of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence. allowing the estimation of the annual ecosystemlevel budget for carbon fixation by the two groups. Productivity rates were determined based on synoptic in situ measurements of absolute rates of electron transport rate of photosystem II. using Pulse Amplitude Modulation fluorometry.

The period is shown to be similar within individuals of a long-term cultivated inbred line and between 4 different C. granii cell culture strains. In contrast. the pore diameter had negligible effects upon the photonic properties. We hence propose that critical parameters defining the photonic response of the girdle are highly preserved.

Oxygen combines with N2 within the mass spectrometer ion source forming NO+ which reduces the N2 concentration.

The eastern South Pacific contains an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) characterized by an anoxic. nitrate‐ and nitrite‐rich layer of ∼ 200‐m thickness below 30–90 m of oxic water. Anammox and denitrification were almost exclusively recorded when the in situ O2 concentration was below detection. indicating that the induction of these processes is highly oxygen sensitive. Anammox was detected in 70% of the samples from anoxic depths. Denitrification was detected in fewer samples. but maximum rates were an order of magnitude higher than those of anammox.

The high-Arctic fjord Young Sound in Northeast Greenland was chosen as study site. The fjord was covered by sea ice for approximately 10 mo during 1996. Despite highly fluctuating seasonal air temperatures. the bottom water temperature remained almost constant at-1.2 to-1.8 C throughout the year. When sea ice broke in mid-July. benthic mineralization was immediately stimulated by a significant peak in sedimentation of organic material. Due to rapid mineralization of the easily degradable fraction of the settling organic material. respiration rates returned to their basic lower level within 1 mo and remained low for the rest of the season. Benthic mineralization rates in the Young Sound sediment are comparable with rates from much warmer locations. suggesting that benthic mineralization in this high-Arctic …,True,c2e3NiAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,202,https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v175/p261-276/,8046414155039743683,/scholar?cites=8046414155039743683,,https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/175/m175p261.pdf,0,0,0

The protocol handbook is based on a workshop held from 30 September to 9 October. 1996 at the Aarhus University. Marine Biology Field Station in Rønbjerg. Denmark. The project aimed at investigating benthic nitrogen cycling in shallow coastal European waters with special emphasis on nitrogen removal via denitrification. In order to elucidate the regulating mechanisms for denitrification on a European scale a number of other variables and processes were also measured. Two of the major variables on a European scale affecting nitrogen cycling were expected to be tidal amplitude and climate and sites were selected to represent these differences. The sediments of shallow waters are very often inhabited by benthic primary producers and previous studies indicated that they have the capacity to control the sediment nitrogen cycling. One of the major aims of the project was therefore to investigate the role of benthic primary producers on the sediment nitrogen cycle. The benthic primary producers were divided into three functional groups: the benthic microalgae. the floating macroalgae and the rooted macrophytes. The experimental procedures needed to measure nitrogen cycling and associated variables in these three groups of primary producers are very different. Therefore there is a chapter for each of the groups detailing the experimental procedures. The chemical analysis and calculations are the same for all the groups and they are dealt with in the next chapters.",True,jZnLoYgAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,144,https://iris.unife.it/handle/11392/1732321,833436115576304738,/scholar?cites=833436115576304738,,,0,0,0

A series of filter NH3 load manipulations was performed. HNO2 was observed to constitute around half of the AOB oxidation products. and assumed the main inhibitor of AOB growth and substrate consumption. Under operating conditions with stable NH3 load. biomass increased until self-inhibition restricted further growth. Sudden load changes affected pH and the level of free HNO2. and caused an immediate (within few hours) change in substrate consumption rate.

It is possible to get biogas with very high methane content if the biogas reactors are supplied with exogenous hydrogen. and one of the technologies for supplying hydrogen is through gas permeable membranes. In this study the activity and stratification of hydrogen consumption above such a membrane was investigated by use of microsensors for hydrogen and pH. A hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community that was able to consume the hydrogen flux within 0.5 mm of the membrane with specific rates of up to 30 m3 H2 m-3 day-1 developed within 3 days in fresh manure and was already established at time zero when analyzing slurry from a biogas plant. The hydrogen consumption was dependent on a simultaneous carbon dioxide supply and was inhibited when carbon dioxide depletion elevated the pH to 9.2. The activity was only partially restored when the carbon dioxide supply was resumed. Bioreactors supplied with hydrogen gas should thus be carefully monitored and either have the hydrogen supply disrupted or be supplemented with carbon dioxide when the pH rises to values about 9.,True,jZnLoYgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,22,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01276/full,760494421213252490,/scholar?cites=760494421213252490,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.01276/full,0,0,0

Presence of anammox. the anaerobic oxidation of NH4+ to N2 with NO2− results in violation of central assumptions on which the IPT is built. It is shown that anammox activity causes overestimation of the N2 production calculated by the IPT. However. experiments with different additions of 15NO3− will reveal the problems posed by anammox. Two alternative calculation procedures are presented. which enable a more accurate quantification of anammox and denitrification activity in sediments where the processes coexist.

The protocol handbook is based on a workshop held from 30 September to 9 October. 1996 at the Aarhus University. Marine Biology Field Station in Rønbjerg. Denmark. The project aimed at investigating benthic nitrogen cycling in shallow coastal European waters with special emphasis on nitrogen removal via denitrification. In order to elucidate the regulating mechanisms for denitrification on a European scale a number of other variables and processes were also measured. Two of the major variables on a European scale affecting nitrogen cycling were expected to be tidal amplitude and climate and sites were selected to represent these differences. The sediments of shallow waters are very often inhabited by benthic primary producers and previous studies indicated that they have the capacity to control the sediment nitrogen cycling. One of the major aims of the project was therefore to investigate the role of benthic primary producers on the sediment nitrogen cycle. The benthic primary producers were divided into three functional groups: the benthic microalgae. the floating macroalgae and the rooted macrophytes. The experimental procedures needed to measure nitrogen cycling and associated variables in these three groups of primary producers are very different. Therefore there is a chapter for each of the groups detailing the experimental procedures. The chemical analysis and calculations are the same for all the groups and they are dealt with in the next chapters.",True,YU_GA70AAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC,144,https://iris.unife.it/handle/11392/1732321,833436115576304738,/scholar?cites=833436115576304738,,,0,0,0

Polish Academy of Sciences,There are no agricultural activities in Hungarian energy grass plantations (Elymus elongatus (Host) Runemark before harvesting in August. so the breeding success of the ground-nesting Common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus L.) and Common quail (Coturnix coturnix (L.)) is probably higher than in the neighbouring intensively managed grain fields. The dominant nest predators of these bird species (e.g. Red fox Vulpes vulpes L.) prey mostly on small mammals. thus the abundance of small mammals can influence the survival rates of ground-nesting birds. These assumptions were tested using artificial ground-nests and small mammal live traps in late May 2005. Of the nests. 25 were placed in the energy grass field which covered 60 ha and another 25 in the wheat field which area was 20 ha. Each of the nests contained one chicken egg. one quail egg and one plasticine dummy-egg. Real eggs were placed for the evaluation of nest predation rates and artificial plasticine eggs for predator identification from tooth and bill imprints. Following the placement of artificial nests. they were checked repeatedly between 16.00 and 18.00 every day.

April 2012/Available online: 31. May 2012/Printed: December 2012 Abstract. During 2009 and 2010 in the city of Pécs (Hungary) 59 active blackbird (Turdus merula) as well as 59 artificial nests were observed. Among the real nests 26 (44%) were successful. 14 (24%) were predated. and 19 (32%) were abandoned by the parent birds. Among the artificial nests 34 (57%) remained intact. but 25 (42%) were predated. Regarding the failure of real nests. if we consider both predation and abandonment during the incubation period. the daily survival rates of real nests (n= 59) DSR (0.952) were significantly lower than the DSR of artificial nests (0.977). If we consider only predation rates (n= 41). the daily survival rates of the two nest types did not differ significantly (real nests 0.976. artificial nest 0.978). Consequently. the daily survival rates of artificial bush nests used by us reflect precisely the predation pressure on real blackbird nests.,True,H_JfDPEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,21,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kornelia_Kurucz/publication/234169203_Survival_of_blackbird_Turdus_merula_clutches_in_an_urban_environment_Experiment_with_real_and_artificial_nests/links/09e4150fcf58a2f097000000.pdf,11672481082874738772,/scholar?cites=11672481082874738772,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kornelia_Kurucz/publication/234169203_Survival_of_blackbird_Turdus_merula_clutches_in_an_urban_environment_Experiment_with_real_and_artificial_nests/links/09e4150fcf58a2f097000000.pdf,0,0,0

The decreasing area of natural habitats. the forest clearances. and the growing urbanization jointly cause bats to move closer to human-inhabited territories. This phenomenon increases the number of direct contacts between bats and domestic animals as well as humans. and given that bats have been recognized as important reservoir hosts for many viruses that can cross species barriers (2). it raises serious veterinary and public health issues.

Two eggs were placed in each of the artificial nests. comprising. in an alternating sequence. quail+ quail. quail+ natural colour plasticine. and quail+ white lime coloured plasticine eggs. During one week 65.4% of the artificial nests were depredated. When the damage or disappearance of any of the eggs was considered as a predation event. the daily survival rates of nest containing only two quail eggs was higher than of nests with quail and natural plasticine eggs and significantly higher than of nests with quail and white coloured plasticine eggs. When considering predation to real eggs only. the results remained similar. however. the significant difference in survival rates of the two nest types with different plasticine eggs disappeared. Simultaneously with the nest predation experiments. 78 small mammal live traps were set up in the wheat field and operated for 7 nights. The capture success of traps baited with quail egg was 9.9%. with natural plasticine egg 15.4%. and with white coloured plasticine egg 23.1%. but only a marginal significant difference was found between daily survival rates of quail vs. white coloured plasticine eggs.

December 2014/Available online: 03. August 2015/Printed: December 2015 Abstract. Nest predation studies provide important information about breeding success and predators. but the frequent monitoring of nests can influence survival rate. and disturbance-sensitive species may then abandon their nests. Since artificial nests provide an alternative tool to investigate nest predation rates and to roughly identify predators. we studied the potential negative effects of nest monitoring using artificial ground and shrub nests applying a visit/non-visit procedure in May and June. The nest predation rate was independent of month or disturbance alone. but it did depend on their interaction and on the nest type. The predator assemblages of the two nest types were different: ground nests were discovered mainly by mammals. but shrub nests by birds. Disturbance influenced the predation rate inversely in the two months. and had contradicting effects on the nest survival of both ground and shrub nests in our study. which phenomena was highly weather dependent. If possible we should avoid daily visits to nests. because frequent disturbance might bias the result of nest predation studies either positively or negativelyand also threaten the breeding success of the real nests by affecting nest survival rates.,True,H_JfDPEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,https://biozoojournals.ro/nwjz/content/v11n2/nwjz_141605_Kurucz.pdf,7835374775658627765,/scholar?cites=7835374775658627765,,https://biozoojournals.ro/nwjz/content/v11n2/nwjz_141605_Kurucz.pdf,0,0,0

Given all of our technological expertise. why is there an emerging disease crisis. and why are we losing the battle to contain and diminish emerging diseases?Part of the reason is that the prevailing paradigm explaining the biology of pathogenhost associations (coevolution. evolutionary arms races) has assumed that pathogens must evolve new capacities-special mutations–in order to colonize new hosts and produce emergent disease (eg Parrish and Kawaoka. 2005). In this erroneous but broadly prevalent view. the evolution of new capacities creates new opportunities for pathogens. Further. given that mutations are both rare and undirected. the highly specialized nature of pathogenhost relationships should produce an evolutionary firewall limiting dissemination; by those definitions. emergences should be rare (for a historical review see Brooks et al.. 2019).

1187992,New paradigms for modelling species distributions?,2004,SP Rushton and Stephen James Ormerod and G Kerby,41,Journal of applied ecology,2,193-200,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,1. The management of both desirable and undesirable species requires an understanding of the factors determining their distribution. Quantitative distribution models offer simple methods for formulating the species–habitat link and the means not only for predicting where species should occur. but also for understanding the factors involved. Generalized linear modelling. in particular. links the incidence of species to habitat variables. and has increasingly formed the backbone of the modelling approaches used.

This top‐down concept has received much attention within conservation biology. but few studies have demonstrated the phenomenon. The concept has been criticized since alternative explanations involving bottom‐up impacts from bioclimatic effects on ecosystem productivity and from anthropogenic habitat change are rarely considered. We analyse the response of a mesopredator (the red fox) to declines in top predators (wolf and Eurasian lynx) and agricultural expansion over 90 years in Sweden. taking bioclimatic effects into account.

In addition. the role of the American mink (Mustela vision; Mustelidae) in determining the present distribution of water voles in the Thames region was investigated.

To examine these two factors. we explored 120 different model scenarios using three different distances to link …,True,2Kcd0zoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320701001793,7174964027333973702,/scholar?cites=7174964027333973702,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47775538/Conserving_red_squirrels_Sciurus_vulgar20160803-11906-1k7qm2k.pdf,0,0,0

These are: visual counts along line transects. the use of hair tubes. counts of dreys. cone line feeding transects in conifer forests and feeding signs on whole maize bait at feeding stations. 2. Drey counts and cone feeding transects cannot differentiate between red and grey squirrels and are not suitable for areas where both species may be present. Hair tubes require expertise and facilities to identify hairs to species. and the relationship between tube visits and animal density in different habitats is only known for red squirrels in Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis dominated plantations. Visual counts along line transects are the simplest method to do and require little equipment.

The control of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle in Britain and Ireland is hindered by persistent infection in wild badgers (Meles meles). Vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been shown to reduce the severity and progression of experimentally induced TB in captive badgers. Analysis of data from a four-year clinical field study. conducted at the social group level. suggested a similar. direct protective effect of BCG in a wild badger population. Here we present new evidence from the same study identifying both a direct beneficial effect of vaccination in individual badgers and an indirect protective effect in unvaccinated cubs. We show that intramuscular injection of BCG reduced by 76% (Odds ratio = 0.24. 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11–0.52) the risk of free-living vaccinated individuals testing positive to a diagnostic test combination to detect progressive infection. A more sensitive panel of tests for the detection of infection per se identified a reduction of 54% (Odds ratio = 0.46. 95% CI 0.26–0.88) in the risk of a positive result following vaccination. In addition. we show the risk of unvaccinated badger cubs. but not adults. testing positive to an even more sensitive panel of diagnostic tests decreased significantly as the proportion of vaccinated individuals in their social group increased (Odds ratio = 0.08. 95% CI 0.01–0.76; P = 0.03). When more than a third of their social group had been vaccinated. the risk to unvaccinated cubs was reduced by 79% (Odds ratio = 0.21. 95% CI 0.05–0.81; P = 0.02).,True,2Kcd0zoAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,73,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049833,13772156643950831419,/scholar?cites=13772156643950831419,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049833,0,0,0

This analysis revealed both global and local heterogeneity in the contact pattern between the infected premises in the first 3 weeks of the disease. In particular. the global heterogeneity contributed to the failure of the culling strategy imposed by the UK government. However. a more effective strategy targeting selective deletion of key premises in the network was not available once the epidemic had begun.

SQPV causes disease with high mortality in red squirrels but appears non-pathogenic in grey squirrels. Not all populations of introduced grey squirrels carry the virus. notably those in Scotland and Italy. and the rate of red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels is some twenty times faster in those areas where grey squirrels carry the virus.

Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations are subject to attempted control throughout much of their range due to their impacts on livestock and game. and disease transmission (e.g.. rabies); however. the efficacy of different methods in controlling fox populations is low. For mesomammal species. experimental approaches are often limited by issues of scale. We used an individual‐based. spatially explicit population model to investigate the efficacy of different culling practices in artificial landscapes.

SUI may lead to withdrawal from regular physical activities and hence impair women’s general health. 34 One of the problems with the assessment of incontinence is that outcome measures frequently used in primary research may not perfectly map on to outcomes of importance to women. For example. the commonly reported outcome measure in clinical trials is ‘cure’. which is the satisfactory resolution (or near resolution) of symptoms. Using this definition usually means the patient self-report of the absence of incontinence. However. the ideal measure of how women are after treatment should reflect the ability to lead a normal social life. which may be compatible with improvements in the level of continence.,True,hUIzv64AAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,238,http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/798,5308176009029196292,/scholar?cites=5308176009029196292,,http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2164/798/mon1440a.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Eligible participants from nine centers were randomized to ILM peeling or no peeling (1: 1 ratio) in addition to phacovitrectomy. including detachment and removal of the posterior hyaloid and gas tamponade. The primary outcome was distance visual acuity (VA) at 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes included hole closure. distance VA at other time points. near VA. contrast sensitivity. reading speed. reoperations. complications. resource use. and participant-reported health status. visual function. and costs.Results.: Of 141 participants randomized in nine centers. 127 (90%) completed the 6-month follow-up. Nonstatistically significant differences in distance visual acuity at 6 months were found between groups (mean difference. 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI].− 0.3 to 9.8; P= 0.063). There was a significantly higher rate of hole closure in the ILM-peel group (56 [84%] vs. 31 [48%]) at 1 month (odds ratio [OR]. 6.23; 95% CI. 2.64–14.73; P< 0.001) with fewer reoperations (8 [12%] vs. 31 [48%]) performed by 6 months (OR. 0.14; 95% CI. 0.05–0.34; P< 0.001).

Ltd.,Background and method: Foam sclerotherapy is a potential treatment for varicose veins. A systematic review was undertaken to assess its safety and efficacy. Results: Sixty‐nine studies were included. The median rates of serious adverse events. including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. were less than 1 per cent. The median rate of visual disturbance was 1·4 per cent. headache 4·2 per cent. thrombophlebitis 4·7 per cent. matting/skin staining/pigmentation 17·8 per cent and pain at the site of injection 25·6 per cent. The median rate of complete occlusion of treated veins was 87·0 per cent and for recurrence or development of new veins it was 8·1 per cent. Meta‐analysis for complete occlusion suggests that foam sclerotherapy is less effective than surgery (relative risk (RR) 0·86 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0·67 to 1·10)) but more effective than liquid sclerotherapy (RR 1·39 (95 per cent c.i. 0 …,True,w_zQzNIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,367,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jws/bjs/2007/00000094/00000008/art00003,4564955371840852757,/scholar?cites=4564955371840852757,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48624192/bjs.589120160906-5393-jkhvrv.pdf,0,0,0

There was no restriction on study designs.Results: 67 studies were included. For serious adverse events including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. the median event rates were less than 1%. Median rate for visual disturbance was 1.1%. Median rates for some other adverse events were more common. including headache (4.2%). thrombophlebitis (4.7%). matting/skin staining/pigmentation (17.8%) and pain at the site of injection (25.6%). The rates for complete occlusion of treated veins ranged from 60.0 to 98.2%. The rates of recurrence or development of new veins ranged from 10.1 to 51.2%. Compared with surgery. FS associated with higher risk of skin pigmentation (RR 1.41. 95% CI 1.07 to 1.85). The rate of complete occlusion was similar.

During infection interaction with the immune system occurs in three main phases. First is invasion via the gastrointestinal tract. Infection with S. Pullorum or S. Gallinarum does not cause substantial inflammation. unlike S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis. Through in vitro models it was found that S. Gallinarum does not induce expression of CXC chemokines or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β or IL-6. whilst in an in vivo model S. Pullorum infection leads to down-regulation of CXCLi1 and CXCLi2 in the ileum. The absence of flagella in S. Gallinarum and S.

1188107,Avian cytokines in health and disease,2003,Paul Wigley and P Kaiser,5,Brazilian Journal of Poultry Science,1,1-14,Fundação APINCO de Ciência e Tecnologia Avícolas,Cytokines are proteins secreted by cells that play an important role in the activation and regulation of other cells and tissues during inflammation and immune responses. Although well described in several mammalian species. the role of cytokines and other related proteins is poorly understood in avian species. Recent advances in avian genetics and immunology have begun to allow the exploration of cytokines in health and disease. Cytokines may be classified in a number of ways. but may be conveniently arranged into four broad groups on the basis of their function. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta play a role in mediating inflammation during disease or injury. Th1 cytokines. including interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma. are involved in the induction of cell-mediated immunity. whereas Th2 cytokines such as interleukin-4 are involved in the induction of humoral immunity. The final group Th3 or Tr cytokines play a role in regulation of immunity. The role of various cytokines in infectious and non-infectious diseases of chickens and turkeys is now being investigated. Although there are only a few reliable ELISAs or bioassays developed for avian cytokines. the use of molecular techniques. and in particular quantitative RT-PCR (Taqman) has allowed investigation of cytokine responses in a number of diseases including salmonellosis. coccidiosis and autoimmune thyroiditis.

No animal reservoir has been identified. and it has been suggested that ST313 is adapted to humans and transmission may occur via person-to-person spread. Here. we show that ST313 cause severe invasive infection in chickens as well as humans. Oral infection of chickens with ST313 isolates D23580 and Q456 resulted in rapid infection of spleen and liver with all birds infected at these sites by 3 days post-infection. In contrast. the well-defined ST19 S. Typhimurium isolates F98 and 4/74 were slower to cause invasive disease. Both ST19 and ST313 caused hepatosplenomegaly. and this was most pronounced in the ST313-infected animals. At 3 and 7 days post-infection. colonization of the gastrointestinal tract was lower in birds infected with the ST313 isolates compared with ST19.

1188128,Molecular approaches to nontoxic antifouling,1992,AS Clare and D Rittschof and DJ Gerhart and JS Maki,22,Invertebrate Reproduction & Development,1-3,67-76,Taylor & Francis Group,A consequence of environmental and human health concerns arising from the use of toxic metals in marine antifouling coatings has been to recognise the need for a nontoxic alternative to fouling control. Recent research has focused on two approaches to this problem: the development of (a) foul-release coatings that work on the principle of either low surface free energy or coating ablation. and (b) coatings that incorporate a compound(s) that is nontoxic. or at least environmentally benign. that will deter fouling. Here we discuss the nature of the fouling problem and a new technology that is emerging to address it. The use of natural marine products and of analogues to these compounds holds considerable promise and is an area of intense research. It is recognized. however. that a melding of the technologies of foul-release and foul-deterrence may be required to develop broad spectrum. nontoxic antifouling …,True,2DnJPQQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,225,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07924259.1992.9672258,8463500070889285249,/scholar?cites=8463500070889285249,,,0,0,0

Balanus amphitrite amphitrite Darwin (Crustacea: Cirripedia) cyprids deposit ‘footprints’ of antennular secretion.

This result is in accord with a previous study on Balanus balanoides (L.)(=Semibalanus balanoides). In settlement assays. the pheromone is likely to contribute to an observed positive linear relationship between settlement and cyprid density.

N2O concentrations are highest during the southwest (SW) monsoon along the southern Indian continental shelf. Annual emissions range from 0.33 to 0.70 Tg N2O and are dominated by fluxes from coastal regions during the SW and northeast monsoons. Our revised estimate for the annual N2O flux from the Arabian Sea is much more tightly constrained than the previous consensus derived using averaged in-situ data from a smaller number of studies. However. the tendency to focus on measurements in locally restricted features in combination with insufficient seasonal data coverage leads to considerable uncertainties of the concentration fields and thus in the flux estimates. especially in the coastal zones of the northern and eastern Arabian Sea. The overall mean relative error of the annual N2O emissions from the Arabian Sea was estimated to be at least 65%.,True,8dPbqA0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,84,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/1/61/2001/,13641529924077898328,/scholar?cites=13641529924077898328,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/1/61/2001/acp-1-61-2001.pdf,0,0,0

Exchange rates were estimated with the 3He/SF6 dual tracer technique and from measured sea‐to‐air DMS fluxes and surface water concentrations. A total of seven kw estimates derived from 3He/SF6 were made. two of which were deemed to be influenced by the surfactant. These exhibited suppression from ∼5% to 55% at intermediate wind speeds (U10) in the range 7.2–10.7 m s−1. Similarly. kw determined from DMS data (kDMS) was also depressed by the surfactant; suppression ranged from ∼39% at 5.0 m s−1 to ∼24% at 10.8 m s−1.

Here we focus on bioactive compounds and interactions associated with phytoplankton. particularly bloom-forming diatoms. prymnesiophytes and dinoflagellates. Planktonic bioactive metabolites are structurally and functionally diverse and some may have multiple simultaneous functions including roles in chemical defense (antipredator. allelopathic and antibacterial compounds). and/or cell-to-cell signaling (eg. polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) of diatoms). Among inducible chemical defenses in response to grazing. there is high species-specific variability in the effects on grazers. ranging from severe physical incapacitation and/or death to no apparent physiological response. depending on predator susceptibility and detoxification capability.

This semi-lunar rhythm coincided with spring tides (full and new moon). and activity peaked in November. Observation of the progression of specific behaviour types in mating and non-mating pairs revealed that pairs which would go on to complete mating progressed from fighting to mating behaviour significantly faster than non-mating pairs.

Electro pilosa. Ion substitution and supplementation experiments with artificial sea water (ASW) have. however. shown that metamorphosis can be induced by elevation of the potassium ion concentration alone. Approximately 19 mM K+ASW (10 mM'excess') was found to elicit maximal metamorphic responses: 29 and 39 mM K+ASW had no inductive effect. Choline chloride was also found to induce metamorphosis in a dose-dependent manner. with lO^ M ineffective. 10~ 3M approximately threshold; and5xl03M to 102M optimal. Concentrations of choline> 10"" 2M were sub-lethally toxic. That the absence of larval metamorphosis on exposure to 29 and 39 mM K+ ASW was due to inhibition is inferred from interaction experiments with choline: at these concentrations of K+. metamorphosis in response to choline could be abolished. Timedexposure experiments indicated that artificial induction elicited by elevated K+ and choline involve either separate mechanisms. or different parts of the same pathway. Thus. whilst larvae required to be continuously exposed to 19 mM K+ ASW in order to complete metamorphosis. those exposed to 10'2M choline would subsequently complete development in normal ASW following only 1-2 h exposure to the inducer.

However. recent research suggests that. for some species at least. it may have a direct impact upon fertilization success. We present comparative data on the influence of gamete age on fertilization and development success in several marine invertebrates: the polychaetes Arenicola marina and Nereis virens and the asteroid echinoderm Asterias rubens. Oocytes are much longer lived in the polychaetes than in the echinoderm. with A. marina oocytes still capable of fertilizing and developing normally 96 h post-spawning. Developmental abnormalities and failure to reach blastula tend to occur well before the fertilizable life of the oocytes has expired.

Dordrecht,The evidence that the moon has a profound effect on the timing of reproductive activities of marine animals is compelling. Some moon phase related spawning events are revealed by the constant phase relationship between the timing of “once per year” spawning events and the lunar phase as in the highly synchronised breeding of the palolo worm Palola viridis. and the Japanese crinoid Comanthus japonicus. In other cases there is a repeated lunar cycle of reproductive activity and again the marine worms provide many good examples. The breeding of the palolo worm involves the highly synchronised release of what are in effect detached sexual satellites and the timing of this has annual (solar year). lunar. daily and tidal rhythm components.

In the absence of current monitoring or legislation to govern the trade. baseline information regarding the species. number and source location of animals traded is missing despite being critical for its successful management and sustainability. An industry assessment to establish the number and provenance of species of ornamental polychaetes (sabellids and serpulids) traded was undertaken across UK wholesalers and retailers. Six geographical regions exporting fan worms were identified. Singapore contributed the highest percentage of imports. but of only one worm “type” whereas Bali. the second largest source. supplied five different worm “types”. Over 50% of UK retailers were supplied by one wholesaler while the remainder were stocked by a mixture of one other wholesaler and/or direct imports from the source country. We estimate that up to 18.500 ornamental polychaetes (16.980 sabellids and 1.018 serpulids) are sold annually in the UK revealing a drastic underestimation of currently accepted trade figures. Incorrect identification (based on exporting region or visual characteristics) of traded animals exacerbates the inaccuracy in market quantification. although identification of preserved sabellids using published keys proved just as inconclusive with high within-species variability and the potential for new or cryptic species.

We attribute the increase at pH 7.95 to an initial stress response which was succeeded by a hormesis-like response at pH 7.67. A multi-generational modelling approach predicted a gradual decline in naupliar production over the next 100 years (equivalent to approximately 2430 generations).

1188201,The influence of bioactive oxylipins from marine diatoms on invertebrate reproduction and development,2009,Gary S Caldwell,7,,3,367-400,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,Diatoms are one of the main primary producers in aquatic ecosystems and occupy a vital link in the transfer of photosynthetically-fixed carbon through aquatic food webs. Diatoms produce an array of biologically-active metabolites. many of which have been attributed as a form of chemical defence and may offer potential as candidate marine drugs. Of considerable interest are molecules belonging to the oxylipin family which are broadly disruptive to reproductive and developmental processes. The range of reproductive impacts includes; oocyte maturation; sperm motility; fertilization; embryogenesis and larval competence. Much of the observed bioactivity may be ascribed to disruption of intracellular calcium signalling. induction of cytoskeletal instability and promotion of apoptotic pathways. From an ecological perspective. the primary interest in diatom-oxylipins is in relation to the potential impact on energy flow in planktonic systems whereby the reproductive success of copepods (the main grazers of diatoms) is compromised. Much data exists providing evidence for and against diatom reproductive effects; however detailed knowledge of the physiological and molecular processes involved remains poor. This paper provides a review of the current state of knowledge of the mechanistic impacts of diatom-oxylipins on marine invertebrate reproduction and development.

Here we focus on bioactive compounds and interactions associated with phytoplankton. particularly bloom-forming diatoms. prymnesiophytes and dinoflagellates. Planktonic bioactive metabolites are structurally and functionally diverse and some may have multiple simultaneous functions including roles in chemical defense (antipredator. allelopathic and antibacterial compounds). and/or cell-to-cell signaling (eg. polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) of diatoms). Among inducible chemical defenses in response to grazing. there is high species-specific variability in the effects on grazers. ranging from severe physical incapacitation and/or death to no apparent physiological response. depending on predator susceptibility and detoxification capability. Most bioactive compounds are present in very low concentrations. in both the producing organism and the surrounding aqueous medium. Furthermore. bioactivity may be subject to synergistic interactions with other natural and anthropogenic environmental toxicants. Most. if not all phycotoxins are classic secondary metabolites. but many other bioactive metabolites are simple molecules derived from primary metabolism (eg. PUAs in diatoms. dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in prymnesiophytes). Producing cells do not seem to suffer physiological impact due to their synthesis.

Here we report on the efficacy of the diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehyde 2.4-decadienal as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against shell-infesting polychaetes. Exposure to decadienal had pronounced dose- and time-dependent negative effects on larval mortality. growth and developmental rate.

Naupliar production. growth. and cuticle elemental composition were determined for four pH values: 8.06 (control); 7.95; 7.82; 7.67. with copper addition to concentrations equivalent to those in benthic pore waters. An additive synergistic effect was observed; the decline in naupliar production was greater with added copper at decreasing pH than for decreasing pH alone. Naupliar production modelled for the two generations revealed a negative synergistic impact between ocean acidification and environmentally relevant copper concentrations. Conversely. copper addition enhanced copepod growth. with larger copepods produced at each pH compared to the impact of pH alone. Copepod digests revealed significantly reduced cuticle concentrations of sulphur. phosphorus and calcium under decreasing pH; further. copper uptake increased to toxic levels that lead to reduced naupliar production. These data suggest that ocean acidification will enhance copper bioavailability. resulting in larger. but less fecund individuals that may have an overall detrimental outcome for copepod populations.,True,fPrWE6oAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,32,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071257,15947252627963247404,/scholar?cites=15947252627963247404,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071257,0,0,0

1188238,Risk factors for moderate and severe persistent pain in patients undergoing total knee and hip arthroplasty: a prospective predictive study,2013,Patrícia R Pinto and Teresa McIntyre and Ramón Ferrero and Armando Almeida and Vera Araújo-Soares,8,PloS one,9,e73917,Public Library of Science,Persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) is a major clinical problem with significant individual. social and health care costs. The aim of this study was to examine the joint role of demographic. clinical and psychological risk factors in the development of moderate and severe PPSP after Total Knee and Hip Arthroplasty (TKA and THA. respectively). This was a prospective study wherein a consecutive sample of 92 patients were assessed 24 hours before (T1). 48 hours after (T2) and 4–6 months (T3) after surgery. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of moderate and severe levels of PPSP. Four to six months after TKA and THA. 54 patients (58.7%) reported none or mild pain (Numerical Rating Scale: NRS ≤3). whereas 38 (41.3%) reported moderate to severe pain (NRS >3). In the final multivariate hierarchical logistic regression analyses. illness representations concerning the condition leading to surgery (osteoarthritis). such as a chronic timeline perception of the disease. emerged as a significant predictor of PPSP. Additionally. post-surgical anxiety also showed a predictive role in the development of PPSP. Pre-surgical pain was the most significant clinical predictive factor and. as expected. undergoing TKA was associated with greater odds of PPSP development than THA. The findings on PPSP predictors after major joint arthroplasties can guide clinical practice in terms of considering cognitive and emotional factors. together with clinical factors. in planning acute pain management before and after surgery.,True,bmSwuBkAAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C,95,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073917,3548360513652720715,/scholar?cites=3548360513652720715,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073917,0,0,0

However. two recent reviews have found little evidence that individualized stage-based activity promotion interventions are any more effective than control conditions in promoting long-term adherence to increased levels of physical activity.

1188285,Food access and obesity,2007,Martin White,8,,,99-107,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,BackgroundHuman diet and nutrition has long been known to influence health outcomes. The major focus of research during the last hundred years has been on the relationship between nutrient intakes and disease processes at a physiological level. In the post-war years. separate strands of research emerged primarily in the UK and the USA: on food retailing. from economic and planning perspectives; and on dietary patterns and dietary behaviour change. focusing on prevention of chronic non-communicable diseases such as coronary heart disease. Only with the emergence of interest in and. more recently. a UK policy focus on health inequalities. has the link been made explicitly between food retail access and dietary intake. From the early 1990s onwards. this research increasingly sought to answer the questions of whether urban ‘food deserts’ exist. and if so how they are caused and whether they can be tackled by modifying the food retail environment. In the last 5 years. this integrated strand of research has broadened and converged with a parallel strand of research on understanding the ‘obesogenic environment’. This new field of research has predominantly explored the effects of the built environment on physical activity. but has now also started to explore the availability and accessibility of retailed foods. A recent addition to this strand is research on the spatial patterning of and food availability in restaurants and fastfood chains.,True,Qj1CGEkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,301,https://www.academia.edu/download/31007738/099-107.pdf,14683992376945511957,/scholar?cites=14683992376945511957,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31007738/099-107.pdf,0,0,0

UK),Health inequalities between groups within populations defined by place of residence. race. ethnicity or culture. occupation. gender. religion. age. education. income or other measure of socioeconomic position (SEP) are widely observed (Marmot et al. 1978; Townsend and Davidson. 1982; Charlton and White. 1995) and. in many contexts. growing (Adams et al. 2006). Reducing health inequalities has become an important objective of governments worldwide (US Department of Health and Human Services. 2000; Department of Health. 2004). However. evidence for strategies to reduce health inequalities is limited and systematic reviews have failed to offer substantive analyses or contribute to theory (Arblaster et al. 1996; Gunning-Schepers and Gepkens. 1996). Health inequities are inequalities or differences in health between populations or groups within populations that are considered unfair and avoidable (Kawachi et al. 2002; Macinko and Starfield. 2002). The term ‘inequality’is used throughout this chapter. although it is impossible to make the necessary value judgements to designate observed differences as ‘unfair and avoidable’in the space available. nor is it central to the arguments presented here.Contemporary health strategies at international. national and local levels share the twin aims of improving overall health and reducing inequalities in health between groups within the population. Although common sense may suggest that these aims should be achievable in tandem. an intervention that improves the health of a population overall may also increase inequalities in health (Macintyre. 2000; Victora et al. 2000; Mechanic. 2002 …,True,Qj1CGEkAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,297,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NHRoDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&dq=info:RGGKwkDIBUkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=5ZKzBPyeab&sig=2A0G9STn9ATTDa5-Wph0bqykAlY,5261831920119603524,/scholar?cites=5261831920119603524,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f57b/e09df31909b5f66191203a326885d70c38f6.pdf,0,0,0

Various studies indicate that Campylobacter causes a substantial human disease burden in low to middle-income countries. but data regarding the organism’s epidemiology in countries like Kenya are scarce. In sub-Saharan Africa. 3.8 million deaths of children under-5 years of age are reported annually.

Much of what we know about the biology of Campylobacter jejuni is based on infection of inbred or SPF laboratory lines of chickens with a small number of isolates used in most laboratory studies. Recently we have shown that both the host response and microbial ecology of C. jejuni in the broiler chicken varies with both the host-type and significantly between C. jejuni isolates. Here we describe heterogeneity in infection within a panel of C. jejuni isolates in two broiler chicken breeds. human intestinal epithelial cells and the Galleria insect model of virulence. All C. jejuni isolates colonised the chicken caeca. though colonisation of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract varied between isolates. Extra-intestinal spread to the liver varied between isolates and bird breed but a poultry isolate 13126 (sequence type 21) showed the greatest levels of extra-intestinal spread to the liver in both broiler breeds with over 70% of birds of the fast growing breed and 50% of the slower growing breed having C. jejuni in their livers. Crucially 13126 is significantly more invasive than other isolates in human intestinal epithelial cells and gave the highest mortality in the Galleria infection model.

As such there is a need for effective controls in chicken production. Microbial-based controls such as probiotics are attractive to the poultry industry. but of limited efficacy. Furthermore. as commercially-produced chickens have no maternal contact. their pioneer microbiome is likely to come from the hatchery environment. Early delivery of microbials that lead to a more ‘natural avian’ microbiome may. therefore. improve bird health and reduce susceptibility to C.jejuni colonisation.A faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) was used to transfer a mature cecal microbiome to newly-hatched broiler chicks and its effects on C.jejuni challenge assessed. We used both a seeder-bird infection model that mimics natural bird-to-bird infection alongside a direct-challenge model. We used a 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based approach to characterize the transplant material itself alongside changes to the chicken microbiome following FMT.FMT changes the composition of the chicken intestinal microbiome. We observed little change in species richness following FMT compared to untreated samples. but there is an increase in phylogenetic diversity within those species. The most significant difference in the ceca is an increase in Lactobacilli. although not a major component of the transplant material. suggesting the FMT results in a change in the intestinal milieu as much as a direct change to the microbiome.Upon direct challenge.

Vent fluid and macroconsumer samples were collected at three vent sites (E2. E9N and E9S) at distances of tens of metres to hundreds of kilometres apart with contrasting vent fluid chemistries to describe trophic interactions and identify potential carbon fixation pathways using stable isotopes. δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon from vent fluids ranged from −4.6‰ to 0.8‰ at E2 and from −4.4‰ to 1.5‰ at E9. The lowest macroconsumer δ13C was observed in peltospiroid gastropods (−30.0‰ to −31.1‰) and indicated carbon fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle by endosymbiotic gamma-Proteobacteria. Highest δ13C occurred in Kiwa sp. (−19.0‰ to −10.5‰). similar to that of the epibionts sampled from their ventral setae. Kiwa sp. δ13C differed among sites. which were attributed to spatial differences in the epibiont community and the relative contribution of carbon fixed via the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) and CBB cycles assimilated by Kiwa sp.

Radical changes in the abundance of some species in 1996 led to a significant shift in the way in which organic matter was reprocessed at the seabed. This article examines the reproductive processes of the holothurian Oneirophanta mutabilis collected during the time series. The reproductive biology of O. mutabilis is reviewed. No males were evident in any of the samples. The sex ratio (females: ‘no gender’) was biased significantly towards no-gender individuals. The maximum egg size was 650 μm and there was no evidence of synchrony in reproduction.

We explored macrofaunal community ecology at a sediment-hosted hydrothermal vent in the Southern Ocean. This is the first such study of these ecosystems outside of the Pacific and the furthest south (62˚S) of any vent system studied. Sedimentary fauna were sampled in four areas of the Bransfield Strait (Southern Ocean). with the aim of contrasting community structure between vent and non-vent sites. Macrofaunal assemblages were clearly distinct between vent and non-vent sites. and diversity. richness and density declined towards maximum hydrothermal activity. This variation is in contrast to observations from similar systems in the Pacific and demonstrates the influence of factors other than chemosynthetic primary productivity in structuring infauna at deep-sea vent communities. Vent endemic fauna had limited abundance and were represented by a single siboglinid species at hydrothermally active areas. meaning that that the majority of local biota were those also found in other areas.

The oropharyngeal microbiota is the major reservoir of infection. This study explored the relative contributions of time in hospital and patient demographics to the community structure of the oropharyngeal microbiota in older patients with lower limb fracture. We collected 167 throat swabs from 53 patients (mean age 83) over 14 days after hospitalisation. and analysed these using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We calculated frailty/comorbidity indices. undertook dental examinations and collected data on respiratory tract infections. We analysed microbial community composition using correspondence (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis. Ten patients were treated for respiratory tract infection. Microbial community structure was related to frailty. number of teeth and comorbidity on admission. with comorbidity exerting the largest effect.

Only by understanding these can we find effective interventions. We analysed trends in human Campylobacter cases in NE England from 2004 to 2009. investigating the associations between different risk factors and disease using time-series models. We then developed an individual-based (IB) model of risk behaviour. human immunological responses to infection and environmental contamination driven by weather and land use. We parameterised the IB model for NE England and compared outputs to observed numbers of reported cases each month in the population in 2004–2009.
