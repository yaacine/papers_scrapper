1096295,Human Immunodefficiency Virus (HIV)-Blood Interactions: Surface Thermodynamics Approach,2010,CH Achebe and SN Omenyi and OP Manafa and D Okoli,,"Nnamdi azikiwe university, Awka",,1-120,,Sequel to the earlier works by Omenyi et al which established the role of surface thermodynamics in various biological processes from the electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction mechanisms. HIV-blood interactions were modeled. This involved the use of the Hamaker coefficient approach as a thermodynamic tool in determining the interaction processes. It therefore became necessary to apply the Lifshitz derivation for van der Waals forces as an alternative to the contact angle approach which has been widely used in other biological systems. The methodology involved taking blood samples from HIV-infected and uninfected persons for absorbance measurement using Ultraviolet Visible Spectrophotometer. From the absorbance data various variables required for computations with the Lifshitz formula were derived. The Hamaker constants A11. A22. A33 and the combined Hamaker coefficients A132 were obtained using the values of the dielectric constant together with the Lifshitz equation. The absolute combined Hamaker coefficient. A132abs for the infected blood samples gave the value of 0.2587 x10-21Joule. The positive sense of this value implies net positive van der Waals forces indicating an attraction between the virus and the lymphocyte. A lower value of A131abs= 0.1026 x10-21 Joule obtained for the uninfected blood samples is also an indicator that a zero or negative absolute combined Hamaker coefficient is attainable.,True,dyXIrVcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,16,http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2012/IMECS2012_pp136-141.pdf,6026553217977291622,/scholar?cites=6026553217977291622,,http://www.iaeng.org/publication/IMECS2012/IMECS2012_pp136-141.pdf,0,0,0

They are theoretically given comparative study for a three tooth end miller operating at 0.5. 0.75 and 0.8 radial immersions. 0.5 and 0.8 radial immersion conditions are chosen so that analysis covers situations in which repeat and continuous tool engagements occur while 0.75 radial immersion just precludes tool free flight. It results from analysis that the down end-milling mode is better favoured for workshop application than the up end-milling mode from both standpoints of cutting force and chatter stability. This superiority in chatter stability is quantified by making use of the Simpson’s rule to establish that switching from up end-milling mode to down end-milling mode at 0.5 radial immersion almost doubles the possibility of chatter free milling while at 0.75 and 0.8 radial immersions this possibility almost triples. This result conforms to the age long recognition from workshop practices that climb milling operations are much more stable than conventional milling operations.

The system consists of a DC vapour compression refrigerator. a controller that prevents the battery from being over charged or deepdischarged. a DC inverter which converts direct current from the solar photovoltaic panel or the battery into alternating current that can be fed to the refrigerator’s compressor. a battery to store and supply energy when the sun is not available and a photovoltaic (PV) generator which supplies power to the refrigerator and charges the battery with excess energy. The different components of the system are modeled. the output from one component becoming the input to the next component. The significance of the resulting photovoltaic powered vapour compression refrigeration is to develop a computer model and simulation for a photovoltaic powered refrigeration system and MatLab is used to simulate the system performance. The simulation gives the system relationship between the freezer temperatures that can be attained and incident solar radiation on the solar PV panel using different solar panels. The battery size required to run the system for a maximum period of 12 hours was derived. It was determined that as the system voltage increased. the battery size required to run the system decreased.

1096314,Integrated process modelling of a thermophilic biogas plant,2014,OE Anisiji and JL Chukwuneke and CH Achebe and PC Okolie,3,International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research,7,334-341,,this work developed a mathematical model of a biogas plant from a mechanistic point of view. for urban area clean energy requirement. It aimed at integrating thermodynamics; which deals with the direction in which a process occurs and Biochemical kinetics; which gives the understanding of the rates of biochemical reaction. The mathematical formulation of the proposed gas plant follows the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. and further analysis were accomplished to develop an algorithm for evaluating the plant performance preferably in terms of daily production capacity. In addition. the capacity of the plant is equally estimated for a given cycle of operation and presented in time histories. A nominal 1500m3 biogas plant was studied characteristically and its performance efficiency evaluated. It was observed that the rate of biogas production is essentially a function of enthalpy ratio. the reactor temperature. pH. substrate concentration. rate of degradation of the biomass. and the accumulation of matter in the system due to bacteria growth. The results of this study conform to a very large extent with reported empirical data of some existing plant and further model validations were conducted in line with classical records found in literature.,True,dyXIrVcAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,4,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.589.3016&rep=rep1&type=pdf,9844088489882783899,/scholar?cites=9844088489882783899,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.589.3016&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The laboratory batch anaerobic digestion were carried out in five (5) different ten-litre anaerobic digesters which were used for the fermentation of the substrates with cumulative biogas production of 13.1. 24.6. 16.7. 8.6 and 7.1L/g volatile solid(VS). The digesters A. B. C. D and E with process conditions of (100% PD and 0% CP). (75% PD and 25% CP). (50% PD and 50% CP). (25% PD and 75% CP) and (0% PD and 100% CP) respectively. were incubated for forty four (44) days at ambient mesophilic temperature of 37±1 oC at a pH of 6.7. The gas production did not begin until the second day for the first four digesters while that of digester E started on the fourth day. (this is as a result of high cellulose content) and then increased steadily until it reached a maximum biogas yield between the 18 th and 22nd day of anaerobic digestion. The highest biogas production of 24.6L/g volatile solid(VS) recorded in digester B could be attributed to better synergy of microorganisms in the digester as a result of the presence of some limited quantity of cassava peels and a C/N ratio of 23.4. This result shows that biogas production could be enhanced effectively through co-digestion process of substrates.. Keywords: Anaerobic. Biogas. Co-digestion. Feedstock.

1096318,Analysis of the dynamic energy flow associated with phagocytosis of bacteria,2015,Paul Okpala and Sam Omenyi and Godwin Ozoegwu and Chinonso Achebe,1,Heliyon,1,e00021,Elsevier,This paper treats the phenomenon of phagocytosis from the flow of energy point of view. Considerable efforts have been made towards elucidating the subject of phagocytosis in other fields of learning. but little has been said about the mechanical work that is done during phagocytosis. Phagocytosis without doubt is an interaction that involves the flow of energy. Energy equation model of phagocytosis is then presented in this paper to analyze the mechanical energy that is involved in the build-up of the engulfment of bacteria by the phagocytes. Data of the E Coli bacteria from published work was then applied to the solution of the energy equation. A borderline contact angle ϑ of 77.356° between the phagocyte and the bacteria at χ= 0 was deduced in this work. It was shown that when ϑ< 77.356°. χ< 0. engulfment is favoured and when ϑ> 77.356°. χ> 0. engulfment is not favoured for E-coli.

1096319,Surface thermodynamics Approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M-Tb)–Human Sputum Interactions,2015,JL Chukwuneke and CH Achebe and SN Omenyi,5,Journal of Bioengineering & biomedical Science,3,167,,This research work presents the surface thermodynamics approach to M-TB/HIV-Human sputum interactions. This involved the use of the Hamaker coefficient concept as a surface energetics tool in determining the interaction processes. with the surface interfacial energies explained using van der Waals concept of particle interactions. The Lifshitz derivation for van der Waals forces was applied as an alternative to the contact angle approach which has been widely used in other biological systems. The methodology involved taking sputum samples from twenty infected persons and from twenty uninfected persons for absorbance measurement using a digital Ultraviolet visible Spectrophotometer. The variables required for the computations with the Lifshitz formula were derived from the absorbance data. The Matlab software tools were used in the mathematical analysis of the data produced from the experiments (absorbance values). The Hamaker constants and the combined Hamaker coefficients were obtained using the values of the dielectric constant together with the Lifshitz equation. The absolute combined Hamaker coefficients A132abs and A131abs on both infected and uninfected sputum samples gave the values of A132abs= 0.21631× 10-21 Joule for M-TB infected sputum and Ã132abs= 0.18825× 10-21 Joule for M-TB/HIV infected sputum. The significance of this result is the positive value of the absolute combined Hamaker coefficient which suggests the existence of net positive vanderwaals forces demonstrating an attraction between the bacteria and the macrophage.

Tubers were randomly selected and moisture content determined before processing the remaining to flour for physicochemical and pasting characteristics. The results showed that test varieties had significantly (p< 0.05) higher moisture and protein contents. higher peak time and pasting temperature but lower dry matter and starch content. lower swelling power and pasting viscosities in comparison with pona. Peak viscosity ranged from 74.80 to 284.60 RVU. trough (66.85 to 258.65 RVU). and breakdown (19.50 to 311.50 RVU). Peak time and pasting temperatures were 5.15-7.00 min and 83.60-90.10 o C respectively. Pona had 291.17 RVU as peak viscosity. 186.17 RVU troughs. 105.00 RVU breakdown and 422.75 RVU final viscosity. Others were: setback (236.58 RVU). peak time (4.73 min) and pasting temperatures (79.88 o C).

In order to continue effective use of slag in the future. we realize the necessity of development for new applications and market reclamation to create the stable demand. Therefore the needs of recycling slag waste cannot be over emphasized for sustainable environmental. economic and industrial growth. The present paper summarizes the current application of slag the ferrous and non-ferrous slag. as well as recycling of salt fluxes in secondary smelting production.

Data on the critical loads and forces that were used for the analysis were obtained from literature. and the analyses were done with an Autodesk Inventor Software. Findings made confirmed that the aluminum alloy hub have less weight than the cast iron hub which helps to reduce the inertia (the work done to move or stop the motorcycle hub).

The identification of a city center that aims to find the accurate location of the city center or delineate the city center with a precise boundary becomes vital. This work attempts to achieve this by using a new type of movement data generated from location-based social networks. whereby three different methods are deployed for clustering and compared regarding identification of city centers and delineation of their boundaries. Experiments show that city centers with precise boundaries can be identified by using the proposed approach with location-based social network data.

Geo-Inf.,5,,,Tourism is one of the most economically important industries. It is. however. vulnerable to disaster events. Geotagged social media data. as one of the forms of volunteered geographic information (VGI). has been widely explored to support the prevention. preparation. and response phases of disaster management. while little effort has been put on the recovery phase. This study develops a scientific workflow and methods to monitor and assess post-disaster tourism recovery using geotagged Flickr photos. which involve a viewshed based data quality enhancement. a space-time bin based quantitative photo analysis. and a crowdsourcing based qualitative photo analysis. The developed workflow and methods have also been demonstrated in this paper through a case study conducted for the Philippines where a magnitude 7.2 earthquake (Bohol earthquake) and a super typhoon (Haiyan) occurred successively in October and November 2013. In the case study. we discovered spatiotemporal knowledge about the post-disaster tourism recovery. including the recovery statuses and trends. and the photos visually showing unfixed damages. The findings contribute to a better tourism rehabilitation of the study area.

OSM road networks have high levels of detail and complex structures. but they also have large numbers of duplicated lines for the same road features. which leads to difficulties and low efficiency when extracting multilane roads using conventional methods based on the analysis and operations of line segments. To overcome these deficiencies. a polygon-based method is proposed that is based on shape analysis and Gestalt theory. which treats polygons surrounded by roads as operating elements.

This phenomenon is of great importance to understanding from where the data come and how the project evolves. The investigation in this paper is dedicated to answering the following questions: How does contribution inequality change over time in OSM? Which group of contributors plays a more important role in influencing trends in contribution inequality: the “vocal minority” or the “silent majority”? To answer the first question. we provide overall measurements for contribution inequality using the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient. To answer the second question. we use quantile-based classifying strategy to analyze structural changes in the community. and use the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test to analyze productivity changes. Our case study shows that in countries without significant imports. contributions become more unequal over time. This trend is consistent with the rapid expansion of the silent majority. even though other classes of contributors also grow at a slower pace. On the other hand. contribution inequality fluctuates a lot in countries with huge imports. and agrees well with the productivity changes in the vocal minority.

The approach is designed based on a priori knowledge in urban areas: 1) man-made objects feature geometric regularity such as vertical planar structures (e.g.. building facades). whereas vegetation reveals huge diversity in shape and point distribution and 2) different types of urban man-made objects can be characterized by the point extension and the height above the ground level. Therefore. MLS-based point clouds are first divided into three layers with respect to the vertical height. In each layer. seed points of man-made objects are indicated by a line filter in the footprints of off-ground objects. which is generated by binarizing the spatial accumulation map of the point clouds.

1096374,Segmentation of Sloped Roofs from Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds Using Ridge-Based Hierarchical Decomposition,2014,Yao W. and Fu Q. Fan H,6,Remote Sensing,4,3284-3301,MDPI AG,This paper presents a new approach for roof facet segmentation based on ridge detection and hierarchical decomposition along ridges. The proposed approach exploits the fact that every roof can be composed of a set of gabled roofs and single facets which are separated by the gabled roofs. In this work. firstly. building footprints stored in OpenStreetMap are used to extract 3D points on roofs. Then. roofs are segmented into roof facets. The algorithm starts with detecting roof ridges using RANSAC since they are parallel to the horizon and situated on the top of the roof. The roof ridges are utilized to indicate the location and direction of the gabled roof. Thus. points on the two roof facets along a roof ridge can be identified based on their connectivity and coplanarity. The results of the segmentation benefit the further process of roof reconstruction because many parameters. including the position. angle and size of the gabled roof can be calculated and used as priori knowledge for the model-driven approach. and topologies among the point segments are made known for the data-driven approach. The algorithm has been validated in the test sites of two towns next to Bavaria Forest national park. The experimental results show that building roofs can be segmented with both high correctness and completeness simultaneously.

Research has proven that the resulting data in some areas are of decent quality. which guarantees their usability in various applications. Though these achievements are normally attributed to the huge heterogeneous community mainly consisting of amateurs. it is in fact a small percentage of major contributors who make nearly all contributions. In this paper. we investigate the contributing behaviors of these contributors to deduce whether they are actually professionals. Various indicators are used to depict the behaviors on three themes: practice. skill and motivation. aiming to identify solid evidence for expertise. Our case studies show that most major contributors in Germany. France and the United Kingdom are hardly amateurs. but are professionals instead.

1096382,Automated detection of 3D individual trees along urban road corridors by mobile laser scanning systems,2013,Wei Yao and Hongchao Fan,,,,,,(300 words): Recently. mobile laser scanning (MLS) has emerged as an efficient means to acquire massive 3D point clouds along urban road corridors for the several applications such as building footprint reconstruction. facade modeling and road traffic inventories. In this paper. we propose an automated strategy to address the issue of detecting 3D individual trees in urban traffic corridors using MLS data. Firstly. an approach based on analyzing the features in the spatial accumulation map of MLS point cloud is developed to identify manmade objects from natural objects by sequentially extracting man-made structures. The remaining points of natural objects should mainly contain vegetation and few vertical disturbing objects. This point class is further delivered to the next step to undergo a 3D segmentation process to obtain individual object instances by using a spectral clustering method. Once the point cloud is partitioned into various point segments corresponding to object instances such as single trees. poles or traffic signs. different fine classes can be further distinguished by using local shape descriptor of point segments. After the refinement of the segmentation. vegetation can be separated from other disturbing objects and detected as individual trees. An experimental study shows and evaluates the feasibility and capability of the proposed strategy towards detecting 3D individual trees from MLS data of complex urban corridors.,True,VeH-I7AAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,14,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hongchao_Fan/publication/258565301_Automated_detection_of_3D_individual_trees_along_urban_road_corridors_by_mobile_laser_scanning_systems/links/54748bb90cf2778985abe6ed/Automated-detection-of-3D-individual-trees-along-urban-road-corridors-by-mobile-laser-scanning-systems.pdf,9162935528887998398,/scholar?cites=9162935528887998398,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hongchao_Fan/publication/258565301_Automated_detection_of_3D_individual_trees_along_urban_road_corridors_by_mobile_laser_scanning_systems/links/54748bb90cf2778985abe6ed/Automated-detection-of-3D-individual-trees-along-urban-road-corridors-by-mobile-laser-scanning-systems.pdf,0,0,0

However. to protect privacy. government population data is aggregated. Population estimates at finer scales can be obtained through areal interpolation. a process where data from a first spatial unit system is transferred to another system. Areal interpolation can be conducted with ancillary data that guide the redistribution of population. For population estimation at the building level. common ancillary data include three-dimensional data on buildings. obtained through costly processes such as LiDAR.

The idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over the Web. Similarly. there is a growing interest in volunteered geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a complement to existing.“traditional” data. it becomes important to develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several sources and with other types of data. In this paper. we make a first step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an investigation of the types of VGI applications. we have developed a conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications. which will act as interfaces to higher-level services. such as discovery and reasoning services. in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor data by client applications.

An essential step towards the success of a semantic approach is the ability to take into account the fuzzy nature of geospatial concepts being compared and of the semantic mapping process itself. While fuzzy ontologies and quantitative fuzzy matching methods have been proposed. they are not targeted at the geospatial domain. In this paper. we present a fuzzy semantic mapping approach for fuzzy geospatial ontologies. which employs fuzzy logics. The fuzzy semantic mapping approach has the capability to produce fuzzy qualitative semantic relations between concepts of fuzzy ontologies. which are richer than quantitative-only matches that are provided by existing approaches. In an application example. we show how fuzzy mappings can be used to propagate fuzzy queries to relevant sources of a network.

1096404,Toward coupling sensor data and volunteered geographic information (VGI) with agent-based transport simulation in the context of smart cities,2012,Mohamed Bakillah and Steve HL Liang and Alexander Zipf,,,,17-23,,Smart transportation planning is one of the fundamental components of Smart Cities. Agent-based transport simulations are one efficient way to support the development of smart transportation planning systems. However. to be reliable. transportation simulations must integrate information on time-varying phenomena that can constitute obstacles to transportation. such as the impact of snow storms. Sensor networks constitute an efficient solution for gathering data on such time-varying obstacles and feeding the agent-based transportation simulation. We present Sensor-Enabled OSM-Matsim. a multi-agent transportation simulation system which integrates sensor data from the Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for Environment Sensing (GeoCENS) platform and uses volunteered geographic information (VGI) from Open Street Map (OSM) as input data.

Heidelberg,The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative enables access of sensor data over the Web. The growing amount of available sensors requires discovering mechanisms to find sensor services relevant for users. These mechanisms must rely on explicit sensor metadata model and address the problem of semantic heterogeneity. We present a new discovering approach that is based on a novel sensor metadata model compliant with SWE standards. where sensors’ descriptions are referenced to a common semantic reference frame to support resolution of semantic heterogeneities. The discovery mechanism comprises two steps: first. a network-analysis-based partitioning algorithm modularizes the set of sensors into meaningful sensor clusters. which semantics is generated with aggregation operators.

1096407,Modeling spatial interactions between areas to assess the burglary risk,2016,Lucy W Mburu and Mohamed Bakillah,5,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,4,47,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,It is generally acknowledged that the urban environment presents different types of risk factors. but how the structural effects of areas influence the risk levels in neighboring areas has been less widely investigated. This research assesses the local effects of burglary contributory factors on burglary over small areas in a large metropolitan region. A comparative framework is developed for analyzing the effects of geographic dependence on burglary rates. and for assessing how such dependence conditions the community context and the urban land use. A local indicators spatial autocorrelation analysis assesses burglaries over five years (2011–2015) to identify risk clusters. Thereafter. effects of different variables (eg. unemployment. building density) on burglary frequency are estimated in a series of regression models while controlling for changes in the risk levels of nearby surrounding areas. Results uncover strong evidence that the configuration of the surroundings influences risk. After controlling for area-based interaction. patterns are identified that contrast with the previous literature. such as lower burglary frequency in areas with higher tenancy in social housing units. Together the findings demonstrate that the spatial arrangement of areas is as crucial as contextual crime factors. particularly when assessing the risk for small areas.

The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps.

Some policies targeting UHI mitigation have been implemented for a few years and thus needs to be evaluated for changes or modifications in the future. A low-cost approach to rapidly monitoring UHI intensity variations can assist in evaluating policy implementations. In this study. we proposed a new approach to local-scale UHI intensity estimates by using nighttime light satellite imageries. We explored to what extent UHI intensity could be estimated according to nighttime light intensity at two local scales. We attempted to estimate district-level and neighbourhood-level UHI intensity across London and Paris. As the geography level rises from district to neighbourhood. the capacity of the models explaining the variations of the UHI intensity decreases.

Several studies have suggested the key role of the dehydrated crust. which is thought to control the main mechanisms in oil absorption. that is drainage and capillary suction during post‐frying cooling. To contribute to a better understanding of these mechanisms. we have used infrared microspectroscopy at the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury (UK) to monitor the oil distribution in fried potato cylinders.

Such a function might be based on maximising the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency or the correlation coefficient or by minimising the root mean square error. Other modellers routinely incorporate a bias constraint into their objective function. There are a number of ways of incorporating a bias constraint. One way is to accept a calibration only if the difference in total streamflow between observation and prediction is less than some prescribed limit. Typically. this limit might be expressed as a percentage of the total observed streamflow. In this paper we examine whether the choice of calibration method—using a bias constraint or not—has an effect on the subsequent use of the calibrated parameter sets to regionalise predictions to ungauged catchments. We calibrate five lumped rainfall-runoff models—AWBM. IHACRES. Sacramento. Simhyd and SMAR-G—to 89 gauged catchments in Tasmania ranging in size from 10 to 3500 km2. Three separate calibration runs are done for each model. In one. the objective function is based on the daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency alone; in the second. we augment the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency with a severe bias constraint that attempts to ensure that the total predicted streamflow is within 5% of the total observed streamflow (the bucket constraint); and in the third. we combine a smooth. less severe bias constraint (the log-bias constraint) along with efficiency into the objective function. As expected. overall efficiencies tend to be larger for the unconstrained …,True,oY7IJykAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,90,https://www.academia.edu/download/51591747/viney_I7a.pdf,18021981630871289216,/scholar?cites=18021981630871289216,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51591747/viney_I7a.pdf,0,0,0

This paper describes an integrated modelling framework combining conceptual rainfall–runoff modelling. river system modelling and hydrodynamic (HD) modelling to estimate hydrological connectivity between wetlands and rivers in the Flinders and Gilbert river catchments in northern Australia. Three historical flood events ranging from a mean annual flood to a 35-year return period flood were investigated using a two dimensional HD model (MIKE 21). Inflows from upstream catchments were estimated using a river network model.

Heidelberg,Traditionally optimization of defence operations are based on the findings of human-based war gaming. However. this approach is extremely expensive and does not enable analysts to explore the problem space properly. Recent research shows that both computer simulations of multi-agent systems and evolutionary computation are valuable tools for optimizing defence operations. A potential maneuver strategy is generated by the evolutionary method then gets evaluated by calling the multi–agent simulation module to simulate the system behavior. The optimization problem in this context is known as a black box optimization problem. where the function that is being optimized is hidden and the only information we have access to is through the value(s) returned from the simulation for a given input set.

In the present study. the distribution of macrophages in murine ovaries at various developmental stages was immunohistochemically studied using a monoclonal antibody against F4/80. a highly specific antigen of murine macrophages. The results showed that definite F4/80-positive stains were hardly detectable in ovaries on day 0 after birth. On day 7. a few F4/80-positive cells could be identified between the developing follicles. The positive stains were irregular in shape and showed little physical contact with the primordial or primary follicles. By days 14 and 21. when the theca cell layers of growing follicles were developing. the positive cells had extended or elongated to surround the cell layer. On day 28. besides the presence of elongating positive cells surrounding the growing follicles. irregularly shaped F4/80-positive cells became apparent in the interstitium between the growing follicles and also in the capsular tissues. Thereafter. positive cells with stellate appearance were detected in the corpora lutea. which first developed around 6 weeks of age. Although the positive cells were homogenously distributed in the corpora lutea in virgin adults. only a few sporadic positive cells were found there in pregnant mice. However. the positive cells infiltrated into the corpora lutea again in the postpartum period. These results show that ovarian macrophages exhibit dramatical changes in their distribution from neonatal to postpartum periods.Previous studies have shown that the mature ovary contains many macrophages which may be involved in important endocrine or paracrine processes …,True,oY7IJykAAAAJ:tBlTYpvFGQIC,17,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/aohc1988/61/4/61_4_353/_article/-char/ja/,10377601644895758323,/scholar?cites=10377601644895758323,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/aohc1988/61/4/61_4_353/_pdf,0,0,0

School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.,Simulation has been used to model combat for a long time. Recently. it has been accepted that combat is a complex adaptive system (CAS). Multi-agent systems (MAS) are also considered as a powerful modelling and development environment to simulate combat. Agent-based distillations (ABD)-proposed by the US Marine Corp-are a type of MAS used mainly by the military for exploring large scenario spaces. ABDs that facilitated the analysis and understanding of combat include: ISAAC. EINSTein. MANA. CROCADILE and BactoWars. With new concepts such as networked forces. previous ABDs can implicitly simulate a networked force. However. the architectures of these systems limit the potential advantages gained from the use of networks.In this thesis. a novel network centric multi-agent architecture (NCMAA) is proposed. based purely on network theory and CAS.

As energy prices continue to rise. energy conservation is the prime concern for every industry. Distillation is probably the most studied unit operation in terms of optimization and control. Since distillation columns are major energy-intensive units in chemical plants and given the recent increase in fuel cost. the plant engineers are obliged to find better operating strategies and control systems. One of the significant sections that can be worked upon is finding the optimum feed tray locations of distillation columns. The energy consumptions during distillation can have a strong impact on overall profitability. Hence. the optimization of a column is aimed towards greater production and an increase in quality.

1096463,Improved method for development of parsimonious orthonormal basis filter models,2011,Lemma D Tufa and M Ramasamy and M Shuhaimi,21,Journal of process Control,1,36-45,Elsevier,One of the major advantages of orthonormal basis filter (OBF) models is that they are parsimonious in parameters. However. this is true only if appropriate type of filter and reasonably accurate dominant poles of the system are used in developing the model. An arbitrary choice of filter type and poles may lead to non-parsimonious model. While the selection of the type of filter may be simple if the damping characteristics of the system are known. finding good estimates of the dominant pole(s) of the system is not a trivial task.

Their popularity is due to their simplicity in developing the model. However. they need very large amount of data to reduce variance error. in addition ordinary ARX model structures lead to inconsistent model parameters. Orthonormal Basis Filter (OBF) model structures permit incorporation of prior knowledge of the system in the form of one or more poles. which renders it the capacity to capture the system dynamics with a few number of parameters (parsimonious in parameters). In addition. the resulting OBF models are consistent in parameters. The model parameters can be easily developed using linear least square method. In this study.

Nearly all optimal control design techniques including the widely used model predictive control techniques rely on the use of model of the system to be controlled. There are several linear model structures that are commonly used in control relevant problems in process industries. Some of these model structures are: Auto Regressive with Exogenous Input (ARX). Auto Regressive Moving Average with Exogenous Input (ARMAX). Finite Impulse Response (FIR). Output Error (OE) and Box Jenkins (BJ) models. The selection of the appropriate model structure. among other factors. depend on the consistency of the model parameters. the number of parameters required to describe a system with acceptable accuracy and the computational load in estimating the model parameters.

For this purpose. we propose an anomaly detection system based on adaptive resonance theory (ART) for industrial plants. The feature of the system is that it has several ART systems applied to subsystems of the plant in order to narrow down the cause of the anomalies. This report presents our examination of online anomaly detection tests on whether or not the proposed system is applicable to a distillation tower system. The tests were conducted with experimental equipment of a distillation tower in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP). In the tests. we carried out four cases of anomaly operation (eg. valve sticking and tray upset) that would cause quality or yield losses in the product. By learning normal operation data. the proposed system could detect anomalies in all four cases. and no false positives were observed in normal operation. We also found that the system could narrow down the cause of the anomalies by using the results of each ART system. thereby demonstrating that the system is applicable for the distillation tower system.,True,bGyhUH0AAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC,5,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jcej/50/6/50_16we360/_article/-char/ja/,10767523713896113831,/scholar?cites=10767523713896113831,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jcej/50/6/50_16we360/_pdf,0,0,0

This study conducted closed-loop identification on an Aspen Plus® dynamic simulation based on a pilot-plant distillation column to develop discrete-time linear time-invariant models. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Identification data was generated using set-point perturbations in control variables under proportional-integral control. Identified models were compared with a model identified using open-loop data using 20-step ahead predictions. Findings: Results indicate that closed-loop identification provides more precise prediction models than open-loop identification in this case study. 20-step predictions for closed loop models exceeded 90% fit. whereas the open loop model predictions provided a 70% fit and missed the steady-state values. Application/Improvements: Thus closed-loop identification is more appropriate for applications in model-based controllers.,True,bGyhUH0AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,5,https://www.academia.edu/download/52940590/110383-247907-1-PB_2.pdf,53724590658415450,/scholar?cites=53724590658415450,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52940590/110383-247907-1-PB_2.pdf,0,0,0
1096484,System identification based proxy model of a reservoir under water injection,2017,Berihun M Negash and Lemma D Tufa and M Ramasamy and Mariyamni Bt Awang,2017,Modelling and Simulation in Engineering,,,Hindawi,Simulation of numerical reservoir models with thousands and millions of grid blocks may consume a significant amount of time and effort. even when high performance processors are used. In cases where the simulation runs are required for sensitivity analysis. dynamic control. and optimization. the act needs to be repeated several times by continuously changing parameters. This makes it even more time-consuming. Currently. proxy models that are based on response surface are being used to lessen the time required for running simulations during sensitivity analysis and optimization. Proxy models are lighter mathematical models that run faster and perform in place of heavier models that require large computations. Nevertheless. to acquire data for modeling and validation and develop the proxy model itself. hundreds of simulation runs are required. In this paper. a system identification based proxy model that requires only a single simulation run and a properly designed excitation signal was proposed and evaluated using a benchmark case study. The results show that. with proper design of excitation signal and proper selection of model structure. system identification based proxy models are found to be practical and efficient alternatives for mimicking the performance of numerical reservoir models. The resulting proxy models have potential applications for dynamic well control and optimization.,True,bGyhUH0AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,5,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mse/2017/7645470/abs/,1768713342884595204,/scholar?cites=1768713342884595204,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mse/2017/7645470/abs/,0,0,0

Effects of these issues on the performance of model predictive control in operations in near‐azeotropic regions are investigated. A dynamic model of a pilot‐scale distillation column is simulated and controlled by a linear model predictive controller. As the system moves towards the azeotropic region. the nonlinearity. directionality. and interactions of the system increase. A significant decline is observed in the system control performance since the controller incurs overshoots and offsets for negative and positive setpoint changes. The integral time absolute errors are substantially higher near the azeotropic region.

Furthermore. there is high interest in producing hydrogen from biomass with a view to sustainability. The thermochemical process for hydrogen production. ie gasification. is the focus of this work. This paper discusses the mathematical modeling of hydrogen production process via biomass steam gasification with calcium oxide as sorbent in a gasifier. A modelling framework consisting of kinetics models for char gasification. methanation. Boudouard. methane reforming. water gas shift and carbonation reactions to represent the gasification and CO2 adsorption in the gasifier. is developed and implemented in MATLAB. The scope of the work includes an investigation of the influence of the temperature. steam/biomass ratio and sorbent/biomass ratio on the amount of hydrogen produced. product gas compositions and carbon conversion. The importance of different reactions involved in the process is also discussed. It is observed that hydrogen production and carbon conversion increase with increasing temperature and steam/biomass ratio. The model predicts a maximum hydrogen mole fraction in the product gas of 0.81 occurring at 950 K. steam/biomass ratio of 3.0 and sorbent/biomass ratio of 1.0.

Despite considerable work on advanced multivariable controllers for MIMO systems. multiloop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers remain the standard for many industries because of their adequate performance with most simple. failure tolerant. and easy to understand structure. In a multiloop system. once a control structure is fixed. control performance is then determined mainly by tuning each multiple single-loop PID controller. However. because the interactions that exist between the control loops make the proper tuning of the multiloop PID controllers quite difficult. only a relatively few tuning methods are available to the multiloop PID controllers and most of them require nonanalytical forms with complex iterative steps (Loh et al.. 1993; Luyben. 1986; Skogestad and Morari. 1989). The analytical tuning rule is very attractive. with respect to its practicality. but the mathematical complexity attributed to the loop interactions has mainly prevented the analytical approach to the multiloop systems.In this article. we propose an analytical design method for the multiloop PID controllers to give desired closed-loop responses by extending the generalized IMC–PID method for single input/single output (SISO) systems (Lee et al.. 1998) to MIMO systems. Simple but efficient tuning rules are obtained for general process models by using the frequency-dependent property of the closed-loop interactions.,True,ev4mdPwAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,101,https://www.academia.edu/download/46550802/2004AIChEP1631.pdf,3298209065257899079,/scholar?cites=3298209065257899079,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46550802/2004AIChEP1631.pdf,0,0,0

1096542,A multi-scale orthogonal nonlinear strategy for multi-variate statistical process monitoring,2006,A Maulud and D Wang and JA Romagnoli,16,Journal of process Control,7,671-683,Elsevier,In this paper a multi-scale nonlinear PCA strategy for process monitoring is proposed. The strategy utilizes the optimal wavelet decomposition in such a way that only the approximation and the highest detail functions are used. thus simplifying the overall structure and making the interpretation at each scale more meaningful. An orthogonal nonlinear PCA procedure is incorporated to capture the nonlinear characteristics with a minimum number of principal components. The proposed nonlinear strategy also eliminates the requirement of nonlinear functions relating the nonlinear principal scores to process measurements for Q-statistics as in other nonlinear PCA process monitoring approaches. In addition. the strategy is considerably robust to the presence of typical outliers.,True,yo3xSBQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,59,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959152406000199,9043561331611675280,/scholar?cites=9043561331611675280,,,0,0,0

Malaysia. like other developing nations. has been facing serious problems in recent years in terms of MSW and its management due to the nation’s rapid economic growth. The objective of this paper is to review and present the current state of MSW and its management in Malaysia and to estimate the economic potentials of some recyclables as well. MSW generation in Malaysia has increased significantly in recent years. ranging between 0.5-2.5 kg per capita per day (or a total of 25000-30000 tons per day). Generally. the waste contains high amount of organics. moisture content and bulk density. More than 70% of the generated wastes are collected using both curbside and communal centers with a collection frequency varying from daily to every two days. In addition. both compactor trucks and open lorry trucks are used. Landfilling is the main disposal method practiced; about 90-95% of the collected wastes is still disposed in landfills. with a recycling rate of 5-10% despite the fact that 70-80% of the waste is recyclable. Estimation of the amount of recyclables and their revenue generation potential shows an impressive result.

For the large-scale complex industrial systems. this approach requires extensive computational time. The main aim is to investigate the capability of the proposed decomposition strategy to find optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively low computational effort. The computational results showed that the proposed three-stage decomposition strategy achieves the optimal solutions four times faster than the integrated approach. Also. a sensitivity analysis of emissions cap on the total cost was performed. It was shown that the minimum possible emissions cap (365 t/h) resulted in a 1.2% reduction in total emissions.

1096608,Analysis of Fuel Reduction Strategies for Crude Distillation Unit,2011,NUR IZYAN BINTI ZULKAFLI,,,,,,There is greater awareness today on the depleting fossil energy resources and the growing problem of atmospheric pollution. Engineers are developing practical techniques to ensure energy processes are designed and operated efficiently. Inefficient furnaces and heat exchangers contribute to the problem due to higher fuel demand and higher carbon emission. In crude preheat train (CPT). fouling causes the reduction of heat transfer efficiency. which leads to higher furnace fuel consumption. and exert additional cost for heat exchanger cleaning and lost production. This thesis presents strategies to reduce fuel consumption in the furnace. which will lead to reductions of operational cost and environmental emission. The method of exergy analysis is applied to determine the baseline energy efficiency of the furnace and CPT in a crude distillation unit (CDU). The strategies consist of locating and reducing exergy lost through process modifications of the energy system and developing optimum scheduling for retrofit and/or cleaning of heat exchangers in the CPT. There are two options for achieving fuel savings in the furnace. The options are reduction of heat lost from furnace stack and enhancement of heat recovery in the CPT. The second option involves plant shutdown for overall cleaning of CPT (Case 1). online cleaning of heat exchangers (Case 2) and combined online cleaning with retrofit of high efficiency heat exchangers (Case 3). Reduction of heat loss from furnace stack contributes to the smallest cost saving of 6.44% without carbon credit. With carbon credit. the saving is increased to 6.70%.

Liquefaction design involves multivariable problem solving and non-optimal execution of these variables can waste energy and contribute to process irreversibilities. Design optimization requires these variables to be optimized simultaneously; minimizing the compression energy requirement is selected as the optimization objective. Liquefaction is modeled using Honeywell UniSim Design™ and the resulting rigorous model is connected with the particle swarm paradigm coded in MATLAB. Design constraints are folded into the objective function using the penalty function method.

Ltd,The liquefaction of natural gas (NG) in a mixed refrigerant (MR) system is an energy‐demanding process. Much energy is wasted because of its irreversibilities and its nonoptimal execution. The most important factors affecting this process's performance are the refrigerant's composition and flow rate. the suction and evaporation pressures. and the extent of refrigerant vaporization. They should be adjusted to optimize the overall operation. The adjustment of one of these variables will affect the other because of their highly nonlinear interactions.

In this Perspective. we discuss the potential contribution of carbon capture and utilization (CCU). Owing to the scale and rate of CO 2 production compared to that of utilization allowing long-term sequestration. it is highly improbable the chemical conversion of CO 2 will account for more than 1% of the mitigation challenge. and even a scaled-up enhanced oil recovery (EOR)-CCS industry will likely only account for 4–8%.

In this work. we evaluate the economic feasibility of two ILs synthesized via acid–base neutralization using two scenarios for each: conventional and intensification processing. Based upon our initial models. we determined the cost price of each IL and compared the energy requirements of each process option.

NY: American Institute of Chemical Engineers. 1971-c2002.,This paper describes the problem of production scheduling in the process industries. First. a review of the techniques for optimising production schedules at individual production sites is presented. with an emphasis on formal mathematical methods. Recent extensions to such work have resulted in techniques for both long-term planning of individual facilities and the overall planning of production and distribution in multisite flexible manufacturing systems. A number of challenges arise in such integrated manufacturing problems. Mathematical models of overwhelming size must be avoided and it is very difficult to apply simplistic approaches based on straightforward capacity models when the capacity is flexible and is to be shared between competing products. The recent research in single-and multisite planning will be reviewed. Another important factor. especially when considering longer term planning. is the presence of uncertainty. both with respect to the process (eg rates/processing times and yields) and the market. There have been a number of recent developments in tackling uncertainty in planning and scheduling. either explicitly during planning. or by including a real-time. reactive scheduling capability within the planning function. These will be considered here.

The superstructure encompasses multiple freshwater sources. membrane separation-based partitioning regenerators of the industrially favored ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis. and sinks for incineration and deep ocean discharge. A mixed-integer nonlinear program is formulated based on this superstructure to determine the optimal interconnections in terms of total flowrates and contaminant concentrations.

Acknowledging the shortcomings of deterministic models. this work proposes a hybrid of stochastic programming formulations for an optimal midterm refinery planning that addresses three factors of uncertainties. namely price of crude oil and saleable products. product demand. and production yields. An explicit stochastic programming technique is utilized by employing compensating slack variables to account for violations of constraints in order to increase model tractability. Four approaches are considered to ensure both solution and model robustness: (1) the Markowitz’s mean–variance (MV) model to handle randomness in the objective coefficients of prices by minimizing variance of the expected value of the random coefficients; (2) the two-stage stochastic programming with fixed recourse approach via scenario analysis to model randomness in the right-hand side and left-hand side coefficients by minimizing the expected recourse penalty costs due to constraints’ violations; (3) incorporation of the MV model within the framework developed in Approach 2 to minimize both the expectation and variance of the recourse costs; and (4) reformulation of the model in Approach 3 by adopting mean-absolute deviation (MAD) as the risk metric imposed by the recourse costs for a novel application to the petroleum refining industry.

Therefore. to minimize errors. the gasification of dry refinery sludge (DRS) is carried out in adiabatic system at atmospheric pressure under ambient air conditions. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the physical and chemical energy and exergy of product gas at different equivalent ratios (ER). It will also be used to determine whether the cold gas. exergy. and energy efficiencies of gases may be maximized by using secondary air injected to gasification zone under various ratios (0. 0.5. 1. and 1.5) at optimum ER of 0.195. From the results obtained. it is indicated that the chemical energy and exergy of producer gas are magnified by 5 and 10 times higher than their corresponding physical values. respectively. The cold gas. energy. and exergy efficiencies of DRS gasification are in the ranges of 22.9–55.5%. 43.7–72.4%. and 42.5–50.4%. respectively. Initially. all 3 efficiencies increase until they reach a maximum at the optimum ER of 0.195; thereafter. they decline with further increase in ER values.

Urea. when applied to crops is vulnerable to losses from volatilization and leaching. Current methods also reduce nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by plants which limits crop yields and. moreover. contributes towards environmental pollution in terms of hazardous gaseous emissions and water eutrophication. An approach that offsets this pollution while also enhancing NUE is the use of controlled release urea (CRU) for which several methods and materials have been reported.

1096718,Simulation of friction stir spot welding (FSSW) process: study of friction phenomena,2007,Mokhtar Awang,,,,,,In this research work. a finite element analysis has been conducted using Abaqus/Explicit codes. The main reason why the explicit formulation is chosen as opposed to implicit is that the modeling of FSSW process required the solutions in a short simulation time efficiently. The Abaqus/Explicit formulations are well-suited to solving high-speed dynamic events that require many small increments to obtain a high-resolution solution [52]. Moreover. contact conditions and other extremely discontinuous events are readily formulated in the explicit method and can be enforced on a node-by-node basis without iteration.The term “explicit” in the FE method refers to the fact that the state at the end of the increment is based exclusively on the displacements. velocities. and accelerations at the beginning of the increment. Generally. the time increments in explicit formulation are quite small in order to produce accurate results. Therefore. it requires a lot of increments so that the accelerations during an increment are nearly constant. Even though it requires a lot of increments in the analysis. each increment in explicit formulation is inexpensive since there are no simultaneous equations need to be solved.

The characterization of physical properties of the synthesized adhesives was carried out by determining the effect of temperature. shear rate. and mass concentration of thickener/stabilizer on the complex viscosity. density. and surface tension. In later stage. phenomenological analyses of spray jet breakup of heated complexes were performed in still air. Using a high speed digital camera. the jet breakup dynamics were visualized as a function of the system input parameters. The further analysis of the grabbed images confirmed the strong influence of the input processing parameters on full cone spray patternation. It was also predicted that the heated starch adhesive solutions generate a dispersed spray pattern by utilizing the partial evaporation of the spraying medium. Below 40°C of heating temperature. the radial spray cone width and angle did not vary significantly with increasing Reynolds and Weber numbers at early injection phases leading to increased macroscopic spray propagation.

Results showed that water penetration in the coating took place sooner and faster than that in the fertilizers.

1096731,An algorithmic framework for multiobjective optimization,2013,T Ganesan and I Elamvazuthi and Ku Zilati Ku Shaari and P Vasant,2013,The Scientific World Journal,,,Hindawi,Multiobjective (MO) optimization is an emerging field which is increasingly being encountered in many fields globally. Various metaheuristic techniques such as differential evolution (DE). genetic algorithm (GA). gravitational search algorithm (GSA). and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been used in conjunction with scalarization techniques such as weighted sum approach and the normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method to solve MO problems. Nevertheless. many challenges still arise especially when dealing with problems with multiple objectives (especially in cases more than two). In addition. problems with extensive computational overhead emerge when dealing with hybrid algorithms. This paper discusses these issues by proposing an alternative framework that utilizes algorithmic concepts related to the problem structure for generating efficient and effective algorithms.

The nanotube was assumed to be a frame-like structure with bonds between atoms regarded as beam elements. The properties of the beam required for input into the finite element analysis were computed by connecting energy equivalence between molecular and continuum mechanics. Simulation was conducted by applying axial tensile strain on one end of the nanotube while the other end was fixed and the corresponding reaction force recorded to compute Young’s modulus. It was found out that Young’s modulus of zirconia nanotubes is significantly affected by some geometrical parameters such as chirality. diameter. thickness. and length. The obtained values of Young’s modulus for a certain range of diameters are in agreement with what was obtained in the few experiments that have been conducted so far. This study was conducted on the cubic phase of zirconia having armchair and zigzag configuration. The optimal diameter and thickness were obtained. which will assist in designing and fabricating bulk nanostructured components containing zirconia nanotubes for various applications.,True,hOxIVKsAAAAJ:inmFHauC9wsC,13,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2015/157423/abs/,14447007398842583007,/scholar?cites=14447007398842583007,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2015/157423/abs/,0,0,0

1096745,Profit optimization of a refrigerated gas plant,2007,Nooryusmiza Yusoff and Marappagounder Ramasamy and Suzana Yusup,,,,227-232,,The operation of a gas processing plant with tight profit margin and rigid contractual constraints at both ends poses a challenging problem. The problem is further compounded by continuous fluctuations in the feed compositions and economic conditions of the plant. To widen its profit margin. the plant needs to operate more efficiently. This requires continuous re-evaluation of the operating conditions through an efficient optimization algorithm. The success of solving the optimization problem rests on the accuracy of the plant model used. as well as the inclusion of technical and business aspects of the plant operation. This paper proposes means for optimizing a refrigerated gas plant (RGP) based on a steady-state simulation model. The RGP is simulated using AspenTech HYSYS and calibrated with the actual plant data. Key optimization variables are prudently identified in order to induce maximization of a profit function. Four case studies namely the base case (1B). one-feed (1F). two-feed (2F) and three-feed (3F) inlet streams are carried out. As compared with Case 1B. the profit margins rise by 9.3%. 12.3% and 13.4% for Cases 1F. 2F and 3F. respectively. It is observed that the best option for this RGP is to focus on balancing the feed gas supplies while respecting the plant constraints. In addition. it is found that optimizing utility consumption results in insignificant savings. The utilities only contribute less than 2.4% of the total expenses in all four case studies.,True,B7BgYPEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,6,https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/2mu4p/download#page=244,11546657991751100449,/scholar?cites=11546657991751100449,,https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/2mu4p/download#page=244,0,0,0

At the top layer. a dynamic model of RGP is subjected to scheduling of plant operating mode from natural gas liquids to sales gas. and vice-versa. Setpoints from scheduling are passed to the steady-state RTO layer. Optimal trajectories of setpoints are obtained using sequential quadratic programming algorithm with constraints. These trajectories are disjointedly implemented by model predictive control (MPC) scheme and proportional-integral (PI) controllers for comparison. Four case studies for each mode scheduling are performed to illustrate efficacy of the proposed approach.,True,B7BgYPEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7fa9/3ea130cc8271055b3b462bc2b1463b108ba6.pdf,5649401785282943335,/scholar?cites=5649401785282943335,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7fa9/3ea130cc8271055b3b462bc2b1463b108ba6.pdf,0,0,0
1096752,An integrated approach for scheduling and real-time optimization in a refrigerated gas plant,2009,Nooryusmiza Yusoff,,,,,,A refrigerated gas plant (RGP) faces operational challenges on three fronts namely: 1) at inlet. multiple feed gas streams are mixed causing fluctuation in flow and composition; 2) within RGP. unscheduled shutdowns due to equipment malfunction often occur; 3) at outlet. strict product specifications are enforced by its customers. In business aspect. RGP enters into diverse agreements with producers. Prices of feed gas vary depending upon quality of gas and tenure of contracts. Prices of liquids namely ethane. propane. butane and condensates are floated to market values. In contrast. price of sales gas is tightly regulated by government.These challenges forces RGP to improve its efficiency in order to sustain profitability. An identified area of improvement is during operational planning. This type of planning poses a short-term and continuous scheduling problem in which preconfigured setpoints are directly implemented by regulatory controllers. While this practice is currently accepted. economic benefits can be further realized by frequent reevaluation of plant states through real-time optimization (RTO). Since scheduling is performed at a much larger time-scale (days-weeks) as compared with RTO (hours-days) and control (seconds-minutes). integration of these three automation layers is difficult. This thesis proposes an integrated framework of scheduling and RTO of the RGP. At top layer. a dynamic model of RGP is subjected to three types of scheduling problems namely input. load. and mode. Input scheduling refers to mixing of certain fractions of lean and rich feed gas streams at normal plant load of 280 ton/h. Load scheduling refers to varying …,True,B7BgYPEAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,1,http://utpedia.utp.edu.my/id/eprint/8060,2948794750005616875,/scholar?cites=2948794750005616875,,http://utpedia.utp.edu.my/8060/1/2009-An%20Integrated%20Approach%20For%20Scheduling%20And%20Real-Time%20Optimization%20In%20a%20Refrigerated%20Gas%20Plant.pdf,0,0,0

About 22 wt% of paddy is RH. which is normally disposed of by open burning. Pelletizing RH increases the bulk density of the waste and is capable of providing benefits such as ease of transport and potentially a more efficient fuel for combustion. This will allow for RH to be utilized for more meaningful applications instead of just being burnt. However. one of the main challenges of producing RH pellets is their low durability. causing pellets to be broken into fines and dust during transportation and thus making them unattractive to potential buyers. This work aims to investigate suitable locally-sourced biomass waste as binder compounds that could improve the mechanical durability of RH pellets.

Enhancing the performance of heat transfer device is a continues effort. Thus. this study investigates the effect of copper nanofluid on the thermal performance of cylindrical heat pipe (HP) that has screen mesh wick for heat transfer applications. The copper HP consists of 350 mm length and 12.7 mm outside diameter. To investigate its thermal performance mathematical model is developed. Demineralized water based 20 nm copper nanofluids with 0 to 4% particle concentrations were considered in the study. Simulation was done at 100 W heat input and results showed that when the particle concentration increases the evaporator wall temperature drops. At 4% particle concentration nanofluid the HP thermal resistance reduced by 17.5% compared to when the HP uses demineralized water. Furthermore. for a given particle concentration as the heat input increases the temperature change between the evaporator and the condenser increases.

The concentration of MDEA was kept constant at 30 wt% in every hybrid solvent investigated. The solubility of CO 2 in the hybrid solvent was investigated by varying the concentration of [bmim][Ac] in the aqueous hybrid solvent as 10 wt% and 20 wt%. For comparison. the solubility experiment was also conducted for pure aqueous MDEA solvent. Addition of [bmim][Ac] in the hybrid solvent reasonably enhanced the solubility of CO 2 as compared to its solubility in pure aqueous MDEA solvent. The loading capacity of hybrid solvent was also improved significantly with hybrid solvents. Further increasing the concentration of [bmim][Ac] from 10 wt% to 20 wt% has demonstrated a decrease in the solubility of CO 2 into the hybrid solvent. The effect of pressure on loading capacity and rate of absorption was also investigated by increasing the pressure from 10 bar to 20 bar.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Miscible gas injection (MGI) processes such as miscible CO2 flooding have been in use as attractive EOR options. especially in conventional oil reserves. Optimal design of MGI is strongly dependent on parameters such as gas–oil minimum miscibility pressure (MMP). which is normally determined through expensive and time‐consuming laboratory tests. Thus. developing a fast and reliable technique to predict gas–oil MMP is inevitable. To address this issue. a smart model is developed in this paper to forecast gas–oil MMP on the basis of a feed‐forward artificial neural network (FF‐ANN) combined with particle swarm optimisation (PSO). The MMP of a reservoir fluid was considered as a function of reservoir temperature and the compositions of oil and injected gas in the proposed model.

Which is the wastage of energy as it is required for cooling in summer and for heating in winters. So it is desired that we must use the renewable sources of energy for this purpose and geothermal energy may be one of the suitable energy source. Geothermal energy is the energy stored in the earth which is received by earth directly from sun and produced by the slow decay of radioactive substances present in the earth’s crust. Further the temperature of earth in depths is almost remains constant in all seasons. So this constant temperature can be utilised for air conditioning in the buildings. This paper presents the possibilities of geothermal energy uses for the air conditioning of buildings. The use of geothermal energy in air conditioning replaces the amount of energy (electricity) required to produce the heat. Use of this energy also minimises the production of greenhouse gases.,True,9amPt4YAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/31646207/7._Scope_of_geothermal_energy_-_full.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31646207/7._Scope_of_geothermal_energy_-_full.pdf,0,0,0

However. the reactor is shut down at the onset of LOCA along with coolant injection from ECCS to remove the decay heat of 2–3% of nominal power. Further postulation of failure of ECCS leads to rapid increase in the temperature of fuel pins and the coolant channel as well. The moderator present around coolant channels limits the rise in temperature. The assessment of temperature distribution in the fuel pins of the bundles of a channel under high temperature is quite important from hydrogen generation and fission product release point of view. A pseudo steady state experiment has been carried out to obtain the temperature distribution of different components of a simulated coolant channel for large capacity Indian pressurized heavy water reactor.

1096864,Review of Solar PV Market Development in East Africa,2014,Ulrich Elmer Hansen and Mathilde Brix Pedersen and Ivan Nygaard,,,,,UNEP Risø Centre Working paper series. no. 12. UNEP Risø Centre. Technical University of Denmark,While the diffusion of solar home systems in Kenya has been market-based for some years. the diffusion of PV in most other Sub-Saharan African countries has been driven by government and donor-supported projects aimed at serving specific needs for electricity while at the same time creating a national niche market for PV. This practice is rapidly changing and. as in industrialised countries. there is evidence of a transition towards more market-based diffusion and private-sector involvement for PV systems for private consumers. institutions and villages. This transition has been facilitated to varying degrees by conducive enabling frameworks comprising innovative financing schemes. exemptions from VAT and import taxes. standardised power-purchasing agreements and feed-in tariffs. Few analyses have so far been conducted on the effects of such measures. This paper aims to contribute to understanding these effects by reviewing the development of markets for solar PV in Kenya. Tanzania and Uganda. focusing on how the differences in market development have been explained in the literature. The paper finds that. although Tanzania and Uganda are rapidly catching up.

1096865,The compatibility of rural electrification and promotion of low-carbon technologies in developing countries-the case of Solar PV for Sub-Saharan Africa,2009,Ivan Nygaard,3,European Review of Energy Markets,2,1-34,Claeys and Casteels bvba,Climate change is a major concern. and climate change mitigation measures are currently high on the policy agenda. In 2007 the European Union (EU) made decisions both on binding targets to be reached by 2020 for CO2 emissions and for a minimum share of energy consumption produced by renewable energy. Increased access to electricity is a major concern for socio-economic development in developing countries. not least in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). where only 8 percent of the population has access to electricity. Using solar photovoltaic (PV) in SSA as a case. this paper explores to what extent the objectives of increased access to electricity in rural areas is compatible with low-carbon technologies. Solar PV systems have been disseminated in SSA for almost 30 years. resulting in more than half a million installations concentrated in a few countries. Despite this apparent success. solar PV has been criticized for being expensive. fragile and limited to non-productive uses. If expectations of future oil prices exceeding twice the level experienced from 1985 to 2003 are confirmed. we may see a more positive attitude emerge. and we might expect solar PV to fulfil an important niche for populations living in dispersed settlements outside the reach of grid electrification. Based on a literature review and the author’s experience in Burkina Faso. the article provides an assessment of various delivery models for individual solar PV systems. and discusses their strengths and weaknesses.,True,mFBThlYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,43,http://www.eeinstitute.org/european-review-of-energy-market/EREM_8-_Article_Nygaard.pdf,1302644457453545310,/scholar?cites=1302644457453545310,,http://www.eeinstitute.org/european-review-of-energy-market/EREM_8-_Article_Nygaard.pdf,0,0,0

Good action plans must be based on a sound analysis of the barriers to technology transfer and examination of the measures that might help overcome these barriers. This publication provides guidance on how to conduct such analysis.Although the main audience is national TNA teams and their consultants. the guidebook should be useful to anyone interested in seeing climate relevant technologies adopted more widely. Acknowledging that most technology transfer and diffusion processes take place without direct government intervention. the guidebook focuses on how governments can accelerate these processes through various policy measures. The guidebook thus aims to engage analysts and policymakers in the often messy process of technology transfer by suggesting a flexible and participatory approach. one that builds links between international experience and local stakeholder knowledge.,True,mFBThlYAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,40,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13799136.pdf,11178380681131962367,/scholar?cites=11178380681131962367,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13799136.pdf,0,0,0

A Renewable Energy Act approved in 2011 seeks to encourage the influx of renewable energy sources in Ghana's energy mix. The new legal framework combined with increasing demand for energy has created an opportunity for dramatic changes in the way energy is generated in Ghana. However. the impending changes and their implication remain uncertain. This paper examines the extent to which future energy scenarios in Ghana could rely on energy from biomass sources. through the production of biogas. liquid biofuels and electricity.

The paper’s analytical focus is on how niche actors are influencing and creating change in the incumbent electrification regime of grid extension to strengthen and expand the niche for private mini-grids.

1096878,Prospects for investment in large-scale. grid-connected solar power in Africa,2014,Ulrich Elmer Hansen and Ivan Nygaard and Mathilde Brix,,,,,UNEP Risø Centre,We are currently observing a shift in the African PV sector away from mainly donor-driven projects towards market-driven investments in PV in all market segments. This transition is stimulated on the one hand by rising oil prices and a substantial reduction in the cost of PV panels during the last decade. which has significantly improved the competitiveness of PV. and on the other hand by conducive enabling frameworks comprising innovative financing schemes. exemptions from VAT and import taxes. standardised power-purchasing agreements and feed-in tariffs. In particular. the market for large-scale. grid-connected PV plants is rapidly emerging throughout Africa. as production costs are currently competitive with large-scale diesel. This development towards the market-based diffusion of PV therefore also marks a movement from mainly small-scale and off-grid PV installations to larger scale grid-connected PV with increased capital intensity (Hansen et al. 2014). In parallel with this movement. a market for another large scale solar power technology. concentrating solar power (CSP) has been developed especially in Spain. but also lately in South Africa and Morocco. with the effect that also the cost of CSP is being reduced. and currently competitive with PV under certain conditions.Hence although large-scale and market-driven investments in renewable energy and local industry development in a high-tech sector is not something one typically associates with Africa. this is nevertheless what we are seeing emerge in the case of solar power.

The aim of this thesis was to establish the technical potential of biomass for second generation biofuels production in Ghana; examine the extent to which the available biomass could contribute to future energy scenarios and analyse ex-ante socio-economic impacts of biomass energy systems using relevant case studies. The thesis found that the technical potential of bioenergy from agricultural residues. livestock manure. municipal solid waste and wood residues was approximately 275 PJ in 2011 alone. By 2030. the potential biomass available could gross over 900 PJ. Generating 4.0% of total electricity from biomass and replacing approximately 20% of transport fuels in 2030 with biofuels could reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by about 6 million tonnes of CO2eq by 2030. equivalent to about 14% reduction relative to emissions from a business-as-usual scenario. A gradual household switch to biogas for cooking. as well as the increased use of more efficient charcoal carbonisation technologies and improved cookstoves could save 138 PJ of woodfuels by the same 2030.

Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,Hocb-jkAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C,496,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

It is important to integrate the anticipated changes into the design of urban drainage in response to the increased risk level in cities. This paper presents a pluvial flood risk assessment framework to identify and assess adaptation options in the urban context. An integrated approach is adopted by incorporating climate change impact assessment. flood inundation modeling. economic tool. and risk assessment. hereby developing a step-by-step process for cost-benefit assessment of climate change adaptation measures.

Although climate change seems marginal compared to the pressing issues of poverty alleviation and economic development. it is becoming clear that the realisation of development goals may be hampered by climate change. However. development can be shaped in such a way as to achieve its goals and at the same time reduce vulnerability to climate change. thereby facilitating sustainable development that realises economic. social. local and global environmental goals. This approach has been coined the ‘development first approach’. in which a future climate regime should focus on development strategies with ancillary climate benefits and increase the capability of developing countries to implement these.

The SD dimension is not merely a requirement of the CDM; it should be seen as a main driver for developing country interest in participating in CDM projects. This is so. since apart from GHG emission reductions CDM projects will have a number of impacts in the host countries. including impacts on economic and social development and on the local environment. Furthermore. the selecting of the SD criteria and the assessment of the SD impacts are sovereign matters of the host countries in the current operationalisation of the Kyoto Protocol. National authorities can thus use the SD dimension to evaluate key linkages between national development goals and CDM projects. with the aim of selecting and designing CDM projects so that they create and maximise synergies with local development goals.

1096905,Costing methodologies,2000,Anil Markandya and K Halsnaes,,Guidance Papers on the Cross Cutting Issues of the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC,,15-31,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Geneva. Switzerland,The costs of climate change policies are estimated and their implications discussed in many parts of the IPCC’s Assessment Report. The use of consistent cost concepts across the TAR is important. in order to facilitate comparability across different cost assessment approaches. In this guidance paper. we propose a set of definitions for the different concepts and present a relation between them. We suggest that. in every case where costs are referred to. authors make clear which cost concept or concepts they are using. The paper also identifies categories of costs and their relevance in the climate change area. We also suggest that authors use this as a checklist when estimating or referring to the costs of certain measures. Finally. the paper discusses the relationship between cost concepts and baselines. Again. authors are recommended to make clear what cost assumptions underlie the baselines they use. Further details of these concepts can be found in Christensen.

1096906,Sustainable development and climate change: lessons from country studies,2008,Kirsten Halsnæs and PR Shukla and Amit Garg,8,Climate Policy,2,202-219,Taylor & Francis Group,Sustainable development has been suggested as a framework for integrating development and climate change policies in developing countries. Mainstreaming climate change into sustainable development policies would allow these countries to achieve their development goals while addressing climate change. A number of research programmes have investigated how potential synergies could be achieved at national level and what kind of trade-offs between the various aspects of sustainable development have to be faced. An overview of these studies is provided. focusing on national case studies. The energy and transportation sectors are covered in many studies. but some attention is also given to the infrastructure sector and water supply. Most existing development policies will not lead to a sustainable development pattern. since they insufficiently address climate change.

National study results are discussed in relation to expected general international development trends in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries certainly will increase in the future due to economic development needs. There is however a large and relatively cheap potential for emission reductions connected to efficiency improvements in industrial production and general energy efficiency improvements in the countries. The implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies is interrelated with general national economic development policies.

Two basic approaches to CCS are available.1.2 In one approach. CO2 is captured directly from the industrial source. concentrated into a nearly pure form. and then pumped deep underground for long-term storage (see Figure 1). As an alternative to storage in underground geological formations. it has also been suggested that CO2 could be stored in the ocean. This could be done either by dissolving it in the mid-depth ocean (1–3 km) or by forming pools of CO2 on the sea bottom where the ocean is deeper than 3 km and. consequently. CO2 is denser than seawater. The second approach to CCS captures CO2directly from the atmosphere by enhancing natural biological processes that sequester CO2 in plants. soils. and marine sediments.

To mark the 10-year anniversary and as a contribution to the United Nations Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit, this publication revisits the gap rationale and how it has evolved, comparing the expectations following the Copenhagen Accord with the reality 10 years later. The findings are sobering. Despite a decade of increasing political and societal focus on climate change and the milestone Paris Agreement, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not been curbed, and the emissions gap is larger than ever. The challenges for the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit and for international climate change negotiations in 2019 are clear. Unless mitigation ambition and action increase substantially and immediately in the form of new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 2020 and are reflected in ambitious long-term GHG development strategies, exceeding the 1.5° C goal can no longer be avoided, and achieving the well-below 2° C temperature goal becomes increasingly challenging.

In addition. it states that the developing countries may propose projects for financing with an estimate of the incremental costs and benefits of reducing emissions.

In contrast this paper adopts a regional perspective by reviewing developments in supportive policies. donor programs and diffusion status in all PV market segments in Kenya. Tanzania and Uganda. as well as identifying the key factors put forward in the literature to explain differences in the diffusion of SHS in these three countries. The paper finds two emerging trends: (i) a movement from donor and government-based support to market-driven diffusion of solar PV; and (ii) a transition from small-scale. off-grid systems towards mini-grids and large-scale. grid-connected solar power plants.

1096938,Review of Solar PV market development in East Africa,2014,Ulrich Elmer Hansen and Mathilde Brix Pedersen and Ivan Nygaard,,"UNEP Risø Centre, Technical University of Denmark: Kongens Lyngby, Denmark",,,,While the diffusion of solar home systems in Kenya has been market-based for some years. the diffusion of PV in most other Sub-Saharan African countries has been driven by government and donor-supported projects aimed at serving specific needs for electricity while at the same time creating a national niche market for PV. This practice is rapidly changing and. as in industrialised countries. there is evidence of a transition towards more market-based diffusion and private-sector involvement for PV systems for private consumers. institutions and villages. This transition has been facilitated to varying degrees by conducive enabling frameworks comprising innovative financing schemes. exemptions from VAT and import taxes. standardised power-purchasing agreements and feed-in tariffs. Few analyses have so far been conducted on the effects of such measures. This paper aims to contribute to understanding these effects by reviewing the development of markets for solar PV in Kenya. Tanzania and Uganda. focusing on how the differences in market development have been explained in the literature. The paper finds that. although Tanzania and Uganda are rapidly catching up. Kenya is still leading the development of PV markets not only in terms of installed capacity and market volume. but also with regard to local industry and PV business development. The paper concludes by drawing attention to particular factors that have been used in the literature to explain disparities in market-development trajectories in the three countries.,True,qPsug3oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,47,https://www.academia.edu/download/53741569/Working_paper_Solar_PV_East_Africa.pdf,18171737913745764665,/scholar?cites=18171737913745764665,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53741569/Working_paper_Solar_PV_East_Africa.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,The goal of providing universal energy access to all by 2030 under the UN‐led SE4ALL initiative calls for new and innovative solutions to rural electrification and is fuelling the recent interest in mini‐grids. Mini‐grid solutions are emerging as a third alternative to rural electrification. coming between the option of large‐scale grid extension and pico‐scale stand‐alone solutions like solar home systems or solar lanterns. International expectations of mini‐grids are high. with the International Energy Agency suggesting that they will play a significant role in reaching the goal of universal access. Based on a detailed review of past. ongoing. and planned mini‐grids in East Africa. this study seeks to deconstructs the popular notion of mini‐grids for rural electrification in East Africa.

This issue is explored by examining so-called ‘technology action plans (TAPs)’. which were main outputs of the Technology Needs Assessment project implemented in 10 African countries from 2010 to 2013. The paper provides a review of three distinct but characteristic trajectories for PV market development in Kenya (private-led market for solar home systems). Morocco (utility-led fee-for service model) and Rwanda (donor-led market for institutional systems).

The paper’s analytical focus is on how niche actors are influencing and creating change in the incumbent electrification regime of grid extension to strengthen and expand the niche for private mini-grids. The analysis shows that. in addition to internal niche processes like the alignment of expectations. learning and network building. niche actors actively engage in various forms of institutional work.

1096942,Prospects for investment in large-scale. grid-connected solar power in Africa,2014,Ulrich Elmer Hansen and Ivan Nygaard and Mathilde Brix,,,,,UNEP Risø Centre,We are currently observing a shift in the African PV sector away from mainly donor-driven projects towards market-driven investments in PV in all market segments. This transition is stimulated on the one hand by rising oil prices and a substantial reduction in the cost of PV panels during the last decade. which has significantly improved the competitiveness of PV. and on the other hand by conducive enabling frameworks comprising innovative financing schemes. exemptions from VAT and import taxes. standardised power-purchasing agreements and feed-in tariffs. In particular. the market for large-scale. grid-connected PV plants is rapidly emerging throughout Africa. as production costs are currently competitive with large-scale diesel. This development towards the market-based diffusion of PV therefore also marks a movement from mainly small-scale and off-grid PV installations to larger scale grid-connected PV with increased capital intensity (Hansen et al. 2014). In parallel with this movement. a market for another large scale solar power technology. concentrating solar power (CSP) has been developed especially in Spain. but also lately in South Africa and Morocco. with the effect that also the cost of CSP is being reduced. and currently competitive with PV under certain conditions.Hence although large-scale and market-driven investments in renewable energy and local industry development in a high-tech sector is not something one typically associates with Africa. this is nevertheless what we are seeing emerge in the case of solar power.

However. as the ‘private model’ covers many different ways of doing business. this paper seeks to broaden our understanding of its complexities. This is done by using insights into organisational hybridity as a defining characteristic of organisations that have a dual mission consisting of social and economic aims and by applying the analytical concept of institutional logics. The paper explores how four different mini-grid firms in Kenya draw on both a commercial logic and a social welfare logic in their everyday operational activities in order to achieve their goals.

1096953,Deconstructing the concept of renewable energy-based mini-grids for rural,2015,Mathilde Brix Pedersen,5,Soc Sci,,45-54,,The goal of providing universal energy access to all by 2030 under the UN-led SE4ALL initiative calls for new and innovative solutions to rural electrification and is fuelling the recent interest in mini-grids. Mini-grid solutions are emerging as a third alternative to rural electrification. coming between the option of large-scale grid extension and pico-scale stand-alone solutions like solar home systems (SHS) or solar lanterns. International expectations of mini-grids are high. with the International Energy Agency suggesting that they will play a significant role in reaching the goal of universal access. Based on a detailed review of past. ongoing and planned mini-grids in East Africa. this paper seeks to deconstructs the popular notion of mini-grids for rural electrification in East-Africa. The paper reveals that so far activities carried out under the heading of mini-grids to a large extent consist of the hybridisation of existing utility-owned electricity systems for medium-size towns located far from the grid. which does not necessarily contribute to rural electrification. On the other hand. limited but increasing activity is identified regarding the use of mini-grids to bring electricity to rural villages and smaller rural towns. This is of specific interest because it is for this type of mini-grid that the main challenges are to be found with respect to identifying and testing adequate financing. ownership and business models. Based on the trajectories identified for mini-grids for rural electrification and the challenges identified in the literature. the paper concludes by proposing three avenues for further research.,True,qPsug3oAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83998675.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83998675.pdf,0,0,0

About 25 years down the line. Ghana seems to be inching closer toward universal electrification. However. a number of challenges remain. As is the case in many other countries. urban communities have greater access to the national electricity grid than rural communities. Also. electricity generation in the country has not matched demand. This has resulted in load shedding/power rationing that has become the bane of the power sector in Ghana. negatively impacting all sectors of the economy and leading to economic losses. The low generation capacity is partly due to poor fuel supply to existing thermal power plants. meaning that installed capacity is often not available for use.

1096964,An assessment of Thailand’s biofuel development,2013,S Kumar and P Abdul Salam and Pujan Shrestha and Emmanuel Kofi Ackom,5,Sustainability,4,1577-1597,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The paper provides an assessment of first generation biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) development in Thailand in terms of feedstock used. production trends. planned targets and policies and discusses the biofuel sustainability issues—environmental. socio-economic and food security aspects. The policies. measures and incentives for the development of biofuel include targets. blending mandates and favorable tax schemes to encourage production and consumption of biofuels. Biofuel development improves energy security. rural income and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. but issues related to land and water use and food security are important considerations to be addressed for its large scale application. Second generation biofuels derived from agricultural residues perform favorably on environmental and social sustainability issues in comparison to first generation biofuel sources. The authors estimate that sustainably-derived agricultural crop residues alone could amount to 10.4× 10 6 bone dry tonnes per year. This has the technical potential of producing 1.14–3.12 billion liters per year of ethanol to possibly displace between 25%–69% of Thailand’s 2011 gasoline consumption as transportation fuel. Alternatively. the same amount of residue could provide 0.8–2.1 billion liters per year of diesel (biomass to Fischer-Tropsch diesel) to potentially offset 6%–15% of national diesel consumption in the transportation sector.

The existing energy insecurity dilemma. where demand for energy is desperately needed for sustainable development leaves Ghana with no other option than to exploit its renewable energy resources. The study seeks to address three main research questions:(a) Are Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) technically and economically viable in Ghana?;(b) Can RE projects be self sustained in Ghana without continual external support?;(c) Can RETs be used as an engine for local development? Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed in addressing the research questions. The four main RE resources identified in Ghana are biomass. solar. small hydro and wind energy.

In this paper. by exploiting the dynamic regulating ability of hydropower and energy intensive controllable load to reduce the power output uncertainties. an optimal wind-solar capacity allocation method is proposed. The power regulation characteristics of hydropower stations based on hydraulic head and energy intensive controllable load based on complex production process are modelled. A bi-level (including planning and operation layers) optimization model for wind-solar capacity allocation is proposed. which is subject to the system dynamic regulation constraints. In the planning layer. a cost function model is constructed to minimize the investment and operational cost of the hybrid system with wind-solar. hydropower and energy …,True,2uR9920AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9114968/,17021593602799532181,/scholar?cites=17021593602799532181,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/8948470/09114968.pdf,0,0,0

Analogous to crude oil refinery where several hydrocarbon products are obtained from petroleum. a suite of products are derived from wood in the forest biorefinery. Forest products. unlike a petroleum refinery. often come from distinct mills that operate independently from each other. compared to the latter where all products are often processed in the same facility (Table 5.1). A result of integrated forest biorefinery. however. is the production within the same facility of traditional products in addition to new products that are typically derived from fossil fuels (Table 5.1). These products. for example plastics are currently used in applications such as packaging. automobiles and consumer electronic goods that must comply with stringent regulations on a lifecycle perspective.

Sustaining the lead firm position was. however. challenged by difficulties in developing innovative capability. Drawing on the literature on (i) firm-level technological capability and (ii) knowledge transfer in international acquisitions. we explain the reasons for insufficient innovative capability building.

1096989,Review of Solar PV market development in East Africa,2014,Ulrich Elmer Hansen and Mathilde Brix Pedersen and Ivan Nygaard,,"UNEP Risø Centre, Technical University of Denmark: Kongens Lyngby, Denmark",,,,While the diffusion of solar home systems in Kenya has been market-based for some years. the diffusion of PV in most other Sub-Saharan African countries has been driven by government and donor-supported projects aimed at serving specific needs for electricity while at the same time creating a national niche market for PV. This practice is rapidly changing and. as in industrialised countries. there is evidence of a transition towards more market-based diffusion and private-sector involvement for PV systems for private consumers. institutions and villages. This transition has been facilitated to varying degrees by conducive enabling frameworks comprising innovative financing schemes. exemptions from VAT and import taxes. standardised power-purchasing agreements and feed-in tariffs. Few analyses have so far been conducted on the effects of such measures. This paper aims to contribute to understanding these effects by reviewing the development of markets for solar PV in Kenya. Tanzania and Uganda. focusing on how the differences in market development have been explained in the literature. The paper finds that. although Tanzania and Uganda are rapidly catching up. Kenya is still leading the development of PV markets not only in terms of installed capacity and market volume. but also with regard to local industry and PV business development.

This discussion falls at the intersection of several literatures within innovation studies and development studies. It requires a combination of ideas from across several academic fields of study. This paper focuses on value chain linkages and interactive learning. Because this is largely unexplored terrain. the paper seeks to provide conceptual framing based on insights from the literature and it discusses whether linkages within the global South offer specific advantages over North–South linkages. It then uses this conceptual framing to draw insights from the case of renewable electrification with wind and solar PV in Kenya.

1097001,Prospects for investment in large-scale. grid-connected solar power in Africa,2014,Ulrich Elmer Hansen and Ivan Nygaard and Mathilde Brix,,,,,UNEP Risø Centre,We are currently observing a shift in the African PV sector away from mainly donor-driven projects towards market-driven investments in PV in all market segments. This transition is stimulated on the one hand by rising oil prices and a substantial reduction in the cost of PV panels during the last decade. which has significantly improved the competitiveness of PV. and on the other hand by conducive enabling frameworks comprising innovative financing schemes. exemptions from VAT and import taxes. standardised power-purchasing agreements and feed-in tariffs. In particular. the market for large-scale. grid-connected PV plants is rapidly emerging throughout Africa. as production costs are currently competitive with large-scale diesel. This development towards the market-based diffusion of PV therefore also marks a movement from mainly small-scale and off-grid PV installations to larger scale grid-connected PV with increased capital intensity (Hansen et al. 2014). In parallel with this movement. a market for another large scale solar power technology. concentrating solar power (CSP) has been developed especially in Spain. but also lately in South Africa and Morocco. with the effect that also the cost of CSP is being reduced. and currently competitive with PV under certain conditions.Hence although large-scale and market-driven investments in renewable energy and local industry development in a high-tech sector is not something one typically associates with Africa. this is nevertheless what we are seeing emerge in the case of solar power.

Based on a single-case qualitative study of a Brazilian subsidiary of a large biotechnology MNE (1989-2016). we found that: (1) the subsidiary's technological capability-building. from production-based to advanced levels (including R&D for applied research). reflects the effectiveness with which it implemented interactive learning strategies through the use of ‘science. technology and innovation’ (STI) and ‘doing. using and interacting’ (DUI) learning mechanisms to tap into three types of knowledge sources: within the subsidiary. the MNE corporate network. and other host sectoral system organisations; (2) the …,True,EEi2A4MAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733320300755,3655537933202209240,/scholar?cites=3655537933202209240,,,0,0,0

1097008,The economics of wind energy,2009,Søren Krohn and Poul-Erik Morthorst and Shimon Awerbuch,3,European Wind Energy Association,,,,One of the most important economic benefits of wind power is that it reduces the exposure of our economies to fuel price volatility. This benefit is so sizable that it could easily justify a larger share of wind energy in most European countries. even if wind were more expensive per kWh than other forms of power generation. This risk reduction from wind energy is presently not accounted for by standard methods for calculating the cost of energy. which have been used by public authorities for more than a century. Quite the contrary. current calculation methods blatantly favour the use of high-risk options for power generation. In a situation where the industrialised world is becoming ever more dependent on importing fuel from politically unstable areas at unpredictable and higher prices. this aspect merits immediate attention.As is demonstrated in this publication. markets will not solve these problems by themselves because markets do not properly value the external effects of power generation. Governments need to correct the market failures arising from external effects because costs and benefits for a household or a firm who buys or sells in the market are different from the cost and benefits to society. It is cheaper for power companies to dump their waste. eg in the form of fly ashes. CO2. nitrous oxides. sulphur oxides and methane for free. The problem is that it creates cost for others. eg in the form of lung disease. damage from acid rain or global warming. Similarly. the benefits of using wind energy accrue to the economy and society as a whole. and not to individual market participants (the so-called common goods problem).,True,T2M-QFwAAAAJ:cBPnxVikjH8C,483,http://www.unioviedo.es/ate/manuel/seasturlab/EWEA.pdf,18315021475722070654,/scholar?cites=18315021475722070654,,http://www.unioviedo.es/ate/manuel/seasturlab/EWEA.pdf,0,0,0

The last-mentioned issue might require the contribution from renewable energy technologies. but at present most renewables cannot compete on their own with conventional technologies. Thus. it can be expected that if renewables must compete solely on market conditions alone this will slow down or even halt the development of new renewable capacity. One model in which additional payments to renewable technologies are generated is based on the development of a separate green market. In Holland a voluntary green certificate market has existed since the beginning of 1998.

Investments in new wind-power installations on land. however. have declined dramatically after the Danish electricity market was liberalised in 1999. First. the paper describes how policy measures directed towards wind power have been redesigned to match the liberalised market. Then. we estimate the impact of the redesigned tariffs on the electricity prices. Finally. we assess whether the new tariffs make an incentive to invest in wind power. The paper concludes that the new tariffs not by itself make evidence for the actual Danish recession in new wind-power installations after the electricity reform. The main causes could include a combination of problems in spatial planning. high risk aversion of new wind turbine investors and perhaps more favourable support schemes in other countries.,True,T2M-QFwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,224,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508003649,1893827861563533041,/scholar?cites=1893827861563533041,,,0,0,0

New technologies may make individual solutions such as electric heating. heat pumps and micro-CHP more attractive than previously. Therefore. the competitive conditions between district heating and other types of heating may change in the future.

In other words. this long-term research agenda is driven by problems and curiosity. addressing basic research and fundamental knowledge in 11 research areas. ranging from physics and design to environmental and societal aspects. Because of the very nature of this initiative. this document does not intend to be permanent or complete. It shows the vision of the experts of the eawe. but other views may be possible.

1097018,Experience curves: a tool for energy policy assessment,2003,Lena Neij and Peter Helby and Per Dannemand Andersen and Poul Erik Morthorst and Michael Durstewitz and Martin Hoppe-Kilpper,,,,,,The objective of the project. Experience curves: a tool for energy policy assessment (EXTOOL). was to analyse the experience curve as a tool for the assessment of energy policy measures. This is of special interest. since the use of experience curves for the assessment of energy policy measures requires the development of the established experience curve methodology. This development raises several questions which have been addressed and analysed in this project. The analysis is based on case studies of wind power. an area with considerable experience in technology development. deployment and policy measures. Therefore. a case study based on wind power provides a good opportunity to study the usefulness of experience curves as a tool for the assessment of energy policy measures. However. the results are discussed in terms of using experience curves for the assessment of any energy technology. The project shows that experience curves can be used to assess the effect of combined policy measures in terms of cost reductions. Moreover. the result of the project show that experience curves could be used to analyse international 'learning systems'. i.e. cost reductions brought about by the development of wind power and policy measures used in other countries. Nevertheless. the use of experience curves for the assessment of policy programmes has several limitations. First. the analysis and assessment of policy programmes cannot be achieved unless relevant experience curves based on good data can be developed. The authors are of the opinion that only studies that provide evidence of the validity. reliability and relevance of …,True,T2M-QFwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,119,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20371554,4582124746381240759,/scholar?cites=4582124746381240759,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/20371554,0,0,0

Is it possible to establish a relation between turbine economy and the capacity expansion that could be used for regulatory purposes in reaching a specific policy-determined target for the deployment of wind power? Such relations are analysed with reference to three types of turbine ownership: Co-operatives. individuals (e.g. a farmer). and utility companies. The paper concludes that concerning individually owned turbines. a strong relationship between wind turbine profitability and the annual capacity development does exist. With regard to investments in co-operatively owned turbines. only a weak relationship was found.

1097024,Wind power and the conditions at a liberalized power market,2003,Poul Erik Morthorst,6,,3,297-308,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Wind power is undergoing a rapid development nationally as well as globally and in a number of countries covers an increasing part of the power supply. At the same time an ongoing liberalization of power markets is taking place and to an increasing extent the owners of wind power plants will themselves have to be responsible for trading the power at the spot market and financially handling the balancing. In the western part of Denmark (Jutland/Funen area). wind‐generated power from time to time covers almost 100% of total power consumption. Therefore some examples are chosen from this area to analyse in more detail how well large amounts of wind power in the short‐term are handled at the power spot market. It turns out that there is a tendency that more wind power in the system in the short run leads to relatively lower spot prices. while less wind power implies relatively higher spot prices. although. with …,True,T2M-QFwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,67,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/we.92,17291511985066970697,/scholar?cites=17291511985066970697,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/we.92,0,0,0

During these 10 years. electricity markets have been subject to developments with a key focus on integrating wind power as well as trading electricity with neighbouring countries. This article introduces a methodology to analyse and understand the current market integration of wind power and concludes that the majority of Danish wind power in the period 2004–2008 was used to meet the domestic demand. Based on a physical analysis. at least 63 per cent of Danish wind power was used domestically in 2008. To analyse the remaining 37 per cent. we must apply a market model to identify cause–effect relationships.

Both short-term and long-term effects of exposing customers to hourly spot market prices and a simpler rebate scheme are analysed under scenarios with large shares of wind power in a Danish case study. Our results indicate strategies that could be favourable in ensuring high adoption of products and efficient response by households. We find that simple pricing schemes. though economically less efficient. could become important in an early phase to initialise the development of household demand response. At a later point. when long-term dynamics take effect. a larger effort should be made to shift consumers onto real-time rates. and an increased focus on overall adoption of variable pricing will be required.

The water uptake and acid doping of PBI membranes have been studied. The water uptake of PBI from the vapour phase is only slightly increased as the atmospheric humidity increases up to unity (100%). Little difference is observed for the water uptake from vapour and liquid phases. behaving very differently from Nafion membranes. When doped with phosphoric acid at low levels (<2). the active sites of the imidazole ring are preferably occupied by the doping acid and the water uptake is consequently lower. At higher acid doping levels. the water uptake is influenced by the excess of hygroscopic acid and higher water uptake than for Nafion membranes is observed.

The absorption of SO2 in the ionic liquids is an exothermic process and standard enthalpy of solution was found to be in the range −21 to −37 kJ mol−1. indicating a moderate association between gas and liquid. which also could be confirmed by Raman and UV–vis spectroscopy on the gas-saturated (1 bar) ionic liquids.

1097079,Tailoring properties of biocompatible PEG-DMA hydrogels with UV light,2012,B Sania,2012,,,,Scientific Research Publishing,Hydrogels are highly water-absorbent hydrophilic polymer networks. which show potential in many biocompatible applications. In previous work. we demonstrated the feasibility of using poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) gels polymerized with a photoinitiator for encapsulation and stabilization of painted biomimetic membrane arrays for novel separation technologies or biosensor applications. These gels were formed from PEG-DMA monomers suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and gelated by radical polymerization in the presence of the photoinitiator Darocur 1173. In this work. we show that the properties of a PEG-DMA hydrogel formed by photoinitiated polymerizetion can be tailored by varying the photocrosslinking time. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS) showed that the optimal crosslinking time for the gel was 6 - 10 minutes and that the water content of the gels could be tuned in the range of 50 - 90 wt%. The resistivity was between 0.8 - 3.5 Ωm. which is comparable to that of PBS. The low resistivity of the gel makes it compatible for encapsulating membranes for (ion channel based) biosensor applications. With FTIR and RS we identified spectral features of the hydrogel. which may serve as a diagnostic tool to monitor changes in the gels due to variation in parameters such as time. pH. temperature. aging or exposure to chemicals or biological material.,True,z_maQwoAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC,51,https://www.scirp.org/html/12-7700740_19859.htm?pagespeed=noscript,14228338279489845402,/scholar?cites=14228338279489845402,,https://www.scirp.org/html/12-7700740_19859.htm?pagespeed=noscript,0,0,0

It is shown that with N and B concentrations in a range of 10^18cm^−3 the samples exhibit the most intense luminescence when the concentration difference (n-type) is about 4.6x10^18cm^−3. Raman spectroscopy studies further verified the doping type and concentrations for the samples.

The apparently quite strongdriving force toward pairwise association of metallotetraphenylporphyrin rr-cationradical species is further demonstrated in these studies. Dimer formation has significant effects on the molecular structure. leading to an unusual saddle-shaped core conformation. Solid-state dimer formation also leads to antiferromagnetic coupling between the ring radicals and the extent of the coupling appears tobe quite sensitive to the extent of porphyrin core overlap. Since spin coupling is insufficient to producediamagnetism at room temperature. the present work supports the partitioningof intra-and intermolecular spin coupling effects previously made in iron (III) and copper (II) porphyrin radicals. 3· 4Acknowledgment.

For enhancing the Raman signal the enkephalin molecules have been attached to silver colloidal cluster structures. The experiments demonstrate that the SERS signal of the strongly enhanced ring breathing vibration of phenylalanine at 1000 cm− 1 can be used as “intrinsic marker” for detecting a single enkephalin molecule without using a specific label molecule. The reported result suggests the use of the phenylalanine 1000 cm− 1 SERS line as spectroscopic signature for monitoring single proteins containing this amino acid as a building block.,True,z_maQwoAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,46,https://content.iospress.com/articles/spectroscopy/spe219,11959695585831845740,/scholar?cites=11959695585831845740,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jspec/2004/376395.pdf,0,0,0

Warming is expected to lead to a northward expansion of suitable cropping areas and a reduction of the growing period of determinate crops (e.g. cereals). but an increase for indeterminate crops (e.g. root crops). Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will directly enhance plant productivity and also increase resource use efficiencies.In northern areas climate change may produce positive effects on agriculture through introduction of new crop species and varieties. higher crop production and expansion of suitable areas for crop cultivation. Disadvantages may be an increase in the need for plant protection. the risk of nutrient leaching and the turnover of soil organic matter. In southern areas the disadvantages will predominate.

It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) concept and enhance the understanding of NAMAs by explaining the underlying decisions of the Conference of the Parties in layman's terms. The first chapter describes how the concept of NAMA emerged in the context of the negotiations on climate change. The chapter gives an overview of how the concepts of NAMA and related MRV and financing issues have evolved through the different COPs. The second chapter clarifies the understanding of NAMAs in the context of the global temperature goal. and moves on to discuss the legal nature and scope of NAMAs. The chapter subsequently analyses the diversity of NAMAs submitted by developing countries to the UNFCCC. and ends by proposing a structure for formal submission of a NAMA. The third chapter specifically addresses the concept of measurement. reporting and verification (MRV). and describes the implications for countries implementing the MRV requirements. The last chapter discusses institutional arrangements. under the Convention. for providing financing to develop and implement NAMAs. The chapter also briefly discusses the different financial sources for implementing NAMAs. and concludes by explaining the concept of incremental cost in this specific context.

Financing activities aimed at emission mitigation must not only result in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. the enhancement of mitigation. adaptive capacity and adaptation strategies. but should also produce additional outcomes on other environmental. social or economic aspects of sustainable development. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was created precisely to cover these two aspects: firstly. to achieve cost-effective mitigation of greenhouse gases and secondly. to assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development based on their national development priorities and strategies. However. complying with the second objective turned out to be problematic. Registered projects appeared that had no proven sustainable development benefits. or even perceived negative impacts. Consequently. critique was raised that the current set-up is weak due to the lack of clear and transparent sustainable development criteria in many host countries. and whether the intended sustainable development benefits are actually achieved in the absence of standards or monitoring. reporting and verification procedures.. To strengthen the current system for assessing the impact of sustainable development within CDM projects. even the High-Level Panel on the CDM Policy Dialogue recommended introducing monitoring. reporting and verification schemes for measuring the outcomes.

The general idea behind these processes is to specify global and national objectives in terms of environmental protection. development and climate protection. We face a debate on firstly Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda originating from the Rio+ 20 process and secondly on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that may be merged with the SDGs. Thirdly parties are negotiating a new Climate Convention under the UNFCCC. These processes are intended to provide inspiration for action and deliver objectives for implementation at the national level supported by international institutions. A globally defined but flexible approach for assessing sustainable development can provide invaluable support towards a globally harmonised assessment of sustainable development. comparable through mitigation mechanisms and embedded into development planning at the national level. This can then be used to integrate sustainability assessment standards into Performance Measurement Systems such as national Monitoring. Reporting and Verification Systems. On the other hand. compliance with standards ensures that countries also meet the requirements of international financial institutions such as the Green Climate Fund.

Capacity development interventions are. however. characterized by a low level of success. Explored in this paper is the theoretical grounding for why planned interventions for capacity development in the environment often fail. Drawing on a review of mainstream systems theory and strategic management approaches. it is argued that these rely on overoptimistic assumptions about the institutional and social reality as manageable and controllable.

Yale Univeristy and University of Lapland,Over the past several years. the human rights implications of climate change have become evident. The first official recognition of the relationship between climate change and human rights at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR) emerged with the adoption of Resolution 10/4 in 2009 (UNHCR. 2009). Since then. two other UNHRC resolutions (Res 18/22; Res 26 L/33) have been passed on the linkages between human rights and climate change. Generally. these resolutions recognize the adverse direct and indirect effects of climate change on the effective enjoyment of human rights and acknowledge that the effects of climate change will be felt most severely by those that are already vulnerable due to geography. gender. age. indigenous or minority status. and disability(UNHRC. 2009; Knox. 2009; Limon. 2009).The foregoing development has been recognized in the negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) through a decision reached by the Conference of Parties (COP) at its sixteenth meeting held in Cancun in 2010 (Decision 1/CP. 16. 2010). Paragraph 8 of the Cancun Agreements. which emerged from the event. urges Parties to fully respect human rights in all climate related actions. The urgency in this. with respect to the development and implementation of CDM policies. has been emphasized by the former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

However. some non-governmental organisations have signalled the poor implementation of this requirement. The independent High-Level Panel on the CDM Policy Dialogue has also considered the need for improvement. Subsequently the Conference of the Parties serving as the meetings of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) 7 at Durban called on the CDM Executive Board to develop a tool for voluntary use in order to highlight the contribution of CDM to sustainability. As a result. in late 2012 The Sustainable Development Tool was developed and adopted. The fact that CDM projects should support sustainable development in the host countries is a key element of the CDM. which is why past experience suggests that a strong approach to the assessment of projects is important. Meanwhile. many innovative approaches taken by Designated National Authorities (DNAs) have superseded the restraint that was prevalent in earlier sustainability assessment with rather general sustainability criteria. superficial examinations and difficult stakeholder consultations. Such new approaches include scoring of indicators. priority sectors. checklists as well as improved documentation requirements for verification. municipal approval or on-site visits by DNA staff.

It has been instrumental to the success of the Paris Agreement by raising corporate climate ambition over 10+ years. As commitments under the Paris Agreement currently fall short of what is required to keep global temperature rises well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels. voluntary climate action–more than ever–can and must help bridge the ambition gap.Despite its proven track record. the voluntary carbon market faces two life-threatening challenges. First. the failure of ‘offsetting’as a call to action globally endorsed by a broad range of climate groups fundamentally challenges the legitimacy of existing climate commitments and poses a significant hurdle to new ones. 1 Second. while now an isolated issue. the risk of double counting will become a global challenge post-2020–potentially undermining the promises of the voluntary carbon market.,True,JYgMd-0AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,5,https://www.gxhagyy.com/sites/default/files/documents/a_new_paradigm_for_voluntary_climate_action.pdf,3194633402430069230,/scholar?cites=3194633402430069230,,https://www.gxhagyy.com/sites/default/files/documents/a_new_paradigm_for_voluntary_climate_action.pdf,0,0,0

While rules exist on global and local stakeholder consultations. however. these rules are vague. and there are numerous cases in which local communities have not been adequately consulted(for example. in Santa Rita (hydroelectric dam in Guatemala). Bajo Aguán (biogas project in Honduras) and Olkaria (geothermal power plant in Kenya)). There has also been concern that the current rules on local stakeholder consultations (LSC) do not provide sufficient guidance to project participants and independent validators regarding who to consult. when and by what method(EB 69.

Taking the Maharashtra State.

A lack of access to appropriate financing mechanisms is one of the important barriers. Energy service companies (ESCOs). a market oriented mechanism to improve energy efficiency. had successful experiences in developed countries such as the USA and Canada. and developing countries such as South Korea. ESCOs are in nascent stage in many developing countries and face several barriers that include market. finance and institutional barriers. poor energy pricing policies. high transaction costs etc. Market development through active involvement of governments as a customer. information provider. and policy maker is required to promote ESCOs.

However. it has a lot of barriers and challenges to be successful. The Korean case is a good example to show the reason why economically viable energy savings measures cannot be implemented and how this can be corrected. Although financing is essential for promoting energy efficiency investment and ESCO business. it is not the most crucial barrier to overcome.

1097141,Implementation of renewable energy technology-Opportunities and barriers. Summary of country studies,2002,Jyoti Prasad Painuly and Jørgen Villy Fenhann,,,,,,The project was launched to identify barriers to the implementation of renewable energy technologies (RETs) and explore measures to overcome the identified barriers. National institutions in Egypt. Ghana and Zimbabwe carried out the country studies based on the basic methodological framework provided by the UNEP Centre. The objectives of the project included strengthening institutional capacity for analysis and implementation of RET projects in the participating countries and bring out experiences on RETs barriers and removal measures for dissemination so that others can benefit from the knowledge so gained. An important highlight of the studies was involvement of stake holders in the process of identification of barriers and measures to remove them. A preliminary identification of relevant RETs for their countries was done by the country teams in the initial stage of the project. After that. national workshops involving various stake holders were held between July and September 1999 to discuss the RETs and barriers to their implementation. Based on the discussions. a few important RETs were identified for more detailed study. PV systems for rural electrification. solar water heating systems and large-scale biogas system were identified and analysed for barriers in the Egypt country study. Economic. information and policy barriers were identified as major barriers for these technologies. Solar water pumps. biogas and small hydro were the focus of study in Ghana.

High investment requirements for additional capacity and long gestation periods make it difficult to keep up with the rising demand. This has forced the government. the utilities. and the consumers to think in terms of energy conservation through efficiency improvements and load management strategies.

The issues are then analysed from the perspective of the use of fertilizers and pesticides in Indian agriculture. Fertilizer consumption in India is concentrated in about one-third of the cultivated area. Its use has been increasing but it is being used inefficiently. Pesticide use is also concentrated in five states and on a few crops such as rice. cotton and chillies. Evidence from micro studies on the environmental consequences of these chemicals is presented.

1097150,Promoting private sector financing of commercial investments in renewable energy technologies,2002,Norbert Wohlgemuth and Jyoti Painuly,,Testing New Policy Approaches,,319,,Too much investment is directed towards conventional energy technologies. even where commercially available energy efficient and renewable technologies are technically feasible and economically attractive. The fact that renewable energy technologies (RETs) account for only a modest proportion of the world’s commercial energy demand suggests that there are obstacles to their implementation. These obstacles (either financial or non-financial) need to be identified and addressed in order to design innovative policy approaches for the international and domestic sector financing of RETs. It is clear that a strategy to increase the market share of renewable energy should address the full range of obstacles. Since the use of renewable energy contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development. particularly in developing countries. one of the challenges for energy policy is to ensure that environmentally sound technologies. including RETs. have a fair opportunity to compete for the resources required for the provision of energy services.The coming together of the renewable energy industry and the financial sector cannot yet be regarded as a marriage made in heaven. There is considerable suspicion and misunderstanding on both sides which permeates all RET sectors. as well as most levels of financial institutions. In order to overcome the “understanding gap” between the worlds of renewable energy and financing. various initiatives have been launched recently to bring these two together.

Although the economics of renewable energy technologies (RETs) have yet to reach a stage where these could replace fossil fuels on a significant scale. many experts argue that technologies such as solar. wind. and small-scale hydropower are not only economically viable but also ideal for rural areas. The mismatch between the potential and actual use of RE ca n be attributed to barriers in its implementation. Among others. a lack of financing has been one of the important barriers adversely affecting the widespread use of RETs. In developing countries. a majority of initiatives have focused on financial incentives. The re are successes as well as failures from the models adopted.

We show that the developing countries will always be better-off participating in the CDM if the emissions quota they get in the post-Kyoto period is not linked to their baseline emissions. However if their quota equals (or is related to) their baseline emissions. CDM participation strategy may be a preferred alternative only if the CDM price is high enough to off-set the losses of the post-Kyoto period (during ET regime) due to participation in the CDM.

Coal is also most polluting fuel in terms of GHG emissions. Considering India`s energy resources. coal may continue to provide a large part of energy requirements in the future too. Coal is mainly used for generating electricity. Therefore. efficient measures for generation. transmission and end use of electricity can help in reducing the environmental pollution. leading to environmentally sound development. The report highlights some such important measures; reduction in auxiliary consumption (i e. the electricity consumed by generating units in the process of generation). reduction in transmission and distribution losses. and application of demand side management (DSM) options for high tension (HT) industries. The study was conducted in two phases. Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). the largest utility in Maharashtra was chosen for the detailed study in the first phase. For the study of auxiliary consumption. two typical plants of the MSEB were selected. The transmission losses were studied for the MSEB system based on a snap-shot picture of the system. For the DSM part. energy saving potential in HT industries in Maharashtra was explored based on a survey of HT industries. In the second phase of the study. two more plants outside Maharashtra were also studied to get better insight into diverse causes for the different levels of auxiliary consumption and estimate potential savings. All India potential for savings through reduction in auxiliary consumption was also estimated in this phase.

1097163,The role of district heating in the future Danish energy system,2012,Marie Münster and Poul Erik Morthorst and Helge V Larsen and Lars Bregnbæk and Jesper Werling and Hans Henrik Lindboe and Hans Ravn,48,Energy,1,47-55,Pergamon,In the EU and in Denmark. the aim is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to use energy more efficiently. District heating and combined heat and power have significant potential with regard to achieving this aim. New technologies may make individual solutions such as electric heating. heat pumps and micro-CHP more attractive than previously. Therefore. the competitive conditions between district heating and other types of heating may change in the future. The question is therefore whether district heating can contribute to ensuring the sustainability of future energy systems? Denmark is used as a case as the country has a high share of district heating and produces 20% of the electricity with wind power. The analyses are carried out using the electricity market model Balmorel. which facilitates cost optimization of operation and investments in energy production plants as well as electricity transmission.

Appendices,2001,Hans F Ravn and J Munksgaard and J Ramskov and PE Grohnheit and HV Larsen,,,NEI-DK--3934,,Elkraft System,[en] This report describes the motivations behind the development of the Balmorel model as well as the model itself. The purpose of the Balmorel project is to develop a model for analyses of the power and CHP sectors in the Baltic Sea Region. The model is directed towards the analysis of relevant policy questions to the extent that they contain substantial international aspects. The model is developed in response to the trend towards internationalisation in the electricity sector. This trend is seen in increased international trade of electricity. in investment strategies among producers and otherwise. Also environmental considerations and policies are to an increasing extent gaining an international perspective in relation to the greenhouse gasses. Further. the ongoing process of deregulation of the energy sector highlights this and contributes to the need for overview and analysis. A guiding principle behind the construction of the model has been that it may serve as a means of communication in relation to the policy issues that already are or that may become important for the region. Therefore. emphasis has been put on documentation. transparency and flexibility of the model. This is achieved in part by formulating the model in a high level modelling language. and by making the model. including data. available at the internet.

However. the method needs further development to take care of the time delay. especially for a step response of the supply temperature. Based on physical simulations of the DH network. the neural network model can be trained at points in the network where no measured data exist. The cost function used in the neural model can also be supported by the APROS model. An optimum cost function was derived as a function of supply temperature and mass flow from the plant.Automatic simplification (aggregation) of DH networks is possible for steady state as well as for dynamic simulation and optimisation of the operation of DHC and CHP systems. Aggregation of DH networks can be carried out to aggregation depths of 80-95% of the original system with very little loss of accuracy.,True,6Q29MP4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,54,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.4742&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16942077046101582482,/scholar?cites=16942077046101582482,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.4742&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. the time needed for the computations may be excessive and it is therefore desirable to reduce this time in some way. In this paper we present a method in which an original model of a DH network is replaced by a simplified one. with the purpose of reducing simulation time. but without loosing too much accuracy in the simulation. The simplified model. referred to as an equivalent network. is generated by gradually reducing the topological complexity of the original network. During this reduction. the relevant model parameters of the network are transformed in such a way that the dynamic behaviour of the equivalent network will resemble the original one. In order to validate the reduction method. we perform simulation tests on real as well as equivalent systems. These tests include a simple illustrative case and a case with a real DH network involved. Furthermore. in order to verify the quality of the equivalent model parameters we compare them with parameters that are optimally estimated for a given operational case.Results show that simple equivalent networks can maintain most of the dynamic characteristics of the original networks. but with some loss of accuracy in different situations. When applied to a real network. it is observed that a considerable network reduction is possible without introducing significant errors. which results in a good potential for a reduction of simulation time.,True,6Q29MP4AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,33,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helge_Larsen/publication/256732310_Equivalent_Models_for_District_Heating_Systems/links/5b73dee0299bf14c6da6bdda/Equivalent-Models-for-District-Heating-Systems.pdf,4560294368374425110,/scholar?cites=4560294368374425110,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Helge_Larsen/publication/256732310_Equivalent_Models_for_District_Heating_Systems/links/5b73dee0299bf14c6da6bdda/Equivalent-Models-for-District-Heating-Systems.pdf,0,0,0

1097183,A scenario model for the generation of waste,1998,Frits M Andersen and Jørgen Fenhann and Helge Larsen and Lotte Schleisner,,"Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark",,,,Concern about development in the amount of waste. resources used and environmental problems associated with the various means of waste management is growing. Detailed and comprehensive waste statistics have been developed and targets for future amounts and management of different categories of waste have been decided. Until now. however. no detailed model for the future development of waste has been available. This report presents a simple scenario model linking the development in the amount of waste to economic activities. Waste from individual sources and fractions of the ISAG statistics is linked to categories of private consumption and production by branches of the macroeconomic model ADAM. which is used for official forecasts of the Danish economy. The model converts forecasts of economic development to scenarios for the generation of waste assuming that waste generation per economic activity is unchanged relative to 1996. By generating alternative scenarios the model can be used to analyse how economic changes affect the generation of waste. In waste planning the scenarios may be used as baseline scenarios. In order to make proper forecasts. however. the model calculations have to be supplemented with evaluations of changes in waste generation per economic activity. eg changes due to legislation and technological changes. etc.. which is beyond the scope of the present model.,True,6Q29MP4AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,15,http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/1998/87-7909-168-7/word/helepubl_eng.doc,8616749193971920551,/scholar?cites=8616749193971920551,,http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/1998/87-7909-168-7/word/helepubl_eng.doc,0,0,0

1097192,Theory of a novel voltage-sustaining layer for power devices,1998,XB Chen and PA Mawby and K Board and CAT Salama,29,Microelectronics journal,12,1005-1011,Elsevier,The theory of a novel voltage-sustaining layer for power devices. called a Composite Buffer layer (CB-layer for short) is proposed. The CB-layer can be implemented in several ways. one particular implementation is used here. which consists of alternating n- and p-type regions. that are parallel to the direction of the applied electric field. In the off-state. the fields induced by the depletion charges of both region types compensate each other to allowing the doping in both n-regions and p-regions to be very high without causing a reduction of the breakdown voltage. In the onstate the heavy doping ensures the voltage drop is very low and that the saturation current density high. A simple relationship between the specific on-resistance and Ron and the sustaining voltage VB can be shown to be Ron=2.53 × 10−7bVB1.23 ωcm2. where the breadth b (in μm) of each region is much smaller than the thickness W.

This paper presents a method to monitor solder fatigue inside a module by identifying the increase of internal thermal resistance due to that solder fatigue. taking account of the masking effect of the variable operating point.

Nevertheless. the reliability of SiC power modules has been identified as a major area of uncertainty in applications which require high reliability. Traditional power module packaging methods developed for silicon chips have been adopted for SiC and the different thermomechanical properties cause different fatigue stresses on the solder layer of the chip.

Power cycling tests. for nonaged and aged modules. are designed to illustrate the failure mechanisms. Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules in actual converters are usually operated in a ΔT j  range up to 40 °C; therefore. tests are carried out to observe the effects of such narrow ΔT j  stress cycles on the module lifetime. It is found that the relatively minor stress cycles may not be able to directly initiate a crack but can contribute to the development of damage in the die attach solder layer due to stress concentration.

However. the SiC SBD suffers from ringing/oscillations due to an underdamped response to an RLC circuit formed among the diode depletion capacitance. parasitic inductance. and diode resistance. These oscillations contribute to additional power losses that cause the SiC SBDs to be outperformed by the Si pin diodes at -40 °C and 0 °C.

It is shown that the switching rate of the output current (dI D S /dt) coupled with the gate current plateau (I G P ) during turn-ON could be an effective TSEP under specific operating conditions. Both parameters increase with the junction temperature of the device as a result of the negative temperature coefficient of the threshold voltage. The temperature dependency of dI DS /dt has been shown to increase with the device current rating (due to larger input capacitance) and external gate resistance (R G EXT ). However. as dI D S /dt is increased by using a small R G EXT . parasitic inductance suppresses the temperature sensitivity of the drain and gate current transients by reducing the “effective gate voltage” on the device.

Germanium is the logical supplement to enhance existing technologies. as its material behaviour is very close to silicon. and to create new functional devices that cannot be fabricated from silicon alone (Hartmann et al.

Electrical characterisation of the fabricated contacts showed that metal structures with an initial‎ Ti‎ layer‎ yielded‎ the‎ lowest‎ specific‎ contact‎ resistance‎(ρc). with a mean value of 3.7× 10-5 Ω-cm2 being achieved after annealing in argon (Ar) at 1000 C for 2 minutes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis illustrated the epitaxial relationship between the 4H-SiC and the as-deposited Ti layer. and. in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. showed that after annealing a~ 5 nm thick layer of Ti3SiC2 was present. epitaxially arranged with the 4H-SiC. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that the presence of the Ti3SiC2 metallic phase was more prevalent in the samples with Ti as the initial metal layer annealed at 1000 C. which corresponded with lower specific contact resistance.

There is no universally accepted effective non-invasive screening test for CRC. Guaiac based faecal occult blood (gFOB) testing has largely been superseded by Faecal Immunochemical testing (FIT). but sensitivity still remains poor. The uptake of population based FOBt testing in the UK is also low at around 50%. The detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) signature(s) for many cancer subtypes is receiving increasing interest using a variety of gas phase analytical instruments. One such example is FAIMS (Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer). FAIMS is able to identify Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) patients by analysing shifts in VOCs patterns in both urine and faeces. This study extends this concept to determine whether CRC patients can be identified through non-invasive analysis of urine. using FAIMS. 133 patients were recruited; 83 CRC patients and 50 healthy controls. Urine was collected at the time of CRC diagnosis and headspace analysis undertaken using a FAIMS instrument (Owlstone. Lonestar. UK). Data was processed using Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) after feature extraction from the raw data.

There has been an increasing interest in the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as potential surrogate markers of gut dysbiosis in gastrointestinal disease. Gut dysbiosis occurs when pathological imbalances in gut bacterial colonies precipitate disease and has been linked to the dysmetabolism of bile acids (BA) in the gut. BA metabolites as a result of microbial transformations act as signaling molecules and have demonstrated regulation of intestinal homeostasis through the TGR5 and FXR receptors by inhibiting inflammation. preventing pathogen invasion. and maintaining cell integrity. The presence of VOC footprints is the resultant effect to gut microbiome substrate fermentation. Aim. To review the role of the gut microbiome and bile acid signaling in intestinal homeostasis and the resultant use of VOCs as potential noninvasive surrogate biomarkers in gut dysbiosis. Methods. A systematic search on PubMed and Medline databases was performed to identify articles relevant to gut dysbiosis. BA metabolism. and VOCs. Conclusions. The host and presence of the gut microbiome appear to regulate the BA pool size.

1097395,The detection of patients at risk of gastrointestinal toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy by electronic nose and FAIMS: a pilot study,2012,James A Covington and Linda Wedlake and Jervoise Andreyev and Nathalie Ouaret and Matthew G Thomas and Chuka U Nwokolo and Karna D Bardhan and Ramesh P Arasaradnam,12,Sensors,10,13002-13018,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,It is well known that the electronic nose can be used to identify differences between human health and disease for a range of disorders. We present a pilot study to investigate if the electronic nose and a newer technology. FAIMS (Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry). can be used to identify and help inform the treatment pathway for patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. which frequently causes gastrointestinal side-effects. severe in some. From a larger group. 23 radiotherapy patients were selected where half had the highest levels of toxicity and the others the lowest. Stool samples were obtained before and four weeks after radiotherapy and the volatiles and gases emitted analysed by both methods; these chemicals are products of fermentation caused by gut microflora. Principal component analysis of the electronic nose data and wavelet transform followed by Fisher discriminant analysis of FAIMS data indicated that it was possible to separate patients after treatment by their toxicity levels. More interestingly. differences were also identified in their pre-treatment samples. We believe these patterns arise from differences in gut microflora where some combinations of bacteria result to give this olfactory signature. In the future our approach may result in a technique that will help identify patients at “high risk” even before radiation treatment is started.

1097400,Thin-film diode structures for advanced energy applications,2015,Evgeniy Donchev,,,,,,Presented within this thesis is the work towards studies on thin-film diode structures for use in advanced energy applications. The main energy application pursued within this study is the solar rectenna device. considered to be next-generation in energy harvesting due to promises of efficiencies beyond the Shokley-Queisser limit for solar cells. A RECTifying antENNA (RECTENNA) is a device consisting of an antenna. with dimensions scaled to the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave to be absorbed. and the resulting signal rectified by a diode of sufficient cut-off frequency to efficiently operate at the desired harvesting frequency. In studying the rectenna device and its efficiency limits. diode performance requirements have been outlined that are used to identify suitable structures to be used in future prototype manufacturing of energy relevant devices. for example solar rectenna. rectenna for microwave power transmission. antenna-coupled diode photodetectors. hot-electron devices. etc. Silicon based Schottky barrier and Metal-(native oxide) Insulator-Metal diodes have been. for the first time. systematically studied by using conventional manufacturing techniques to produce optimised devices. The result being n-type Si Schottky barrier diodes with various top metals (Ag. Al. Au. Nb. Cr. Mo. Ni and Ti) displaying low ideality factors close to unity (exception made from Al). good low-bias rectification properties. low leakage currents and optimised barrier heights.

However. the SiC SBD suffers from ringing/oscillations due to an underdamped response to an RLC circuit formed among the diode depletion capacitance. parasitic inductance. and diode resistance. These oscillations contribute to additional power losses that cause the SiC SBDs to be outperformed by the Si pin diodes at -40 °C and 0 °C.

The parasitic inductances of the module were minimised by abandonment of contact leads while the use of AlN DCB substrates ensures an excellent heat transfer to the heat-sink.

Germanium is the logical supplement to enhance existing technologies. as its material behaviour is very close to silicon. and to create new functional devices that cannot be fabricated from silicon alone (Hartmann et al. (2004) [1]). Germanium wafers are. however. both expensive and less durable than their silicon counterparts. Hence it is highly desirable to create a relaxed high quality Ge layer on a Si substrate. with the provision that this does not unduly compromise the planarity of the system.

Efficient transduction is particularly difficult to realize in devices of low dimensionality. such as beam resonators based on carbon nanotubes or silicon nanowires. where mechanical vibrations combine very high frequencies with miniscule amplitudes. Here we describe an enhanced piezoresistive transduction mechanism based on the asymmetry of the beam shape at rest. We show that this mechanism enables highly sensitive linear detection of the vibration of low-resistivity silicon beams without the need of exceptionally large piezoresistive coefficients. The general application of this effect is demonstrated by detecting multiple-order modes of silicon nanowire resonators made by either top-down or bottom-up fabrication methods. These results reveal a promising approach for …,True,jYntBg0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,41,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5313,8103325603918775827,/scholar?cites=8103325603918775827,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5313,0,0,0

The obtained value of 19 Wm− 1 K− 1 at room temperature represents a tenfold reduction with respect to bulk Si. This design paves the way for subsequent lateral nanostructuration of the layer with lithographic techniques. to define different geometries such as Si nanowires. nanostrips or phononic grids. As a proof of concept. nanostrips of 0.5× 10 μm have been defined by focused ion beam (FIB) in the ultrathin Si layer. After the FIB cutting process with Ga ions at 30 kV and 100 pA. the measured thermal conductivity dramatically decreased to 1.7 Wm− 1 K− 1. indicating that the structure became severely damaged (amorphous).

Suspended. doubly clamped SiNWs fabricated by this process presents a good electrical conductivity which enables the electrical read-out of the SiNW oscillation. During the fabrication process. gallium implantation induces the amorphization of silicon that. together with the incorporation of gallium into the irradiated volume. increases the electrical resistivity to values higher than 3 Ω m. resulting in an unacceptably high resistance for electrical transduction. We show that the conductivity of the SiNWs can be restored by performing a high temperature doping process. which allows us to recover the crystalline structure of the silicon and to achieve a controlled resistivity of the structures.
