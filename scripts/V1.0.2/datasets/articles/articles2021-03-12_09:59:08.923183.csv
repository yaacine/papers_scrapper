Here. we identify the origin of a 500-fold OER activity enhancement that can be achieved with mixed (Ni.Fe)oxyhydroxides (Ni1–xFexOOH) over their pure Ni and Fe parent compounds. resulting in one of the most active currently known OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) reveals that Fe3+ in Ni1–xFexOOH occupies octahedral sites with unusually short Fe–O bond distances. induced by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedra. Using computational methods. we establish that this structural motif results in near optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and low overpotentials at Fe sites.

Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function. but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA. confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above. yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model. in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network.

The recent X-ray crystal structures. while limited by resolutions of 3.2−3.5 Å. have located the electron density associated with the Mn4Ca cluster within the multiprotein PS II complex. Detailed structures critically depend on input from spectroscopic techniques. such as EXAFS and EPR/ENDOR. as the XRD resolution does not allow for accurate determination of the position of Mn/Ca or the bridging and terminal ligand atoms. The number and distances of Mn−Mn/Ca/ligand interactions determined from EXAFS provide important constraints for the structure of the Mn4Ca cluster.

It affects the kidneys. with nephritis being the primarily chemically-induced effect in animals and humans. Intermediate-term studies on animals indicate that increased uranium doses are positively correlated with various biochemical effects and histopathological changes. Since the kidneys efficiently excrete in urine the major portion of solubilized uranium circulating in blood. an increased urinary uranium excretion can provide a sensitive quantitative measure of exposure. especially in the case of acute exposure. In the present work a method was developed for the quantitative determination of uranium in human urine. It combines the chemical treatment of urine. which results in a significant pre-concentration of uranium. with its subsequent detection by means of total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF).

The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds. however—gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals. To understand the nobleness of gold. we have studied a simple surface reaction. the dissociation of H 2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper. nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table. We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption. and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate.

Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches. real-space grids offer several advantages. most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However. as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid.

Activating the MoS 2 basal plane could further enhance its HER activity but is not often a strategy for doing so. Herein. we report the first activation and optimization of the basal plane of monolayer 2H-MoS 2 for HER by introducing sulphur (S) vacancies and strain. Our theoretical and experimental results show that the S-vacancies are new catalytic sites in the basal plane. where gap states around the Fermi level allow hydrogen to bind directly to exposed Mo atoms. The hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔG H) can be further manipulated by straining the surface with S-vacancies. which fine-tunes the catalytic activity.

The most important effect is related to the availability of many low-coordinated gold atoms on the small particles. Effects related to the interaction with the support may also contribute. but to a considerably smaller extent.

Coking and sintering are the main causes of catalyst failure. In spite of its lower activity and higher tendency to deactivation with respect to noble metal-based catalysts. Ni. if supported over Al2O3 in particular. is commonly used in industry for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons because of its low cost and wide availability. Ni is considered as a promising catalyst; this owes to its activity in CÀC. OÀH and CÀH bond cleavage and in the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction. Glycerol is the main by-product in biodiesel production; therefore a glut in its market is expected in the next few years owing to a rise in biodiesel production. The pathway for the steam reforming of glycerol (GSR) is usually considered as similar to that of ethanol SR. even if this is not exhaustively understood. The reported mechanism for metal-catalysed GSR relates to the one previously proposed for hydrocarbon reforming.[4. 5] GSR is an energy intensive process and CÀC cleavage is commonly considered to be the rate determining step. Glycerol can dehydrogenate and adsorb onto the metal. subsequent CÀC breakings lead to adsorbed CO that can be further oxidised through the WGS reaction. which is thermodynamically favoured at low temperature. The CO is then either converted to methane or desorbed.

Apart from the case of the metallic Ru nanoparticles. the observed potential dependencies were purely core-level shifts caused by a change in oxidation state. which indicates no structural changes. These findings can be explained by different binding energies of oxygenated species on the surface of IrOx and RuOx. Simulated XAS spectra show that the average Ir oxidation state change is strongly affected by the coverage of atomic O. The observed shifts in oxidation state suggest that the surface has a high coverage of O at potentials just below the potential where oxygen evolution is exergonic in free energy.

We observed considerable and similar non-uniformities in terms of Ni oxidation states (and. by proxy. lithium distributions) for all the samples in the bulk. Therefore. the chemically delithiated samples are similar to the electrochemically charged samples in terms of mesoscale charge heterogeneity in large polycrystalline particle ensembles.

In addition to determining the quantity of impurities on a surface. TXRF can reveal information about the vertical distribution of contaminants by measuring the fluorescence signal as a function of the angle of incidence. In this study. two samples were intentionally contaminated with copper in non-deoxygenated and deoxygenated ultrapure water (UPW) resulting in impurity profiles that were either atomically dispersed in a thin film or particle-like. respectively. The concentration profile of the samples immersed into deoxygenated UPW was calculated using a theoretical concentration profile representative of particles. yielding a mean particle height of 16.1 nm.

Digital models are most efficient in terms of time and cost. and provide the facility to infinitely modify model properties non-destructively. such that sensitivity analyses can be conducted to quantify the effect of the many unknown parameters involved in reconstructions of extinct animals. In this study we use laser scanning (LiDAR) and computer modelling methods to create a range of 3D mass models of five specimens of non-avian dinosaur; two near-complete specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex. the most complete specimens of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis and Strutiomimum sedens. and a near-complete skeleton of a sub-adult Edmontosaurus annectens. LiDAR scanning allows a full mounted skeleton to be imaged resulting in a detailed 3D model in which each bone retains its spatial position and articulation. This provides a high resolution skeletal framework around which the body cavity and internal organs such as lungs and air sacs can be reconstructed. This has allowed calculation of body segment masses. centres of mass and moments or inertia for each animal. However. any soft tissue reconstruction of an extinct taxon inevitably represents a best estimate model with an unknown level of accuracy.

However. these approaches are all indirect and an alternative approach is to create a musculoskeletal model of the animal and see how fast it can run.

Jumping locomotion involves large forces and energy costs which. in this non-cyclic activity. are generated anew with each jump. Jumping appears to be. therefore. a major target for optimization.

This paradigm has stood for more than 70 years but has yet to be tested objectively with quantitative data.

Computer simulation provides a methodology for combining multimodal information to produce concrete predictions that can be evaluated and used to assess the likelihood of competing locomotor hypotheses. However. with the advent of much faster supercomputers. such simulations can also explore a wider range of possibilities. allowing the generation of gait hypotheses de novo. In this paper we document the use of an 8000 core computer to produce mechanically and physiologically plausible gaits and trackway patterns for a sub-adult dinosaur (Edmontosaurus annectens). evaluating a large range of locomotor possibilities in terms of running speed. The anatomical reconstruction presented is capable of running and hopping bipedal gaits; trot. pace and single foot symmetrical quadrupedal gaits; and asymmetrical galloping gaits. Surprisingly hopping is the fastest gait (17 ms-1). followed by quadrupedal galloping (16 ms-1) and bipedal running (14 ms-1). Such a hopping gait is considered unlikely for this animal. which would imply that either our anatomical and physiological reconstruction is incorrect or there are important constraints such as skeletal loading and safety factor that are currently not included in our simulation. The most likely errors are in joint ranges of motion. combined with the lengths of muscle fibres and tendons since these values are difficult to reconstruct.

This study combines geochemical analyses with morphological observations to investigate the preservation of melanosomes and melanin within feathers of the Early Cretaceous bird. Gansus yumenensis. Scanning electron microscopy reveals structures concordant with those previously identified as eumelanosomes within visually dark areas of the feathers but not in lighter areas or sedimentary matrices. Fourier transform infrared analyses show different spectra for the feathers and their matrices; melanic functional groups appear in the feather including carboxylic acid and ketone groups that are not seen in the matrix. When mapped. the carboxylic acid group absorption faithfully replicates the visually dark areas of the feathers. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy of one specimen demonstrates the presence of organic signals but proved too insensitive to resolve melanin. Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry shows a similar distribution of aliphatic material within both feathers that are different from those of their respective matrices.

The phylum Mollusca includes some of the most beautiful exemplars of biological pigmentation. with the vivid colours of sea shells particularly prized by collectors and scientists alike. Biochemical studies of molluscan shell colour were fairly common in the last century. but few of these studies have been confirmed using modern methods and very few shell pigments have been fully characterised. Here. we use modern chemical and multi-modal spectroscopic techniques to identify two porphyrin pigments and eumelanin in the shell of marine snails Clanculus pharaonius and C margaritarius.

Evidence from confocal microscopy analyses shows that the distribution of porphyrin pigments corresponds to the striking pink-red of C. pharaonius shells. as well as pink-red dots and lines on the early whorls of C. margaritarius and yellow-brown colour of later whorls. Additional HPLC results suggest that eumelanin is likely responsible for black spots.

In addition to the need to move the object in some cases. perhaps the most important challenge posed by chemical analyses of ancient material stems from the potential for damage either during sample preparation for analysis (removing material. subsampling. coating) or during analysis itself (alteration or destruction). This puts severe limitations on the chemical analysis of many artifacts with so-called invasive or destructive techniques such as mass spectrometry. scanning electron microscopy. or high-performance liquid chromatography. for example.Synchrotron-based techniques provide unique opportunities to study important ancient objects with minimal risk of damage.

Ni–Fe films with a bulk and surface composition of 40% Fe exhibit OER activities that are roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of a freshly deposited Ni film and about 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of an Fe film. The freshly deposited Ni film increases in activity by as much as 20-fold during exposure to the electrolyte (KOH); however. all films containing Fe are stable as deposited. The oxidation of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH in Ni films occurs at potentials below the onset of the OER.

Interpolation methods such as the growing-string method and the nudged-elastic band are able to find an approximation to the minimum-energy pathway and thereby provide a good initial guess for a transition state and imaginary mode connecting both reactant and product states. Since interpolation methods employ usually just a small number of configurations and converge slowly close to the minimum-energy pathway. local methods such as partitioned rational function optimization methods using either exact or approximate Hessians or minimum-mode-following methods such as the dimer or the Lanczos method have to be used to converge to the transition state.

The distribution of products over reduced and unreduced Fe2O3 are similar. The primary products are methane and linear. terminal olefins. Some C+2 paraffins are produced in parallel with olefins. but most result from hydrogenation of the olefins. Isomerization of terminal to internal olefins also occurs as a secondary reaction.

1147157,Electrocatalysis in solid acid fuel cells,2011,Mary WC Louie,,,,,,Solid state electrochemical reactions play a crucial role in many energy conversion devices. yet the pathways of many reactions remain unknown. The elusiveness of the reaction mechanisms is due. in part. to the complexity of electrochemical reactions; because electrochemical reactions require the interaction of many species (e.g.. ions. electrons. and adsorbates) across multiple phases (e.g.. electrolyte. catalyst. and gas phases). elucidation of the reaction pathway can quickly become complicated. In this work. we develop and utilize model catalyst | electrolyte systems. that is. structures of reduced complexity. to study electrode reactions in solid acid fuel cells which operate at intermediate temperatures of ~ 250 ºC. We employ AC impedance spectroscopy to explore the reaction pathway for hydrogen electro-oxidation over Pt thin films sputter-deposited atop the proton-conducting solid acid electrolyte CsH2PO4. We observed that hydrogen electro-oxidation occurs by diffusion of hydrogen through Pt. taking advantage of the entire Pt | CsH2PO4 interfacial area rather than being confined to the triple-phase sites. This insight opens up new avenues for developing high performance electrodes with low Pt loadings by eliminating the requirement that Pt-based electrodes be comprised of high triple-phase site densities long considered to be critical for Pt electrocatalysis. Indeed. even for flat. planar electrodes of very thin Pt films. we obtained a Pt utilization that is significantly higher than in typical composite electrodes.

Inc.,The addition of Fe sites has been found to enhance the catalytic activity of NiO (OH) for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For electrodeposited mixed (Fe. Ni) oxyhydroxide films. we found a volcanoshaped correlation between Fe content and OER activity. which is maximized near a Fe: Ni atomic ratio of 1. In order to understand the structural and electronic interplay between Fe and Ni sites and its effect on OER activity. we employed in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy both under OER operating conditions as well as at lower potentials where the Ni (II)/Ni (III) redox transition can be observed. The high energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) technique was used to obtain detailed electronic structure information from Fe and Ni K-mainand pre-edge features. These results are combined with extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. We can thus probe the correlation between Fe and Ni oxidation states. Fe–O and Ni–O bond distances. and longer metal–metal distances and coordination numbers that originate from edge-or cornersharing between (Fe. Ni) O6 octahedra. We propose that the observed linear increase of the Ni (II)/Ni (III) equilibrium potential with Fe content can be explained with a strain effect where Fe sites induce increased metal–oxygen bond distances which destabilize Ni (III).,True,LGcscfYAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6178/36666ba1251a876bd6bb01f66b14a3a0e7d6.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

Although yields have increased in absolute value under all levels of stress for both crops. the sensitivity of maize yields to drought stress associated with high vapor pressure deficits has increased. The greater sensitivity has occurred despite cultivar improvements and increased carbon dioxide and reflects the agronomic trend toward higher sowing densities. The results suggest that agronomic changes tend to translate improved drought tolerance of plants to higher average yields but not to decreasing drought sensitivity of yields at the field scale.,True,2ZvvyrEAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,632,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/516.abstract,13881870681501341262,/scholar?cites=13881870681501341262,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Roberts20/publication/262017307_Greater_Sensitivity_to_Drought_Accompanies_Maize_Yield_Increase_in_the_US_Midwest/links/5464c7ed0cf221c8f57b9dbe/Greater-Sensitivity-to-Drought-Accompanies-Maize-Yield-Increase-in-the-US-Midwest.pdf,0,0,0

Here we show that the process-based Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is able to reproduce both of these relationships in the Midwestern United States and provide insight into underlying mechanisms. The predominant effects of EDD in APSIM are associated with increased vapour pressure deficit. which contributes to water stress in two ways: by increasing demand for soil water to sustain a given rate of carbon assimilation. and by reducing future supply of soil water by raising transpiration rates. APSIM computes daily water stress as the ratio of water supply to demand. and during the critical month of July this ratio is three …,True,2ZvvyrEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,602,https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1832,5123277585987291661,/scholar?cites=5123277585987291661,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Roberts20/publication/258807246_The_critical_role_of_extreme_heat_for_maize_production_in_the_United_States/links/55aea08608aed9b7dcdda360/The-critical-role-of-extreme-heat-for-maize-production-in-the-United-States.pdf,0,0,0

Contracts are now the primary method of handling sales of many livestock commodities. including milk. hogs. and broilers. and of major crops such as sugar beets. fruit. and processing tomatoes. Use of contracts is closely related to farm size; farms with $1 million or more in sales have nearly half their production under contract. For producers. contracting can reduce income risks of price and production variability. ensure market access. and provide higher returns for providing differentiated farm products. For processors and other buyers. vertical coordination through contracting is a way to ensure the flow of products and to obtain differentiated products. ensure traceability for health concerns. and guarantee certain methods of production. The traditional spot market-though it still governs nearly 60 percent of the value of agricultural production-has difficulty providing accurate price signals for products geared to new consumer demands. like produce raised and certified as organic or for identity-preserved crops modified for special attributes.

1147200,The changing economics of US hog production,2007,Nigel Key and William D McBride,,USDA-ERS Economic Research Report,52,,,The increasing size and specialization of hog operations reflect structural change in US swine production during the past 15 years. The number of farms with hogs has declined by over 70 percent. as hog enterprises have grown larger. Large operations that specialize in a single phase of production have replaced farrow-to-finish operations that performed all phases of production. The use of production contracts has increased. Operations producing under contract are larger than independent operations and are more likely to specialize in a single phase of production. These structural changes have coincided with substantial gains in efficiency for hog farms and lower production costs. Most of these productivity gains are attributable to increases in the scale of production and technological innovation. Productivity gains likely contributed to a 30-percent reduction in the price of hogs at the farm gate.,True,TGODIBgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,106,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084881,3076223774333400764,/scholar?cites=3076223774333400764,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/6389/files/er070052.pdf,0,0,0

Adverse selection occurs when those seeking insurance know more than insurers do about their risks. Agents facing greater risks are more likely to insure at average prices. causing those facing less risk to be priced out of the market. Moral hazard refers to the effect insurance contracts may have on the insured’s hidden actions. When bad outcomes are indemnified. the insured may have less incentive to prevent these outcomes from happening. Insurers. understanding agents’ incentives. may be less likely to provide insurance. and the private market for insurance can break down.Perhaps as a result of these information problems. little crop insurance was available to the US farmers until the government began providing it in the 1930s.

Specifically. contract producers tend to operate at a larger scale than do independent producers. and the likelihood of an operation contracting increases with its scale. This relationship is strongest in the cattle and hog sectors. where it persists even among large commercial operations. Six theoretical explanations for the observed correlation between scale and contracting are proposed. including imperfect capital markets. contractor transaction costs. input leverage. grower risk aversion. asset specificity. and technological change.

The result has been an industry with larger hog enterprises. increased specialization in a single phase of production. greater reliance on purchased feed rather than feed grown on the farm. and an increased reliance on formal contracts—connecting farmers. hog owners. and packers—to coordinate production. This structural change contributed to substantial productivity gains for hog farms. likely benefiting US consumers in terms of lower pork prices and enhancing the competitive position of US producers in international markets—though larger hog farms may increase environmental risks by concentrating production in areas with limited land available for manure application. With most hogs now grown on very large operations and with productivity-enhancing technologies widespread. the slowdown in hog farm productivity growth after 2004 suggests that the era of dramatic productivity gains will likely remain unmatched. absent significant technological innovation.,True,TGODIBgAAAAJ:ehoypfNsBj8C,45,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2981705,4377806790549932822,/scholar?cites=4377806790549932822,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/262217/files/40364_err158.pdf,0,0,0
1147217,Agricultural Contracting Trading Autonomy for Risk Reduction,2006,Nigel D Key and James M MacDonald,,Amber Waves,,,United States Department of Agriculture. Economic,Farming is a risky business. Sharp changes in farm production or farm prices. driven by the vagaries of weather and disease. sudden shocks to export markets. or the introduction of new technologies. can lead to striking changes in a farmer’s income in a short period of time. Agricultural contracts can shift such risks from farmers to contractors. and facilitate farm expansion. For these reasons. more and more farm output is being produced under contract. But farmers who contract often give up something they prize—the autonomy that comes with making management decisions.Agricultural contracts are agreements between farmers and their commodity buyers that are reached before harvest or the completion of a livestock production stage. They govern the terms under which products are transferred from the farm. and might specify the date of delivery. product price. and required production practices. Contracts create closer linkages between farmers and specific buyers. and may afford the contractor (buyer) greater control over agricultural production decisions. The growth in contracting has come largely at the expense of spot (or cash) markets. where farmers retain full autonomy and receive prices based on prevailing market conditions and product attributes at the time of sale. In the case of hogs. the risk reduction provided by contracts is valuable to risk-averse farmers. who seek to avoid widely fluctuating input and output prices. But hog farmers also appear to value autonomy highly—ERS research shows that a moderately risk-averse producer would need to be paid a price premium of nearly 12 percent to give up the autonomy of independent …,True,TGODIBgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,45,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/128315/files/AgriculturalContracting.pdf,2954461260351131950,/scholar?cites=2954461260351131950,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/128315/files/AgriculturalContracting.pdf,0,0,0

Because the maximum possible yields achieved in farmers' fields might level off or even decline in many regions over the next few decades. reducing the gap between average and potential yields is critical. In most major irrigated wheat. rice. and maize systems. yields appear to be at or near 80% of yield potential. with no evidence for yields having exceeded this threshold to date. A fundamental constraint in these systems appears to be uncertainty in growing season weather; thus tools to address this uncertainty would likely reduce gaps. Otherwise. short-term prospects for yield gains in irrigated agriculture appear grim without increased yield potential.

The virtual certainty that climate and CO2 will continue to trend in the future raises many questions related to food security. one of which is whether the aggregate productivity of global agriculture will be affected. We outline the mechanisms by which these changes affect crop yields and present estimates of past and future impacts of climate and CO2 trends. The review focuses on global scale grain productivity. notwithstanding the many other scales and outcomes of interest to food security. Over the next few decades. CO2 trends will likely increase global yields by roughly 1.8% per decade.

As predictions from different models often disagree. understanding the sources of this divergence is central to building a more robust picture of climate change's likely impacts. A common approach is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather. such as growing season average temperature and precipitation. Although the general strengths and weaknesses of statistical models are widely understood. there has been little systematic evaluation of their performance relative to other methods.

We use a field-level data set on maize and soybean yields in the central United States for 1995 through 2012 to examine changes in drought sensitivity. Although yields have increased in absolute value under all levels of stress for both crops. the sensitivity of maize yields to drought stress associated with high vapor pressure deficits has increased. The greater sensitivity has occurred despite cultivar improvements and increased carbon dioxide and reflects the agronomic trend toward higher sowing densities. The results suggest that agronomic changes tend to translate improved drought tolerance of plants to higher average yields but not to decreasing drought sensitivity of yields at the field scale.,True,biuzU-AAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC,632,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6183/516.abstract,13881870681501341262,/scholar?cites=13881870681501341262,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Roberts20/publication/262017307_Greater_Sensitivity_to_Drought_Accompanies_Maize_Yield_Increase_in_the_US_Midwest/links/5464c7ed0cf221c8f57b9dbe/Greater-Sensitivity-to-Drought-Accompanies-Maize-Yield-Increase-in-the-US-Midwest.pdf,0,0,0

This uncertainty partly reflects the relative lack of observations of crop behaviour in farmers’ fields under extreme heat. We used nine years of satellite measurements of wheat growth in northern India to monitor rates of wheat senescence following exposure to temperatures greater than 34 C. We detect a statistically significant acceleration of senescence from extreme heat. above and beyond the effects of increased average temperatures. Simulations with two commonly used process-based crop models indicate that existing models underestimate the effects of heat on senescence.

Farmers can also produce a variety of non-commodity ecosystem services for which markets do not exist or are imperfectly formed. Such services may be valued by society. but due to their nature or institutional arrangements. farmers often do not receive a price signal for them. This results in inefficient allocations of resources. in that farmers under-produce non-commodity ecosystem services. One possible way to increase private investment in ecosystem services is to create a market for them.

1147258,The use of markets to increase private investment in environmental stewardship,2008,Marc Ribaudo and LeRoy T Hansen and Daniel Hellerstein and Catherine R Greene,,,1477-2016-121121,,,US farmers and ranchers produce a wide variety of commodities for food. fuel. and fiber in response to market signals. Farms also contain significant amounts of natural resources that can provide a host of environmental services. including cleaner air and water. flood control. and improved wildlife habitat. Environmental services are often valued by society. but because they are a public good—that is. people can obtain them without paying for them—farmers and ranchers may not benefit financially from producing them. As a result. farmers and ranchers underprovide these services. This report explores the use of market mechanisms. such as emissions trading and eco-labels. to increase private investment in environmental stewardship. Such investments could complement or even replace public investments in traditional conservation programs. The report also defines roles for government in the creation and function of markets for environmental services.,True,u9pw-M4AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC,66,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/56473/,15255855739088440572,/scholar?cites=15255855739088440572,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/56473/files/err-64.pdf,0,0,0

Under several higher crop price scenarios. including one that incorporates 15 billion gallons of crop-based biofuels production. maintaining the CRP as currently configured will lead to significant expenditure increases. If constraints are placed on increasing rental rates. it might be possible to meet enrollment goals with moderate increases in CRP rental rates—but this will mean accepting lower average Environmental Benefits Index scores as landowners with profitable but environmentally sensitive lands choose not to enroll.,True,u9pw-M4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,65,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2735039,7331828674091020830,/scholar?cites=7331828674091020830,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/262244/files/7770_err110.pdf,0,0,0

We look at the ability of these choice data to predict farming decisions for an in-person sample of 68 farmers. A coarse version of our risk preference measure has substantial explanatory power but in an unexpected direction: a farmer who was more risk averse under our measure was less likely to have diversified his operation and less likely to have a crop insurance contract. A fine version of our risk preference measure has essentially no explanatory power. We conclude that despite their widespread use in the lab. lottery-choice measures of risk preferences are unproven for predicting real world farming behaviour.,True,u9pw-M4AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,64,https://academic.oup.com/erae/article-abstract/40/5/807/408786,16387851158515103979,/scholar?cites=16387851158515103979,,https://academic.oup.com/erae/article/40/5/807/408786,0,0,0

However. most conservation efforts are incentive-based and voluntary. and neither reward landowners for contiguity nor do they select based on contiguity. Thus. achieving optimal contiguity of conserved parcels is unlikely. Using lab and artefactual field experiments. this paper evaluates two mechanisms in the context of reverse auctions for achieving optimal contiguity: network bonuses and spatial targeting. Results suggest that spatial targeting alone improves the aggregate environmental and social welfare outcomes. while network bonuses alone result in worse outcomes. The interaction of the bonus effect and the targeting effect is positive.

Prior research has shown that climate-related risk exposure influences production decisions such as crop choice; our research shows that adaptation also includes program participation decisions.

Economic theory predicts that the entire subsidy incidence should be on the farmland owners. Using a complementary set of policy quasi experiments. I find that farmers who rent the land they cultivate capture 75 percent of the subsidy. leaving just 25 percent for landowners. This finding contradicts the prediction from neoclassical models.

Floyd. Gardner. Kuchler and Tegene). The degree to which this occurs—the incidence of current expected government payments on current rent—is relevant for policy in two ways. First. it provides information about the distribution of payment benefits vis-a-vis landowners and farmers. For example. if payment benefits are intended for farmers rather than landowners. and the incidence is high. a share of the benefits may miss their target. 1 Because about 60% of US farmland is owned by nonoperators. there is a real potential for this kind of misallocation (Hopkins.

Existing evidence on the incidence of subsidies on cash rental rates is mixed. Identification is obscured by unobserved or imprecisely measured factors that tend to be correlated with subsidies. especially land quality and time-varying factors like commodity prices and adverse weather events. A problem that has received less attention is the fact that subsidies and land quality on rented land may differ from owned land. Since most farms possess both rented and owned acreage. farm-level measures of subsidies. land values. and rental rates may bias estimated incidence.

Critics of food aid argue it has increased the dependence of developing countries on food imports.

The distribution of agricultural subsidies suggests that subsidies become more important as farms get smaller and may play a role in slowing farm size contraction.,True,1br6B44AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,9,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504851.2016.1178837,2728770729865264128,/scholar?cites=2728770729865264128,,https://www.econ-jobs.com/research/64502-US-Farm-Dynamics-and-the-Distribution-of-US-Agricultural-Subsidies.pdf,0,0,0
1147282,The crowd-out effect of crop insurance on farm survival and profitability,2014,Barrett E Kirwan,,,329-2016-12913,,,The Federal Crop Insurance program has expanded dramatically over the past two decades—from $140 million in subsidies and 84 million acres covered to nearly $10 billion in subsidies and 260 million acres covered. The effect this has had on farmers’ overall risk exposure and profitability is unclear. Self-selection and market dynamics have masked the direct effect of crop insurance. This paper uses numerous changes to the crop insurance program to isolate crop insurance’s direct effect on risk exposure and. ultimately. profitability. I find that crop insurance increases debt holdings and acres cash rented and decreases the use of marketing contracts. Crop insurance has no effect on farm profitability. Taken together. crop insurance crowds out other risk-management strategies without improving farm profitability.,True,1br6B44AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC,8,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/170881/,10016013847427438331,/scholar?cites=10016013847427438331,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/170881/files/AAEA2014.pdf,0,0,0

1147284,Essays on US agricultural policy: subsidies. crop insurance. and environmental auctions,2005,Barrett E Kirwan,,,,,,This thesis investigates the unintended consequences of government policy. specifically policy meant to benefit agricultural producers. The first chapter asks how agricultural subsidies affect farmland rental rates. Chapter two examines the relative effects of ad hoc disaster payments and crop insurance. focusing on the potential to smooth income shocks. and the final chapter studies the targeting efficiency of the Conservation Reserve Program. Chapter one exploits exogenous variation in agricultural subsidies to measure the effects on farmland rental rates. The primary finding is that landlords capture one-fifth of the marginal subsidy dollar per acre. This finding stands in contrast to the standard assumption that landlords immediately capture the entire subsidy. There is some evidence that the share of the subsidy captured by landlords increases as the farmland rental market becomes more competitive. The analysis also indicates that the lower effective price of land induces tenants to rent more land such that they gain roughly $1 per dollar of subsidy. Taken together. the results suggest that agricultural subsidies benefit farmers. as well as individuals that own agricultural land. Chapter two exploits random weather variation and exogenous variation in crop insurance take-up in order to investigate the relative effect of two forms of government-provided disaster relief on farm failure rates.,True,1br6B44AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/33831,1337418534957173630,/scholar?cites=1337418534957173630,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/33831/65198872-MIT.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

Current maize yields in Ghana average only one-third of their estimated potential. but this yield gap can be reduced by improving farming practices and growing conditions in Ghana; specifically. yields in Ghana can likely be increased by intensifying the use of inorganic fertilizer. other inputs. and irrigation systems. Recently. Ghana introduced a fertilizer subsidy program to help increase fertilizer-use rates. This paper examines alternate instruments for increasing fertilizer use by determining farm-holder characteristics correlated with inorganic fertilizer use. The results show that the farmer's distance from the closest weekly market. whether the farmer has a pre-harvest contract. and whether the farmer has property rights on the field have a significant effect on fertilizer use.,True,1br6B44AAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barrett_Kirwan/publication/313306063_Factors_Affecting_the_Fertilizer-use_Decision_of_Maize_Farmers_in_Ghana/links/5894f97092851c8bb672d317/Factors-Affecting-the-Fertilizer-use-Decision-of-Maize-Farmers-in-Ghana.pdf,195905654226943019,/scholar?cites=195905654226943019,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barrett_Kirwan/publication/313306063_Factors_Affecting_the_Fertilizer-use_Decision_of_Maize_Farmers_in_Ghana/links/5894f97092851c8bb672d317/Factors-Affecting-the-Fertilizer-use-Decision-of-Maize-Farmers-in-Ghana.pdf,0,0,0

By exploiting random variation in weather and the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994. which mandated crop insurance coverage for the first time. I employ two natural experiments that identify the causal effect of disaster relief on farm failure rates. I examine the survival smoothing contribution of crop insurance by looking at the relative effect of disaster relief across two regimes. pre-and post-1994. Prior to 1994 ad hoc. ex post disaster payments were the primary form of disaster relief. Shortly after the 1994 Act virtually all disaster relief came through crop insurance indemnities. I find that disaster relief in the form of ad hoc disaster payments slightly reduces the average farm failure rate. while average farm failure rates increase under the crop insurance regime. The relative effect suggests that farm failure rates increase by 1.7 percentage points (about 30-percent) under the crop insurance regime. Excessively generous ad hoc disaster payments and moral hazard provide possible explanations for these findings.

However. criticism of the methods used (Kaplan and Zingales. 1997; Erickson and Whited. 2000; Gao. 2002) cast doubt on this answer. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports.“US farms are likely to be financially stable and therefore an inability to take on more debt does not seem to be a concern.”(USDA. 2003) This paper answers this important question by examining the responsiveness of farm investment to shocks in exogenous cash flow. Several empirical papers demonstrate a relationship between farm investment and the availability of internal funds (Hart and Lence. 2004; Bierlen and Featherstone. 1998; Bierlen et al.. 1998). A long-standing criticism of this line of empirical work is the endogeneity of internal funds. eg. increased cash flow might simply signal “improvements in future profitability”(Poterba. 1988).

We isolate the value of this perfectlycomplementary. auxiliary good by endowing consumers with the complete good and giving them the opportunity to pay to upgrade the auxiliary component of the good. We employ a Becker-Degroot-Marschack auction design in a market setting to determine consumers’ actual willingness to pay. We find consumers are willing to pay a $0.67–$1.12 premium for a bioplastic plant container over a traditional plastic one.Horticultural specialty crop production is an $11 billion industry in the US. and plastic plant containers (pots) are a major expense accounting for 5% of total expenditures and 15% of non-labor expenses (National Agricultural Statistics Service 2009). The container cropping industry uses over 4 billion plastic containers each year with ninety-eight percent ending up in landfills representing 1.6 billion pounds of discarded petroleum-based plastics (Mathers.

1147290,Does the Samaritan’s Dilemma Matter? Evidence from Corp Insurance,2014,TATYANA Deryugina and BARRETT Kirwan,,,,,Working Paper,The theory of the Samaritan’s dilemma posits a downside to private or public charity: recipients may begin to rely on free aid instead of their own efforts. An important application is government aid. When the government acts as an “insurer of last resort”. potential beneficiaries may reduce private insurance coverage and instead rely on the government to bail them out. This phenomenon can increase the cost and impact of negative shocks. Anecdotally. it is thought to be an important explanation for the relatively low rates of insurance take-up in some markets. but empirical evidence is scarce. We estimate whether the Samaritan’s dilemma is present in agriculture. where both private crop insurance and frequent federal disaster assistance are present. We use political variation within a county to instrument for disaster aid and subsequently identify the causal relationship between disaster aid and insurance coverage. We find that bailout expectations are qualitatively and quantitatively important for the insurance decision. especially on the intensive margin.,True,1br6B44AAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15437575741676326795&hl=en&oi=scholarr,15437575741676326795,/scholar?cites=15437575741676326795,,,0,0,0

Poverty rates were no higher in these counties than in counties without population loss. We identify remote (from metro areas). thinly settled counties as “frontier” counties. arguing that the lack of access to services and the small labor market sizes in these counties inhibits the inmigration of people and businesses. particularly in the absence of compensating natural amenities. In two of every three low-amenity frontier counties. population loss exceeded 5 percent in 1990-2000. Most of these counties are farming-dependent. less because of their abundance of agriculture than because of their dearth of other economic activities.

The results of a growth model and quasi-experimental control group analysis indicate no discernible impact by the CRP on aggregate county population trends. Aggregate employment growth may have slowed in some high-CRP counties. but only temporarily. High levels of CRP enrollment appear to have affected farm-related businesses over the long run. but growth in the number of other nonfarm businesses moderated CRP's impact on total employment. If CRP contracts had ended in 2001. simulation models suggest that roughly 51 percent of CRP land would have returned to crop production. and that spending on outdoor recreation would decrease by as much as $300 million per year in rural areas. The resulting impacts on employment and income vary widely among regions having similar CRP enrollments. depending upon local economic conditions.,True,teMZHu4AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,150,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=614511,15770199395256547835,/scholar?cites=15770199395256547835,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/33987/files/ae040834.pdf,0,0,0
1147303,How people make a living in rural America,2003,David A McGranahan,,Challenges for rural America in the twenty-first century,,135-151,The Pennsylvania State University Press,People originally moved into rural America to take advantage of its natural resources. whether through hunting. fishing. gathering. farming. mining. or forestry. Employment in these activities peaked in the early 1900s. however. Farm employment has since dropped by about 70 percent. and employment in the other resource industries by half (Freudenberg 1992). Yet in all but a few states. rural (nonmetropolitan) areas now have larger populations than they had in 1920. Some areas have attracted manufacturers seeking to escape the high costs of urban labor and land. Other areas. favored by mild climates. lakes. or mountains. have developed into recreation centers for urban vacationers and retirees. But some areas have retained their dependence on agriculture or mining. which has often meant declining jobs and population. The result is a wide diversity of local rural economies that have in common the limitations and advantages of sparse settlement. This situation is not static. Like other social sciences. rural sociology has been concerned recently with the continued economic viability of rural areas in the context of market globalization and technological change. Rural sociology stands out. however. in its concern with the impact of these changes on the well-being of people who make a living in rural America. This review of recent research on making a living in rural areas is divided into four major sections. The first draws on an ecological perspective to examine the rural role in the broader economy and factors accounting for differences across rural areas.

It is a collage of people and places—a diverse mix of races. ethnic groups. terrain. climate. amenities. businesses. and institutions. No one industry dominates the rural landscape. no single pattern of population decline or growth exists for all rural areas. and no statement about improvements and gaps in well-being applies to all rural people. Some rural areas have shared in the economic progress of the Nation. while others have not. The opportunities and challenges facing rural America are as varied as rural America itself (see box.“Defining Rural Areas”).Farming no longer anchors the rural economy as it did through the mid-20th century. Today. seven out of eight rural counties are dominated by manufacturing. services. and other employment not related to farming. Despite these changes. rural and farm communities are becoming increasingly interdependent. Job growth in agricultural areas is now more likely to come from rural industries related to farming than from farming itself.

Over a third of nonmetro counties lost at least 10 percent of their population through net outmigration over 1988-2008. Some of these counties have had very high poverty rates. substantial loss in manufacturing jobs. and high unemployment. Lack of economic opportunity was likely a major factor in their high outmigration. Most high net outmigration counties. however. are relatively prosperous. with low unemployment rates. low high school dropout rates. and average household incomes. For these counties. low population density and less appealing landscapes distinguish them from other nonmetro counties. Both types of outmigration counties stand out on two measures. indicating that quality-of-life factors inhibit inmigration: a lack of retirees moving in and local manufacturers citing the area’s unattractiveness as a problem in recruiting managers and professionals.,True,teMZHu4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,54,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1711309,16166541163470596116,/scholar?cites=16166541163470596116,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/96769/files/ERR107.pdf,0,0,0

University of Maine,"Recent rural socioeconomic trends. in part the product of the internationalization of markets. provide a severe challenge to rural school systems. On the one hand. ruralfamilies in the 1990s have less to support their children and schools than a decade earlier: poverty rates are up (particularly among children). intact two-parentfamilies are rarer. mothers are more likely to be working. and parental education is lower. On the other hand. schools have become more criticalfor economicfutures. It is increasingly difficult to support afamily without post-secondary education. And rural communities. to avoidfurther declines in the economic well-being oftheir residents. will need to shift their specializationfrom low-skill. low-pay activities to new. higher-skill manufacturing and other activities. To succeed. this shift will require the active. innovative involvement ofrural school systems.Why should people concerned with education care about socioeconomic trends in small town and open country areas of the country?

Many studies have been done regarding the effect on the mean of such distributions but few have addressed the effect on variance. Furthermore. those that have been done generally report the variance from crop simulators. not from observations. This paper examines the potential effects of climate change on crop yield variance in the context of current observed yields and then extrapolates to the effects under projected climate change.

1147333,Three seasons of subsistence insect-resistant maize in South Africa: Have smallholders benefited,2006,Marnus Gouse and Carl Pray and David Schimmelpfennig and Johann Kirsten,,,,,,White maize is the staple food of the majority of the South African population. We examine if smallholder farmers that adopted insect-resistant (Bt) varieties of white maize benefited from planting Bt over the last three seasons. Commercial farmers are known to benefit from planting Bt maize in high stalk borer or corn borer infestation years. but when planted in locations or years when stalk borers are not a problem. Bt will usually not be profitable because of higher seed costs. In the first two production seasons. small farmers enjoyed higher yields with Bt maize than with conventional hybrid varieties despite lower-than-normal (yet still significant) stalk borer pressure and less-than-ideal maize production conditions. Yield is expressed according to grain per kilogram of seed planted. as seeding rates per land area differ drastically between small-scale farmers. The value of the yield benefit depended on how the farmer utilized the additional grain. with the highest valued use being home grinding and consumption substituting for more expensive store purchases. In the third season. which was also the fourth consecutive drier-than-usual season. the stalk borer infestation level was very low. and farmers who planted Bt maize had yields similar to farmers who planted conventional hybrids.,True,RfdSXkoAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,114,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/8482,9560239981143985966,/scholar?cites=9560239981143985966,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/8482/PDF,0,0,0

With little growth in total measured use of agricultural inputs. the extraordinary performance of the US farm sector was driven mainly by increases in total factor productivity (TFP-measured as output per unit of aggregate input). Over the last six decades. the mix of agricultural inputs used shifted significantly. with increased use of intermediate goods (eg. fertilizer and pesticides) and less use of labor and land. The output mix changed as well. with crop production growing faster than livestock production.

1147346,Uncertainty in economic models of climate-change impacts,1996,David Schimmelpfennig,33,Climatic Change,2,213-234,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Uncertainty is poorly represented in existing studies of climate-change impacts. Methods that have been used to characterize uncertainty in the literature are described and the limitations of each discussed. It is found that two broad characterizations are useful. A large number of studies are based on several specific scenarios or attempt to randomize selected variables in their deterministic economic models. Other studies describe individual or collective reaction to risk. The first category falls short of an adequate representation of uncertainty by focusing primarily on a few values of variables included to capture variability. The second group of studies tend to focus more on behavior than impacts. What is needed are Monte Carlo type simulations where randomness is apparent in a series of independent draws from a distribution suitably adjusted for climate change.

1147347,Is US agricultural productivity growth slowing?,2013,Eldon Ball and David Schimmelpfennig and Sun Ling Wang,35,Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,3,435-450,Oxford University Press,This paper uses statistics on agricultural productivity compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service to test the productivity slowdown hypothesis. The indexes of productivity growth span the years 1948 to 2009. In our analysis. we apply econometric techniques that allow for multiple structural breaks at unknown points in time and in various forms. The tests identify a break in trend in 1974 and an intercept shift in 1985. These results point to slower productivity growth in agriculture beginning in 1974. Prior to 1974. productivity grew at an annual rate of 1.71%. but this slowed to 1.56% after 1974. This slower rate of productivity growth persisted after the intercept shift in 1985 but from a higher absolute level of productivity.,True,RfdSXkoAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,57,https://academic.oup.com/aepp/article-abstract/35/3/435/8187,3653877678778446683,/scholar?cites=3653877678778446683,,https://academic.oup.com/aepp/article-pdf/35/3/435/24409/ppt014.pdf,0,0,0

The commercial collection of these products could reduce both the number of species and population of a species in the forests. In order to keep the balance between biodiversity and commercial collection of NTFPs. this paper evaluates the dependence of forest dwellers on NTFPs and identifies the relation between household characteristics and cash income generated by NTFP collection. As a result. commercial collection of NTFPs is negatively correlated to dependency ratio. poverty level and distance to the provincial city. and positively correlated with female labors of households. Moreover. NTFPs are proved to be very important in poor households or in those who lack rice or high rate of female labor.

Implicit in this line of research is the assertion that the traditional quadratic model of crop yield suffers from specification bias.

In order to speak to the global flexibility of FFT. as well as to provide both robustness to outliers and information on the scale effects of weather variables. this article compares FFT with restricted cubic spline (RCS) and quadratic models in a quantile regression framework.

1147352,Conditional Suspension of the US Ethanol Mandate Using Threshold Price inside a Competitive Storage Model,2013,Michael J Roberts and A Nam Tran,,,,,,In 2012. EPA turned down request to suspend the US ethanol mandate on the ground that doing so would not result in lower corn prices. Given that ethanol production accounts for more than 40 percent of the US annual corn harvest together with current trend of extreme weather events. it is likely that a similar request will resurface in the future. We therefore use a competitive storage model to investigate how a waiver of the US ethanol mandate. conditional on high corn price. might affect corn prices and consume welfares. It is found that although waiving the mandate when the price was at the level in 2012 would only result in moderate decrease of long run corn prices. the price volatility reductions are much larger. In addition. if the US corn yield in 2013 is as low as it was in 2012. suspending 20 percent of the mandate in 2012 will result in a price drop of 18 percent in 2013. higher than EPA’s estimate of less than 1 percent.

Using longitudinal data collected for owner-cum-sharecroppers in Amhara.

This paper considers how a rational. forwardlooking and competitive commodity market would account for these anticipated changes and thereby influence time path of storage. prices. price volatility. and social welfare. We forecast 1600 hypothetical yield paths from 2000 to 2080 using estimates from a recent global statistical analysis of weather and crop yields combined with projections from 16 climate models. We then extend the dynamic competitive storage model to account for land response to price and anticipated yield shift. We simulate 1600 stochastic-equilibrium price paths under climate change relative to a baseline of stable prices using our hypothetical yield paths together with estimated demand and supply elasticities and storage cost from the literature. Our results indicate that. under the impact of climate change. world crop price level will increase twofold and world crop price volatility will increase fivefold between 2000 and 2080.

1147355,Commodity Price Adjustment in a Competitive Storage Model with an Application to the US Biofuel Policies,2012,Michael J Roberts and A Nam Tran,,,323-2016-11729,,,When demand for a commodity shifts permanently outward. the effect of the shift on the level and volatility of prices will differ over the short run and long run depending on:(1) how early the market anticipates the demand shock;(2) the elasticities of supply and demand in the new environment as compared to the old environment; and (3) inventories available when news of the impending demand shock arrives. We analyze the relative importance of these three features on food prices using a modified version of the storage model that allows demand to change over time. Model parameters are found using a grid search that minimizes the difference between simulated and observed data. We then use the model to evaluate the effect of the US ethanol mandate on world food prices. In line with earlier studies. we find that the US ethanol mandate. by shifting the world demand out by more than 5 percent in 2015. can account for 11 to 30 percent of the food price increase between 2005 and 2011 depending on demand and supply elasticities before and after the demand shift.

We consider four policies that could be combined with unilateral emissions pricing to counter effects on international competitiveness: a border charge on imports. a border rebate for exports. full border adjustment. and domestic output-based rebating. Each option faces different potential legal hurdles in international trade law; each also has different economic impacts. While all can support competitiveness. none is necessarily effective at reducing global emissions. Nor is it possible to rank order the options; effectiveness depends on the relative emissions rates. elasticities of substitution. and consumption volumes.

But the general consensus is that little or no actual liberalization was achieved. and that the services-trade negotiations merely established the institutional structure for negotiating liberalization in the future. The focus of this study thus shifted to the more hypothetical one of examining what the effects of services liberalization might be when it finally occurs. For this purpose. we used Hoekman's (1995)“guesstimates” of the size of trade barriers in services and calculated the effects of an assumed 25 percent reduction in these barriers. which is a reduction that we believe represents a plausible order of magnitude that may eventually be achieved. To provide a benchmark for comparison. we have also calculated the effects of the liberalization in tariffs for industrial products that actually was negotiated. Our focus is on the world's major trading countries/regions which account for the largest part of trade in services and merchandise. Several results emerge from our analysis.First. the effects of liberalization in services trade are of the same order of magnitude as for liberalization in industrial products. Despite the fact that trade in services is smaller than trade in industrial products. the size of the services sectors. and thus the size of their trade barriers. is large. Because liberalization in services trade is just starting on a process that in the goods sectors began fifty years ago and is now almost complete. it has substantial scope for expanding trade and welfare in the world's economies.

A large literature advocates the use of CO2 pricing and recycling the revenues to lower distorting taxes as a way to minimize costs. In this paper. we explore the implications of labor tax interactions for cost-effectiveness of border adjustments and other measures to cope with leakage. We find that. for plausible values of labor supply elasticities. the cost savings from revenue recycling are significant—from 15 to 25%. The cost savings from anti-leakage measures are generally smaller. but also significant. particularly for small coalitions or more binding reduction targets.

Particularly. energy-intensive industries competing with foreign competitors could lose their international edge. Although the abatement of CO2 emissions in industrialized countries entails the reduction of their energy-intensive production. a corresponding increase in the production of energy-intensive goods in countries without CO2 regulations may lead to carbon “leakage.” This paper examines the effects of various allocation methods of emissions permits in the Japanese ETS on the economy and CO2 emissions using a multiregional and multisector computable general equilibrium model.

1147376,On the scope for output-based rebating in climate policy,2011,Carolyn Fischer and Alan Fox,,,,,,The allocation of tradable emissions permits has important efficiency and distributional effects in the presence of preexisting distortions. Three such imperfections are noteworthy for the “downstream” implementation of a domestic emissions trading program for greenhouse gases: 1) distorting labor taxes in the economy. 2) emissions “leakage” due to the lack of comparable emissions pricing abroad. and 3) incomplete coverage of the trading program. which allows domestic leakage. Because regulations that raise the price of covered sector goods exacerbate these problems. a potential response is to combine the emissions price with a rebate to production. such as by output-based allocations (OBA) of emissions permits. We employ a multi-sector computable general equilibrium model based on the GTAP framework to compare different rules for allocating carbon allowances among the major emissions-intensive sectors within a trading program in the US economy. We find that OBA for energy-intensive. trade-exposed sectors can dominate auctioning with revenue recycling.

We present different rules for allocating carbon allowances within sectors (lump-sum grandfathering. outputbased allocation [OBA]. and auctioning) and among sectors (historical emissions and value-added shares). Using a partial equilibrium model. we explore how OBA mitigates price increases. limits incentives for conservation in favor of lowering energy intensity. and changes relative output prices among sectors. We then use a computable general equilibrium model from the Global Trade Analysis Project. modified to incorporate a labor/leisure choice. to compare overall mechanism performance. The output subsidies implicit in OBA mitigate tax interactions. which can lead to higher welfare than grandfathering. OBA with sectoral distributions based on value added generates effective subsidies similar to a broad-based tax reduction. performing nearly like auctioning with revenue recycling. which generates the highest welfare. OBA based on historical emissions supports the output of more polluting industries. which more effectively counteracts carbon leakage but is more costly in welfare terms.

1147387,Predicting the effects of NAFTA with the BDS.

Canada. and Mexico under NAFTA. Our paper has two objectives. First is to evaluate the predictions made by GTAP against the actual post-NAFTA changes in NAFTA trade. Recent literature (Kehoe. 2005; Shikher. 2012) finds that pre-NAFTA predictions of the effects of NAFTA on trade have little correlation with the actual changes. Therefore. we wanted to investigate whether GTAP could have produced accurate predictions if it were used before NAFTA. The second objective is to compare the predictions of GTAP against the predictions of a general equilibrium model based on the Eaton and Kortum (2002) methodology with heterogeneous producers. We wanted to investigate if the two models would produce different predictions and investigate the sources of these differences. We find that the changes in NAFTA trade predicted by GTAP using pre-NAFTA data are much closer to what actually happened after NAFTA than the changes predicted by the pre-NAFTA studies we looked at (Brown. Deardorff. and Stern. 1992; Roland-Holst. Reinert. and Shiells. 1994). GTAP’s predictions are also close to those of the model with heterogeneous producers. though the latter’s predictions are more closely correlated with the actual changes.

Port inefficiency and its impact,2011,Paul Kent and Alan Fox,,International Handbook of Maritime Economics,,405,Edward Elgar Publishing,Recent research has shown how transport inefficiencies affect development. trade success and foreign investment. Hummels (1999) provides evidence of the impact of high transportation costs (determined by distance to source and export markets). on development. Henderson et al.(2001) explore how transport costs influence trade and welfare. Hoffmann and Kumar (2002) show a symbiotic relationship between trade and maritime transport and their interplay with globalization. Other studies show the precise impact of high transport costs. Limao and Venables (2001). for example. show that increasing transport costs by 10 percent can reduce trade volumes by 20 percent; Radelet and Sachs (1998) show that a doubling of shipping costs can slow annual economic growth by about half a percentage point.While these studies illustrate the effect of transport on trade flow patterns and the importance of transport costs to trade success. some use distance as a proxy for transport costs in their analysis. High transport costs. however. can be explained by many other factors. such as lower cargo volumes. trade flow imbalances. inadequate infrastructure. onerous border and cargo processing procedures. and port inefficiencies. Port costs. for example. represent about 8–12 percent of total transport costs from product origin to destination. Shippers. who consider port costs as one of the very few. if not the only. controllable costs in the logistics chain. make shipping decisions in part based on those costs.

We then use two centuries of US interest rate data to quantify this effect. Using both random walk and mean-reverting models. we compute the “certainty-equivalent rate” that summarizes the effect of uncertainty and measures the appropriate forward rate of discount in the future. Under the random walk model we find that the certainty-equivalent rate falls continuously from 4% to 2% after 100 years. 1% after 200 years. and 0.5% after 300 years. At horizons of 400 years. the discounted value increases by a factor of over 40.000 relative to conventional discounting.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated. and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates. then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates.

Although most of the debate on global climate change policy has focused on quantity controls due to their political appeal. this paper argues that price controls are more efficient. Simulations based on a stochastic computable general equilibrium model indicate that the expected welfare gain from the optimal price policy is five times higher than the expected gain from the optimal quantity policy. An alternative hybrid policy combines both the political appeal of quantity controls with the efficiency of prices. using an initial distribution of tradeable permits to set a quantitative target. but allowing additional permits to be purchased at a fixed “trigger” price.

We then use two centuries of US interest rate data to quantify this effect. Using both random walk and mean-reverting models. we compute the “certainty-equivalent rate” that summarizes the effect of uncertainty and measures the appropriate forward rate of discount in the future. Under the random walk model we find that the certainty-equivalent rate falls continuously from 4% to 2% after 100 years. 1% after 200 years. and 0.5% after 300 years. At horizons of 400 years. the discounted value increases by a factor of over 40.000 relative to conventional discounting.

Yet. there have been few attempts to factor such uncertainty into current policy decisions concerning stringency and instrument choice. This paper presents a framework for determining optimal climate change policy under uncertainty and compares the resulting prescriptions to those derived from a more typical analysis with best-guess parameter values.

Europe. and Japan,2007,Richard D Morgenstern and William Aaron Pizer,,,,,Resources for the Future,"Publisher description: Since the early 1990s. voluntary programs have played an increasingly prominent role in environmental management in the US and other industrialized countries. Programs have attempted to address problems ranging from climate change and energy efficiency to more localized air and water pollution problems. But do they work? Despite a growing theoretical literature about how and why voluntary programs might be effective. there is limited empirical evidence on their success or the situations most conducive to their approaches. Even less is known about their cost-effectiveness. Getting credible answers to these questions is important. Research to date has been largely limited to individual programs. and protagonists and antagonists to the trend are at ever greater disagreement. sometimes drawing opposite conclusions about the same program. This innovative book seeks to clarify what is known by looking at a range of program types. including different approaches adopted in different nations. The focus is on assessing actual performance via seven case studies. including the US Climate Wise program. the US EPA's 33/50 program on toxic chemicals. the UK Climate Change Agreements. and the Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan in Japan. The central goals of Reality Check are understanding outcomes and the relationship between outcomes and design.

1147431,Prices vs. quantities revisited: the case of climate change,1997,William A Pizer,,,1318-2016-103316,,,Uncertainty about compliance costs causes otherwise equivalent price and quantity controls to behave differently. Price controls–in the form of taxes–fix the marginal cost of compliance and lead to uncertain levels of compliance. Meanwhile quantity controls–in the form of tradable permits or quotas–fix the level of compliance but result in uncertain marginal costs. This fundamental difference in the face of cost uncertainty leads to different welfare outcomes for the two policy instruments. Seminal work by Weitzman (1974) clarified this point and derived theoretical conditions under which one policy is preferred to the other. This paper applies this principal to the issue of worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) control. using a global integrated climate economy model to simulate the consequences of uncertainty and to compare the efficiency of taxes and permits empirically. The results indicate that an optimal tax policy generates gains which are five times higher than the optimal permit policy–a $337 billion dollar gain versus $69 billion at the global level. This result follows from Weitzman’s original intuition that relatively flat marginal benefits/damages favor taxes. a feature that drops out of standard assumptions about the nature of climate damages. A hybrid policy. suggested by Roberts and Spence (1976). is also explored. Such a policy uses an initial distribution of tradeable permits to set a target emission level. but then allows additional permits to be purchased at a fixed “trigger” price. The optimal hybrid policy leads to welfare benefits only slightly higher than the optimal tax policy. Relative to the tax policy. however. the hybrid preserves the ability to …,True,Im8TwrIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,210,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10498/,13016732063541852126,/scholar?cites=13016732063541852126,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10498/files/dp980002.pdf,0,0,0

The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has some distinctive features that differentiate it from the more standard model of emissions trading. In particular. it has a relatively decentralized structure that gives individual member states responsibility for setting targets. allocating permits. determining verification and enforcement. and making some choices about flexibility.  It is also a “cap-within-a-cap.” seeking to achieve the Kyoto targets while only covering about half of the EU emissions.

1147433,Managing permit markets to stabilize prices,2005,Richard Newell and William Pizer and Jiangfeng Zhang,31,Environmental and Resource Economics,2,133-157,Kluwer Academic Publishers,The political economy of environmental policy favors the use of quantity-based instruments over price-based instruments (e.g.. tradable permits over green taxes). at least in the United States. With cost uncertainty. however. there are clear efficiency advantages to prices in cases where the marginal damages of emissions are relatively flat. such as with greenhouse gases. The question arises. therefore. of whether one can design flexible quantity policies that mimic the behavior of price policies. namely stable permit prices and abatement costs. We explore a number of “quantity-plus” policies that replicate the behavior of a price policy through rules that adjust the effective permit cap for unexpectedly low or high costs. They do so without necessitating any monetary exchanges between the government and the regulated firms. which can be a significant political barrier to the use of price instruments.,True,Im8TwrIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,166,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10640-005-1761-y.pdf,15885551255575226918,/scholar?cites=15885551255575226918,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10524/files/dp030034.pdf,0,0,0

Resources for the future discussion paper",12-53,,,In September 2011. the US Environmental Protection Agency asked 12 economists how the benefits and costs of regulations should be discounted for projects that affect future generations. This paper summarizes the views of the panel on three topics: the use of the Ramsey formula as an organizing principle for determining discount rates over long horizons. whether the discount rate should decline over time. and how intra-and intergenerational discounting practices can be made compatible. The panel members agree that the Ramsey formula provides a useful framework for thinking about intergenerational discounting. We also agree that theory provides compelling arguments for a declining certainty-equivalent discount rate. In the Ramsey formula. uncertainty about the future rate of growth in per capita consumption can lead to a declining consumption rate of discount. assuming that shocks to consumption are positively correlated. This uncertainty in future consumption growth rates may be estimated econometrically based on historic observations. or it can be derived from subjective uncertainty about the mean rate of growth in mean consumption or its volatility. Determining the remaining parameters of the Ramsey formula is. however. challenging.,True,Im8TwrIAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,154,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199511,5103197781165317707,/scholar?cites=5103197781165317707,,https://www.rff.org/documents/1564/RFF-DP-12-53.pdf,0,0,0

1147436,38 Choosing Price or Quantity Controls for Greenhouse Gases,2006,William A Pizer,,The RFF Reader in Environmental and Resource Policy,,225,Resources for the Future,Much of the debate surrounding climate change has centered on verifying the threat of climate change and deciding the magnitude of an appropriate response. After years of negotiation. this effort led to the 1997 signing of the Kyoto Protocol. a binding commitment by industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to slightly below 1990 recorded levels. Without approving or disapproving of the response effort embodied in the Kyoto Protocol. I believe that an important element has been ignored. Namely. should we specify our response to climate change in terms of a quantitative target?The appeal of a quantitative target is obvious. A commitment to a particular emissions level provides a straightforward measure of environmental progress as well as compliance. Commitment to an emissions tax. for example. offers neither a guarantee that emissions will be limited to a certain level nor an obvious way to measure a country’s compliance (when other taxes and subsidies already exist).

We study profit maximizing Cournot producers facing an ideal third party access regime for gas transport. Producers sell gas either to large users in the manufacturing industry and to gas-fired thermal power plants. or to local distribution companies. We first examine the case where no traders exploit arbitrage possibilities and some producers have limited access to the markets. In this equilibrium net prices differ across markets. These differences disappear in the second case where traders are introduced. The third case focuses on a complete European market for natural gas in which traders exploit all arbitrage possibilities and all producers can sell gas in all markets. We also study the impact on the complete European market of changes in costs for production. transport. and distribution. Finally. welfare implications from a liberalization of the West-European natural gas markets are discussed.

Our analysis shows that the timing of optimal emission reduction policy strongly depends on the set of policy instruments available. When climate-specific R&D targeting instruments are available. policy has to use these to step up early innovation. When these instruments are not available. policy has to steer innovation through creating demand for emission saving technologies.

The prospect of rising carbon prices raises concerns in these nations about the effects on the competitiveness of their own energy-intensive industries and the potential for carbon leakage. particularly leakage to emerging economies that lack comparable regulation. In response. certain developed countries are proposing controversial trade-related measures and allowance allocation designs to complement their climate policies. Missing from much of the debate on trade-related measures is a broader understanding of how climate policies implemented unilaterally (or subglobally) affect all countries in the global trading system. Arguably. the largest impacts are from the targeted carbon pricing itself. which generates macroeconomic effects. terms-of-trade changes. and shifts in global energy demand and prices; it also changes the relative prices of certain energy-intensive goods.

We explore whether the policy should be especially stringent in order to spur a successful export industry based on abatement technology.

Nevertheless. according to Böhringer and Lange [On the design of optimal grandfathering schemes for emission allowances. Europ. Econ.

A major challenge is emissions leakage. Border carbon adjustments and output-based allocation of emissions allowances can increase effectiveness of unilateral action but introduce distortions of their own. We assess antileakage measures as a function of abatement coalition size. We first develop a partial equilibrium analytical framework to see how these instruments affect emissions within and outside the coalition. We then employ a computable general equilibrium model of international trade and energy use to assess the strategies as the coalition grows. We find that full border adjustments rank first in global cost-effectiveness. followed by import tariffs and output-based rebates.

Previous studies suggest that emission pricing combined with border carbon adjustment is a second-best instrument. and more cost-effective than output-based rebating. We show that the combination of output-based rebating and a consumption tax for emission-intensive and trade-exposed goods can be equivalent with border carbon adjustment. Moreover. it is welfare improving for a region that implements emission pricing along with output-based rebating to introduce such a consumption tax. The welfare gain is particularly large if output-based rebating is already implemented for a sector that is not much exposed to leakage. e.g.. due to uncertainty about exposure or due to lobbying activities.

We systematically consider alternative designs for such tariffs. and analyze their effects on global welfare within a multi-region. multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of global trade and energy.

In a model with emission reduction through clean energy deployment. and with R&D increasing the overall productivity of clean energy. we describe optimal R&D policies jointly with emission pricing policies. We find that while emission prices can be set at the Pigouvian level independently of innovation policy. the optimal level of R&D subsidies and patent lifetime change with the stages of the climate problem. In the early stages of clean energy development. innovators find it more difficult to capture the social value of their innovations. Thus. for a given finite patent lifetime. optimal clean energy R&D subsidies are initially high. but then fall over time.

Externalities from the environment on production are central in the analysis. and we examine whether an optimal path realizes more rapid economic growth. The paper focuses mainly on developing countries. where production is largely influenced by the environmental quality. The result of the analysis indicates that the economic growth rate may not depend on the internalization of the environmental externality. but rather on the internalization of the human capital externality.

Since the EU ETS covers only some industries. it implies a hybrid emission control scheme where EU member states must apply complementary domestic emissions regulation for the non-trading sectors of their economies in order to comply with their national emission reduction targets. The EU ETS thus opens up for strategic partitioning of national emissions budgets by the member states between trading and non-trading sectors. In this paper we examine the potential effects of such strategic behavior on compliance cost and emissions prices. We show that concerns on efficiency losses from strategic partitioning are misplaced.

We apply two intertemporal equilibrium models of the global oil market; one consisting of a cartel and a fringe. and one describing a hypothetical competitive market. Comparing the outcome of these models we conclude that there are positive cartelisation gains of about 18 percent in the oil market. In comparison with what Pindyck (1978) found for the 1970s this may be considered as quite modest. Moreover. we study whether the cartelisation gains to OPEC are altered by different moves by non-OPEC producers or consumer countries. Generally. we find that the relative cartelisation gains are unchanged. One exception is exploration activities. where we find that a major increase in non-OPEC reserves could remove the cartelisation gains to OPEC completely.

Fuel taxes have restrained growth in fuel demand and associated carbon emissions. Although fuel demand is large and growing. our analysis shows that it would have been much higher in the absence of domestic fuel taxes. People often assert that fuel demand is inelastic but there is strong research evidence showing the opposite. The price elasticity is in fact quite high but only in the long-run: in the short run it may be quite inelastic which has important implications for policy makers.

Both of these factors depend on the assumptions made concerning the underlying utility and welfare functions. It is common to aggregate welfare gains and losses across generations and countries as if the utility of money were constant. but it is not. If we assume that a e CO2-equivalent dlubling implies costs equal to 1.5% of the income in both high and low income countries. a pure rate of time preference equal to zero. and a utility function which is logarithmic in income. then the marginal cost of CO2 emissions is estimated at 260–590 USD/ton C for a time horizon in the range 300–1000 years. an estimate which is large enough to justify significant reductions of CO2 emissions on purely economic grounds.

An often-overlooked message is that we should discount costs but also take into account the increase in the relative price of the ecosystem service endangered. The effect of discounting would thus be counteracted. and if the rate of price rise of the item was fast enough. it might even be reversed. The scarcity that leads to rising relative prices for the environmental good will also have direct effects on the discount rate itself. The magnitude of these effects depends on properties of the economy’s technology and on social preferences.

1147479,Discounting and relative prices,2007,Michael Hoel and Thomas Sterner,84,Climatic Change,3,265-280,Springer Netherlands,Environmentalists are often upset at the effect of discounting costs of future environmental damage. e.g.. due to climate change. An often-overlooked message is that we should discount costs but also take into account the increase in the relative price of the ecosystem service endangered. The effect of discounting would thus be counteracted. and if the rate of price rise of the item was fast enough. it might even be reversed. The scarcity that leads to rising relative prices for the environmental good will also have direct effects on the discount rate itself. The magnitude of these effects depends on properties of the economy’s technology and on social preferences.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated. and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates. then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. There is a growing empirical literature that estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the DDR schedule. However. this literature has been criticized because it lacks a connection to the theory of project evaluation. In benefit-cost analysis. the net benefits of a project in year t (in consumption units) are discounted to the present at the rate at which society would trade consumption in year t for consumption in the present.

To economists this should be no surprise yet it seems that the role of fuel taxation as an instrument of climate policy has not been fully appreciated. It is however one of the few policy instruments that. since several decades. has actually reduced fuel consumption appreciably. Thanks to taxation (mainly in Europe and Japan). carbon emissions are considerably lower than they would have been otherwise. In future where carbon emissions are to be cut drastically. this instrument will be crucial. There is however much opposition to the instrument. This opposition uses various arguments. for instance that fuel taxes hurt the poor since they are strongly regressive.

1147485,Fuel taxes and the poor: the distributional effects of gasoline taxation and their implications for climate policy,2012,Thomas Sterner,,,,,Routledge,Fuel Taxes and the Poor challenges the conventional wisdom that gasoline taxation. an important and much-debated instrument of climate policy. has a disproportionately detrimental effect on poor people. Increased fuel taxes carry the potential to mitigate carbon emissions. reduce congestion. and improve local urban environment. As such. higher gasoline taxes could prove to be a fundamental part of any climate action plan. However. they have been resisted by powerful lobbies that have persuaded people that increased fuel taxation would be regressive. Reporting on examples of over two dozen countries. this book sets out to empirically investigate this claim. The authors conclude that while there may be some slight regressivity in some high-income countries. as a general rule. fuel taxation is a progressive policy particularly in low income countries. Rich countries can correct for regressivity by cutting back on other taxes that adversely affect poor people. or by spending more money on services for the poor. Meanwhile. in low-income countries. poor people spend a very small share of their money on fuel for transport. Some costs from fuel taxes may be passed on to poor people through more expensive public transportation and food transport. Nevertheless. in general the authors find that gasoline taxes become more progressive as the income of the country in question decreases. This book provides strong arguments for the proponents of environmental taxation.

There has been a marked increase in national policies and legislation on climate change since the AR4 with a diversity of approaches and a multiplicity of objectives (see Section 15.2). However. Figure 1.9 of Chapter 1 suggests that these policies. taken together. have not yet achieved a substantial deviation in emissions from the past trend. Limiting concentrations to levels that would be consistent with a likely probability of maintaining temperature increases below 2 degrees C this century (scenarios generally in the range of 430-480 ppmv CO2eq) would require that emissions break from these trends and be decreased substantially. In contrast. concentrations exceed 1000 ppmv CO2eq by 2100 in many baseline scenarios (that is. scenarios without additional efforts to reduce emissions).   The literature on mitigation scenarios provides a wide range of CO2 shadow price levels consistent with these goals. with estimates of less than US$50/tCO2 in 2020 in many studies and exceeding US$100/tCO2 in others. assuming a globally-efficient and immediate effort to reduce emissions. These shadow prices exhibit a strongly increasing trend thereafter. Policies and instruments are assessed in this light.   Section 15.2 assesses the role of institutions and governance. Section 15.3 lays out the classification of policy instruments and packages. while 15.4 discusses the methodologies used to evaluate policies and institutions.

A number of economists have questioned some of the more technical aspects of the exercise—for example. what is indicated by estimates that mix together replacement costs and willingness-to-pay damage components. the extent of double-counting. and the intimation that this aggregation of disparate component estimates can be meaningfully compared with a measure of value-added economic activity like GDP. Others have decried what appears to be a retreat from the core principles of ecological economics into a highly reductionistic calculation of economic value using what those critics view as dubious methodology. 1These criticisms suggest that the Nature piece is wanting as a scientific treatise. regardless of one’s disciplinary perspective. I believe that it can best be read as a political document. one designed principally to ‘‘stimulate additional research and debate’’(the last of the authors’ five goals) by expressing the authors’ view that the value of ecosystem services is not only large but underappreciated.

Using a detailed electricity model linked to an integrated assessment framework to value changes in human health. we find a tax of $25 per metric ton of carbon emissions would yield NOx-related health benefits of about $8 per metric ton of carbon reduced in the year 2010 (1997 dollars). Additional savings of $4–$7 accrue from reduced investment in NOx and SO2 abatement in order to comply with emission caps. Total ancillary benefits of a $25 carbon tax are $12–$14. which appear to justify the costs of a $25 tax. although marginal benefits are less than marginal costs. At a tax of $75. greater total benefits are achieved but the value per ton of carbon reductions remains roughly constant at about $12.,True,yGHcsBkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,348,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069602000220,13893832746038659945,/scholar?cites=13893832746038659945,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/10664/files/dp010061.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,"In large part. the literature on energy and development focuses on how energy demand is driven by economic development and on how energy services can be improved for developing countries. In this paper we begin with a conceptual discussion to identify the channels through which increased availability of energy services might act as a"" key"" stimulus of economic development along different stages of the development process. We then examine some empirical work to see what evidence it might provide regarding the importance of the possible channels of influence. We do find some important illustrations of a disproportionate role for energy. However. that evidence also underscores the importance of energy development in concert with other forms of development. Moreover. the amount of relevant literature we found was fairly limited. and in many cases it was difficult to separate out various influences in the study to see how energy might be exerting a disproportionate role relative to other influences.

1147498,41 The Difficulty in Defining Sustainability,2006,Michael A Toman,,The RFF reader in environmental and resource policy,,247,Resources for the Future,“Sustainability” has become a new watchword by which individuals. organizations. and nations are to assess human impacts on the natural environment and resource base. A concern that economic development. exploitation of natural resources. and infringement on environmental resources are not sustainable is expressed more and more frequently in analytical studies. conferences. and policy debates. This concern is a central theme in the international deliberations leading up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992. To identify what may be required to achieve sustainability. it is necessary to have a clear understanding of what sustainability means. Like many evocative terms. the word sustainability (or the phrase “sustainable development.” which more strongly connotes concerns of particular importance to developing countries) means many things to different people and can be used in reference to a number of important issues. The term inherently evokes a concept of preservation and nurturing over time. The World Commission on Environment and Development (known popularly as the Brundtland Commission) labeled sustainable development in its 1987 report Our Common Future as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Thus sustainability involves some notion of respect for the interests of our descendants. Beyond this point. however. uncertainty and disagreement are rife.

Accordingly. the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effect thereof.” The phrase “common but differentiated responsibilities” has become a touchstone for the international climate equity debate. During the first Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-1; held in 1995 in Berlin. Germany). negotiators debated whether developing countries. in addition to developed countries. would commit to binding reductions for GHG emissions. The developing countries ultimately rejected binding commitments. asserting that the historical responsibility for climate change was not theirs. that they had less financial ability to pay for reductions. and that they had more urgent priorities for their limited resources.

Several conclusions follow from our analysis regarding the potential sources of market failure and possible remedies.

Using a simple general equilibrium approach. we consider the possibility that the assimilative capacity of the environment is eventually exhausted by pollution accumulation. In this case. there is a nonconvexity in the problem that gives rise to multiple potential optima; environmental quality may be preserved or completely degraded in the long term. We characterize the circumstances under which phasing out dirty production is consistent with an intertemporally optimizing path and we discuss the design of price-based and quantity-based policies for supporting an optimal solution with the nonconvexity.,True,yGHcsBkAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,66,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765500000221,6886470895746686419,/scholar?cites=6886470895746686419,,,0,0,0

Motivations range from energy security to environmental preservation to green jobs and innovation. and measures comprise an array of subsidies to mandates to emissions trading. But do these policies work together or at cross-purposes? To evaluate RES-E policies. one must understand how specific policy mechanisms interact with each other and under what conditions multiple policy levers are necessary.

The resource economics literature rarely addresses such labor allocation decisions of artisanal fishers and how. in turn. these contribute to the impact of MPAs on fish stocks. yield. and income. This paper develops a spatial bio-economic model of a fishery adjacent to a village of people who allocate their labor between fishing and on-shore wage opportunities to establish a spatial Nash equilibrium at a steady state fish stock in response to various locations for no-take zone MPAs and managed access MPAs. Villagers’ fishing location decisions are based on distance costs. fishing returns. and wages. Here. the MPA location determines its impact on fish stocks. fish yield. and villager income due to distance costs. congestion. and fish dispersal. Incorporating wage labor opportunities into the framework allows examination of the MPA’s impact on rural incomes. with results determining that win-wins between yield and stocks occur in very different MPA locations than do win-wins between income and stocks. Similarly. villagers in a high-wage setting face a lower burden from MPAs than do those in low-wage settings. Motivated by issues of central importance in Tanzania and Costa Rica. we impose various policies on this fishery – location specific no-take zones. increasing on-shore wages. and restricting MPA access to a subset of villagers – to analyze the impact of an MPA on fish stocks and rural incomes in such settings.,True,KcsufWMAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,6,http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/44444/,5892879224710742209,/scholar?cites=5892879224710742209,,,0,0,0

University of Maryland and University of Massachusetts at Amherst,Groundwater is a key resource for agricultural production globally. Both increasingly rapid drawdowns of aquifers as well the policies intended to increase aquifer sustainability increase costs to agricultural producers. with unknown consequences. In this paper. we provide the first large-scale empirical estimates of how farmers respond to changes in groundwater costs in one of the world’s most valuable agricultural areas: California. To do this. we assemble a novel dataset that combines (i) detailed restricted-access microdata on farmers’ electricity consumption.(ii) rich data from technical audits of these farmers’ pump efficiencies.(iii) measurements of groundwater depths in California aquifers. and (iv) satellite-derived measures of crop cover. For identification. we leverage exogenous variation in the price of electricity. a key marginal input into the groundwater production function. We find that farmers are very price responsive: we estimate large price elasticities of demand for electricity (− 1.17) and groundwater (− 1.12). We demonstrate that crop switching and fallowing are the main channel through which farmers respond to increases in groundwater costs. Using a discrete choice model. we estimate that a counterfactual $10 per-acre-foot groundwater tax—approximately the price increase required to meet California’s sustainability targets—would lead farmers to reallocate 8 percent of cropland. with increases in fallowing and high-value fruit and nut perennials. and decreases in annual crops and low-value perennials.,True,KcsufWMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1,https://epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Groundwater-Energy-And-Crop-Choice.pdf,1045975792981586575,/scholar?cites=1045975792981586575,,https://epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Groundwater-Energy-And-Crop-Choice.pdf,0,0,0
1147529,Three Essays on Energy Economics,2018,Louis Demetri Preonas,,,,,,Electricity powers the modern economy. and the electricity supply chain is notoriously complex. Power plants must develop stable relationships for fuel procurement. as their long-run profitability hinges on securing a cheap. reliable fuel supply. Electric utilities may also lack the incentive to provide a reliable power supply to all potential customers. which could hamper economic productivity. The physical properties of electricity transmission create inherent challenges in providing power to all regions of the grid. while simultaneously incentivizing economically efficient production decisions. In this dissertation. I study three potential market failures in electricity supply: (i) market power in U.S. coal transportation; (ii) under-electrification of India’s rural poor; and (iii) short-run allocative inefficiencies in Indian electricity dispatch. In each case. my findings are of substantial economic importance due the scale of the electric power industry. which is essential to virtually all economic activity. Climate change only raises the stakes. and alleviating electricity market failures has the potential to increase carbon dioxide emissions and further harm the planet.In the first chapter. I investigate how market power in the transportation of coal might impact U.S. climate policies. Economists have widely endorsed pricing CO2 emissions to internalize climate change-related externalities. Doing so would significantly affect coal. which is the most carbon-intensive major energy source. However. U.S. coal markets exhibit an additional distortion. as the railroads that transport coal to power plants can exert market power.

Duflo. and Mullainathan (2004). We identify only 12 papers that adjust for correlation along more than one dimension.

When designing randomized controlled trials (RCTs). researchers rely on power calculations to appropriately design and size experiments with the statistical power to detect effects of interest. Researchers must base these ex ante calculations on a specific statistical model. implying that power calculations should go hand-in-hand with regression model pre-specification. However. very few researchers report power calculations in either their PAPs or in their published work. In fact. out of the 104 publicly available PAPs registered with the JPAL hypothesis registry. the AEA RCT registry. and the EGAP registry by June 2015. only 33 include a discussion of power calculations. 1 Without this information. it is difficult to assess whether failure to reject a null hypothesis stems from an under-powered experimental∗ University of California.

Sources of uncertainty include shocks to baseline emissions. affecting corresponding abatement costs. and shocks to the supply of offsets. We consider a continuum between soft collars. which have a limited volume of additional emission allowances (a reserve) available at the price ceiling. and hard collars. which provide an unlimited supply of additional allowances. thereby preventing allowance prices from exceeding the price ceiling. For all cases considered. we set the price floors and ceiling such that the expected cumulative emissions net of offsets are equal to the cumulative allowances. Consequently. increasing the size of the allowance reserve requires higher price ceilings and floors. and a lower probability of reaching the ceiling. Across most parameter values examined. we find that increasing the size of the allowance reserve leads to lower expected net present values of compliance costs. although the differences are not large. However. when offset supply shocks are highly persistent and exhibit strong (negative) correlation with baseline emission shocks. hard collars deliver noticeably lower expected costs. though with a wider range of emission outcomes than the soft collars.,True,KcsufWMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://media.rff.org/archive/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-DP-10-27.pdf,,,,https://media.rff.org/archive/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-DP-10-27.pdf,0,0,0

Their role has expanded from treating serious infections to preventing infections in surgical patients. protecting cancer patients and people with compromised immune systems. and promoting growth and preventing disease in livestock and other food animals.Now. however. once-treatable infections are becoming difficult to cure. raising costs to healthcare facilities. and patient mortality is rising. with costs to both individuals and society.

Although the risk of a future government gold auction depresses the price. it also causes the price to rise in percentage terms faster than the real rate of interest and at an increasing rate. Even risk-neutral investors require this rate of return as inducement to hold gold in the face of the asymmetric risk of a price collapse. Announcements making a government auction more probable cause a sudden drop in the price.

Even though the aggregate R&D cost of identical firms in a research joint venture would be lowest if they invested equally to reduce subsequent production costs. nonetheless members may often enlarge their overall joint profit by making unequal investments. Such a strategy raises costs in the investment stage but may create more than offsetting benefits in the production stage since industry profits are larger there when the firms are of unequal size.

We investigate the behavior of an agent with limited willpower who optimally consumes over time an endowment of a tempting and storable consumption good or cake. We assume that restraining consumption below the most tempting feasible rate requires willpower. Any willpower not used to regulate consumption may be valuable in controlling other urges. Willpower thus links otherwise unrelated behaviors requiring self-control. An agent with limited willpower will display apparent domain-specific time preference.

Although price discrimination by inducing self-selection is. therefore. feasible in her model. Stokey shows that (under her base-case assumptions) it is never advantageous.

1147581,The welfare costs of unreliable water service,2010,Brian Baisa and Lucas W Davis and Stephen W Salant and William Wilcox,92,Journal of Development Economics,1,1-12,North-Holland,Throughout the developing world. many water distribution systems are unreliable. As a result. it becomes necessary for each household to store its own water as a hedge against this uncertainty. Since arrivals of water are not synchronized across households. serious distributional inefficiencies arise. We develop a model describing the optimal intertemporal depletion of each household's private water storage if it is uncertain when water will next arrive to replenish supplies. The model is calibrated using survey data from Mexico City. a city where many households store water in sealed rooftop tanks known as tinacos. The calibrated model is used to evaluate the potential welfare gains that would occur if alternative modes of water provision were implemented. We estimate that most of the potential distributional inefficiencies can be eliminated simply by making the frequency of deliveries the same across households …,True,_i1bNyYAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,66,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387808000990,12406051427196513768,/scholar?cites=12406051427196513768,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9812/1/MPRA_paper_9812.pdf,0,0,0

The same phenomenon is also responsible for excessive investment in R&D and excessive outlays in rent-seeking contests. We propose a “Partnership Solution” to eliminate or at least mitigate these excesses. Each of N players joins a partnership in the first stage and chooses his effort in the second stage. Under the rules of a partnership. each member must pay his own cost of effort but receives an equal share of the partnership's revenue. The incentive to free-ride created by such partnerships turns out to be beneficial since it naturally offsets the excessive effort inherent in such problems. In our two-stage game. this institutional arrangement can. under specified circumstances. induce the social optimum in a subgame-perfect equilibrium: no one has a unilateral incentive (1) to switch to another partnership (or create …,True,_i1bNyYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,66,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506960800079X,10626672121632478222,/scholar?cites=10626672121632478222,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9804/1/MPRA_paper_9804.pdf,0,0,0

All of the world9s high CO2-emitting individuals are treated the same. regardless of where they live.

This paper discusses policy instruments for advancing large-scale deployment of CCS in the European Union. and evaluates them in a multi-criteria analysis. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) is a cost-effective instrument for limiting greenhouse gas emissions. but it is questionable whether its currently limited time horizon and short-trading periods will lead to substantial CCS diffusion. Complementary policies at the EU and the Member State level may repair this and provide sufficient incentives for CCS.

CCS involves the integration of four elements: CO 2 capture. compression of the CO2 from a gas to a liquid or a denser gas. transportation of pressurized CO 2 from the point of capture to the storage location. and isolation from the atmosphere by storage in deep underground rock formations. Considering full life-cycle emissions. CCS technology can reduce 65–85% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion from stationary sources. although greater reductions may be possible if low emission technologies are applied to activities beyond the plant boundary. such as fuel transportation. CCS is applicable to many stationary CO2 sources. including the power generation. refining. building materials. and the industrial sector. The recent emphasis on the use of CCS primarily to reduce emissions from coal-fired electricity production is too narrow a vision for CCS. Interest in CCS is growing rapidly around the world. Over the past decade there has been a remarkable increase in interest and investment in CCS. Whereas a decade ago. there was only one operating CCS project and little industry or government investment in R&D. and no financial incentives to promote CCS. In 2010. numerous projects of various sizes are active. including at least five large-scale full CCS projects. In 2015. it is expected that 15 large-scale. full-chain CCS projects will be running.

While this hypothesis seems to be based on some form of bounded rationality. this paper argues that governments may have good reasons for setting an especially strong environmental policy even though firms are fully rational. If the available abatement technology turns the environment into an “inferior input”. competitiveness is spurred by a strong environmental policy. The government should take advantage of this. and set an especially strict emission quota or an especially high emission tax. The findings in the paper also has consequences for the desirability of international cooperation with respect to national environmental policy.

Innovation of new pollution abatement techniques requires a new market to develop. If policy is lax. few firms enter and are forced to charge a high mark-up in order to cover development costs.

We explore whether the policy should be especially stringent in order to spur a successful export industry based on abatement technology. Furthermore. we investigate if a stringent policy can be used to increase competition in the upstream sector. Our point of departure is a three-stage game between a government in a country with a polluting downstream industry. and a limited number of upstream firms supplying abatement technologies. The government moves first. and may use its environmental policy strategically to influence the behavior of the upstream technology firms.

We analyze the choice between an environmental standard and a voluntary eco-label scheme in a partial trade model with one domestic firm and one foreign firm. The environmental standard will only apply to the domestic firm. while both firms can adopt the eco-label. Pollution is production related. and domestic consumers demand products that are produced in an “environmentally friendly” way. Our results show that it may be optimal for the domestic government to introduce an eco-label and get both firms to adopt the label. instead of setting an environmental standard.

The stringency of environmental policy is determined in a game between two governments. There is one firm in each jurisdiction. and both firms threaten to relocate their production to the other jurisdiction. Because there is asymmetric information about the cost of relocation. the governments do not know the credibility of the threat.We compare the outcome of this game with the outcome of a game in which relocation is not possible. We find that the threat of relocation can increase both the level of environmental regulation and welfare.

Our point of departure is the experience curve approach. however unlike many other studies of new energy technologies. we also seek to account for autonomous technological change. scale effects and the effects of upstream competition among technology suppliers. To our surprise we find that upstream competition is by far the most important factor contributing to the fall in unit price.

1147620,Promoting Second Generation Biofuels: Does the First Generation Pave the Road?,2014,H. and M. Greaker Eggert,7,Energies,,1-16,,The US. Brazil and a number of European and other countries worldwide have introduced various support schemes for bioethanol and biodiesel. The advantage of these biofuels is that they are relatively easily integrated with the current fossil fuel-based transport sector. at least up to a certain point. However. recent studies point to various negative effects of expanding the production of first generation (1G) biofuels further. 1G biofuels’ problems can be overcome by a transition to second generation (2G) biofuels. So far. 2G biofuels are much more costly to produce. We therefore ask: to what extent is targeted support to 2G biofuels likely to bring costs down? Additionally. are current support schemes for biofuels well designed in order to promote the development of 2G biofuels? We find that the prospects for cost reduction look better for 2G bioethanol than for 2G biodiesel. Bioethanol made from cellulose is far from a ripe technology. with several cost-reducing opportunities yet to be developed. Hence. targeted support to cellulosic ethanol might induce a switch from 1G to 2G biofuels. However. we find little evidence that production and use of 1G bioethanol will bridge the conversion to 2G bioethanol. Hence. to the extent that private investment in the development of 2G bioethanol is too low. current support schemes for 1G biofuels may block 2G bioethanol instead of promoting it.

One of the arguments. frequently cited for such a policy. is the need for technological development. However. the literature on climate change and technological innovation does not unambiguously support the need for setting high emission taxes today. In this paper we investigate the relationship between emission taxes and technological change further by modeling innovation activity explicitly.

We introduce decreasing returns to R&D. and allow future carbon taxes to influence current R&D decisions. Our results suggest that governments should prioritize clean R&D. Dealing with major environmental problems requires an R&D shift towards clean technology.

1147624,Lock-in and the transition to hydrogen cars. When should governments intervene?,2007,Mads Greaker and Tom-Reiel Heggedal,,,,,Statistics Norway. Research Department,The density of fuel filling stations influences consumers' utility of private car transport. Thus. to the extent that different modes of private transport require different fuels. there may exist a network externality in the consumption of private transport. We investigate this in a formal model of the market for private transport. In the model there are two competing technologies; today's internal combustion engine based on fossil fuels. and tomorrow's hydrogen car. Due to the network externality there may exist several market equilibriums. of which one is likely to Pareto dominate the other(s). Thus. a lock-in situation is possible. On the other hand. if either the costs of establishing hydrogen filling stations is too high or the hydrogen car technology is still in its infancy. the only equilibrium is the current internal combustion engine equilibrium. Hence. apart from internalizing the environmental externality on gasoline cars. the government has no reasons to intervene before the technology is ripe. And even then. governments should take great care so as not to create a situation of excess momentum.  Keywords: Lock-in. Path dependency. Hydrogen economy.

Consumer utility of both durables increases in their respective market shares due to network effects.First. we characterize the optimal dirty good tax. The tax should achieve a long run optimal division of the market between the two goods. Along the transition path to this steady state the optimal tax depends on the current and future market shares of the clean durable. Thus. even if the marginal environmental damage from an additional dirty durable is constant. the optimal tax should not be constant.Second. we study whether excess inertia can occur if the emission tax is not optimally set. We then find that a constant tax that only accounts for the environmental damage caused by the dirty good may lead to excess inertia.

Several countries now have such sets also including separate indicators for climate change. Some of these indicators typically report global concentration of green house gasses in the atmosphere or time series for global temperatures.

1147630,Policies for second generation biofuels: current status and future challanges,2011,Håkan Eggert and Mads Greaker and Emily Potter,,,,,Statistics Norway,Current state-of-the-art knowledge concludes that green house gas (GHG) emissions must be controlled and reduced within the next 30-40 years. The transport sector contributes almost a fifth of the current global emissions. and its share is likely to increase in the future. The US and a number of European countries have therefore introduced various support schemes for research and development (R&D) of low emission fuels that can potentially replace the current fossil fuels. One such alternative is biofuels. The advantage of biofuels are that it is easy to introduce into the transport sector. On the other hand. recent research papers question whether the supply of feedstock is sufficient. and to what extent biofuels lead to GHG emission reductions.  This report reviews the current status of second generation biofuels. Second generation biofuels are made from cellulose. which according to our survey of the literature. is in more abundant supply than the first generation biofuels feedstocks. Furthermore. it seems to have the potential to reduce GHG emissions from the transport sector without leading to devastating land use changes. which recent critique has held against first generation biofuels. Given that governments have decided to support R&D of low emission fuels. we ask the following questions: • Should second generation biofuels receive R&D support to the same extent as other low emission fuels like hydrogen? • How should support schemes for second generation biofuels be designed?,True,7s7Yn8UAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,18,https://ssb.brage.unit.no/ssb-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/181075/rapp_201124.pdf?sequence=1,16435219057396757755,/scholar?cites=16435219057396757755,,https://ssb.brage.unit.no/ssb-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/181075/rapp_201124.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

R&D investments influence the future GHG abatement choices of both industrialized and developing countries. We distinguish between investments that reduce industrialized countries’ abatement costs and investments that reduce developing countries’ abatement costs. Unlike earlier contributions. we include global trading in emission permits. This changes the nature of the game. With global permit trading. industrialized countries should in many cases invest strategically in technologies that only reduce abatement costs at home. This comes in addition to investments abroad.

1147632,Effects of global fisheries on developing countries possibilities for income and threat of depletion,2009,Håkan Eggert and Mads Greaker,,,,,,This study deals with fisheries and trade. focusing on developing countries. Fish is globally traded. and for many developing countries. it is an important net export good. In most of these countries. fisheries are often characterized by poorly defined property rights. accompanied by overcapitalization where too many vessels and fishermen catch too few fish from too small stocks. Management is often de facto open access. where vessels with or without permission to fish land as much as they can catch due to limited monitoring and enforcement activities. Even in developed countries. many fisheries are poorly managed. and recent studies indicate that marine ecosystems are in global decline. While trade generally is beneficial for growth and welfare. the combination of pure open access and trade liberalization may both reduce welfare and stocks for a country—an outcome that can be reinforced by the common use of bad subsidies. However. trade liberalization may have an additional positive impact by promoting the development of property rights in response to increased fish exploitation. The WTO can play a role by adopting a broader classification of subsidies to help eliminate bad subsidies. such as like public support of vessel construction. fuel subsidies. or fishing rights outside developing coastal countries provided at limited or zero cost. The WTO can also ssist by distinguishing good subsidies (e.g.. improving fisheries management or improving monitoring and enforcement). which are desirable targets when rich countries allocate aid resource to developing countries.,True,7s7Yn8UAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,17,https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/21492,16410565809848844901,/scholar?cites=16410565809848844901,,https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/21492/1/gupea_2077_21492_1.pdf,0,0,0

Strategic use of climate policy could also induce the development of a successful upstream abatement technology industry like the Danish windmill industry. Interestingly. this latter question has not been analyzed theoretically before. Our point of departure is a three-stage game between a government in a small country with a climate restriction. and a limited number of firms supplying carbon abatement technology. The government moves first. and may use its climate policy strategically to influence the behavior of the upstream technology firms. An especially stringent climate policy towards the polluting downstream sector may then in fact be well founded. It will increase the competition between the technology suppliers. and lead to lower domestic abatement costs.

According to SNA-numbers. Norwegian fisheries contributed negatively to the national wealth in the period 1984–2016 with exception of the years 2010–2011 and 2015–2016. Because all parameter values entering the calculation of national wealth are conditional on the existing management regime. the potential value of the natural resources may be concealed. This paper finds that this is the case for the Norwegian fishery sector. Using a numerical optimization model. the paper estimates the contra factual resource rent to be 1.6 billion USD if the fishing quotas were harvested efficiently with the currently available technology. This is 1.2 billion USD more than the observed resource rent in 2011 and means that Norwegian fisheries contribute to national wealth four times more than indicated by 2011 SNA-numbers.

In order to limit leakage. governments consider supporting domestic trade-exposed firms by subsidizing their investments in abatement technology. The suppliers of such technologies tend to be less than perfectly competitive. particularly when both emissions regulations and advanced technologies are new. In this context of twin market failures. we consider the relative effects and desirability of subsidies for abatement technology. We find a more robust recommendation for upstream subsidies than for downstream subsidies.

Such quality leadership strategies often win public acclaim. especially when they involve environmental attributes. Using a duopoly model of vertical product differentiation. we show that if the high‐quality firm can commit to a quality level before regulations are promulgated. it induces the regulator to weaken standards. and welfare falls.

Drawing on the management literature on decoupling and the economic literature on information disclosure. we characterize specifically where this effect is likely to be most pronounced. We identify important differences between social media and traditional media. and present a theoretical framework for understanding greenwash in which corporate environmental communications may backfire if citizens and activists feel a company is engaging in excessive self-promotion. The framework allows us to draw out a series of propositions regarding the impact of social media on corporate decisions whether to greenwash. and what channels to use for environmental communication.

Prior papers treat such agreements as a superior. low-cost instrument that can be used to preempt a threat of traditional. inefficient. regulation. We present a more general model in which public VAs may instead be weak tools used when political opposition makes environmental taxes infeasible.

We study the motivations for and impacts of firms' strategic disclosure of greenhouse gas reductions to the US government. We first model firms' joint abatement and disclosure decisions. incorporating both economic and political incentives. We then use data from the Department of Energy's Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Registry to compare reported reductions to actual emissions.

A growing body of empirical work suggests these programs generally have little impact on the behavior of their participants. A natural policy conclusion would be to eliminate PVPs. but we argue that such a conclusion is premature. Many PVPs are best viewed as information diffusion programs. so identifying their effects econometrically is difficult because information is likely to diffuse to nonparticipants. Thus. after the early phases of even a successful PVP. it may well be impossible to detect a difference in the performance between participants and nonparticipants.

Inc., We study three corporate nonmarket strategies designed to influence the lobbying behavior of other special interest groups: (1) astroturf. in which the firm covertly subsidizes a group with similar views to lobby when it normally would not; (2) the bear hug. in which the firm overtly pays a group to alter its lobbying activities; and (3) self‐regulation. in which the firm voluntarily limits the potential social harm from its activities. All three strategies reduce the informativeness of lobbying. and all reduce the payoff of the public decision‐maker.

Although a theory of the drivers and deterrents of greenwashing has begun to emerge. it is static in nature and does not incorporate the full range of ways in which firms can misrepresent their environmental performance. Our contribution is threefold. First. we extend the theory of organizational information disclosure to incorporate the possibility of undue modesty about a firm’s environmental. social. and governance practices. Second. we hypothesize about the drivers of exaggeration and undue modesty based on which of a firm’s stakeholders are salient at a given point in time; to do so. we place the firm within a dynamic context that has largely been missing in the prior literature.

Most incentive schemes involve profit sharing and are. thus. variants of sliding-scale regulation.

An empirical investigation of most-favored-nation clauses in natural gas contracts",1994,Keith J Crocker and Thomas P Lyon,37,The Journal of Law and Economics,2,297-322,The University of Chicago Press,Long-term contracts often include most-favored-nation clauses (MFNs). which are nondiscrimination guarantees that obligate a buyer or seller to treat all trading partners symmetrically in pricing decisions. Recent theoretical work has shown that such clauses can facilitate tacit collusion by increasing the cost of selective price changes aimed at attracting new business. An alternative view is that MFNs serve to facilitate efficient price adjustment in extended exchange relationships. We test these competing hypotheses using data from long-term natural gas contracts. many of which employ MFNs. Our conclusion is that the pattern of MFN adoption. in conjunction with the structure of the nondiscrimination regions and the parallels with other nonstrategic price escalation provisions. lends strong support to the efficiency rationale.,True,JwLkuSIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,94,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/467315,3257322463836851037,/scholar?cites=3257322463836851037,,http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/tplyon/PDF/Published%20Papers/Crocker%20and%20Lyon%20JLE.pdf,0,0,0

Using fixed effects logit estimation. we find that adoption rates are higher for projects with shorter paybacks. lower costs. greater annual savings. higher energy prices. and greater energy conservation. Plants are 40% more responsive to initial costs than annual savings. suggesting that subsidies may be more effective at promoting energy-efficient technologies than energy price increases.

1147666,Prospects for carbon capture and storage technologies,2004,Soren Anderson and Richard Newell,29,,,109-142,Annual Reviews,Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies remove carbon dioxide from flue gases for storage in geologic formations or the ocean. We find that CCS is technically feasible. with current costs of about $200 to $250 per ton of carbon. Although currently a relatively expensive mitigation option. CCS could be attractive if we have a stringent carbon policy. if CCS turns out unexpectedly inexpensive relative to other options. or if it is otherwise desired to retain fossil fuels as part of the energy mix while reducing carbon emissions. Near-term prospects favor CCS for electric power plants and certain industrial sources with storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs as opposed to aquifers. Deep aquifers may provide an attractive longer-term-storage option. whereas ocean storage poses greater technical and environmental uncertainty.

1147667,The demand for ethanol as a gasoline substitute,2012,Soren T Anderson,63,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,2,151-168,Academic Press,This paper estimates household preferences for ethanol (E85) as a gasoline (E10) substitute. I develop a theoretical model linking the shape of the ethanol demand curve to the underlying distribution among households of willingness to pay for ethanol. I estimate the model using instrumental variables techniques and data from many retail fueling stations. I find that a $0.10-per-gallon increase in ethanol's price relative to gasoline leads to a 12–16% decrease in the quantity of ethanol demanded. My findings imply that preferences for ethanol are heterogeneous and that a substantial fraction of households are willing to pay a premium for the fuel. This reduces substantially the simulated efficiency cost of an ethanol content standard. since some households choose ethanol without large subsidies. mitigating deadweight losses.,True,GPlmHCMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,195,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069611001161,7948799996871633825,/scholar?cites=7948799996871633825,,https://www.nber.org/papers/w16371.pdf,0,0,0

Firms sometimes reveal costs indirectly. however. when they exploit loopholes to avoid regulation. We apply this insight to fuel economy standards for automobiles. These standards feature a loophole that gives automakers a bonus when they equip a vehicle with flexible-fuel capacity. Profit-maximizing automakers will equate the marginal cost of compliance using the loophole. which is observable. with the unobservable costs of strategies that genuinely improve fuel economy. Based on this insight. we estimate that tightening standards by one mile per gallon would have cost automakers just $9–$27 per vehicle in recent years. (JEL L51. L62.

1147687,Overlapping strategies for reducing carbon emissions from the personal transportation sector,2016,Soren Anderson and Carolyn Fischer and Alex Egorenkov,,"Washington, DC: Resources for the Future",,,,We develop a numerical model of the US personal transportation sector and use it to simulate the impacts of gasoline taxes. fuel-economy standards. renewable fuel standards. and other policies targeting transportation fuels. Our model captures consumer demand for miles and tradeoffs between car size. costs. and fuel economy. as well as fuel supply from gasoline and corn. sugarcane. and cellulosic ethanol. In addition to carbon emissions. our model captures potential market failures related to consumer undervaluation of fuel economy. learning spillovers in cellulosic ethanol. and unpriced externalities associated with car size and miles traveled. We find that the current policy mix of gasoline taxes. fuel economy standards. and renewable fuel standards leads to a 13% reduction in domestic carbon emissions from this sector at an average cost of $18/tCO2. In contrast. the optimal policy—a carbon tax. combined with subsidies for fuel economy and cellulosic ethanol—delivers an average welfare gain of $15/tCO2. Meanwhile. the most costeffective single policy is a traditional fuel-economy standard followed by a fuel tax. carbon tax. and size-based fuel economy standard. which all deliver net welfare gains. followed by a low-carbon fuel standard and renewable fuel quantity standard. which are both costly. We find that while the fuel tax and carbon tax both ameliorate unpriced externalities associated with car size and miles traveled. the size-based fuel economy standard greatly exacerbates such externalities. In addition. fuel taxes and carbon taxes consistently deliver low-cost abatement. even when consumers fully value fuel economy.

1147688,The demand for E85 ethanol,2006,Soren T Anderson,,"University of California Energy Institute, Annual Research Conference on Gasoline and Oil Markets, Berkeley, California",,,,The market for E85—a fuel blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline—is small but growing rapidly. I use data for E85 sales at fueling stations in Minnesota to estimate demand for E85 as a function of retail E85 and gasoline prices. I find that demand is highly sensitive to price changes. with an own-price elasticity as high as-13 and a gasolineprice elasticity as high as 16 at sample mean price levels. Demand is most sensitive to price changes when the relative price of E85 is at an intermediate level. at which point small price changes induce fuel switching by a large number of consumers. These results are qualitatively consistent with a simple theoretical model of E85 demand. and the large elasticities are in line with previous literature that estimates demand for fuels with nearperfect substitutes.

1147689,How should environmental policy respond to business cycles? Optimal policy under persistent productivity shocks,2012,Garth Heutel,15,Review of Economic Dynamics,2,244-264,Academic Press,How should environmental policy respond to economic fluctuations caused by persistent productivity shocks? This paper answers that question using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium real business cycle model that includes a pollution externality. I first estimate the relationship between the cyclical components of carbon dioxide emissions and US GDP and find it to be inelastic. Using this result to calibrate the model. I find that optimal policy allows carbon emissions to be procyclical: increasing during expansions and decreasing during recessions. However. optimal policy dampens the procyclicality of emissions compared to the unregulated case. A price effect from costlier abatement during booms outweighs an income effect of greater demand for clean air. I also model a decentralized economy. where government chooses an emissions tax or quantity restriction and firms and consumers respond.

1147690,The general equilibrium incidence of environmental taxes,2007,Don Fullerton and Garth Heutel,91,Journal of Public Economics,3-4,571-591,North-Holland,We study the distributional effects of a pollution tax in general equilibrium. with general forms of substitution where pollution might be a relative complement or substitute for labor or for capital in production. We find closed form solutions for pollution. output prices. and factor prices. Various special cases help clarify the impact of differential factor intensities. substitution effects. and output effects. Intuitively. the pollution tax might place disproportionate burdens on capital if the polluting sector is capital intensive. or if labor is a better substitute for pollution than is capital; however. conditions are found where these intuitive results do not hold. We show exact conditions for the wage to rise relative to the capital return.

The fraction of income used on these goods falls with income. measured either by annual income or by total annual expenditure (as a proxy for permanent income). Thus. climate policy is found to be regressive on the “uses side”(eg Burtraw. Sweeney. and Walls 2009. and Hasset et al. 2009). For these reasons. the economics literature and actual legislation have focused on whether permit revenue can be used to offset regressive burdens.In contrast.

1147712,Incidence. environmental. and welfare effects of distortionary subsidies,2016,Garth Heutel and David L Kelly,3,Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists,2,361-415,University of Chicago Press,Government policies that are not intended to address environmental concerns can nonetheless distort prices and affect firms’ emissions. We present an analytical general equilibrium model to study the effect of distortionary subsidies on factor prices. pollution. and welfare. Based on real-world policies. we model an output subsidy. a capital subsidy. relief from environmental regulation. and a minimum level of labor employment that firms must agree to in exchange for the subsidies. Each policy creates both output effects and substitution effects on input prices and emissions. We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy. Variation in production substitution elasticities does not substantially affect input prices. but it does substantially affect emissions. Distortionary subsidies can both raise emissions and decrease output. Therefore. reducing distortionary subsidies can reduce emissions without a trade-off in lost output …,True,TxYfplkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,10,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684578,8980609281163039753,/scholar?cites=8980609281163039753,,http://sites.gsu.edu/gheutel/files/2016/05/HeutelKelly_JAERE-23otoxu.pdf,0,0,0

We consider two alternate extreme assumptions about labor mobility: either perfect mobility. as is assumed in much previous work. or perfect immobility. The effect of a $35 per ton carbon tax on aggregate unemployment is small and similar across the two labor mobility assumptions (0.2–0.3 percentage points). The effect on unemployment in fossil fuel sectors is much larger under the immobility assumption–a 30 percentage-point increase in the coal sector–suggesting that models omitting labor mobility frictions may greatly under-predict sectoral unemployment effects. Returning carbon tax revenue through labor tax cuts can dampen or even reverse negative impacts on unemployment. while command-and-control policies yield larger unemployment effects.,True,TxYfplkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,8,https://www.nber.org/papers/w25797,857824700643447480,/scholar?cites=857824700643447480,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25797/w25797.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,We continue our examination of the investment performance of nonprofit charities and foundations. This analysis tests hypotheses about what types of organizations do better. Our motivating intuition is that nonprofits with greater focus on investment performance will secure higher returns. Our hypotheses are tested by regressing the rate of return for each organization on various characteristics. As expected. nonprofits whose primary business is predominantly financial. such as insurance providers and pension or retirement funds. consistently earn higher returns. The data also support our hypotheses that larger nonprofits. older nonprofits. and private foundations will tend to outperform.

1147715,Consumer willingness to pay price premiums for environmentally certified wood products in the US,2007,Francisco X Aguilar and Richard P Vlosky,9,Forest Policy and Economics,8,1100-1112,Elsevier,Since its inception nearly 15 years ago. environmental certification has become an important issue in the wood products industry. One research question that has been examined is the potential willingness for supply chain participants to pay a premium for certified products or raw materials to offset certification costs. This study examines stated willingness to pay for four wood products from the perspective of U.S. consumers. Data was collected in 1995 and 2005 from the population of U.S. residential consumers to detect changes in willingness to pay for certified wood products along time and increase the statistical strength of the model. Results of an ordered probit model suggest that higher probabilities of paying a premium are associated to consumers who seek out certified products and who believe certification can lessen environmental impacts such as tropical deforestation.

It also reflects some of the challenges of disseminating codes of conduct in developing countries and ensuring market benefits from certification. We describe the emergence of forest certification standards. outline current certification schemes. and discuss the role of major corporations in creating demand for certified products. We also discuss the limited success of certification and some of the obstacles to its adoption in developing countries. The current diversity of forest certification programs and ecolabeling schemes has created a costly. less-than-transparent system that has been largely ineffective in terms of the initial goals of reducing tropical deforestation and illegal logging. Some steps have been taken toward harmonization of different certification criteria as well as endorsement and mutual recognition among existing forest certification programs.

High oil prices have triggered the adoption of government regulation and financial incentives to promote greater use of wood energy over the last four decades. However. the amount of wood energy consumed in the U.S. industrial sector was driven mainly by the output of the pulp and paper products industry and not by energy prices or any particular public policy incentive. Residential consumption of wood energy was positively correlated with competing energy prices. Public policies seem to have had a greater impact on wood energy consumption in the electric power sector and over the last four decades have concentrated on promoting biopower with a recent shift to liquid cellulosic biofuels.

New Economic Geography. and Cluster Theory. First. six latent location factors were identified based on a survey of lumber industry members using factor analysis. An exploratory analysis of sawmill location identified deviations from complete spatial randomness. suggesting the formal incorporation of a spatial dimension in an econometric model. A Bayesian spatial autoregressive approach was used to model the presence of the lumber industry at the county level in the U.S. South. Empirical results are congruent with theory. The strength of the spatial process is weak in the presence of descriptors with a direct geographic dimension. Counties that provide cost advantages. available labor. and appropriate road access are more likely to host the lumber industry.

1147754,Closing the screen door to new invasions,2014,Reuben P Keller and Michael R Springborn,7,Conservation Letters,3,285-292,,International trade in nonnative species generates economic benefits but also introduces many harmful invasive species. Recent advances in nonnative species screening tools enable useful predictions of invasiveness which can be combined with estimates of impacts to effectively manage the trade‐off between the benefits and costs of this trade. Despite this. most countries maintain an essentially “open door” policy where almost all nonnative species are allowed for introduction until they prove problematic. This approach implicitly favors minimizing one particular type of assessment error—mistakenly excluding safe species. or “false positives.” However. a comprehensive approach to management of species trade should involve balancing the trade‐off between false positives and “false negatives” (mistakenly accepting invasive species).

I analytically and numerically examine the distribution of outcomes from AM under risk neutrality and risk aversion. The inspection decision is framed as a multi-armed bandit problem and solved using the Lagrangian decomposition method.

This paper addresses two issues critical for designing restoration projects for coastal protection: (i) a synthesis of the costs and benefits of projects designed for coastal protection (nature-based defences) and (ii) analyses of the effectiveness of coastal habitats (natural defences) in reducing wave heights and the biophysical parameters that influence this effectiveness. We (i) analyse data from sixty-nine field measurements in coastal habitats globally and examine measures of effectiveness of mangroves. salt-marshes. coral reefs and seagrass/kelp beds for wave height reduction; (ii) synthesise the costs and coastal protection benefits of fifty-two nature-based defence projects and; (iii) estimate the benefits of each restoration project by combining information on restoration costs with data from nearby field measurements. The analyses of field measurements show that coastal habitats have significant potential for reducing wave heights that varies by habitat and site. In general. coral reefs and salt-marshes have the highest overall potential.

Yet. because of the difficulties in matching quota holdings with catches. many argue that IFQs are not appropriate for multispecies fisheries. Using on-the-ground-experience with multispecies IFQ fisheries in Iceland. New Zealand. Australia. and Canada. we assess the design and use of catch-quota balancing mechanisms. Our methodology includes a mix of interviews with fishery managers. industry representatives. and brokers. literature review. and data analysis. We find that a combination of incentives and limits on use rates for the mechanisms provide sufficient flexibility to the quota owner without the fishery manager incurring excessive levels of overexploitation risk.

We find that reserve creation can produce win‐win situations where aggregate biomass and the common license (lease) price increase. These situations arise in biological systems where dispersal processes are prevalent and the fishery prior to reserve creation is operating at effort levels in a neighborhood of open‐access levels. We also illustrate that using strictly biological criteria for siting reserves (e.g.. setting aside the most biological productive areas) will likely induce the most vociferous objections from the fishing industry.

Natural characteristics of the PA combine with the managers' enforcement activities and other policy instruments to create a set of incentives to which local people respond in making decisions about extracting resources from the PA. The different management approaches employed in the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve (XNR; China) and the Khao Yai National Park (KYNP; Thailand) and the reaction to the incentives which they create are compared.

1147819,Adaptation to climate change by smallholder farmers in Tanzania,2012,Coretha Komba and Edwin Muchapondwa,299,,5,,,Agriculture is the most important sector in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and is set to be hit the hardest by climate change. Indeed. this is confirmed by several studies (see. eg. Deressa. 2006; Moussa and Amadou. 2006; Jain. 2006; Hassan and Nhemachena. 2008; Molua and Lambi. 2006; Mano and Nhemachena. 2006). Although climate change may affect the agricultural sectors of different countries in different ways. what is clear is that these changes will bring about substantial welfare losses. especially for smallholders whose main source of livelihood derives from agriculture. There is a need for nations to neutralize the potential adverse effects if welfare losses to this vulnerable segment of society are to be avoided. Adaptation seems to be the most efficient way for farmers to reduce these negative impacts (Füssel and Klein. 2006). This can be achieved through the smallholder farmers themselves taking adaptive actions or by governments implementing policies aimed at promoting appropriate and effective adaptation measures.In order to implement appropriate interventions. governments need to understand the opportunities (or lack thereof) for adaptation and the key drivers behind voluntary adaptation by vulnerable smallholder farmers. Some studies report that agricultural measures such as the use of improved crop varieties. the planting of trees. soil conservation. changing planting dates. and irrigation are the most used adaptation strategies in African countries.

Three agents influence the wildlife stock: a parks agency determines hunting quotas. outside poachers hunt illegally. and a local community may choose to protect wildlife by discouraging poaching. Wildlife generates revenues from hunting licenses and tourism; it also intrudes on local agriculture.

Three agents influence the wildlife stock: a parks agency determines hunting quotas. outside poachers hunt illegally. and a local community may choose to protect wildlife by discouraging poaching. Wildlife generates revenues from hunting licenses and tourism; it also intrudes on local agriculture.

It consists of an introductory chapter and four self-contained chapters. Chapter 1 spells out the history of wildlife conservation leading to the inception of CAMPFIRE. Research issues at the core of the rest of the thesis are also highlighted.  Chapter 2 formulates a bio-economic model with the parks agency and the local community and their two land-uses to analyse wildlife-livestock conflict and welfare in a typical CAMPFIRE area. In the absence of economic benefits some locals tolerate poaching in order to reduce the stock of wildlife. Scenarios in three resource use regimes are analysed. Wildlife conservation is successful when the local community gets profit shares from hunting and tourism. Policies that could enhance wildlife conservation and social welfare are suggested. Optimal profit shares ought to exceed unity i.e. devolution of wildlife conservation should be augmented by inflows of external funding.   If the local communities who live adjacent to the elephant see it as valueless nuisance then they cannot be trusted to be its good stewards. To assess their valuation of it.

The study shows that the median willingness to pay for the preservation of 200 elephants is ZW$300 (US$5.45) and -ZW$98 (-US$1.78) for the public good and public bad cases. respectively. 62% of the households consider the elephant a nuisance.

Without restrictions to govern human behaviour. most natural resources are vulnerable to overexploitation. This study used a sample size of 336 households and community-level data from 30 communities around Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe. to analyse the relationship between institutions and biodiversity outcomes in community-based wildlife conservation. Our results suggest a much stronger effect of institutions on biodiversity outcomes via the intermediacy of cooperation. Overall. the performance of most communities was below the desired level of institutional attributes that matter for conservation. Good institutions are an important ingredient for cooperation in the respective communities. Disaggregating the metric measure of institutions into its components shows that governance. monitoring and enforcement are more important for increased cooperation. while fairness of institutions seems to work against cooperation. Cooperation increases with trust and group size. and is also higher in communities that have endogenized punishment as opposed to communities that still rely on external enforcement of rules and regulations. Cooperation declines as we move from communal areas into the resettlement schemes and with increasing size of the resource system.

1147842,Effects of wildlife resources on community welfare in Southern Africa,2017,Herbert Ntuli and Edwin Muchapondwa,131,,,572-583,Elsevier,This paper demonstrates the importance of wildlife in the portfolio of environmental income in the livelihoods of poor rural communities living adjacent to a national park. The results show that wealthier households use more wildlife resources in total than do relatively poor households. However. poorer households derive greater proportional benefit than wealthier households from the use of wildlife resources. Excluding wildlife understates the relative contribution of environmental resources while at the same time overstating the relative contribution of farm and wage income. Wildlife income alone accounts for about a 5.5% reduction in the proportion of people living below the poverty line. Furthermore. wildlife income has an equalizing effect. bringing about a 5.4% reduction in measured inequality.

The most widely popularized approach has been that of community-managed nature conservancies.

The reason is that the proper valuation of energy efficiency requires time and effort. but differences in efficiency across products will rarely be pivotal to choice when consumers have strong preferences regarding other product attributes. The paper first explains why proper valuation of efficiency is difficult. even in the presence of government energy labels. It next develops a model that shows how to value additional information about energy efficiency in a discrete-choice context.

Firms sometimes reveal costs indirectly. however. when they exploit loopholes to avoid regulation. We apply this insight to fuel economy standards for automobiles.

Profit-maximizing automakers will equate the marginal cost of compliance using the loophole. which is observable. with the unobservable costs of strategies that genuinely improve fuel economy.

1147861,The incidence of tax credits for hybrid vehicles,2008,James M Sallee,,,,1-70,Harris School of Public Policy. University of Chicago,A variety of state and federal tax incentives have been used to subsidize gas-electric hybrid vehicles. In this paper. I estimate the incidence of these tax incentives using microdata on sales of the Toyota Prius. in order to determine who benefits from these policies. I focus on three sharp changes in federal subsidies stemming from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and assemble several pieces of evidence which indicate that consumers captured nearly all of the benefit. First. subsidy exclusive transaction prices do not jump in the anticipated direction in response to large changes in federal tax incentives. Second. estimates that account for consumer heterogeneity indicate that consumers captured the majority of the gains. Third. a state panel regression on state tax incentives shows that state tax incentives have little or no effect on transaction prices. which is consistent with the federal result. The conclusion that consumers captured the subsidy poses a challenge to standard models of tax incidence. Toyota faced a binding capacity constraint when the credit was introduced. Given a fixed supply. standard models predict that Toyota would capture the subsidy. I argue that consumers gained instead because Toyota believed that raising prices to clear the market would lower future demand for hybrids. I outline a stylized model in which current prices influence future demand and show that a capacity constraint can generate the tax incidence observed in the data. I then discuss factors that could give rise to such a demand system. drawing on the theory of search among alternatives and the behavioral literature on fairness. Finally.

This paper derives sufficient statistics. which require a minimum of market information. that quantify the efficiency costs of such constraints on policy design. We demonstrate that. under certain intuitive conditions. standard output from a regression of true externalities on policy variables. including the R2 and the sum of squared residuals. have immediate welfare interpretations—they are sufficient statistics that compare alternative policies. We utilize our approach in three diverse empirical applications: random mismeasurement in externalities. imperfect spatial policy differentiation. and heterogeneity in the longevity of energy-consuming durable goods. Regarding the latter. we use our method and a novel data set and find that policies that regulate vehicle fuel-economy. but ignore the differences in average longevity across types of automobiles. recover only about one-quarter to one-third of the welfare gains achievable by a policy that also takes product longevity into account. In contrast. our other two empirical applications suggest that policy imperfections have only small welfare costs.,True,iwuJ9uwAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,29,https://www.nber.org/papers/w22063,10353628452206267453,/scholar?cites=10353628452206267453,,https://www.nber.org/papers/w22063.pdf,0,0,0

1147868,The effect of gasoline prices on the demand for fuel economy in used vehicles: Empirical evidence and policy implications,2010,James M Sallee and Sarah E West and Wei Fan,,"World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists. Montreal, Canada",,,,Economic analysis generally favors fuel taxation as an efficient policy for dealing with climate and environmental externalities related to fuel consumption and emissions in the personal transportation sector. while actual policy heavily leans on fuel economy regulation. One justification offered for the use of regulatory policy instead of direct fuel taxation is the hypothesis that consumers undervalue fuel economy. If consumers do not sufficiently value fuel economy when making the decision about what car to buy. alternatives such as fuel economy regulation or feebates may be welfare improving over a standard Pigouvian tax on fuel. To determine whether or not consumers properly value fuel economy. we use microdata on used vehicle prices and a unique identification strategy based on micro-level variation in vehicle odometers to test whether used car prices change by the amount predicted by a fully rational asset pricing model. Our baseline results indicate that used car prices adjust by nearly 80% of the amount predicted by theory. and sensitivity analysis suggests that for a reasonable discount rate. they adjust by the full amount. These results contrast with recent literature and policy discussions that argue for tighter fuel economy standards on the basis of consumer undervaluation. Our results instead confirm the canonical finding that direct taxation of fuel is superior to fuel economy regulation or feebates.,True,iwuJ9uwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,20,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.459.6077&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2835589061323884047,/scholar?cites=2835589061323884047,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.459.6077&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

When people do break the rules. what can standard data sources tell us about their behavior? Standard economic models of crime typically assume that individuals are indifferent to dishonesty. so that they will cheat or lie as long as the expected pecuniary benefits exceed the expected costs of being caught and punished. We investigate this presumption by studying the response to a change in tax reporting rules that made it much more difficult for taxpayers to evade taxes by inappropriately claiming additional dependents. The policy reform induced a substantial reduction in the number of dependents claimed. which indicates that many filers had been cheating before the reform. Yet. the number of filers who availed themselves of this evasion opportunity is dwarfed by the number of filers who passed up substantial tax savings by not …,True,iwuJ9uwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,18,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10797-012-9221-4,7403755288854717813,/scholar?cites=7403755288854717813,,https://www.nber.org/papers/w17247.pdf,0,0,0

Policy-related choices include the time period of emissions. the mix of greenhouse gases and different indicators of climate change impacts. The scientific choices include historical emissions and model representations of the climate system. We generated and compared results of several simple climate models. We find that the relative contributions of different nations to global climate change—from emissions of greenhouse gases alone—are quite robust. despite the varying model complexity and differences in calculated absolute changes.

A natural question in this context is what will be the ‘transformation pathway’towards stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there? The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways. including the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key characteristics of different transformation pathways. including the rates of emissions reductions and deployment of low-carbon energy. the magnitude and timing of aggregate economic costs. and the implications for other policy objectives such as those generally associated with sustainable development?

We find that uncertainty in historical contribution estimates differs between countries due to different shares of greenhouse gases and time development of emissions. Although historical emissions in the distant past are very uncertain. their influence on countries’ or sectors’ contributions to temperature increase is relatively small in most cases. because these results are dominated by recent (high) emissions.

Options range from trying to reach consensus on specific long-term atmospheric concentration targets (e.g. 550 ppmv) to simply ignoring this contentious issue and focusing instead on what can be done in the nearer term. This paper argues for a strategy that lies between these two extremes. Internationally agreed threshold levels for certain categories of impacts or of risks posed by climate change could be translated into acceptable levels of atmospheric concentrations. This could help to establish a range of upper limits for global emissions in the medium term that could set the ambition level for negotiations on expanded GHG mitigation commitments.

The focus of the data is limited to national climate legislation and strategies and does not cover subnational or sectoral measures. Climate legislation and strategies are important because they can: enhance incentives for climate mitigation; provide mechanisms for mainstreaming; and provide a focal point for actors.

This supports and goes substantially beyond the emission reductions proposed by national governments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

At the moment. non-CO2 gasses (methane. nitrous oxide. PFCs. HFCs and SF6) contribute to about a quarter of the global emissions. The analysis shows that including these non-CO2 gases in mitigation analysis is crucial in formulating a cost-effective response. For stabilisation at 4.5 W/m2. a multi-gas approach leads to 40% lower costs than an approach that would focus at CO2only. Within the assumptions used in this study. the non-CO2 gasses contribution to total reduction is very large under less stringent targets (up to 60%). but declines under stringent targets. While stabilising at 3.7 W/m2 obviously leads to larger environmental benefits than the 4.5 W/m2 case (temperature increase in 2100 are 1.9 and 2.3 oC. respectively). the costs of the lower target are higher (0.80% and 0.34% of GDP in 2100. respectively).

Until then they may voluntarily take on ‘positively binding’ targets.

Confidence in model estimates of future climate evolution has been enhanced via a range of advances since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR). Climate models are based on well-established physical principles and have been demonstrated to reproduce observed features of recent climate (see Chapters 8 and 9) and past climate changes (see Chapter 6). There is considerable confidence that Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change. particularly at continental and larger scales. Confidence in these estimates is higher for some climate variables (eg. temperature) than for others (eg. precipitation). This summary highlights areas of progress since the TAR:• Enhanced scrutiny of models and expanded diagnostic analysis of model behaviour have been increasingly facilitated by internationally coordinated efforts to collect and disseminate output from model experiments performed under common conditions. This has encouraged a more comprehensive and open evaluation of models. The expanded evaluation effort. encompassing a diversity of perspectives. makes it less likely that significant model errors are being overlooked.,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:9hYaGTfn7EkC,2338,https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1765216/component/file_1765214/content,14750900660436683651,/scholar?cites=14750900660436683651,,https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1765216/component/file_1765214/content,0,0,0

But doing so is not easy for at least two reasons. First. due to the rate of climate change. new infrastructure will have to be able to cope with a large range of changing climate conditions. which will make design more difficult and construction more expensive. Second. uncertainty in future climate makes it impossible to directly use the output of a single climate model as an input for infrastructure design. and there are good reasons to think that the needed climate information will not be available soon. Instead of optimizing based on the climate conditions projected by models. therefore. future infrastructure should be made more robust to possible changes in climate conditions.

The report explores various channels through which climate change and policies will affect poverty: economic impacts through incomes and prices; natural disasters and their effects on assets and livelihoods; and health impacts. It also investigates policy options to ensure adaptation and mitigation policies--such as adaptive and well-targeted social protection. public investments. and financial inclusion policies--contribute to poverty reduction and protect poor people against climate change impacts.

1147940,Why economic dynamics matter in assessing climate change damages: illustration on extreme events,2007,Stéphane Hallegatte and Jean-Charles Hourcade and Patrice Dumas,62,Ecological economics,2,330-340,Elsevier,Extreme events are one of the main channels through which climate and socioeconomic systems interact. and it is likely that climate change will modify the probability distribution of the losses they generate. The long-term growth models used in climate change assessments. however. cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To investigate this issue. a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. This exercise allowed us to define the economic amplification ratio. as the ratio of the overall production loss due to an event to its direct costs. This ratio could be used to improve the cost–benefit analysis of prevention measures. We found also that. unlike a Solow-like model. NEDyM exhibits a bifurcation in GDP losses: for each value of the capacity to fund reconstruction. GDP losses remain moderate if the intensity and frequency of extremes …,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,285,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800906003041,11486648941610851554,/scholar?cites=11486648941610851554,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00164626/file/Hallegatte_Hourcade_Dumas.pdf,0,0,0
1147941,Unbreakable: building the resilience of the poor in the face of natural disasters,2016,Stephane Hallegatte and Adrien Vogt-Schilb and Mook Bangalore and Julie Rozenberg,,,,,World Bank Publications,'Economic losses from natural disasters totaled $92 billion in 2015.'Such statements. all too commonplace. assess the severity of disasters by no other measure than the damage inflicted on buildings. infrastructure. and agricultural production. But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it. By focusing on aggregate losses—the traditional approach to disaster risk—we restrict our consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have assets to lose in the first place. and largely ignore the plight of poor people. This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect people’s well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting. and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor people’s vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters. but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the world’s poor. such as expanding financial inclusion. disaster risk and health insurance. social protection and adaptive safety nets. contingent finance and reserve funds. and universal access to early warning systems. Efforts to reduce disaster risk and poverty go hand in hand.

1147942,Can natural disasters have positive consequences? Investigating the role of embodied technical change,2009,Stéphane Hallegatte and Patrice Dumas,68,Ecological Economics,3,777-786,Elsevier,It has been suggested that disasters might have positive economic consequences. through the accelerated replacement of capital. This possibility is referred to as the productivity effect. This effect is investigated using a model with embodied technical change. In this framework. disasters can influence the production level but cannot influence the growth rate. in the same way than the saving ratio in a Solow-like model. Depending on reconstruction quality. indeed. accounting for embodied technical change can either decrease or increase disaster costs. but is never able to turn disasters into positive events. Moreover. a better but slower reconstruction amplifies the short-term consequences of disasters. but pays off over the long-term. Regardless. the productivity effect cannot prevent the existence of a bifurcation when disaster damages exceed the reconstruction capacity. potentially leading to poverty traps.,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,254,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908002863,8585054542274834123,/scholar?cites=8585054542274834123,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52716489.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we demonstrate an approach to assess future risks and quantify the benefits of adaptation options at a city-scale. with application to flood risk in Mumbai. In 2005. Mumbai experienced unprecedented flooding. causing direct economic damages estimated at almost two billion USD and 500 fatalities. Our findings suggest that by the 2080s. in a SRES A2 scenario. an ‘upper bound’ climate scenario could see the likelihood of a 2005-like event more than double. We estimate that total losses (direct plus indirect) associated with a 1-in-100 year event could triple compared with current situation (to $690–$1.890 million USD). due to climate change alone.

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change.

In this research. we have provided an overview of available indicators for long-term security of supply (SOS). We distinguished four dimensions of energy security that relate to the availability. accessibility. affordability and acceptability of energy and classified indicators for energy security according to this taxonomy. There is no one ideal indicator. as the notion of energy security is highly context dependent. Rather. applying multiple indicators leads to a broader understanding. Incorporating these indicators in model-based scenario analysis showed accelerated depletion of currently known fossil resources due to increasing global demand.

In a reference scenario. global energy demand for heating is projected to increase until 2030 and then stabilize. In contrast. energy demand for air conditioning is projected to increase rapidly over the whole 2000–2100 period. mostly driven by income growth. The associated CO2 emissions for both heating and cooling increase from 0.8 Gt C in 2000 to 2.2 Gt C in 2100. i.e. about 12% of total CO2 emissions from energy use (the strongest increase occurs in Asia).

Methodology/Principal Findings HCT116 cells with stable miR-143 overexpression (Over-143) and control (Empty) cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of nude mice. and tumor growth was evaluated over time. Tumors arose ∼ 14 days after tumor cell implantation. and the experiment was ended at 40 days after implantation. miR-143 was confirmed to be significantly overexpressed in Over-143 versus Empty xenografts. by TaqMan® Real-time PCR (p<0.05). Importantly. Over-143 xenografts displayed slower tumor growth compared to Empty xenografts from 23 until 40 days in vivo (p<0.05). with final volumes of 928±338 and 2512±387 mm3. respectively. Evaluation of apoptotic proteins showed that Over-143 versus Empty xenografts displayed reduced Bcl-2 levels. and increased caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (p<0.05). In addition. the incidence of apoptotic tumor cells. assessed by TUNEL. was increased in Over-143 versus Empty xenografts (p<0.01). Finally. Over-143 versus Empty xenografts displayed significantly reduced NF-κB activation and ERK5 levels and activation (p<0.05). as well as reduced proliferative index. evaluated by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (p<0.01 …,True,nJ66V_QAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,119,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023787,5765091817739797859,/scholar?cites=5765091817739797859,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023787,0,0,0

Although developing countries have little historical responsibility for climate change. they are likely to be most affected by it since they lack resources to cope with or to adapt to its effects. Studies show that the semi-arid northeast region of Brazil – where the country's poorest populations are concentrated – is one of the most vulnerable to climate change and thus likely to suffer its impacts more severely. The present paper addresses these problems by presenting a concrete initiative for strengthening adaptive capacity in the rural community of Pintadas as a first step in the development of a comprehensive methodology to help smallholder farmers in the region adapt to climate change. Based on the project results this paper highlights the integration of development. adaptive capacity and adaptation strategies.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated by the sector has caused much concern. mainly due to the fast growing rate of these emissions. now accounting for approximately 13% of global warming. Since the early 1990s. some of the highest growth rates of transportation emissions have been recorded for air transportation. which currently accounts for around 3.5% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. This increase is particular in the industrial-based developing countries. such as Brazil. where demand for air transportation has increased rapidly. In view of this. the main purpose of this paper is to discuss the contribution of Brazilian air transportation to global climate change and to present more environmentally friendly energy sources for mitigating CO2 emissions from this sector.

Our argument combines knowledge of tree recovery from injury after grassland fires. with theory about carbon acquisition and carbohydrate storage patterns in C3 woody plants in response to elevated CO2. We propose simply that elevated CO2 will tend to favour regrowth of juvenile trees trapped (sometimes for decades) in the ‘topkill’ zone. thus allowing them to escape more readily from periodic fires as CO2 continues to rise.

In mixed tree/grass ecosystems. recurrent grass‐fuelled fires can strongly suppress tree saplings and therefore control tree dominance. We propose that changes in atmospheric [CO2] could influence tree cover in such metastable ecosystems by altering their postburn recovery rates relative to flammable herbaceous growth forms such as grasses. Slow sapling recovery rates at low [CO2] would favour the spread of grasses and a reduction of tree cover. To test the possible importance of [CO2]/fire interactions. we first used a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) to simulate biomass in grassy ecosystems in South Africa with and without fire.

1148020,What controls South African vegetation—climate or fire?,2003,WJ Bond and GF Midgley and FI Woodward,69,,1,79-91,Elsevier,The role of fire in determining biome distribution in South Africa has long been debated. Acocks labelled veld types that he thought were ‘fire climax’ as ‘false’. He hypothesised that their current extent was due to extensive forest clearance by Iron Age farmers. We tested the relative importance of fire and climate in determining ecosystem characteristics by simulating potential vegetation of South Africa with and without fire using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM).

The replacement of dominant species by locally rare species may require decades. and extinctions may occur when plant species cannot migrate fast enough to escape the consequences of climate change. Such lags may impair ecosystem services. such as carbon sequestration and clean water production. Thus. to assess global change. simulation of plant migration and local vegetation change by dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) is critical. yet fraught with challenges. Global vegetation models cannot simulate all species. necessitating their aggregation into plant functional types (PFTs). Yet most PFTs encompass the full spectrum of migration rates.

Inc., Climate change poses a challenge to the conventional approach to biodiversity conservation. which relies on fixed protected areas. because the changing climate is expected to shift the distribution of suitable areas for many species. Some species will persist only if they can colonize new areas. although in some cases their dispersal abilities may be very limited. To address this problem we devised a quantitative method for identifying multiple corridors of connectivity through shifting habitat suitabilities that seeks to minimize dispersal demands first and then the area of land required. We applied the method to Proteaceae mapped on a 1‐minute grid for the western part of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. to supplement the existing protected areas. using Worldmap software. Our goal was to represent each species in at least 35 grid cells (approximately 100 km2) at all times between 2000 and 2050 despite …,True,maftA6oAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,368,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00080.x,3935131252954525440,/scholar?cites=3935131252954525440,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Williams12/publication/252793007_Planning_for_Climate_Change_Identifying_Minimum-Dispersal_Corridors_for_the_Cape_Proteaceae/links/5c0d69404585157ac1b6b33e/Planning-for-Climate-Change-Identifying-Minimum-Dispersal-Corridors-for-the-Cape-Proteaceae.pdf,0,0,0
1148024,Carbon dioxide and the uneasy interactions of trees and savannah grasses,2012,William J Bond and Guy F Midgley,367,,1588,601-612,The Royal Society,Savannahs are a mixture of trees and grasses often occurring as alternate states to closed forests. Savannah fires are frequent where grass productivity is high in the wet season. Fires help maintain grassy vegetation where the climate is suitable for woodlands or forests. Saplings in savannahs are particularly vulnerable to topkill of above-ground biomass. Larger trees are more fire-resistant and suffer little damage when burnt. Recruitment to large mature tree size classes depends on sapling growth rates to fire-resistant sizes and the time between fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can influence the growth rate of juvenile plants. thereby affecting tree recruitment and the conversion of open savannahs to woodlands. Trees have increased in many savannahs throughout the world. whereas some humid savannahs are being invaded by forests.

Yet. they differ. Improving capabilities and transfer mechanisms are two differing approaches to technological development. Technology transfer is associated with a key political dynamic within international climate policy. in that developing countries request support from industrialised countries.

1148030,Low Carbon Development and Poverty Exploring poverty alleviating mitigation action in developing countries,2012,Holle Wlokas and Britta Rennkamp and Marta Torres and Harald Winkler and Anya Boyd and Emily Tyler and Catherine Fedorsky,,,,,,Climate change and poverty mostly fall into the adaptation category in the current research literature and relevant policy-making. The strong connection between poverty and adaptation rests on the assumption that poor countries produce only low carbon emissions. They will also be most affected by the impacts of climate change. Therefore. efforts on poverty and climate change concentrate mostly on adapting to the consequences of climate change. If we acknowledge current findings of poverty research. we find that this separation between mitigation and adaptation does not hold anymore. Recent research suggests that poverty demographics have changed between 1990 and 2010. The majority of the poor nowadays live in middle-income countries. and not only in low-income countries. Emissions in middle-income countries increase. while their governments try to reduce emissions in the long term without jeopardising socio-economic development. Climate change presents a threefold policy challenge for middle-income countries. They need to: i) design mitigation actions in such a way that they contribute to alleviate poverty; ii) reduce emissions. helping to slow global warming in a way that does not compromise the competitiveness of their economies. because without collective action by all. the costs of inaction affect mostly the poor; and iii) prepare to adapt to the unavoidable consequences of climate change.

Boosting technological development through local content requirements in the wind energy industry,2013,Britta Rennkamp and Fernanda Fortes Westin,,,,,Energy Research Centre. University of Cape Town.,How can local content requirements (LCR) boost technological capability for renewable energy? This paper investigates the implementation of LCR in the wind energy in Brazil and South Africa. Brazil tried to grow a local wind industry requiring 60% domestic content in each installation since 2004. South Africa demands up to 45% domestic content in its recent program. The benefits of these requirements are heavily debated. The rationale behind LCR is that governments in developing countries intend to stimulate jobs in new industries and to accelerate technological development. This market intervention imposes a barrier for international manufacturers. as local manufacturing can push up the technology prices. Based on evidence from Brazil and South Africa. we find that LCR fall short as a single technology policy instrument. The Brazilian case shows that LCR incentivized the domestic production of low and medium technology content. These are the heavy parts. such as the towers. which are difficult to transport. Recently. parts of the nacelle. hubs and blades have increasingly been manufactured locally. High technology-intensive components. however. continue to be imported. Boosting local industries requires not just restrictive measure such as content requirements but. more importantly. it requires active support of technological capability.,True,chDPcOYAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,7,https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/16875,8844050905625289946,/scholar?cites=8844050905625289946,,https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/16875/Rennkamp_Feito_no_Brasil_Made_in_2013.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1148040,The social shaping of nuclear energy technology in South Africa,2016,Britta Rennkamp,,UNU Wider Working Papers,19,,,Why is the South African government pursuing a nuclear energy programme. despite abundant and accessible fossil and renewable energy resources? The South African electricity sector has historically been mainly coal-fuelled. One nuclear power plant has contributed five per cent of electricity since the 1980s. Renewable energy contributes another five per cent. We argue that the government has chosen to procure an additional 9.6 GW of nuclear capacity. because of a significant coalition of nuclear energy supporters. The role of coalitions in shaping policy outcomes has long been established. The constructivist literature on science and technology policy explains why decision-makers sometimes choose less practical and less costefficient technologies over others. The concept of social shaping of technology suggests that the interplay of social. political. economic. and cultural factors in a society shape the design and implementation of a technology. The literature identifies political factors leading to the prioritizing of nuclear technologies over other alternatives. We apply this theoretical perspective to the recent nuclear programme in South Africa. A discourse network analysis helps to establish the political arena of nuclear energy and to identify the coalitions supporting and opposing the nuclear energy programme. as well as the arguments that motivate their positioning (Leifeld 2012). The analysis uses data from 350 media articles. relevant policy documents. and background interviews.,True,chDPcOYAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,6,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/31374/629602.pdf?sequence=1#page=308,5593904341865349256,/scholar?cites=5593904341865349256,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/31374/629602.pdf?sequence=1#page=308,0,0,0
1148041,South African approaches to MRV of mitigation actions: the case of installing solar water heaters,2012,Britta Rennkamp,,,,,Energy Research Centre. University of Cape Town.,How to measure. report and verify (MRV) mitigation actions? This question calls growing attention in the international negotiations on climate change. because industrialized countries agreed to support developing countries in their efforts of reducing emissions through so-called ‘nationally appropriate mitigation actions’ (NAMAs). In the process of defining those NAMAs. the question stands out how the emission reductions can be verified. This case study illustrates the way ‘MRV’ works in the case of solar water heating. South Africa has no officially registered NAMAs in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) yet. Therefore. we chose one of the most advanced ‘mitigation action’. which is the roll out program for solar water heating. which is a key energy efficiency program. We find that the incentive system matters for collecting data for MRV. The responsible agency for the incentive needs to provide for data collection. The process becomes easier if previsions for MRV are already made in the stage of designing the policy.

1148042,South Africa’s multiple faces in current climate clubs,2017,Britta Rennkamp and Andrew Marquard,24,South African Journal of International Affairs,4,443-461,Routledge,Climate clubs emerged as a concept to revitalise the international climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and mitigate the free-riding problem. The underlying idea suggests that countries committed to reducing emissions can advance a stable coalition in the form of a club with other countries. As a result. more countries would put forth targets for more ambitious emissions reductions. This article analyses South Africa’s memberships in current climate related clubs. We contextualise South African climate club governance in its wider geopolitical and national context of low-carbon development. The purpose of the analysis is to identify if and how South Africa can possibly contribute to advancing ambition for change within climate clubs.

1148045,Poverty and Climate Change Mitigation A Brief Inspiration,2012,Britta Rennkamp and Holle Wlokas,,,,,Mitigation Action Plans and Scenarios (MAPS Programme),Poverty and climate change mitigation are two concepts. which trouble policy makers and climate policy analysts. because they perceive them as conflicting public policy objectives. Poverty remains a pressing problem in many middle-‐income countries. where efforts for mitigating climate change become more urgent. Poverty alleviation often disappears as an explicit priority in the wider concepts like socio-‐economic. low-‐carbon or sustainable development. Mitigation strategies rarely directly address the fact that large parts of the population live below the poverty line.

Technology. Innovation (STI) policy promoted by international organizations derive from the experience of industrialized countries. The realities in later industrializing countries are different: inequality rates remain high. while poverty and redistribution dominate their political agendas. As a means to socio-economic development STI policy has increasingly gained importance in public policy in the developing world. This thesis seeks to understand how governments in later industrializing countries with high rates of inequality (LICHIR) legitimize and develop their STI policies. The author argues that governments in LICHIR face multiple and competing policy burdens. To overcome these burdens. political actors try to legitimize and to develop their STI policy responding to both domestic and international driving forces. These policy forces are fuelled by three sources of legitimacy: internationalization. technonationalism and social development. Evidence derives from a comparative analysis of the STI policy processes in South Africa and Brazil from 1990- 2010.

1148047,Sustaining Carbon Lock-In,2018,JESSE BURTON and TAWNEY LOTT and BRITTA RENNKAMP,,The Politics of Fossil Fuel Subsidies and Their Reform,,229,,South Africa is a highly carbon-intensive country. Its government has committed to domestic climate change mitigation policy and international treaties to reduce emissions. At the same time. the government also continues to support the production and use of fossil fuels directly (through supporting coal-fired electricity and the conversion of coal into liquid fuels) and indirectly (through the provision of supporting infrastructure). While the dominance of fossil fuels has been explained through the historical co-evolution of state. business and mining interests (Fine and Rustomjee 1996; Marquard 2006; Baker 2012). little is known about the extent of current government support for fossil fuel industries and why such support persists. This chapter quantifies fossil fuel production subsidies in South Africa over the period 2007–15 and offers an analysis of the politics underpinning such subsidies.Any study of the politics and reform of fossil fuel subsidies in South Africa requires an investigation into the existence of subsidies and their scale. who benefits from them. the actors providing them and their justifications for doing so. To date. only one analysis has attempted to describe and quantify fossil fuel production subsidies in South Africa. for 2013 and 2014 (Garg and Kitson 2015). This chapter extends their analysis. first. by highlighting how historical state support has created a system of ‘cheap’fossil fuels through long-running formal and informal institutions and. second. by quantifying subsidies over a longer time period (2007–15).

1148048,Trading off climate change mitigation and poverty reduction in South Africa: drivers and barriers to institutional change,2016,Britta Rennkamp,,,,,,The assumption that there will be trade-offs between climate change mitigation measures and poverty reduction measures goes largely unchallenged in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This paper analyses how these trade-offs unfold at the national level in South Africa. South Africa is a middle income country that exemplifies the challenge of accommodating efforts for emissions reductions and poverty reduction at the same time. The paper analyses the trade-offs and distributional conflicts that drive and hinder institutional change in the current climate policy regime. The analysis focuses on three regulatory regimes in climate change: the climate change response white paper. the carbon tax and the renewable energy program. A combination of interview-based qualitative research and an innovative discourse network analysis reveals the discourse between competing coalitions supporting and opposing specific interventions. We find in the case of South Africa that the lack of economic growth over the last few years has kept emissions levels relatively low and consequently postponed the hard trade-offs between climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. Trade-offs appear in the political discourse. especially around the carbon tax and carbon budgets. Yet. distributional conflicts determine both drivers and barriers to institutional change. Powerful coalitions opposing the carbon tax managed to push the government into postponing the implementation of the tax. We conclude that win-win situations are possible. and that the crux lies in the implementation.

The discussion seeks to span two disciplines. international relations and economic research on innovation. recognising the role of intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) in domestic STI policymaking.

The analysis indicated that these leadership processes evolved through three distinct phases characterized by different forms of leadership. involved many leaders. and were strongly affected by context.

Land stewardship in Australia,2006,Chris Cocklin and Jacqui Dibden and Naomi Mautner,172,The geographical journal,3,197-205,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Recent assessments of Australia's land and water resources have revealed widespread patterns of serious decline. much of it directly associated with agricultural practices. The environmental degradation associated with agriculture has both biophysical and socio‐economic underpinnings. While there have been calls to attend to the sustainability ‘crisis’ of Australian agriculture. policy settings remain firmly locked onto a productivist trajectory. We consider the implications of contemporary policy settings for farmland sustainability against the background of debates as to the meaning of ‘multifunctionality’. The discussion is then turned to the Land Stewardship project. a strategic policy initiative within the State of Victoria that was looked to as a means of redressing environmental degradation in agricultural landscapes while also being attentive to rural community and economic issues.

This paper considers the discursive foundations for promotion of agricultural biotechnology. arguing that notions of progress and ‘science-based’ risk assessment act as ‘anti-political’ strategies to remove consideration of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) from the cut and thrust of politics. while the concept of ‘food security’ reconstitutes agricultural biotechnology as a moral imperative. We argue that a debate ostensibly focussed on developing countries in fact largely arises from discordant views about the future of farming and rural areas in the developed countries where these arguments are taking place.

Two characteristics are cause for particular concern. The first is that it is a reactive process. rather than representing a proactive approach to environmental management. The second is that the project-based approach often means that the combined effects of two or more developments are often overlooked.

While diversification into other agricultural land uses apparently takes place with little consternation or resistance. the development of plantation forestry on agricultural land is often accompanied by concern and controversy. What sets plantation forestry apart from agriculture is that it often involves new forms of ownership and control. it is accompanied by changes in population. and it transforms the production landscape. The development of plantation forestry has become increasingly commonplace in many parts of rural Australia. and it has been met with mixed reactions from rural communities.

In rural and semirural areas. local and regional government agencies are commonly responsible for encouraging landholders to conserve native vegetation and species on these private properties. Yet these agencies often lack the capacity to design and implement conservation programs tailored to rural and semirural landholdings and instead offer one program to all landholders.

While much of the existing research concludes that these mechanisms consolidate the global extension of neoliberalism – enhancing the power of corporate actors to the detriment of smaller producers – we argue that this overlooks the complex ways in which standards are used by governments and farmers in the governing of farming practices.

1148073,Sustainability and agri-environmental governance,2005,Jacqui Dibden and Chris Cocklin,,"Agricultural governance: Globalization and the new politics of regulation. Routledge, London",,135-152,,The sustainability discourse has been remarkably persistent. indeed growing. in its political and social stature over the twenty years or so since it first rose to prominence. In agriculture the already well-established interest in sustainability has been fuelled recently by pressures to extend the use of bio-technology. an increasing consumer interest in food safety. a global focus on food security. and emerging public. political and consumer demands for a ‘clean and green’food supply. Despite the social and political interest in sustainability. the ‘agri-industrial’model of agriculture remains persistent. Economic and political agendas continue to promote a globalized food system. mass food markets. competition and efficiency. along with what Jessop (1997) refers to as the ‘hollowing out’of the state. According to Marsden (2003). powerful interests. supported by regulatory and social networks. have been successful in upholding an inherently unsustainable accumulation system. but the ‘crisis’ of the extant accumulation system has deepened in the face of the sustainability agenda. Thus agricultural policies that seek to entrench the agri-industrial model increasingly stand in contrast to regulation and governing in respect of the environment. For farmers. this presents the dilemma of at once responding to supposedly unfettered markets while simultaneously satisfying increased regulatory and social expectations in terms of their environmental performance and other requirements (eg in relation to food quality). How these respective influences are mediated at the farm level in terms of decisions about land use and resource allocation is a question of some …,True,V8vfSpkAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,83,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nqJgL7SBSEQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA135&dq=info:3_cHu-yqAYQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qmAE8PmQG9&sig=fLuOdFBdArESGyDssJmsOOqed5g,9512071821710063583,/scholar?cites=9512071821710063583,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacqui_Dibden/publication/292697736_Sustainability_and_agri-environmental_governance/links/56ba851b08ae3af6847d896e,0,0,0

Australia's ‘competitive productivism’ is the outcome of an export-oriented economy and a neoliberal political orientation. and this environment affects the development of AAFNs in various ways.

Evidence increasingly supports the finding that this transformation is not triggered by climate policy alone. but rather is shaped by a broad array of decisions and practices that are rooted in underlying patterns of development.

Yet such transformations are not always viewed as politically feasible; finding ways to enhance the political feasibility of ambitious decarbonization trajectories is needed. This paper reviews the role of social justice as an organizing principle for politically feasible 1.5°C transformations. A social justice lens usefully focuses attention on first. protecting vulnerable people from climate change impacts. second. protecting people from disruptions of transformation. and finally. enhancing the process of envisioning and implementing an equitable post-carbon society. However. justice-focused arguments could also have unintended consequences. such as being deployed against climate action.

1148094,Can visualization save the world?

The urgent need to mitigate and adapt to climate change is becoming more widely understood in scientific and some policy circles. but public awareness and policy change are lagging well behind. Emerging visualisation theory suggests that realistic landscape visualisations may offer special advantages in bringing the possible consequences of climate change home to people in a compelling manner. Recent research results on a local climate change visioning process conducted in British Columbia is providing new evidence of this effect. A participatory process to localize. spatialize. and visualize climate change implications in case study communities was successful in raising community awareness. increasing the sense of urgency. and articulating for the first time holistic community options in mitigating and adapting to climate change at the local level. Potentially. such methods could accelerate policy change and action. representing a powerful social marketing tool. The authors conclude that the persuasive use of visualisations and visioning processes by landscape architects is justified. and indeed imperative in communicating climate change.

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century. they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy. energy security and economic development concerns. and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper. we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy. grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models. energy systems simulation models. power systems and electricity market models. and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space. (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency.

But. high capital cost and uncertainty regarding future cost and performance improvements are barriers to investment in water electrolysis. Expert elicitations can support decision-making when data are sparse and their future development uncertain. Therefore. this study presents expert views on future capital cost. lifetime and efficiency for three electrolysis technologies: alkaline (AEC). proton exchange membrane (PEMEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). Experts estimate that increased R&D funding can reduce capital costs by 0–24%. while production scale-up alone has an impact of 17–30%.

Cost projections are important for understanding this role. but data are scarce and uncertain. Here. we construct experience curves to project future prices for 11 electrical energy storage technologies. We find that. regardless of technology. capital costs are on a trajectory towards US $340±60 kWh− 1 for installed stationary systems and US $175±25 kWh− 1 for battery packs once 1 TWh of capacity is installed for each technology. Bottom-up assessment of material and production costs indicates this price range is not infeasible. Cumulative investments of US $175–510 billion would be needed for any technology to reach 1 TWh deployment. which could be achieved by 2027–2040 based on market growth projections.

This emissions rate is called the “marginal emissions factor” (MEF). Accurate estimation of MEFs is crucial for performance assessment because their application leads to decisions regarding the relative merits of CO2 reduction strategies. This article contributes to formulating the principles by which MEFs are estimated. highlighting the strengths and weaknesses in existing approaches. and presenting an alternative based on the observed behaviour of power stations.

This may be appropriate for larger applications where demand is reasonably smooth. but becomes questionable for applications where demand exhibits substantial volatility such as for a single residential dwelling—an important potential market for the commercialisation of small-scale fuel cells and other micro-CHP. Choice of temporal precision is also influenced by the relative ease in obtaining coarse data. their compatibility with available energy price data. and avoidance of computational overheads when data sets expand.

One reason is that most studies into the future cost of storage technologies focus on investment cost. An appropriate cost assessment must be based on the application-specific lifetime cost of storing electricity. We determine the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for 9 technologies in 12 power system applications from 2015 to 2050 based on projected investment cost reductions and current performance parameters. We find that LCOS will reduce by one-third to one-half by 2030 and 2050. respectively. across the modeled applications. with lithium ion likely to become most cost efficient for nearly all stationary applications from 2030.

Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2 C scenarios. under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs. and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios’ average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5 GtCO 2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale. and finding it to be subsequently unavailable. leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 C.

UK: Cambridge University Press,The privatisation of the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) of England and Wales not only transferred ownership from the public to the private sector but must rank as one of the most ambitious attempts anywhere to introduce competition into a normally vertically integrated natural monopoly. The high-tension transmission grid and the low-tension distribution system are classic ex-amples of natural monopolies in which the costs of duplication make competition between altemative systems uneconomic. Between the date of na-tionalisation in 1948 and privatisation in 1990. the industry consisted of two vertically integrated. state-owned segments: generation and high-tension transmission were under the control of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and its precursors. whereas distribution and supply were under the control of twelve Area Boards (ABs). which received electricity from the CEGB under the Bulk Supply Tariff. Both the CEGB and the Area Boards were represented on the coordinating body of the Electricity Council. Recent theoretical discussions of regulation and privatisation typically work within a Principal-Agent framework and assume the existence of a sin-gle principal (normally taken as the state or party in power). with a coherent and well-deﬁned objective and substantial powers to design systems of monitoring and incentives to best achieve that objective. constrained by the opacity and asymmetry of information about the regulated enterprise and the conﬂicting objectives of the owner. the manager. or both.

Thermal capacity falls only slightly in response to the extra wind capacity. and there is a shift towards power stations with higher variable costs (but lower fixed costs). The changes to the pattern of prices. once capacity has adjusted. are relatively small. In an oligopolistic setting. strategic generators will choose lower levels of capacity.

Large consumers in every country can choose their electricity supplier. and in some countries. this choice has been extended to every consumer. The European Union has decided that from 2007 at the latest. all customers will be able to choose their electricity supplier. A number of large European electricity companies have been responding to this changing environment by merging with electricity companies in other countries. This means that while some national markets may not look unduly concentrated. concentration at the European level has been growing.

Electrical energy is traded in many European and US markets. while the USA also has markets for generating capacity. US generators can reduce the cost of complying with environmental regulations by trading emissions of sulphur dioxide. while Europe has just started a carbon-dioxide emissions-trading scheme.

The conventional power stations were only divided between two companies. however. and we show that duopolistic competition in an unregulated spot market might imply undesirably high prices. Most sales are hedged in the contract market. which makes the spot market more competitive. and a realistic threat of entry could also force generators to keep their prices down. In the event. a large amount of entry took place. supported by the regional electricity companies' franchise monopoly over smaller consumers. That monopoly ends in 1998. so that further entry might become very difficult. while competition between firms already in the generation market is still limited.

Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems. leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations.

Until now. there have been too few CSP projects to derive robust conclusions about its cost development. Here we present an empirical study of the cost development of all operating CSP stations and those under construction. examining the roles of capacity growth. industry continuity. and policy support design. We identify distinct CSP expansion phases. each characterized by different cost pressure in the policy regime and different industry continuity. In 2008–2011. with low cost pressure and following industry discontinuity. costs increased. In the current phase. with high cost pressure and continuous industry development. costs decreased rapidly. with learning rates exceeding 20%.

1148173,Calliope: a multi-scale energy systems modelling framework,2018,Stefan Pfenninger and Bryn Pickering,3,Journal of Open Source Software,29,825,,Energy system models create coherent quantitative descriptions of how energy is converted. transported. and consumed. at scales ranging from urban districts to entire continents. Formulating such models as optimisation problems allows a modeller to asses the effect of constraints. such as limited land availability for wind power deployment. the cost of battery electricity storage. or the elimination of fossil fuels from a country or a city. on the feasibility or cost of the modelled system. These models are particularly important in planning and policy-making for the transformation of the global energy system to address climate change.Calliope is a framework to build energy system models. designed to analyse systems with arbitrarily high spatial and temporal resolution. with a scale-agnostic mathematical formulation permitting analyses ranging from single urban districts to countries and continents. Its formulation of energy system components was influenced by the power nodes modelling framework by Heussen et al.(Heussen. Koch. Ulbig. & Andersson. 2010). but generalised to consider energy carriers other than electricity. Calliope’s key features include the ability to handle high spatial and temporal resolution and to easily run on high-performance computing systems. Its design cleanly separates the general framework (code) from the problem-specific model (data). It provides both a command-line interface and an API for programmatic use. to be useful both for users experienced with Python and those with no Python knowledge.,True,pQFfN38AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,39,https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00825.pdf,2201781058244578148,/scholar?cites=2201781058244578148,,https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00825.pdf,0,0,0

We describe the three main technologies likely to be used to harness sunlight—thermal heating. photovoltaic (PV). and concentrating solar power (CSP)—and identify critical climate vulnerabilities for each one. We then compare these vulnerabilities with assessments of future changes in mean conditions and extreme event risk levels.

Here. we use observational radiation data from 119 stations across China to show that the PV potential decreased on average by 11–15% between 1960 and 2015. The relationship between observed surface radiation and emissions of sulfur dioxide and black carbon suggests that strict air pollution control measures. combined with reduced fossil fuel consumption. would allow surface radiation to increase.

We compare ten years of synthetic hourly PV generation series derived from CM-SAF SARAH satellite data and observed load. The analysis also provides insights into the storage capacity required to smooth residual load over different time horizons.

In this Perspective. we discuss the potential contribution of carbon capture and utilization (CCU). Owing to the scale and rate of CO 2 production compared to that of utilization allowing long-term sequestration. it is highly improbable the chemical conversion of CO 2 will account for more than 1% of the mitigation challenge. and even a scaled-up enhanced oil recovery (EOR)-CCS industry will likely only account for 4–8%. Therefore. whilst CO 2-EOR may be an important economic incentive for some early CCS projects.

The rapid advances in computing and communication capabilities enable the concept smart buildings become possible. Most energy-consuming household tasks do not need to be performed at specific times but rather within a preferred time. If these types of tasks can be coordinated among multiple homes so that they do not all occur at the same time yet still satisfy customers’ requirement. the energy cost and power peak demand could be reduced. In this paper. the optimal scheduling of smart homes’ energy consumption is studied using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach.

NY: American Institute of Chemical Engineers. 1971-c2002.,This paper describes the problem of production scheduling in the process industries. First. a review of the techniques for optimising production schedules at individual production sites is presented. with an emphasis on formal mathematical methods. Recent extensions to such work have resulted in techniques for both long-term planning of individual facilities and the overall planning of production and distribution in multisite flexible manufacturing systems. A number of challenges arise in such integrated manufacturing problems. Mathematical models of overwhelming size must be avoided and it is very difficult to apply simplistic approaches based on straightforward capacity models when the capacity is flexible and is to be shared between competing products. The recent research in single-and multisite planning will be reviewed. Another important factor. especially when considering longer term planning. is the presence of uncertainty. both with respect to the process (eg rates/processing times and yields) and the market. There have been a number of recent developments in tackling uncertainty in planning and scheduling. either explicitly during planning. or by including a real-time. reactive scheduling capability within the planning function. These will be considered here.

In alkaline conditions. they exhibit more positive onset (0.94 V vs RHE) and half-wave potentials (0.83 V vs RHE) than commercial Pt/C. while in acidic media the onset potential is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C with a peroxide yield lower than 10%.

1148235,Support materials for PEMFC and DMFC electrocatalysts—a review,2012,Surbhi Sharma and Bruno G Pollet,208,,,96-119,Elsevier,Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) have found a wide variety of commercial applications. Their performance is essentially governed by the electrocatalyst support materials as they strongly influence the electrocatalyst performance. durability and efficiency. It is well known that carbonaceous support materials suffer from carbon corrosion (oxidation) especially at high potentials over time and thus alternative low-cost. high-performing and non-corrosive electrocatalyst support materials are urgently required.

In terms of the losses within fuel cells. the ohmic loss makes up a significant portion. Of this loss. the contact resistance between the GDL and the bipolar plate (BPP) is an important constituent. By analysing the change in thickness and ohmic resistance of GDLs under compression. important mechanical and electrical properties are obtained. Derived parameters such as the ‘displacement factor’ are used to characterise a representative range of commercial GDLs.

We find that the tortuosity of two halves of the electrode. each roughly 250× 350× 50 μm differ by about 30%. On a smaller scale. 80× 100× 50 μm. local tortuosity variations up to a factor of 3 were observed. The Bruggeman relationship between porosity and tortuosity is also examined. We find that local porosity alone does not determine local tortuosity very well. and that the average relationship between …,True,57ud_ucAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,208,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.079112jes/meta,4297209755098721320,/scholar?cites=4297209755098721320,,,0,0,0

This approach allows the temperature of operation to be reduced to below 600 °C. well below the conventional SOFC operating temperature. Historically. the use of CGO as an electrolyte material has been viewed as impractical because of its poor stability in reducing atmospheres at elevated temperatures. leading to electronic conductivity. which effectively short-circuits the cell leading to a loss of efficiency.

On the other hand. lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are on track to hit the target 100 USD/kWh price in the next decade due to economy of scale and manufacturing process improvements. evident in the rise in Li-ion gigafactories. The forecast of RE and Li-ion technology costs is important for planning RE integration into existing energy systems. Previous cost predictions on Li-ion batteries were conducted using conventional learning curve models based on a single factor. such as either installed capacity or innovation activity. A two-stage learning curve model was recently investigated wherein mineral costs were taken as a factor for material cost to set the floor price. and material cost was a major factor for the battery pack price. However. these models resulted in the overestimation of future prices. In this work. the future prices of Li-ion nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) battery packs-a battery chemistry of choice in the electric vehicle and stationary grid storage markets-were projected up to year 2025 using multi-factor learning curve models. Among the generated models. the two-factor learning curve model has the most realistic and statistically sound results having learning rates of 21.18% for battery demand and 3.0% for innovation. By year 2024. the projected price would fall below the 100 USD/kWh industry benchmark battery pack price. consistent with most market research predictions.

This relies on the real-time evaluation of the cost-optimal extent of solvent regeneration at given energy and CO2 prices. To achieve this. a multilevel. model predictive control architecture is proposed and developed for this system. The low-level control regulates the level of solvent inside the reboiler and the power supplied to the system. while the high-level control regulates the extent of the solvent regeneration in order to minimize the operating cost. This approach ensures the safe operation of the system while concurrently enhancing process flexibility.

Because of these low strength values. unreinforced cements are never used in flexure or tension. and studies of cement strength are usually confined to compression. Those few studies which have considered flexural or tensile failure have concluded that hydraulic cements have an intrinsic maximum tensile strength of about 20 MPa 4. 5. Here we demonstrate that the commonly observed flexural weakness of cement is due to the presence of large voids which are largely undetected by conventional methods of pore analysis such as gas adsorption and mercury porosimetry.

1148343,Molecular adhesion and its applications: the sticky universe,2007,Kevin Kendall,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,At the beginning of the twentieth century. engineers and technologists would have recognized the importance of adhesion in two main aspects: First. in the display of friction between surfaces—at the time a topic of growing importance to engineers; the second in crafts requiring the joining of materials—principally wood—to form engineering structures. While physical scientists would have admitted the adhesive properties of glues. gels. and certain pastes. they regarded them as materials of uncertain formulation. too impure to be amenable to precise experiment. Biological scientists were aware also of adhesive phenomena. but the science was supported by documentation rather than understanding. By the end of the century. adhesion and adhesives were playing a crucial and deliberate role in the formulation of materials. in the design and manufacture of engineering structures without weakening rivets or pins. and in the use of thin sections and intricate shapes. Miniaturization down to the micro-and now to the nano-level of mechanical. electrical. electronic. and optical devices relied heavily on the understanding and the technology of adhesion. For most of the century. physical scientists were aware that the states of matter. whether gas. liquid. or solid. were determined by the competition between thermal energy and int-molecular binding forces. Then the solid state had to be differentiated into crystals. amorphous glasses. metals. etc.. so the importance of the molecular attractions in determining stiffness and strength became clearer.,True,3jZig-oAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,413,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=0Z8SBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA11&dq=info:DniEdOnebzQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=FibkXK2Hw3&sig=1QLxt8o1wmu2VBQOFNHoTUpTG0k,3778483706650720270,/scholar?cites=3778483706650720270,,,0,0,0

Mathematical and Physical Sciences,1554,321-340,The Royal Society,This paper describes a novel attempt to determine quantitatively the area of contact between stationary and sliding contacts by means of an ultrasonic technique. The basic idea is to generate an ultrasonic wave in one body and measure the impulse passing into the second body through the interface. Analysis shows that the transmitted pulse depends on the elastic stiffness of the interface. According to theory the stiffness of a single circular contact is proportional to the diameter of the contact and not to its area and this has been confirmed by simple scaled-up experiments. Because of this the stiffness of multiple contacts is not determined unequivocally by the true area of contact. The scaled-up experiments show that for widely separated contacts the stiffness is the sum of the stiffnesses of the individual contacts; if they are close together it is determined primarily by the size of the embracing circle of contact.

Under such compression. cracks can propagate through a particle to split it into two or more fragments of smaller size and increase surface area if the material is sufficiently brittle.

Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences",1511,139-153,The Royal Society,A theory is formulated to connect the strength of cement paste with its porosity. The theory shows that bending strength is largely dictated by the length of the largest pores. as in the Griffith (1920) model. but there is also an influence of the volume of porosity. which affects toughness through changing elastic modulus and fracture energy. Verification of this theory was achieved by observing the large pores in cement. and then relating bending strength to the measured defect length. modulus and fracture energy. The argument was proved by developing processes to remove the large pores from cement pastes. thereby raising the bending strength to 70 MPa. Further removal of colloidal pores gave a bending strength of 150 MPa and compression strength up to 300 MPa with improved toughness.

A platinum alumina catalyst was used to optimise the operating conditions for glycerol steam reforming and mass spectroscopy was chosen to measure reformer gas yield. The problem is that glycerol steam reforming is relatively untested even with pure glycerol and the by-product quality may be too poor. The strategy was therefore to optimise the process using pure glycerol and compare the performance with by-product glycerol. To test catalyst degradation caused by carbon deposition. a Solid Oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was used as a separate reformer and electrical performance was measured to indicate carbon deposition. This is the first time a SOFC has been run on glycerol. The results showed that thermodynamic theory can be used to predict reformer performance.

Disassembly is a systematic method for separating a product into its constituent parts. components or other groupings. Efficient disassembly requires development of disassembly sequence plans (DSPs). Generating DSPs describing the sequence of parts during disassembly is not a trivial problem since DSP generation is described to be NP-complete. Further complicating matters is the presence of a high degree of uncertainty due to upgrading/downgrading of the product during its use by the customers and defects occurring either when in use or during disassembly.

The notion of compressive strength is shown to be useful only in the case of yielding. For compression cracking. where the stress at failure varies with geometry and manner of force application. compressive strength is not such a useful parameter. Therefore. new failure criteria are suggested for compression cracking based on the energy balance theory of fracture. These criteria explain why the force required for failure depends on the mode of cracking. on the fracture surface energy of the material. and on the geometry and elasticity of the specimen.

Shifting or reducing demand at critical moments can reduce the need for generation capacity. help with the integration of renewables. support more efficient system operation and thereby potentially lead to cost and carbon reductions for the entire energy system.In this paper we review the nature of the response resource of consumers from different non-domestic sectors in the UK. based on extensive half hourly demand profiles and observed demand responses. We further explore the potential to increase the demand response capacity through changes in the regulatory and market environment.The analysis suggests that present demand response measures tend to stimulate stand-by generation capacity in preference to load shifting and we propose that extended response times may …,True,yXfmS6kAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,78,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513005363,549731389809055861,/scholar?cites=549731389809055861,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31579983/13_02_JEPO_TSB_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Incorporating the role of storage into current scenario tools is challenging. because it requires high temporal resolution to reflect the effects of intermittent sources on system balancing. This study draws on results from a model with such resolution. It concludes that large scale storage could become economically viable for scenarios with high penetration of renewables. As the proportion of intermittent sources increases. the optimal type of storage shifts towards solutions with low energy related costs. even at the expense of efficiency. However. a range of uncertainties have been identified. concerning storage technology development. the regulatory environment. alternatives to storage and the stochastic uncertainty of year-on-year revenues.

1148369,Flexibility. dynamism and diversity in energy supply and demand: A critical review,2018,Philipp Grunewald and Marina Diakonova,38,,,58-66,Elsevier,Flexibility is vital to the operation of electricity systems. It ensures that the system can keep supply and demand in balance in real time. Until recently the provision of flexibility was a fortunate by-product of thermal power generation using fossil fuels as a convenient storage medium. The rapid emergence of renewables poses a major challenge to this model. As thermal power stations are increasingly displaced with more variable renewable sources of electricity. new forms of flexibility are urgently needed. Two promising candidates for this role are energy storage and demand side response.This paper argues that in low carbon systems flexibility may at times and in certain places supersede the need for component efficiency. in order to improve overall system efficiency.

A conflict exists between keeping these signals simple for consumers. while making responses appropriate for increasingly complex supply-demand balancing dynamics in future. This study reviews some of the demand responses observed in time-of-use (ToU) tariff trials and assesses their effectiveness in scenarios with higher levels of wind. The authors simulate wholesale real-time prices for high-wind scenarios as a benchmark tariff. Simple tariff structures are compared against real-time prices for the extent to which they can `nudge' demand in the `right direction'. They present results which suggest that even in high-wind scenarios. simple ToU tariffs could have a beneficial effect on overall system costs.

1148378,The role of electricity storage in low carbon energy systems: techno-economic drivers and transistional barriers,2013,Philipp Gruenewald,,,,,Imperial College London,UK Government policy sets out ambitious aims to decarbonise the energy system. This requires fundamental changes to the existing energy infrastructure and electricity from low carbon sources is expected to play a major role in this transition. Electricity storage is widely believed to be able to support the integration of low carbon technologies. So far. the installation of wind power in the UK has not led to any significant deployment of additional storage capacity. Investors still regard electricity storage as too expensive. As more low carbon technologies are deployed. the need for storage may increase. How do these developments affect the role for electricity storage in future UK energy systems? This thesis addresses this question by combining technical. economic and social approaches. A techno-economic model has been developed to examine the commercial opportunities for electricity storage in future scenarios. A socio-technical perspective of technological transition complements this approach. Stakeholders have informed the analysis on the uptake of storage through a workshop and interviews. The results point towards a significant increase in the gross value of electricity storage. even at modest efficiencies. especially within highly renewables based scenarios. However. the concept of storing electricity is poorly aligned with existing institutions and regulatory structures. Despite the potential increase in value. electricity storage may fail to be adopted in the best societal interest. Path dependency may lead to the deployment of established alternative solutions. or favour storage technologies with unnecessarily high performance.

1148381,Measuring the relationship between time-use and electricity consumption,2015,Phil Grünewald and Russell Layberry,,ECEEE-2015 European council for an energy efficient economy,,1439-50,,Much hope rests on our ability to reduce. avoid and otherwise manipulate energy consumption. In order to do so. it would be important to understand what we use energy for. Despite the early signs of ‘big data’arriving from smart meters and other electricity consumption studies. very little is know about what the resulting demand profiles represent in terms of activities ‘behind the meter’. This is especially problematic for peak demand periods. which could increase dramatically in coming years due to changes in technology and practices. The lack of activity based energy data has two main reasons. First. until recently it didn’t matter. Under the ‘predict and provide’paradigm the actual service provided by energy is inconsequential. Second. measuring at sub-meter level can be very expensive and labour intensive to instrument. Both reasons no longer apply. For demand shifting measures to be designed effectively it is essential to understand the activities (not just the appliances) involved in consumption. This paper presents a new and innovative low cost collection method that uses smart phones to collect 1 second resolution household electricity consumption profiles. while also gathering event driven activity information from household participants. The combinations of activity and consumption data bridges a disciplinary gap between social sciences and traditional engineering approaches and allows for a wealth of new insights into energy use practices.

Bottom-up energy demand models therefore use time-use data to inform the timing of energy use. In this paper we present some empirical evidence to test the strength of this assumption.Using data that simultaneously captures household activities and their coinciding electricity consumption. it is possible to relate one to the other. We validate the temporal accuracy of the approach with the example of reporting hot drinks and the distinct signature of kettle usage. Despite good data accuracy. the predictive power of reported activities for electricity use is modest.

However. when these activity patterns are used to produce estimates of the electricity demand loads associated with such activities. little attention is paid to the links between activities and the actual use of the electric equipment responsible for the production of the actual demand loads.

1148385,What we do matters–a time-use app to capture energy relevant activities,2017,P Grunewald and Marina Diakonova and Davide Zilli and Jessica Bernard and Adriano Matousek,,,,,European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy,High expectations rest on demand side response to aid the reliability of future electricity systems and to reduce costs. The extent of the potential contribution depends among other things on what that demand is used for. Some uses could be more flexible than others. Some may respond to price signals. others may require different forms of incentive or changes to material or social contexts. Our understanding of the temporal relationship between the activities and the resulting electricity patterns is still in its infancy. This paper presents a novel research tool to combine electricity data collection with activity information at the household level. We critically review established methods to time-use collection and propose a range of innovations to improve their suitability for energy related research with the aim to establish ‘what people use electricity for’. Innovations include: 1) A six-way decision tree allows to discriminate 714 in-home activities with fewer than five screen interaction. 2) The recording of instances in time (‘constructive time perspective’) greatly reduces the user-interface complexity. 3) Virtual rewards have been shown to improve participation and even introduce a degree of recording competitiveness within households. The functionality of this open source mobile app is presented alongside feedback and data from its deployments in UK households. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of this approach in relation to conventional paper-based methods and point towards future research opportunities this approach could enable.,True,yXfmS6kAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,9,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:9914bcf4-027f-4988-8ab0-5bb0c38b0657,12143632838206133309,/scholar?cites=12143632838206133309,,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:9914bcf4-027f-4988-8ab0-5bb0c38b0657/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=Grunewald%2Bet%2Bal%252C%2BWhat%2Bwe%2Bdo%2Bmatters%2B-%2BA%2Btime-use%2Bapp%2Bto%2Bcapture%2Benergy%2Brelevant%2Bactivities.pdf&type_of_work=Conference+item,0,0,0
1148386,Electricity storage in future GB networks–a market failure?,2012,Philipp Grünewald,,BIEE 9th Academic Conference,,19-20,,Electricity markets in the UK have evolved primarily around large scale generators. while networks remain regulated monopolies and demand is treated as passive. With increased penetration of less flexible low carbon technologies and the possible electrification of heat and transport towards 2050. both networks and demand may need to become more active components of the electricity system. to ensure cost effective balancing of supply and demand. One option that could facilitate improved system integration of new technologies is electricity storage.Widely regarded as too expensive. electricity storage has recently been shown to have the potential to significantly reduce the cost for the electricity system as a whole. making it a macro-economically attractive proposition. However. the diverse sources of value. including network. operational. generation capacity and CO2 savings. are difficult to aggregate under current market frameworks. Moreover. institutions and rules. developed in support of existing regimes. could potentially lock-out ‘disruptive’technologies. such as electricity storage.

How demand response could be enhanced based on early UK experience,2014,Philipp Gruenewald and Jacopo Torriti,,,,1-4,IEEE,Policy makers are in broad agreement that demand response should play a major role in EU electricity systems and provide much needed future system flexibility. Yet. little demand response has been forthcoming in member states to date. This paper identifies some of the technical potential for demand response. based on empirical data from one UK demand aggregator. Half-hourly electricity readings of demand during normal operation and during response events have been analysed for different industry and service sectors.

This paper analyses current understanding of motivations and barriers that affect microgeneration adoption with the aim of identifying opportunities for improving the uptake. The findings indicate that. although feed-in tariffs have increased the uptake. policies do not sufficiently address the most significant barrier – capital costs. ‘Environmental benefit’ appears to be a significant motivation to install. but there is doubt whether consumers are willing to pay extra for that. The issue is complicated by the fact that motivations and barriers differ between segments of the population. particularly with age.

The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity. the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration. and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies. regression analysis of market data. and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA.

However. there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources).

To this end. a high temporal resolution is desirable but due to computational restrictions rarely feasible in long-term models that span several decades. Therefore many of these models only include a small number of representative ‘time slices’ that aggregate periods with similar load and renewable electricity generation levels. The deliberate selection of the time slices to consider in a model is vital. as an inadequate choice may significantly distort the model outcome.

1148417,The benefits of flexibility: The value of wind energy with hydropower,2016,Lion Hirth,181,Applied Energy,,210-223,Elsevier,Several studies have shown that the revenue of wind power generators on spot markets (“market value”) diminishes with increasing deployment. This “value drop” is mostly observed in power markets that are dominated by thermal power plants. such as in Germany. This paper assesses the wind market value in power systems where hydroelectric stations with large reservoirs prevail. such as in Sweden. Due to their dispatch flexibility. such hydropower compensates for wind power output variability and thereby mitigates the wind power value drop. The market value of electricity from wind declines with penetration in both types of power systems. but it tends to decline at a slower rate if hydropower is present.

Attaining this target poses a considerable challenge as the electricity sector is “locked” into a carbon-intensive system. which hampers the adoption of RES-E technologies. Electricity generation. transmission and distribution grids as well as storage and demand response are subject to important path dependences. which put existing. non-renewable energy sources at an advantage. This paper examines how an EU framework for RES-E support policies should be designed to facilitate a carbon lock-out. For this purpose. we specify the major technological. economic and institutional barriers to RES-E. For each of the barriers. a policy review is carried out which assesses the performance of existing policy instruments and identifies needs for reform. The review reveals several shortcomings: while policies targeting generation are widely in place. measures to address barriers associated with electricity grids. storage and demand are still in their infancy and have to be extended. Moreover. the implementation of policies has been fragmented across EU Member States. In this respect. national policies should be embedded into an integrated EU-wide planning of the RES-E system with overarching energy scenarios and partially harmonized policy rules.

Electricity prices vary dramatically between moments in time. between location. and according to lead-time between contract and delivery.

Different factors have been blamed. or praised. for having caused the price slump: the expansion of renewable energy; the near-collapse of the European emissions trading scheme; over-optimistic power plant investments; a decline in final electricity consumption; and cheap coal and natural gas. This ex-post study of European electricity markets from 2008 to 2015 uses a fundamental power market model to quantify their individual contributions on day-ahead prices. The two countries we study in detail. Germany and Sweden. differ significantly: fuel and CO2 prices were important price drivers in Germany. but in Sweden it was electricity demand. This difference is explained by the nature of the hydro-dominate Nordic electricity system.

Germany's dramatic expansion of wind and solar energy coincided with a reduction of short-term balancing reserves. This observation has been dubbed the “German Balancing Paradox”. This paper provides further and updated evidence: since 2011. wind and solar energy have nearly doubled while both reserve requirements and reserve use have declined by 50%. The paper quantitatively explores one reason for reduced balancing needs: increased and improved short-term wholesale electricity trading on the intraday market. Trading is now commonly done around the clock and based on quarter-hour. rather than full-hour. contracts. The shift to quarter-hourly products alone explains a decrease in balancing energy by 17%.

1148428,Market-Based Redispatch in Zonal Electricity Markets: The Preconditions for and Consequence of Inc-Dec Gaming,2020,Lion Hirth and Ingmar Schlecht,,,,,Kiel. Hamburg: ZBW–Leibniz Information Centre for Economics,In zonal electricity markets such as Europe’s. system operators rely on out-of-the-market measures to relieve network congestion within bidding zones. One such measure is “redispatching” power plants. i.e. increasing the output of a station downstream of the congestion while lowering production of an upstream plant. Traditionally. generators have often been legally obliged to participate in redispatch and were subsequently compensated for costs incurred. In recent years numerous proposals have been made to organize redispatch through voluntary markets. including one by the European Commission. In this paper. we introduce a simple graphical game-theoretical model of a locational redispatch market within a one-zone electricity market. We solve the model explicitly by determining optimal bidding strategies and the Nash equilibrium. We show that market parties anticipate the redispatch market and bid strategically in the zonal market – this is the so-called increase-decrease game. As a result. grid congestion is aggravated. producers extract windfall profits. financial markets are distorted. and perverse investment incentives emerge. Despite claims to the contrary. we show that such gaming is possible absent any market power. i.e. under perfect competition. At the root of the problem is an inconsistent setup of power markets: combining a zonal with a locational market yields undue arbitrage oppor-tunities that rational firms exploit. We conclude that such inconsistent market design should be avoided.,True,wZ8bLD8AAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC,28,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/222925,10610846088086995705,/scholar?cites=10610846088086995705,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/222925/1/Market-Based%20Redispatch%20in%20Zonal%20Electricity%20Markets.pdf,0,0,0

Dispatchable power plants with CO2 capture and storage (CCS) offer flexibility with low CO2 emissions. but these plants become uneconomical at the low running hours implied by renewables-based power systems. To address this challenge. the novel gas switching reforming (GSR) plant was recently proposed. GSR can alternate between electricity and hydrogen production from natural gas. offering flexibility to the power system without reducing the utilization rate of the capital stock embodied in CCS infrastructure. This study assesses the interplay between GSR and variable renewables using a power system model. which optimizes investment and hourly dispatch of 13 different technologies.

This system is designed to test only the performance of the expander. It is made up mainly of a scroll compressor. a scroll expander. a heat exchanger. and a by-pass valve. The latter is used to adjust the pressure ratio imposed to the expander. The expander was originally a compressor designed for heat pump applications and is characterized by a nominal power input of 2.5 kWe. Performance of the expander is evaluated in terms of isentropic effectiveness and filling factor as functions of the main operating conditions. The study also investigates the impact of oil mass fraction on the expander performance.

Many observers have predicted an uptake of combined PV/battery units which could ultimately disconnect from the grid and lead to autonomous homes or micro-grids. However. most of the comments in social media. blogs or press articles lack proper cost evaluation and realistic simulations. We aim to bridge this gap by simulating self-consumption in various EU countries. for various household profiles. with or without battery. Results indicate that (1) self-consumption is a non-linear. almost asymptotic function of PV and battery sizes. Achieving 100% self-consumption (i.e. allowing for full off-grid operation) is not realistic for the studied countries without excessively oversizing the PV system and/or the battery; (2) although falling fast …,True,WVDLdN4AAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,153,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916311643,5191895607624108763,/scholar?cites=5191895607624108763,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916311643,0,0,0

Although various aspects of LFGTE and WTE have been analyzed in the literature. this paper is the first to present a comprehensive set of life-cycle emission factors per unit of electricity generated for these energy recovery options. In addition. sensitivity analysis is conducted on key inputs (e.g.. efficiency of the WTE plant. landfill gas management schedules. oxidation rate. and waste composition) to quantify the variability in the resultant life-cycle emissions estimates.

Since the volatile character of wind and solar radiation leads to a fluctuating power production. these renewables are incapable of providing reliable base load power. To enable the transition to a renewable energy system. large-scale energy storage is required to compensate for short-term and seasonal imbalances and to save temporary excess power. Due to the order of magnitude involved. this can best be achieved by converting electricity into hydrogen via electrolysis. a process that is also called “power to gas”. Hereby. hydrogen can serve as a link combining the electricity. traffic and heating sector into one energy market.

For this reason. interest is increasing in the feasibility of deploying captured CO2 in this manner. Numerous scientific publications describe laboratory experiments in which CO2 has been successfully used as a feedstock for the synthesis of various chemical products. However. many of these publications have focused on the feasibility of syntheses without considering the ancillary benefits of CO2 emissions reduction if the CO2 is sourced from effluent or the potential profitability of this process.

Of all the sources of CO2 emissions. power plants burning fossil fuels. especially coals. account for a very large portion. For CO2 capture from existing coal-fired power plants. post-combustion technology is thus far considered the most viable method due to its “end-of-pipe” characteristic. Chemical absorption or scrubbing process is currently the technology most likely to be implemented in the near future but rather energy-intensive. Membrane-based CO2 separation process in recent years appears to be a competitive substitution for conventional chemical absorption technology.

Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure. with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However. supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue. we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus. we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility.

However. complete internal reforming may lead to several problems which can be avoided with partial pre-reforming of natural gas.

In the case of anode gas recycling an internal steam circuit exists. This has the advantage that there is no need for an external steam generator and the steam concentration in the anode gas is reduced.

A widely used method to measure the methanol permeation in a DMFC is the analysis of the carbon dioxide content of the cathode exhaust. During the operation of a DMFC large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced in the anodic catalyst layer which can diffuse partially to the cathode. As a consequence the carbon dioxide in the cathodic exhaust gas stream is expected to consist of two fractions: the carbon dioxide resulting from the oxidation of the permeating methanol and the carbon dioxide diffusing from the anode to the cathode.

Systems and Technology,2012,Detlef Stolten and Bernd Emonts,1,,,,John Wiley & Sons,Fuel cells are expected to play a major role in the future power supply that will transform to renewable. decentralized and fluctuating primary energies. At the same time the share of electric power will continually increase at the expense of thermal and mechanical energy not just in transportation. but also in households. Hydrogen as a perfect fuel for fuel cells and an outstanding and efficient means of bulk storage for renewable energy will spearhead this development together with fuel cells. Moreover. small fuel cells hold great potential for portable devices such as gadgets and medical applications such as pacemakers. This handbook will explore specific fuel cells within and beyond the mainstream development and focuses on materials and production processes for both SOFC and lowtemperature fuel cells. analytics and diagnostics for fuel cells. modeling and simulation as well as balance of plant design and components. As fuel cells are getting increasingly sophisticated and industrially developed the issues of quality assurance and methodology of development are included in this handbook. The contributions to this book come from an international panel of experts from academia. industry. institutions and government. This handbook is oriented toward people looking for detailed information on specific fuel cell types. their materials. production processes. modeling and analytics.

1148510,Linking the power and transport sectors—Part 1: The principle of sector coupling,2017,Martin Robinius and Alexander Otto and Philipp Heuser and Lara Welder and Konstantinos Syranidis and David S Ryberg and Thomas Grube and Peter Markewitz and Ralf Peters and Detlef Stolten,10,,7,956,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The usage of renewable energy sources (RESs) to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction goals requires a holistic transformation across all sectors. Due to the fluctuating nature of RESs. it is necessary to install more wind and photovoltaics (PVs) generation in terms of nominal power than would otherwise be required in order to ensure that the power demand can always be met. In a near fully RES-based energy system. there will be times when there is an inadequate conventional load to meet the overcapacity of RESs. which will lead to demand regularly being exceeded and thereby a surplus. One approach to making productive use of this surplus. which would lead to a holistic transformation of all sectors. is “sector coupling”(SC). This paper describes the general principles behind this concept and develops a working definition intended to be of utility to the international scientific community. Furthermore. a literature review provides an overview of relevant scientific papers on the topic. Due to the challenge of distinguishing between papers with or without SC. the approach adopted here takes the German context as a case study that can be applied to future reviews with an international focus. Finally. to evaluate the potential of SC. an analysis of the linking of the power and transport sectors on a worldwide. EU and German level has been conducted and is outlined here.

1148530,The analytic hierarchy process with stochastic judgements,2014,Ian Durbach and Risto Lahdelma and Pekka Salminen,238,European Journal of Operational Research,2,552-559,North-Holland,The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a widely-used method for multicriteria decision support based on the hierarchical decomposition of objectives. evaluation of preferences through pairwise comparisons. and a subsequent aggregation into global evaluations. The current paper integrates the AHP with stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA). an inverse-preference method. to allow the pairwise comparisons to be uncertain. A simulation experiment is used to assess how the consistency of judgements and the ability of the SMAA-AHP model to discern the best alternative deteriorates as uncertainty increases. Across a range of simulated problems results indicate that. according to conventional benchmarks. judgements are likely to remain consistent unless uncertainty is severe. but that the presence of uncertainty in almost any degree is sufficient to make the choice of best alternative unclear.,True,S6uTYjQAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,91,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221714002847,2344090834563641758,/scholar?cites=2344090834563641758,,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/20846/smaa_ahp27.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Ltd.,We describe an application of multicriteria decision aid to the location of a waste treatment facility in eastern Finland. In Finland. the Act on Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure requires that when the amount of waste to be dealt with in a facility exceeds 20.000 tons per year. the process of environmental impact assessment (EIA) must be performed. In addition. the opinions of citizens and different interest groups need to be heard. Generally. EIA requires many different factors to be dealt with. Therefore the use of some multicriteria decision aid may be helpful to preserve the information obtained through the EIA in the decision‐making process.

When the uncertainty is accounted for. it is typically assumed to be independently distributed for the criteria measurements of different alternatives. In forest management planning. the factors introducing the uncertainty can be classified into three main sources: the errors in the basic forestry data. the uncertainty of the (relative) future prices of timber. and the uncertainty in predicting the forest development. Due to the nature of these error sources. most of the involved uncertainties can be assumed to be positively correlated across the alternative management plans and/or criteria. This. in turn. may lead to overestimating the risks due to the uncertainty.

In CHP production. the heat and power production follows a joint characteristic. which means that the production planning must be done in coordination. Cost-efficient operation of a CHP system can be planned by using an optimization model. A long-term planning model decomposes into thousands of hourly models. Earlier. in the regulated electric power market. the planning problem was symmetrically driven by heat and power demand. The liberalization of the power market has created an asymmetrical planning problem. where heat production responds to the demand and power production to the volatile market price.

Cost-efficient operation of a CHP system can be planned using an optimisation model based on hourly load forecasts. A long-term planning model decomposes into hourly models. which can be formulated as linear programming (LP) problems. Such problems can be solved efficiently using the specialized Power Simplex algorithm. However. Power Simplex can only manage one heat and one power balance. Since heat cannot be transported over long distances. Power Simplex applies only for local CHP planning.In this paper we formulate the hourly multi-site CHP planning problem with multiple heat balances as an LP model with a special structure.

We introduce in this paper the DP-RSC1 algorithm. which is a variant of the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm based on linear relaxation of the ON/OFF states of the units and sequential commitment of units one by one. The time complexity of DP-RSC1 is proportional to the number of generating units in the system. the number of periods over the planning horizon and the time for solving a single-period economic dispatch problem.

In the CHP plant. the generation of heat-and-power follows a joint characteristic. which makes the determination of both the marginal power production cost (MPPC) and the feasible operating region for the plant more complicated than for the power-only generation plant.

A slab yard serves as a buffer between the continuous casting stage and the steel rolling stage. Steel slabs are stored in stacks in the yard. Shuffling is needed when picking up a slab for heating and rolling. if it is not in the top position of a stack.

The DKP is more challenging than the KP because four choices of items in an item group diversify the selection of the items. Consequently. it is not possible to solve the DKP based on a classical definition of a core consisting of a small number of relevant variables. This paper partitions the DKP into several easier sub-problems to achieve problem reductions by imitating the core concept of the KP to derive an alternative core for the DKP.

Unfortunately. finding the relevant clinical trials is difficult and their results are only available in text-based reports. Systematic reviews aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence in a specific area. but may not provide the data required for decision making. We review and analyze the existing information systems and standards for aggregate level clinical trials information from the perspective of systematic review and evidence-based decision making. The technology currently used has major shortcomings. which cause deficiencies in the transfer. traceability and availability of clinical trials information. Specifically. data available to decision makers is insufficiently structured. and consequently the decisions cannot be properly traced back to the underlying evidence. Regulatory submission. trial publication. trial registration. and systematic review produce unstructured datasets that are insufficient for supporting evidence-based decision making.

One of the most important parameters of ELECTRE III is the preference information of the decision maker expressed as weights for criteria. The difficulty of eliciting weights from the decision makers is well-known. and several methods for weight elicitation have been proposed in literature in the past. In this paper. we introduce an inverse weight-space analysis for the ELECTRE III. The analysis is based on a modified version of the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). We also derive robust conclusions of an existing ELECTRE III application by applying the inverse approach. In this application 11 actions are evaluated in terms of 11 criteria. and the analysis aims at ranking the actions and selecting the first one. Our re-analysis illustrates the usefulness of the presented method: the recommendation of the original case study seems to be not a “robust” one. The inverse analysis shows that by allowing 10% weight alterations. the action selected in the original case study obtains the first rank with only 26% of the feasible weights. and almost in all the remaining cases the first rank was shared with another action.,True,nG3EA6gAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,24,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Risto_Lahdelma/publication/31597676_An_Inverse_Approach_for_ELECTRE_III/links/00b7d52aae4316ad79000000.pdf,12172996962689023578,/scholar?cites=12172996962689023578,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Risto_Lahdelma/publication/31597676_An_Inverse_Approach_for_ELECTRE_III/links/00b7d52aae4316ad79000000.pdf,0,0,0

As a sorting method. a set of categories must be defined to represent the way in which the actions that are going to be assigned to each of them should further be processed. This method is appropriate to deal with decision aiding contexts where the categories are completely ordered and each of them is defined through a single characteristic reference action. The set of characteristic actions should be co-constructed through an interactive process between the analyst and the decision maker.

If a new constraint is incompatible with the previous ones. then the system becomes inconsistent and the DMs must choose between removing the new constraint or removing some of the older ones. We address the problem of identifying subsets of constraints which. when removed. lead to a consistent system.

Multiple criteria models seem a more adequate representation of districting problems in real-world situations. Real-life decision situations are by their very nature multidimensional.

A district map is formed by partitioning the set of elementary units into connected zones without inclusions. When multiple criteria are considered. the problem of enumerating all the efficient solutions for such a model is known as being NP-hard. which is why we decided to avoid using exact methods to solve large-size instances.

The hierarchy helps to decompose complex decision problems into smaller and manageable subtasks. and thus. it is very attractive for computational efficiency and explanatory purposes. To handle the hierarchy of criteria in MCDA. a methodology called Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP). has been recently proposed. MCHP permits to consider preference relations with respect to a subset of criteria at any level of the hierarchy. Here. we propose to apply MCHP to the ELECTRE III ranking method adapted to handle three types of interaction effects between criteria: mutual-weakening. mutual-strengthening and antagonistic effect.

In the particular case of social networks. the flow represents the way in which information passes through the network nodes. Freeman et al. (1991) were the first authors to relate centrality measures to network flow optimization problems in terms of betweenness. closeness. and the influence of one node over another one. Such measures are single dimensional and. in general. they amalgamate several heterogeneous dimensions into a single one. which is not suitable for dealing with most real-world problems. In this paper we extend the betweenness centrality measure (or concept) to take into account explicitly several dimensions (criteria). A new closeness centrality measure is defined to deal not only with the maximum flow between every ordered pair of nodes. but also with the cost associated with communications.

Ltd.,Irregularities in power output are characteristic of intermittent energy. sources such as wind energy. affecting both the power quality and planning of the energy system. In this work the effects of energy storage to reduce wind power fluctuations are investigated. Integration of the energy storage with wind power is modelled using a filter approach in which a time constant corresponds to the energy storage capacity. The analyses show that already a relatively small energy storage capacity of 3 kWh (storage) per MW wind would reduce the short‐term power fluctuations of an individual wind turbine by 10%. Smoothing out the power fluctuation of the wind turbine on a yearly level would necessitate large storage. e.g. a 10% reduction requires 2–3 MWh per MW wind. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons.

The effects of the integration were mainly evaluated by steady-state power flow analysis. Compensation of unwanted overvoltage events was tested with the use of energy storage. utilization of grid topology. and redirecting of photovoltaic panels. In addition. this work examines the use of energy storage to compensate short and long term fluctuations in the power output of variable distributed generation. For this purpose three different storage control strategies were applied.   For simulation purposes a detailed bottom-up consumer load model and a distribution grid power flow simulation model were developed. The stochastic approach in the load model is based on the classic bottom-up load model by Capasso et al. However. the emulation of the activities of individual people has been replaced by statistical use of household appliances where reference data is more readily available. The grid simulation model is based on established power flow computation methods. The model is especially designed for easy implementation of grid details as well as various types of distributed generation and storage and their control strategies.

1148635,Seasonal Heat Storages and residential micro-cogeneration,2008,Kari Alanne and Jukka Paatero,,"Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Micro-Generation and Application, Ottawa Canada",,,,The overall efficiency of micro-cogeneration may be as high as 85%. which makes it an attractive method of supplying energy for residential buildings. As the largest thermal surplus is commonly available during the warm season when the heating demand is at its minimum. long-term thermal storage may improve the overall energy efficiency of the system. This paper presents a review of seasonal heat storage technologies and evaluates their applicability to residential micro-cogeneration in terms of technical aspects such as physical location and spatial requirements. Moreover. the optimal sizing of seasonal heat storage located in cold climates is defined through computational study. The results imply that a semi-spherical shape would be optimal for the seasonal heat storage and that significant fuel savings could be achieved by employing seasonal storage in terms of residential micro-cogeneration. In the case study used in this research. the breakeven price of 2483€ is achieved for the storage.,True,LrKxUwEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,5,http://paatero.arkku.net/pub/conf_2008_ICMGA_Ottawa.pdf,2987525022811266393,/scholar?cites=2987525022811266393,,http://paatero.arkku.net/pub/conf_2008_ICMGA_Ottawa.pdf,0,0,0

Electric power generation in Malaysia significantly depends on three major fossil fuel sources. namely coal. natural gas and fuel-oil. These fossil fuel based power generation causes negative environmental consequences and depletion of fuel reserves. Malaysia has set to achieve the status of a developed country by2020 through achieving sustainable development. To this end. Malaysia is on a need for sustainable energy. which is the main pillar of sustainable development. The major tools to achieve sustainable energy are renewable energy and energy efficiency. Fortunately. Malaysia is endowed with huge renewable energy resources. particularly biomass. solar. small hydro and ocean. This country has also initiated several energy policies for supporting renewable resources and energy efficiency. Nevertheless. studies show that current patterns of power generation in Malaysia shall not be sustained in the future owing to environmental impacts and depletion of fossil fuel reserves. In this work. we will review power generation sources in Malaysia to foresee the anticipatable challenges and put forward the enabling resources the country can utilize to counteract the challenges.

Burning of these fossil fuels emits greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. The usage of fossil fuels for power generation also severely affects the fossil fuel reserves. In the current consumption trends. the reserve for natural gas is projected to be completely diminished by 41 years whereby crude oil by 29 years. As Malaysia is set to be a high-income nation by 2020. electricity demand would also increase furthermore. In this perspective. Malaysia is looking for alternative fuels for electricity generation to deal with the challenges and leading to a sustainable power generation sector. Malaysia is endowed with a huge amount of renewable energy resources and these could be the potential alternative for power generation. Application of renewable resources also results in several technical. financial and policy implications. Scenario building can assist policy makers to understand their implications and enable them to enact relevant measures.

1148655,Dietary energy intake. energy expenditure and activity pattern among selected rural and urban poor in Bangladesh.,1995,M Abdullah and L Ahmed and MM Rahman,21,Bangladesh Medical Research Council Bulletin,1,1-10,,Rural-urban and seasonal differences in energy balance were studied among selected free living subjects. chosen from the poor population groups in Bangladesh. Individual dietary energy intakes were estimated by a combination of 24 hours recall and weighing method. Time allocation to various occupational and non-occupational activities were recorded by observation and questioning. and energy expenditures were calculated by using FAO/WHO/UNU guidelines. The male working adults in both the population groups studied were found to be in negative energy balance in both the seasons observed. In Jan-Feb when employment opportunities for the rural poor were few all age and sex groups were in negative energy balance. and when employment opportunities improved during May-June the situation reversed except for the male working adults. In urban areas. on the other hand. all age and sex groups. except the male working adults were in positive energy balance in both the seasons. Rural children under 10 years. had significantly higher energy expenditure (P< 0.023) than their urban counterparts. Seasonal difference in energy expenditure among the rural male adults is quite high. In the urban group there was no such seasonal difference. Apparently very high rural-urban difference in energy expenditure of the male adults (18-30 y) in season 1 may be attributed to very high energy demanding activities in which the observed subjects in rural areas were engaged during this season.

The influence of applying flat. oval and circular tube adjustments on the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of air flow were analyzed on the in-line tube arrangements. Establishing standard conditions. the study compared different geometries based on circular tubes of 10.459 mm diameter tubes with 25.4 mm longitudinal pitches and 25.4 mm transverse pitches. The other geometries of tubes were assumed in a stable and constant state preparing the same heat transfer surface area per unit volume as that of the nominal case. The results showed that the FTCHE with flat tubes gives the best area goodness factor (j/f) with in a certainrange of Reynoldsnumbers. In addition. FTCHE with flat tubes shown the best thermo-hydraulic performance and a significant augmentation of up to 10.83% and 35.63% in the average area goodness factor achieved accompanied by a decrease in the average friction factor of 17.02% and 43.41% in the flat tube case compared to the oval and circle tube shapes. respectively. It is concluded that the average area goodness factorfor the oval tube is about 25.04% higher than that of the circular tube. while the average friction factor for the oval tube is about 26.9% lower than that of the circular tube.

1148658,Energy Co-Generation in Photovoltaic Thermal- Collector (PVT) System: A Significant Increase in Efficiency,2016,Md. Mizanur Rahman,21,Journal of Advanced Research in Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Sciences,1,13-20,AKADEMIA BARU,The main obstacle of using the earth’s enormous solar energy potential is its low conversion efficiency. The conversion efficiency from solar irradiation to electricity by the photovoltaic (PV) cell is around 5–20%. The remaining energy that falls on the PV surface becomes waste and increases the PV surface temperature. In this experimental work. we have modified a solar Photovoltaic (PV) system into a Photovoltaic-thermal collector (PVT) co-generation system and examined the effects on its performance. A coolant (water) has been circulated underneath the PV surface to extract heat and keep the PV surface temperature low. In the modified system. a glass cover was also placed on the top of the PVT to minimize the heat loss. This study found that electrical efficiency of the PV decreases linearly with surface temperature. In the modified PVT. when heat is extracted from the PV surface. the total efficiency increased to a significant level (ie 82%). The top loss of the PVT system was minimised effectively by putting a transparent glass cover on the PVT top. Although the top cover glass of PVT costs about 1% of electrical efficiency due to the glass’s transmission factor. it significantly increases thermal efficiency ie from 48% to 75%. The overall efficiency (electrical and thermal) of the cogeneration system is much higher than the standalone PV or solar collector system.,True,WiRZ9MEAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC,6,http://www.akademiabaru.com/submit/index.php/arfmts/article/view/2070,9711148455437664995,/scholar?cites=9711148455437664995,,http://www.akademiabaru.com/submit/index.php/arfmts/article/download/2070/1044,0,0,0

Mizanur Rahman and Aminuddin Saat and Mazlan Abdul Wahid,2016,,March 8-10,,IEEE XPLORE,Energy-sectors in both developed and developing countries face three major challenges namely emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). depletion of fossil fuel reserves. and increasing demands. Despite renewable energy retains many advantages over fossil-based energy. its wider dissemination is still restricted in many countries owing to techno-economic. societal and policy barriers. Renewable energy policy is meant to promote renewable energy by overcoming these barriers. Globally more than 140 countries had laid policy measures to promote the development of renewable energy. however. very few countries are successful. Germany is one of the successful countries in the world in developing renewable energy in terms of per capita installation and cumulative capacity expansion. Malaysia. on the other hand. undertook several initiatives in order to increase renewable energy uses to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and to contribute global effort to minimize GHG emissions but is not yet as successful as it desires. This paper examines renewable energy policy of both these countries. and identifies the key success factors in German case.

Suspension system in an automobile provides vehicle control and passenger comfort by providing isolation from road disturbances. This makes it essential that the detailed behavior of suspension should be known to optimize the performance. A kinetic study is performed using multi body system (MBS) analysis. The dirt road profile is considered as an applied loading. The spring constant. damping coefficient and sprung mass are studied on the performance of the suspension system. It can be observed that the spring constant is inversely related with time required to return to initial position and the amount of deformations. The damping ratio affects the suppression of spring oscillations. beyond a certain limit damping ration has the negligible effect.

Due to the growing environmental degradation and fossil fuel depletion issues. energy supply from alternative sources is gaining huge attention. Solar driven refrigeration system. which uses solar energy as its energy input. not only addresses these challenges and but also enhances sustainable development. In this work. we have developed a small scale solar driven refrigeration system by combining several components such as a solar panel. a charge controller. a compressor. an inverter. an evaporator-tank. a condenser and a few connection wiring. We have operated the system for several days to check its functionality and performance. During operation. we have measured solar panel’s current and voltage with a 5-minute interval to calculate power that has been supplied as an input to the compressor. The evaporator coils pass through the water tank to cool down water to a desired temperature (ie 4 ºC). The temperature of the evaporator and condenser was also recorded for calculating the cooling effect created by the refrigerant R-134a. We have calculated coefficient of performance (COP) of the system for both actual cooling load of water and cooling effect created by the refrigerant. The refrigeration system successfully operates with an actual COP of 0.95. Despite the COP is low. the solar driven refrigeration system. which does not require any fuel. is a promising option in regard to both environment and economic aspects.,True,WiRZ9MEAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC,5,http://www.akademiabaru.com/submit/index.php/arfmts/article/view/2103,5285529131628092459,/scholar?cites=5285529131628092459,,http://www.akademiabaru.com/submit/index.php/arfmts/article/download/2103/1079,0,0,0

Renewable energy sources are abundant in Malaysia. especially palm biomass residues that are produced during the oil extraction process of fresh fruit bunch. Therefore. it is inevitable to harness these bioenergy sources. in order to prevent waste accumulation at adjacent to palm mills. Briquetting of palm biomass such as empty fruit bunch (EFB) with polyethylene (PE) plastics waste addition is expected not only could maximize the utilization of energy resources. but also could become as a potential solution for residue and municipal plastics waste disposal. In the present study. the physical and combustion properties of palm biomass briquettes that contain novel mixture of pulverized EFB and PE plastics waste were investigated experimentally. The briquettes were produced with different mixing ratio of EFB and PE plastics (weight ratios of 95: 5. 90: 10 and 85: 15). under various heating temperatures (130-190) and at constant compaction pressure of 7 MPa. Based on the results. it can be said that heating temperature plays a significant role in affecting physical properties such as relaxed density and compressive strength. The values of relaxed density and compressive strength are within the range of 1100 to 1300 kg/m3 and 0.8 to 1.2 MPa. respectively. Meanwhile. mixing ratio does affect relaxed density and gross calorific value.

To achieve an optimally functioning building that fulfils the need of the end-user and is designed in an environmentally conscious manner necessitates considering energy performance. environmental performance. indoor air quality. lighting. and acoustics. To consider these multiple criteria. use of computer-based modelling tools and comprehensive simulation methods becomes essential. These criteria are typically assessed after the main phases of architectural design of the building. and the knowledge is passed on to the engineers for development of the technical design. During the technical design process. the exchange of data between the design model and a selected building performance aspect may occur. This paper investigates the potential of BIM-based models at the core of providing input data required for performance-based simulations (BPS) to enable iterative multi-criteria assessment towards high performance buildings. A comprehensive literature review of 249 documents was conducted to identify the current state of knowledge and provide future directions for design and simulation tools to better quantify and evaluate the performance aspects.

The European Union’s climate and energy policy framework for 2020 and 2030 requires reducing GHG emissions by 40%. increasing the level of energy savings by 25%. and increasing the share of renewable energy by at least 30% relative to 1990.  The environmental and energy performance criteria for buildings will continually evolve to meet the aforementioned decarbonisation goals. Consequently. buildings will have an increased number of variables and alternatives that are to be evaluated for their performance. indicating increased complexity for building designers. The prospect of evaluating multiple building performance criteria necessitates integrated designing and planning tools. such as the use of Building Information Model (BIM). Building Performance Simulations (BPS). and methodologies for comparing and optimizing alternative design options.  This dissertation presents new insights on advancing the design criteria for the energy and environmental performance of commercial and residential buildings. Specially. the four associated journal publications demonstrate how building designers and the Architecture. Engineering. and Construction (AEC) industry can integrate embodied GHG analysis. comprehensive BIM tools in conjunction with BPS analyses. and stochastic assessment of public perceptions to work towards buildings that are more energy-efficient. generate energy on-site. and have a smaller carbon footprint.

Because the analytic hierarchy process (AHP. developed by Thomas Saaty in the 1970s) has been successfully applied to many complex planning. resource allocation. and priority setting problems in business. energy. health. marketing. natural resources. and transportation. more applications of the AHP in natural resources and environmental sciences are appearing regularly. This realization has prompted the authors to collect some of the important works in this area and present them as a single volume for managers and scholars. Because land management contains a somewhat unique set of features not found in other AHP application areas. such as site-specific decisions. group participation and collaboration. and incomplete scientific knowledge. this text fills a void in the literature on management science and decision analysis for forest resources.,True,YjwqDQoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,285,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=bM7tCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:poKavipHeKUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=q-hRfLROZu&sig=Bhax9CFqKOwOcUNv2kJwlLuJIGI,11923358262375383718,/scholar?cites=11923358262375383718,,,0,0,0

ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE II. commonly used as decision-aid in various environmental problems. and their applications to decision support for natural resources management are presented. These methods represent ‘the European school’of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). as opposed to ‘the American school’. represented by. for instance. the AHP method. On the basis of a case study. outranking methods are compared to so far more usually applied techniques based on the ideas of multi attribute utility theory (MAUT). The outranking methods have been recommended for situations. where there is a finite number of discrete alternatives to be chosen among. The number of decision criteria and decision makers may be large. An important advantage of outranking methods. when compared to decision support techniques most often applied in today’s natural resources management. is the ability to deal with ordinal and more or less descriptive information on the alternative plans to be evaluated. Furthermore. the uncertainty concerning the values of the criterion variables can be taken into account using fuzzy relations. determined by indifference and preference thresholds. The difficult interpretation of the results. on the other hand. is the main drawback of the outranking methods.,True,YjwqDQoAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,222,https://jukuri.luke.fi/handle/10024/532531,18384430494809008045,/scholar?cites=18384430494809008045,,https://jukuri.luke.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/532531/outranking.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Applications of MCDS methods of varying characteristics can be found in the management planning of multiple-purpose forestry. However. the tool to be used should be chosen to fit the planning process at hand. When choosing a method. compromises must often be made. For instance. simple and easily understandable methods may mean loss of attainable information and. correspondingly. deficient analyses.

1148716,Forest inventory: methodology and applications,2006,Annika Kangas and Matti Maltamo,10,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,This book has been developed as a forest inventory textbook for students and could also serve as a handbook for practical foresters. We have set out to keep the mathematics in the book at a fairly non-technical level. and therefore. although we deal with many issues that include highly sophisticated methodology. we try to present first and foremost the ideas behind them. For foresters who need more details. references are given to more advanced scientific papers and books in the fields of statistics and biometrics. Forest inventory books deal mostly with sampling and measurement issues. as found here in section I. but since forest inventories in many countries involve much more than this. we have also included material on forestry applications. Most applications nowadays involve remote sensing technology of some sort. so that section II deals mostly with the use of remote sensing material for this purpose. Section III deals with national inventories carried out in different parts of world. and section IV is an attempt to outline some future possibilities of forest inventory methodologies. The editors.

ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE II. commonly used as decision-aid in various environmental problems. and their applications to decision support for natural resources management are presented. These methods represent ‘the European school’of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). as opposed to ‘the American school’. represented by. for instance. the AHP method. On the basis of a case study. outranking methods are compared to so far more usually applied techniques based on the ideas of multi attribute utility theory (MAUT). The outranking methods have been recommended for situations. where there is a finite number of discrete alternatives to be chosen among. The number of decision criteria and decision makers may be large. An important advantage of outranking methods. when compared to decision support techniques most often applied in today’s natural resources management. is the ability to deal with ordinal and more or less descriptive information on the alternative plans to be evaluated. Furthermore. the uncertainty concerning the values of the criterion variables can be taken into account using fuzzy relations. determined by indifference and preference thresholds.

This being the case. the independent variables of a growth model will contain error due to prediction errors in the preceding periods. which cumulate through the simulation process. Thus. the accuracy of growth predictions depends on the number of growth periods. In this paper. the effect of cumulating errors is considered by conducting a simulation study using models estimated from thinning experiments carried out in Finland.

There are several methods for predicting the diameter distribution of a stand. varying from methods which utilize theoretical distribution functions to nonparametric methods. Usually the predicted diameter distribution is scaled so that the stem number corresponds to the measured value. However. if stem number and basal area are both known. it may be difficult to predict a distribution that gives correct estimates for both these characteristics.

When the uncertainty is accounted for. it is typically assumed to be independently distributed for the criteria measurements of different alternatives. In forest management planning. the factors introducing the uncertainty can be classified into three main sources: the errors in the basic forestry data. the uncertainty of the (relative) future prices of timber. and the uncertainty in predicting the forest development. Due to the nature of these error sources. most of the involved uncertainties can be assumed to be positively correlated across the alternative management plans and/or criteria. This. in turn. may lead to overestimating the risks due to the uncertainty.

The stands are typically visually delineated based on aerial photographs. Because of visual interpretation. the estimation of stand boundaries is always subjective. Moreover. there are no definite criteria for the delineation. For one forest area. several different solutions could be obtained.

After approval by central authorities such as the FDA or EMA. a new drug still needs to receive market authorization. which is in most cases granted by some local authorities – in Europe. for example. by more than 30 national and regional bodies.

While the business case for expensive items to be RFID tagged may be somewhat clear. we claim that even ‘cheap’ items (i.e.. those that cost less than an RFID tag) should be RFID tagged for retailers to benefit from efficiencies associated with item-level visibility. We study the relative price premiums a retailer with RFID tagged items can command as well as the retailer’s profit to illustrate the significance of item-level RFID-tagging both cheap and expensive items at a retail store. Our results indicate that. under certain conditions. item-level RFID tagging of items that cost less than an RFID tag has the potential to generate significant benefits to the retailer.

In spite of this development. this competence is still underdeveloped in industry. Research has not been able to fill this industrial capability gap partly because there is a lack of convergence of the methodologies for concurrent product and supply chain design in the research community. Moreover. a dominant and practical methodology in concurrent product and supply chain design in the industries has not yet emerged.

The outsourcers have different levels of demand uncertainty and the contract manufacturer faces the question how to allocate the contractual capacity flexibility in an optimal way. The contractual capacity flexibility is a contract parameter that sets the amount of demand the contract manufacturer is obliged to accept from the outsourcers. We develop a hierarchical model that consists of two decision levels. At the tactical level. the contract manufacturer allocates the capacity flexibility to the different outsourcers by maximizing the expected profit. Offering more flexibility to the more uncertain outsourcer generates higher expected revenue. but also increases the expected penalty costs.

The salient features of this method includes nondiscretization of generation levels. a systematic method to handle ramp rate constraints. and a good initialization procedure. By using Lagrange multipliers to relax system-wide demand and reserve requirements and ramp rate constraints. the problem is decomposed into the scheduling of individual units.

1148780,Nonlinear approximation method in Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithms for hydrothermal scheduling,1995,Xiaohong Guan and Peter B Luh and Lan Zhang,10,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,2,772-778,IEEE,When the Lagrangian relaxation technique is used to solve hydrothermal scheduling problems. many subproblems have linear stage-wise cost functions. A well recognized difficulty is that the solutions to these subproblems may oscillate between maximum and minimum generations with slight changes of the multipliers. Furthermore. the subproblem solutions may become singular. i.e.. they are undetermined when the linear coefficients become zero. This may result in large differences between subproblem solutions and the optimal primal schedule.

The algorithm is developed for solving a class of constrained dynamic optimization problems. It relaxes all constraints but the system dynamics by the multiplier method and adopts the DDP solution technique to solve the resultant unconstrained dynamic optimization problem. The authors formulate the HSP of the Taiwan power system and apply the algorithm to it. Results demonstrate the efficiency and optimality of the algorithm for this application. Computational results indicate that the growth of the algorithm's run time with respect to the problem size is moderate. CPU times of the testing cases are well within the Taiwan Power Company's desirable performance; less than 30 minutes on a VAX/780 mini-computer for a one-week scheduling.< >,True,epk7guIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,198,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/65900/,8885896143631978996,/scholar?cites=8885896143631978996,,http://recipe.ee.ntu.edu.tw/C&D/Frame/paper/CCF90.pdf,0,0,0
1148782,A control-theoretic view on incentives,1982,Yu-Chi Ho and Peter B Luh and Geert Jan Olsder,18,Automatica,2,167-179,Pergamon,The idea of declaring a reward (punishment) for a decision maker according to his particular choice of action in order to induce certain ‘desired’ behavior on the part of the decision maker is known as incentive (threat). This practice is age old. However. only in recent years have the notions been formalized. In the development of a control-theoretic view on incentives. we first investigate the deterministic version of the incentive problem. This reveals the basic simple idea behind the problem. It also illustrates the different possibilities introduced by the presence of dynamics and multi-follower nature of the problem. This is followed by two variants of the stochastic version of the problem where we concentrate on the role of uncertainties. Relationship to economic literature is also discussed.,True,epk7guIAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,197,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005109882901066,11834375736661308215,/scholar?cites=11834375736661308215,,,0,0,0

In the approach. operation precedence constraints rather than machine capacity constraints are relaxed. The relaxed problem is decomposed into single or parallel machine scheduling subproblems. These subproblems. which are NP-complete in general. are approximately solved by using fast heuristic algorithms. The dual problem is solved by using a recently developed “surrogate subgradient method” that allows approximate optimization of the subproblems. Since the algorithms for subproblems do not depend on the time horizon of the scheduling problems and are very fast. our new LR approach is efficient. particularly for large problems with long time horizons.

Goal programming as a methodology emphasises the resolution of conflict among criteria; scenario planning focuses on the treatment of uncertainty relating to future states of the world. Integrating the two methodologies is based on the simple formulation of a super‐goal programme consisting of one scenario‐specific goal program in each scenario.

Simulation results show that a suitably detailed construction of the acceptability index is particularly important. and that the resulting model can be fruitfully applied in the selection of a shortlist of alternatives from a larger set with only very limited decision maker involvement.,True,xwALMPgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,38,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221704005296,3642382005032775257,/scholar?cites=3642382005032775257,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46829271/j.ejor.2004.06.03120160627-32573-16ser9h.pdf,0,0,0
1148826,On the estimation of a satisficing model of choice using stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis,2009,Ian Durbach,37,Omega,3,497-509,Pergamon,This paper addresses the task of estimating the kind of aspirations that are most likely to have given rise to an observed partial rank ordering of alternatives. The proposed approach uses a Tchebycheff goal programming formulation to serve as a descriptive model of choice and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis to generate candidate aspiration vectors and estimate the true aspiration vector from this candidate set. A simulation experiment is used to assess the accuracy of the estimated aspiration levels in a variety of problem contexts. The approach can perform well if strong performance is demanded on a small subset of the attributes and the rank order that is observed is sufficiently detailed.,True,xwALMPgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048307000990,7917473131891184421,/scholar?cites=7917473131891184421,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46829258/On_the_estimation_of_a_satisficing_model20160627-24012-1m77sch.pdf,0,0,0
1148827,Outranking under uncertainty using scenarios,2014,Ian N Durbach,232,European Journal of Operational Research,1,98-108,North-Holland,This paper considers the use of scenarios to treat uncertain attribute evaluations in the outranking methods. The scenario-based approach allows the decision maker to think deterministically about the problem by attaching causal links to a small number of potential outcomes. instead of using probability distributions. The scenario approach can be expressed as a simplified version of the comprehensive but practically complex “distributive” outranking method of d’Avignon and Vincke. Using a scenario approach has distinct practical advantages. but also presents the inherent danger that meaningful information is ignored. The extent of this danger is assessed using a simulation experiment. where it is found to be of a magnitude that is non-trivial but still potentially acceptable for certain decision contexts.,True,xwALMPgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,30,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221713005481,8034954276820935605,/scholar?cites=8034954276820935605,,,0,0,0
1148828,The use of the SMAA acceptability index in descriptive decision analysis,2009,Ian N Durbach,196,European Journal of Operational Research,3,1229-1237,North-Holland,This paper proposes and evaluates a descriptive multiattribute choice model based upon the notion of acceptability developed in the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) methods. The acceptability index is simply the relative proportion of all possible preference structures that support the selection of a particular alternative. and is related to a model of choice in which attribute evaluations are relatively stable but what is desired changes as if at random. The model is tested using two longitudinal surveys of FMCG markets in Europe. The acceptability index is found to be positively associated with relative purchase frequencies at the individual and aggregate level. inversely related to defection rates. and positively related to changes in relative purchase frequencies over a six-month period.,True,xwALMPgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221708004189,4362962746596063084,/scholar?cites=4362962746596063084,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.321.4737&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We consider two projections of this network : a director network. in which only directors are present and two directors are linked if they sit together on one or more common boards; and a firm network. in which only firms are present and an edge indicates that the two firms share one or more directors.

Awareness of the danger is growing and with the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. also evidence has grown once more that fossil fuels such as coal have to be left in the ground in order to minimize those threats. The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) since 11 years now. keeps on working to bring awareness forward. Since 2005. the CCPI has been contributing to a clearer understanding of national and international climate policy. The various initial positions. interests. and strategies of the numerous countries make it hard to distinguish their strengths and weaknesses. The CCPI is an important tool to address this.,True,LIjl9q0AAAAJ:uQVPmWFBlwUC,267,https://www.altinget.dk/misc/edef13_The_Climate_Change_Performance_Index.pdf,11933943553126750156,/scholar?cites=11933943553126750156,,https://www.altinget.dk/misc/edef13_The_Climate_Change_Performance_Index.pdf,0,0,0

Working Group III. summarises in Box 13.7 the required emission reduction ranges in Annex I and non-Annex I countries as a group. to achieve greenhouse gas concentration stabilisation levels between 450 and 650 ppm CO2-eq. The box summarises the results of the IPCC authors’ analysis of the literature on the regional allocation of the emission reductions. The box states that Annex I countries as a group would need to reduce their emissions to below 1990 levels in 2020 by 25% to 40% for 450 ppm. 10% to 30% for 550 ppm and 0% to 25% for 650 ppm CO2-eq. even if emissions in developing countries deviate substantially from baseline for the low concentration target.

Under CDC. Annex-I countries' per-capita emission allowances converge within a convergence period to a low level. Individual non-Annex-I countries' allowances converge to the same level also within the same period (‘common convergence’). but starting when their per-capita emissions are a certain percentage above global average (‘differentiated’). Until then they may voluntarily take on ‘positively binding’ targets. This approach eliminates two concerns often voiced in relation to gradually converging per-capita emissions: (i) advanced developing countries have their commitment to reduce emissions delayed and their targets are not the same as Annex-I countries with equal per-capita emissions; (ii) CDC does not provide excess …,True,LIjl9q0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,151,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2006.9685594,8430345812735253470,/scholar?cites=8430345812735253470,,,0,0,0

A natural question in this context is what will be the ‘transformation pathway’towards stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there? The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways. including the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key characteristics of different transformation pathways. including the rates of emissions reductions and deployment of low-carbon energy. the magnitude and timing of aggregate economic costs. and the implications for other policy objectives such as those generally associated with sustainable development?

Although historical emissions in the distant past are very uncertain. their influence on countries’ or sectors’ contributions to temperature increase is relatively small in most cases. because these results are dominated by recent (high) emissions.

1148866,Climate change: long-term targets and short-term commitments,2003,Jan Corfee-Morlot and Niklas Höhne,13,Global environmental change,4,277-293,Pergamon,International negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change could take several different approaches to advance future mitigation commitments. Options range from trying to reach consensus on specific long-term atmospheric concentration targets (e.g. 550 ppmv) to simply ignoring this contentious issue and focusing instead on what can be done in the nearer term. This paper argues for a strategy that lies between these two extremes. Internationally agreed threshold levels for certain categories of impacts or of risks posed by climate change could be translated into acceptable levels of atmospheric concentrations. This could help to establish a range of upper limits for global emissions in the medium term that could set the ambition level for negotiations on expanded GHG mitigation commitments. The paper thus considers how physical and socio-economic indicators of climate change impacts …,True,LIjl9q0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,95,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378003000633,14944422407046646391,/scholar?cites=14944422407046646391,,https://www-iam.nies.go.jp/aim/publications/book/reference/japan/cyuou_chikyu/climate_change/climate_change.pdf,0,0,0

This data set is distinguished from the existing literature in its breadth of coverage. its focus on national policies (rather than international pledges). and on the use of objective metrics rather than normative criteria. The focus of the data is limited to national climate legislation and strategies and does not cover subnational or sectoral measures. Climate legislation and strategies are important because they can: enhance incentives for climate mitigation; provide mechanisms for mainstreaming; and provide a focal point for actors. Three broad findings emerge. First. there has been a substantial increase in climate legislation and strategies between 2007 and 2012: 67% of global GHG emissions are now under national climate legislation or …,True,LIjl9q0AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,88,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2013.845409,362896426857300949,/scholar?cites=362896426857300949,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:658565/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0
1148868,Bridging the greenhouse-gas emissions gap,2012,Kornelis Blok and Niklas Höhne and Kees Van Der Leun and Nicholas Harrison,2,Nature Climate Change,7,471-474,Nature Publishing Group,We propose a new approach—which we call ‘wedging the gap’—consisting of 21 coherent major initiatives that together would trigger greenhouse-gas emission reductions of around 10 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e) by 2020. plus the benefits of enhanced reductions in air-pollutant emissions. This supports and goes substantially beyond the emission reductions proposed by national governments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The approach would play a significant part in bridging the gap between current emission trends and what is necessary to put the world on a path that would limit global temperature increase to 2 C above pre-industrial levels.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources.

In an affluent. low-population-growth. equity and sustainability-oriented B1-H2 world. hydrogen technologies experience substantial but plausible performance and costs improvements and are able to diffuse extensively. Corresponding production and distribution infrastructures emerge. The global hydrogen production system. initially fossil based. progressively shifts toward renewable sources.

Therefore. many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 C. Here we analyse integrated energy–economy–environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios. energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 C-consistent scenarios. but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors. leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 C-to a 1.5 C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO 2. This implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide. to be achieved between 2045 and 2060.

This report is the culmination of the combined efforts of the New Scenarios Steering Committee. an author team composed primarily of members of the research community. and numerous other meeting participants and external reviewers who provided extensive comments during the expert review process. The expert meeting included presentations focused on needs for scenarios as seen from a policymaking perspective. a review of past IPCC scenarios. overviews of evolving plans in the research community. needs and opportunities for scenarios on two different time scales ('near term' to 2035. and 'long term' to 2100. extended to 2300 for some applications). and a review of options for the benchmark scenarios. referred to in the report as 'Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCPs). Additional presentations addressed institutional issues and options for increasing participation by developing and transition-economy countries. The remainder of the meeting was organized around a series of breakout groups and plenary sessions that provided an opportunity for the research communities to further coordinate their plans. to refine the proposal for the RCPs. and to consider additional cross-cutting issues.

The matrix architecture facilitates addressing key questions related to current climate research and policy-making: identifying the effectiveness of different adaptation and mitigation strategies (in terms of their costs. risks and other consequences) and the possible trade-offs and synergies. The two main axes of the matrix are: 1) the level of radiative forcing of the climate system (as characterised by the representative concentration pathways) and 2) a set of alternative plausible trajectories of future global development (described as shared socio-economic pathways). The matrix can be used to guide scenario development at different scales. It can also be used as a heuristic tool for classifying new and existing scenarios for assessment.

1148902,Land use competition for production of food and liquid biofuels: An analysis of the arguments in the current debate,2010,Régis Rathmann and Alexandre Szklo and Roberto Schaeffer,35,,1,14-22,Pergamon,This article analyses the current state of the debate over competition for land use. by means of an index of the main arguments in favor and against the production of liquid biofuels and the impacts on food production. Based on this index. an analytic framework is constructed to establish the causal relations indicated by the existing studies on this competition. We find that the emergence of agro-energy has altered the land use dynamic. albeit not yet significantly. with a shift of areas traditionally used to grow foods over to crops to produce biofuels. This has been contributing to raise food prices in the short run. However. it is probable that this is not the only factor determining this trend. nor will it last over the long run. The challenge is to conciliate the production of biofuels with the production of foods in sustainable form.,True,gNdjFFcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,455,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148109000974,10068067581623068005,/scholar?cites=10068067581623068005,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45723276/j.renene.2009.02.02520160517-5988-4j2its.pdf,0,0,0

The UN Convention on Climate Change is considering its inclusion in future agreements and asked its scientific board to study methodological and scientific issues related to positive incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation. Here we present an empirically derived mechanism that offers a mix of incentives to developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation. conserve and possibly enhance their ecosystem's carbon stocks. We also use recent data to model its effects on the 20 most forested developing countries.

CO2 emissions at refineries. In Brazil. for example. the stipulated reduction in the sulfur content of diesel and gasoline between 2002 and 2009 should increase the energy use of Brazil's refining industry by around 30%. with effects on its CO2 emissions. Thus. the world refining industry must deal with trade-offs between emissions of pollutants with local impacts (due to fuel specifications) and emissions of pollutants with global impacts (due to the increased energy use at refineries to remove contaminants from oil products).

VA (United States),Greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries will likely surpass those from developed countries within the first half of this century. highlighting the need for developing country efforts to reduce the risk of climate change. While developing nations have been reluctant to accept binding emissions targets. asking that richer nations take action first. many are undertaking efforts that have significantly reduced the growth of their own greenhouse gas emissions. In most cases. climate mitigation is not the goal. but rather an outgrowth of efforts driven by economic. security. or local environmental concerns. This study attempts to document the climate mitigation resulting from such efforts in six key countries (Brazil. China. India. Mexico.

The six countries examined here reflect significant regional. economic. demographic. and energy resource diversity. They include the world's two most populous nations. a major oil exporter. Africa's largest greenhouse gas emitter. and the country with the largest expanse of tropical forest. While their circumstances vary widely. these countries share common concerns that have motivated actions resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions growth. Primary among these concerns are economic growth. energy security. and improved air quality.

1148921,An exergy analysis of the Brazilian economy: from energy production to final energy use,1992,Roberto Schaeffer and Robert M Wirtshafter,17,Energy,9,841-855,Pergamon,The concept of exergy is applied to a national economy as a tool for energy planning. Conversions and utilizations of energy carriers in Brazil are described in terms of both energy and exergy. The energy analysis of the Brazilian economy shows that the overall first-law efficiency of the country's energy system is 32.4%. while the exergy analysis shows that the overall second-law efficiency is only 22.8%. Expressed in a different way. the exergy approach uncovers that the efficiency with which the Brazilian economy uses its energy resources is only about two-thirds of that manifested by the traditional heat-balance approach. The exergy approach not only reveals the existence of an inadequate match between the quality of the energy carriers supplied to end users and the quality required by final consumers to perform their energy services. but also indicates that there is room for improvement in the nations's energy …,True,gNdjFFcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,112,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0360544292901026,17764059371466718553,/scholar?cites=17764059371466718553,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roberto_Schaeffer/publication/229370519_Exergy_accounting_of_energy_and_material_flows_in_steel_production_systems/links/5f64a926299bf1b53ede0672/Exergy-accounting-of-energy-and-material-flows-in-steel-production-systems.pdf,0,0,0

United Kingdom and New York,Stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at any level will require deep reductions in GHG emissions. Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

1148940,Long-term multi-gas scenarios to stabilise radiative forcing-exploring costs and benefits within an integrated assessment framework,2006,DP Van Vuuren and B Eickhout and PL Lucas and MGJ Den Elzen,,The energy journal,Special Issue# 3,,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper presents a set of multi-gas mitigation scenarios that aim for stabilisation of greenhouse gas radiative forcing in 2150 at levels from 3.7 to 5.3 W/m2. At the moment. non-CO2 gasses (methane. nitrous oxide. PFCs. HFCs and SF6) contribute to about a quarter of the global emissions. The analysis shows that including these non-CO2 gases in mitigation analysis is crucial in formulating a cost-effective response. For stabilisation at 4.5 W/m2. a multi-gas approach leads to 40% lower costs than an approach that would focus at CO2only. Within the assumptions used in this study. the non-CO2 gasses contribution to total reduction is very large under less stringent targets (up to 60%). but declines under stringent targets. While stabilising at 3.7 W/m2 obviously leads to larger environmental benefits than the 4.5 W/m2 case (temperature increase in 2100 are 1.9 and 2.3 oC. respectively). the costs of the lower target are higher (0.80% and 0.34% of GDP in 2100. respectively). Improving knowledge on how future reduction potential for non-CO2 gasses could develop is shown to be a crucial research question.,True,vEhdqjkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,186,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2192,1863516172132156054,/scholar?cites=1863516172132156054,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2192,0,0,0

This is done on the basis of theEUtarget of a maximum global temperature increase of 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. The Framework to Assess International Regimes for the differentiation of commitments (FAIR) is used to explore the implications of two possible climate regimes: (1) increasing participation (i.e. a gradual increase in the number of parties involved and their level of commitment according to participation and differentiation rules) and (2) ‘contraction and convergence’ (C&C) with universal participation and a convergence of per capita emission permits.

This is because both problems are caused to a large extent by the same activity (fossil fuel combustion). Substantial ancillary benefits were found for regional air pollution (SO2. NOx. VOC and particulate matter) of implementing the Kyoto Protocol (intended to control greenhouse gas emissions) in Europe. For instance. while three different scenarios on Kyoto implementation were found to reduce European CO2 emissions by 4–7%. they also reduced European emissions of SO2 by 5–14% compared with a no Kyoto policies case.

Individual non-Annex-I countries' allowances converge to the same level also within the same period (‘common convergence’). but starting when their per-capita emissions are a certain percentage above global average (‘differentiated’). Until then they may voluntarily take on ‘positively binding’ targets.

The Netherlands. 19-21 September 2007. This report is the culmination of the combined efforts of the New Scenarios Steering Committee. an author team composed primarily of members of the research community. and numerous other meeting participants and external reviewers who provided extensive comments during the expert review process. The expert meeting included presentations focused on needs for scenarios as seen from a policymaking perspective. a review of past IPCC scenarios. overviews of evolving plans in the research community. needs and opportunities for scenarios on two different time scales ('near term' to 2035. and 'long term' to 2100. extended to 2300 for some applications). and a review of options for the benchmark scenarios. referred to in the report as 'Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCPs). Additional presentations addressed institutional issues and options for increasing participation by developing and transition-economy countries. The remainder of the meeting was organized around a series of breakout groups and plenary sessions that provided an opportunity for the research communities to further coordinate their plans. to refine the proposal for the RCPs. and to consider additional cross-cutting issues.

The scenarios both provide inputs to climate models and also assist in assessing the relative importance of relevant trace gases and aerosol precursors in changing atmospheric composition and hence climate. Scenarios can also help lo improve the understanding of key relationships among factors that drive future emissions.Scenarios are not predictions of the future and should not be used as such. This becomes increasingly true as the time horizon increases. because the basis for the underlying assumptions becomes increasingly speculative. Considerable uncertainties surround the evolution of the types and levels of human activities (including economic growth and structure). technological advances. and human responses to possible environmental. economic and institutional constraints. Since completion of the 1990 Scenario A (SA90). events and new information have emerged which relate to that scenario's underlying assumptions.

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound. for each region and sector. is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate. ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone. carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However. stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend.

This report is the culmination of the combined efforts of the New Scenarios Steering Committee. an author team composed primarily of members of the research community. and numerous other meeting participants and external reviewers who provided extensive comments during the expert review process. The expert meeting included presentations focused on needs for scenarios as seen from a policymaking perspective. a review of past IPCC scenarios. overviews of evolving plans in the research community. needs and opportunities for scenarios on two different time scales ('near term' to 2035. and 'long term' to 2100. extended to 2300 for some applications). and a review of options for the benchmark scenarios. referred to in the report as 'Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCPs).

Confidence in model estimates of future climate evolution has been enhanced via a range of advances since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR). Climate models are based on well-established physical principles and have been demonstrated to reproduce observed features of recent climate (see Chapters 8 and 9) and past climate changes (see Chapter 6). There is considerable confidence that Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change. particularly at continental and larger scales. Confidence in these estimates is higher for some climate variables (eg. temperature) than for others (eg. precipitation). This summary highlights areas of progress since the TAR:• Enhanced scrutiny of models and expanded diagnostic analysis of model behaviour have been increasingly facilitated by internationally coordinated efforts to collect and disseminate output from model experiments performed under common conditions. This has encouraged a more comprehensive and open evaluation of models.

But doing so is not easy for at least two reasons. First. due to the rate of climate change. new infrastructure will have to be able to cope with a large range of changing climate conditions. which will make design more difficult and construction more expensive. Second. uncertainty in future climate makes it impossible to directly use the output of a single climate model as an input for infrastructure design. and there are good reasons to think that the needed climate information will not be available soon. Instead of optimizing based on the climate conditions projected by models. therefore. future infrastructure should be made more robust to possible changes in climate conditions.

The report explores various channels through which climate change and policies will affect poverty: economic impacts through incomes and prices; natural disasters and their effects on assets and livelihoods; and health impacts. It also investigates policy options to ensure adaptation and mitigation policies--such as adaptive and well-targeted social protection. public investments. and financial inclusion policies--contribute to poverty reduction and protect poor people against climate change impacts.

Current methods to assess these costs employ a variety of terminologies and approaches for different types of natural hazards and different impacted sectors. This may impede efforts to ascertain comprehensive and comparable cost figures. In order to strengthen the role of cost assessments in the development of integrated natural hazard management. a review of existing cost assessment approaches was undertaken. This review considers droughts. floods. coastal and Alpine hazards. and examines different cost types. namely direct tangible damages. losses due to business interruption. indirect damages. intangible effects. and the costs of risk mitigation. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art cost assessment approaches and discusses key knowledge gaps. It shows that the application of cost assessments in practice is often incomplete and biased. as direct costs receive a relatively large amount of attention. while intangible and indirect effects are rarely considered. Furthermore. all parts of cost assessment entail considerable uncertainties due to insufficient or highly aggregated data sources. along with a lack of knowledge about the processes leading to damage and thus the appropriate models required. Recommendations are provided on how to reduce or handle these uncertainties by improving data sources and cost assessment methods. Further recommendations address how risk dynamics due to climate and socio-economic change can be better considered. how costs are distributed and risks transferred. and in …,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC,321,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/13/1351/2013/,8362199816820170475,/scholar?cites=8362199816820170475,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/13/1351/2013/nhess-13-1351-2013.pdf,0,0,0

The long-term growth models used in climate change assessments. however. cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To investigate this issue. a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. This exercise allowed us to define the economic amplification ratio. as the ratio of the overall production loss due to an event to its direct costs. This ratio could be used to improve the cost–benefit analysis of prevention measures. We found also that. unlike a Solow-like model. NEDyM exhibits a bifurcation in GDP losses: for each value of the capacity to fund reconstruction.

1149019,Unbreakable: building the resilience of the poor in the face of natural disasters,2016,Stephane Hallegatte and Adrien Vogt-Schilb and Mook Bangalore and Julie Rozenberg,,,,,World Bank Publications,'Economic losses from natural disasters totaled $92 billion in 2015.'Such statements. all too commonplace. assess the severity of disasters by no other measure than the damage inflicted on buildings. infrastructure. and agricultural production. But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it. By focusing on aggregate losses—the traditional approach to disaster risk—we restrict our consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have assets to lose in the first place. and largely ignore the plight of poor people. This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect people’s well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting. and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor people’s vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters. but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the world’s poor. such as expanding financial inclusion. disaster risk and health insurance. social protection and adaptive safety nets. contingent finance and reserve funds. and universal access to early warning systems.

1149020,Can natural disasters have positive consequences? Investigating the role of embodied technical change,2009,Stéphane Hallegatte and Patrice Dumas,68,Ecological Economics,3,777-786,Elsevier,It has been suggested that disasters might have positive economic consequences. through the accelerated replacement of capital. This possibility is referred to as the productivity effect. This effect is investigated using a model with embodied technical change. In this framework. disasters can influence the production level but cannot influence the growth rate. in the same way than the saving ratio in a Solow-like model. Depending on reconstruction quality. indeed. accounting for embodied technical change can either decrease or increase disaster costs. but is never able to turn disasters into positive events. Moreover. a better but slower reconstruction amplifies the short-term consequences of disasters. but pays off over the long-term. Regardless. the productivity effect cannot prevent the existence of a bifurcation when disaster damages exceed the reconstruction capacity. potentially leading to poverty traps.,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,254,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908002863,8585054542274834123,/scholar?cites=8585054542274834123,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52716489.pdf,0,0,0

Five climate variables are included: temperature. diurnal temperature range. precipitation. vapour pressure. and cloud cover. The set comprises the observed climate record (1901–2000). a control scenario (1901–2100) and 16 scenarios of projected future climate (2001–2100). The 16 climate change scenarios represent all combinations of four emissions scenarios and four global climate models (GCMs). covering 93% of the range of uncertainty in global warming in the 21st century published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus these scenarios permit users to assess the implications for climate impacts of some of the major sources of uncertainty in future climate.

This report is the culmination of the combined efforts of the New Scenarios Steering Committee. an author team composed primarily of members of the research community. and numerous other meeting participants and external reviewers who provided extensive comments during the expert review process. The expert meeting included presentations focused on needs for scenarios as seen from a policymaking perspective. a review of past IPCC scenarios. overviews of evolving plans in the research community. needs and opportunities for scenarios on two different time scales ('near term' to 2035. and 'long term' to 2100. extended to 2300 for some applications). and a review of options for the benchmark scenarios. referred to in the report as 'Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCPs). Additional presentations addressed institutional issues and options for increasing participation by developing and transition-economy countries. The remainder of the meeting was organized around a series of breakout groups and plenary sessions that provided an opportunity for the research communities to further coordinate their plans. to refine the proposal for the RCPs. and to consider additional cross-cutting issues.

Anthropogenically induced climatic change arising from increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases would. therefore. be likely to have a significant effect on agricultural insect pests. Current best estimates of changes in climate indicate an increase in global mean annual temperatures of 1°C by 2025 and 3°C by the end of the next century. Such increases in temperature have a number of implications for temperature-dependent insect pests in mid-latitude regions. Changes in climate may result in changes in geographical distribution. increased overwintering. changes in population growth rates. increases in the number of generations. extension of the development season. changes in crop-pest synchrony. changes in interspecific interactions and increased risk of invasion by migrant pests.

Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

Nine modeling teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Cancún Agreements to 2030. Specific features compared to earlier assessments are the explicit consideration of near-term 2030 emission targets as well as the systematic sensitivity analysis for the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further “lock-in” of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (450 ppm CO2e).

Key among these is the five-year cycle of pledge-and-review designed to increase the ambition of climate action over time. The starting point for this “ambition mechanism” is a Party’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) submitted to the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). which pledges certain types of actions to reduce emissions and strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change impacts. 6More than 190 Parties submitted intended NDCs in 2015 before the Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris. 7 Reflecting each country’s diverse national circumstances and capabilities. this first round of NDCs offered a variety of approaches to reducing emissions and building resilience and adaptive capacity. 8 Box 1 summarizes the current state of NDCs.,True,GWWrA5MAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,15,https://catalogue.unccd.int/1304_WRI_NDCS.pdf,8439925206943252902,/scholar?cites=8439925206943252902,,https://catalogue.unccd.int/1304_WRI_NDCS.pdf,0,0,0

While attention has been understandably focussed on the ratification process. it is time to begin thinking about the next steps for the global climate regime. particularly in terms of a deeper inclusion of developing countries' concerns and interests. This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries. The principal argument is that we need to return to the basic principles outlined in the Framework Convention on Climate Change in searching for a north—south bargain on climate change. Such a bargain may be achievable if we can realign the policy architecture of the climate regime to its original stated goals of sustainable development.,True,6FYIdSQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,261,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3763/cpol.2003.0329,9964145031625308308,/scholar?cites=9964145031625308308,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44499411/Najam_20-_20Climate_20Negotiations_20Beyond_20Kyoto_20Developing.pdf,0,0,0

Although climate change seems marginal compared to the pressing issues of poverty alleviation and economic development. it is becoming clear that the realisation of development goals may be hampered by climate change. However. development can be shaped in such a way as to achieve its goals and at the same time reduce vulnerability to climate change. thereby facilitating sustainable development that realises economic. social. local and global environmental goals. This approach has been coined the ‘development first approach’. in which a future climate regime should focus on development strategies with ancillary climate benefits and increase the capability of developing countries to implement these.

This allows a standardized but flexible use of indicator sets adapted to specific objectives or desertification issues relevant for implementing the Convention. Science has made progress in understanding major issues and proximate causes of dryland degradation such that indicator sets can be accordingly selected from the wealth of existing and documented indicator systems. The selection and combination should be guided according to transparent criteria given by existing indicator frameworks adapted to desertification conceptual frameworks such as the Dryland Development Paradigm and can act as a pragmatic entry point for selecting area‐ and theme‐specific sets of …,True,6FYIdSQAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,138,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ldr.1084,94729437119590064,/scholar?cites=94729437119590064,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54387769/Application_of_indicator_systems_for_mon20170909-29566-1d62hpp.pdf,0,0,0

1149125,Widening energy access in Africa: Towards energy transition,2012,Youba Sokona and Yacob Mulugetta and Haruna Gujba,47,Energy Policy,,3-10,Elsevier,The discussion to widen access to modern energy services has been influential in shaping some of the discussions on energy at the international level. The practice of widening modern energy services access to the poor in Africa is complex. and exacerbated by the dual nature of the energy system across Sub-Saharan Africa where traditional and modern energy systems and practices co-exist. This presents major challenges for policy makers who have to contend with a fragmented energy system. which requires the mobilisation of an array of actors at cross-sectoral levels in order to develop effective institutions and implement innovative policy frameworks. This paper further argues that. the ‘energy access’ discussion needs to take place in the context of energy transitions. giving due consideration to the productive sector as an important vehicle for change.

Irrigation was considered as one of the prominent inputs among these that led to heavy investments in large surface irrigation infrastructure through five-year plans. However. when persistent droughts during the late 1960s exposed the vulnerability of canal irrigation. the use of groundwater became an alternative. In addition. HYV crops require greater control and reliability over irrigation than canals could not provide and is considered as one of the factors for pervasive proliferation of wells and tubewells even within the command areas of large irrigation systems. Further. the dependence on groundwater to meet irrigation needs has substantially increased due to increase in area under irrigation that was out of the command areas of canals. Unfortunately with the increased use of groundwater. the water table has started dropping alarmingly. particularly in areas with hard rocks and low rainfall. In the early 1990s. serious depletion of groundwater tables was reported in parts of Gujarat. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The state of Gujarat has over-exploited its groundwater resources largely due to the growth in irrigated agriculture. With the rise of tubewell technology and its easy accessibility. farmers in alluvial regions of the state make abundant use of groundwater. Today. groundwater irrigation in Gujarat accounts for almost 80 per cent of the total irrigated area.

The first was when agricultural consumption was de-metered and extensive subsidies were offered; the second when Independent Power Producer contracts with major fiscal implications were signed by the State Electricity Boards. A third set of circumstances. with the potential for equally powerful forms of institutional lock-in. appears to be in the making with the reproduction of the Orissa model on the national scale. This paper provides an analysis of the social and political context in which power sector reforms have taken place in India.

There has been a marked increase in national policies and legislation on climate change since the AR4 with a diversity of approaches and a multiplicity of objectives (see Section 15.2). However. Figure 1.9 of Chapter 1 suggests that these policies. taken together. have not yet achieved a substantial deviation in emissions from the past trend. Limiting concentrations to levels that would be consistent with a likely probability of maintaining temperature increases below 2 degrees C this century (scenarios generally in the range of 430-480 ppmv CO2eq) would require that emissions break from these trends and be decreased substantially. In contrast. concentrations exceed 1000 ppmv CO2eq by 2100 in many baseline scenarios (that is. scenarios without additional efforts to reduce emissions).   The literature on mitigation scenarios provides a wide range of CO2 shadow price levels consistent with these goals. with estimates of less than US$50/tCO2 in 2020 in many studies and exceeding US$100/tCO2 in others. assuming a globally-efficient and immediate effort to reduce emissions. These shadow prices exhibit a strongly increasing trend thereafter. Policies and instruments are assessed in this light.   Section 15.2 assesses the role of institutions and governance. Section 15.3 lays out the classification of policy instruments and packages. while 15.4 discusses the methodologies used to evaluate policies and institutions.

Integrated model studies highlight that climate policies as part of well-designed policy packages reduce the overall cost of achieving multiple sustainability objectives. The incommensurability and uncertainties around the quantification of coeffects become. however. increasingly pervasive the more the perspective shifts from sectoral and local to economy wide and global. the more objectives are analyzed. and the more the …,True,jfpM418AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,90,https://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/VD9QeEm4HZ3drPtzFpJi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-021113-095626,9938778930932198569,/scholar?cites=9938778930932198569,,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-021113-095626,0,0,0

This data set is distinguished from the existing literature in its breadth of coverage. its focus on national policies (rather than international pledges). and on the use of objective metrics rather than normative criteria. The focus of the data is limited to national climate legislation and strategies and does not cover subnational or sectoral measures. Climate legislation and strategies are important because they can: enhance incentives for climate mitigation; provide mechanisms for mainstreaming; and provide a focal point for actors. Three broad findings emerge. First. there has been a substantial increase in climate legislation and strategies between 2007 and 2012: 67% of global GHG emissions are now under national climate legislation or …,True,jfpM418AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,88,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2013.845409,362896426857300949,/scholar?cites=362896426857300949,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:658565/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Unlocking Africa’s huge renewable energy potential could help to take many people out of poverty. while ensuring the uptake of sustainable technologies for the continent’s long-term development. The report examines a ''renewable scenario'' based on a modelling tool developed by IRENA and tested with assistance from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Initial results from the ECOWAS Renewable Energy Planning (EREP) model for continental ECOWAS countries show that the share of renewable technologies in the region could increase from the current 22% of electricity generation to as much as 52% in 2030. provided that the cost of these technologies continues to fall and fossil fuel prices continue to rise. In this scenario. nearly half of the envisaged capacity additions between 2010 and 2030 would be with renewable technologies. Analysis using EREP – along with a similar model developed for Southern Africa – can provide valuable input for regional dialogue and energy projects such as the East and Southern Africa Clean Energy Corridor and the Programme for Infrastructure and Development in Africa (PIDA).

The sector is forecast to potentially eclipse industry in this regard if conventional vehicle choices and travel modes persist. This paper explores scenarios of transport technology choices and demand in a future of uncertain fuel and technology costs. and the consequences for energy supply and greenhouse gas emissions. It explores the extent of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the implication of fuel migration from petroleum products. The preference for alternative fuels such as hydrogen. liquid biofuels and natural gas is also investigated. The evolution of road transport in South Africa towards 2050 is investigated utilising the South African TIMES model. a full energy sector least-cost optimisation model that relies on a rich technological database of the entire energy supply and demand system. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are shown to be a viable option in freight and public transport. potentially meeting 70% of travel demand by 2045. The private passenger and light commercial sectors emerge as the main market for electric vehicles. potentially accounting for 80% of new vehicle sales by 2045. Electricity as a transport fuel could account for 30% of fuel supply and reduce transport emissions to half of present day estimates. However. the key uncertainty driving EV adoption is future vehicle costs and crude oil prices. which could dampen EV uptake. Another main finding is that petroleum-dependent vehicles remain an important vehicle class. and that re-investment in existing crude oil …,True,iPVqkhUAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,11,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-447X2018000300004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es,866980232798515960,/scholar?cites=866980232798515960,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-447X2018000300004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es,0,0,0

1149171,Policy options for the sustainable development of Zambia's electricity sector,2013,Bernard Tembo and Bruno Merven,24,Journal of Energy in Southern Africa,2,16-27,University of Cape Town,This paper aims at understanding how Zambia's electricity system would be affected by droughts (due to a dry year) and how the system's adaptive capacity could be improved. Hydropower currently supplies 99% of the total electricity in Zambia. and concerns have been raised because many climate change studies project increased occurrences of dry years in the Southern Africa region. Different economic and climatic scenarios were explored to understand their impact on the development of Zambia's power generation system. and what policies and strategies could be adopted to mitigate these impacts on security of supply and average generation costs. which directly affect the electricity price. The results show that a dry year has significant impact on the average generating cost since hydropower continues to dominate the system. Diversifying the system does not improve the adaptive capacity of the system but only increases the average cost of generating electricity in an average year. The most cost effective way of increasing the system's adaptive capacity is by importing electricity and gradually increasing share of renewable and coal technologies in the system. Further research on how electricity trade in Southern Africa could be enhanced. should be done.,True,iPVqkhUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,11,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2013000200002,2445645890730822815,/scholar?cites=2445645890730822815,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2013000200002,0,0,0

South Africa’s latest electricity plan due to be released shortly. We have used a similar modelling methodology. with the addition of an economic model to account for key indicators such as employment and economic growth. and assessed all the key assumptions used in the draft IRP 2018 against available evidence as the basis for our analysis. We have also assumed that existing coal power plants will be required to conform with current air pollution legislation. which will impose further costs on the existing system not taken into account by the draft IRP 2018. In addition. we have assessed the suitability of one of the most important drivers of the IRP–the greenhouse gas emissions constraint–in the light of South Africa’s overall mitigation potential. with the aim of understanding better the contribution which the electricity sector should be making. especially in the light of future contributions to the global mitigation effort South Africa wil be required to make in the next decade. We have modelled two scenarios:1) Reference scenario: A least-cost electricity investment plan using the best available evidence on key parameters. These include realistic technology costs and learning curves for renewable energy and batteries. more realistic plant availabilities for the Eskom fleet. and compliance of the existing coal fleet with the Air Quality Act (AQA) and Minimum Emission Standards (MES);,True,iPVqkhUAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,10,http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/119/Papers-2019/Alt%20IRP%20final%2007022019.pdf,13086470107554919930,/scholar?cites=13086470107554919930,,http://www.erc.uct.ac.za/sites/default/files/image_tool/images/119/Papers-2019/Alt%20IRP%20final%2007022019.pdf,0,0,0

IEA. 2014; Citi. 2015). Stranded assets are defined as assets that “have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs. devaluations or conversion to liabilities”(Caldecott et al. 2014). This can arise from environmental regulation or other regulatory shifts. market forces. and other causes. including the falling costs of competing technologies.Much of the research on stranded assets thus far has examined the potential financial risks to investors of stranding fossil fuel assets and wasted exploration and extraction capex (Carbon Tracker Initiative. 2011. 2013. 2015; Caldecott et al 2014). For example. McGlade & Ekins (2015) estimated that a third of oil. half of gas and over 80% of coal reserves cannot be burned in future emission scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to below 2oC. Policy interventions to limit warming have been estimated to result in $100 trillion worth of stranded fossil fuel resources to 2050 (Citibank 2015). On the production side. potential wasted capex on fossil fuel projects that exceed the fossil energy requirements for scenarios consistent with 2oC is in the order of $1.9-2.2 trillion. including an estimated $8.6 bn in coal mining capital expenditure in South Africa (CTI. 2015).,True,iPVqkhUAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,10,https://www.africaportal.org/publications/the-impact-of-stranding-power-sector-assets-in-south-africa-using-a-linked-model-to-understand-economy-wide-implications/,2485332761660599889,/scholar?cites=2485332761660599889,,https://www.africaportal.org/documents/15384/2016-Burtonetal-Impact_stranding_power_sector_assets.pdf,0,0,0

As a starting point. this requires building a sufficiently detailed 'bottom-up' picture of technologies and their activity levels in the recent past. A vehicle parc model was developed for South Africa to feed transport demand and data on the fleet into a national energy systems model. the South African TIMES model. which is a least-cost optimisation model of the TIMES/ MARKAL family. Detailed assumptions were developed for 24 vehicle typologies that included the vintage profile. annual mileage and its relationship with age. fuel economy and its improvement over time. and occupancy and load factor. Combining these assumptions. the model was successfully calibrated over 2000-2014 with the national registration database. national fuel sales statistics and. on the freight side. with estimates of the demand for ton.km published by the University of Stellen-bosch's Department of Logistics (2014 only). A demand for passenger.km was also calculated. which agreed well with national transport surveys. A range of detailed indicators were produced for the vehicle typologies and some interesting trends observed. including the steady dieselisation of the light vehicle fleet over the study period and the stagnation of passenger car fuel economy. despite legislation in the European Union. The present study believes that this updated data-rich picture of the road transport vehicle parc will support other studies and national policy and planning initiatives.,True,iPVqkhUAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,8,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2018000200006,16587815584861749098,/scholar?cites=16587815584861749098,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1021-447X2018000200006,0,0,0

1149178,Socio Economic Implications of Mitigation in the Power Sector Including Carbon Taxes in South Africa,2014,Bruno Merven and Alfred Moyo and Adrian Stone and Anthony Dane,,,,,Energy Research Centre (ERC),South Africa has a carbon-intensive energy economy. The energy sector is responsible for most of the country’s emissions. with the national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory for 2000 indicating that 78.9% of total emissions were from energy supply and use (DEAT. 2009). These emissions have largely resulted from the extensive use of coal in the generation of electricity. as well as the conversion of coal into liquid fuels by Sasol. a petrochemicals company. The economy was historically built around the minerals-energy complex (Burton. 2011; Fine & Rustomjee. 1996). linking energy-intensive industries with coal-based energy supply.The South African government made a voluntary commitment during the 15th Conference of Parties in 2009 to reduce emissions by 34% and 42% below ‘business as usual’by 2020 and 2025 respectively. provided they receive the necessary international support (DEA. 2010). The government developed its 2010 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in order to meet South Africa’s future electricity demand by moving towards less carbon-intensive generation. This would contribute to efforts aimed at achieving South Africa’s emissions reduction targets. According to the IRP Policy adjusted scenario. renewable energy (RE) would contribute 14% to South Africa’s electricity generating mix by 2030 (DOE. 2011).

Our results suggest substantial reductions in the country's greenhouse gas emissions when these two policy changes are jointly implemented (relative to business-as-usual baseline scenario). Moreover. the two policies impose essentially no cost to economic growth. although there is a 1 per cent reduction in employment. From our analysis we conclude that a regional energy strategy. anchored in hydropower. represents a potentially inexpensive approach to reducing emissions in South Africa.

Confidence in model estimates of future climate evolution has been enhanced via a range of advances since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR). Climate models are based on well-established physical principles and have been demonstrated to reproduce observed features of recent climate (see Chapters 8 and 9) and past climate changes (see Chapter 6). There is considerable confidence that Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change. particularly at continental and larger scales. Confidence in these estimates is higher for some climate variables (eg. temperature) than for others (eg. precipitation). This summary highlights areas of progress since the TAR:• Enhanced scrutiny of models and expanded diagnostic analysis of model behaviour have been increasingly facilitated by internationally coordinated efforts to collect and disseminate output from model experiments performed under common conditions.

Despite their tremendous value for the scientific community and policy makers alike. there are some difficulties in interpreting the results. For example. radiative forcings were not standardized across the various AOGCM integrations and carbon cycle runs. and. in some models. key forcings were omitted. Furthermore. the AOGCM analysis of plausible emissions pathways was restricted to only three SRES scenarios. This study attempts to address these issues.

While a ‘feasible scenario warming commitment’ is probably the most relevant one for policy making. it depends centrally on key assumptions as to the technical. economic and political feasibility of future greenhouse gas emission reductions.

A brief analysis based on multi-gas emission pathways and several climate sensitivity uncertainty estimates,2006,Malte Meinshausen,,Avoiding dangerous climate change,,265-280,Cambridge University Press. New York. NY,Assuming a policy target of how much climate change is tolerable–eg in terms of global mean temperature rise–how low do greenhouse gas concentrations need to peak or stabilize to prevent this target being exceeded? Drawing from a set of 11 published climate sensitivity uncertainty estimates. the probability of exceeding 2 C equilibrium warming (eg European Union target) is found to lie between 63% and 99% for stabilization at 550 ppm CO2 equivalence. Only at levels around 400 ppm CO2 equivalence or below. could the probability of staying below 2 C in equilibrium be termed ‘likely’for most of the climate sensitivity PDFs. The probability of exceeding 2 C ranges from 8% to 57% in this case. Going beyond the analysis of equilibrium warming levels. the transient probabilities of exceeding 2 C by 2100 are estimated. The analysis is based on ‘Equal Quantile Walk’multi-gas emission pathways that stabilize at 550. 475 and 400ppm CO2eq. Given that stabilization at 400ppm became infeasible to reach without overshooting. the latter pathway overshoots its ultimate 400 ppm stabilization level by peaking at 475 ppm. The results suggest that such an overshooting in terms of concentrations would increase the probability of overshooting the 2 C target. Hence. the maximal greenhouse gas concentration might be more relevant for achieving a 2 C target than the ultimate stabilization level. Thus. future research and policy might want to focus rather on the peaking concentrations over the 21st century instead of the ultimate stabilization level.,True,uLNbYKEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,264,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/7972/1/avoid-dangercc.pdf#page=279,5447778260019386297,/scholar?cites=5447778260019386297,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/7972/1/avoid-dangercc.pdf#page=279,0,0,0

Multiple factors have hindered the quantification of this feedback. which was not included in climate carbon-cycle models which participated in recent model intercomparisons (such as the Coupled Carbon Cycle Climate Model Intercomparison Project – C4MIP) . There are considerable uncertainties in the rate and extent of permafrost thaw. the hydrological and vegetation response to permafrost thaw. the decomposition timescales of freshly thawed organic material. the proportion of soil carbon that might be emitted as carbon dioxide via aerobic decomposition or as methane via anaerobic decomposition. and in the magnitude of the high latitude amplification of global warming that will drive permafrost degradation. Additionally. there are extensive and poorly characterized regional heterogeneities in soil properties. carbon content. and hydrology. Here. we couple a new permafrost module to a reduced complexity carbon-cycle climate model. which allows us to perform a large ensemble of simulations. The ensemble is designed to span the uncertainties listed above and thereby the results provide an estimate of the potential strength of the feedback from newly thawed permafrost carbon. For the high CO2 concentration scenario (RCP8.5). 33–114 GtC (giga tons of Carbon) are released by 2100 (68 % uncertainty range). This leads to an additional warming of 0.04–0.23 °C.

This book explores whether such a transformation is underway. how it might be accelerated. and the complex politics of this process. Given the dominance of global capitalism and free-market ideologies. decarbonisation is dependent on creating carbon markets and engaging powerful actors in the world of business and finance. Climate Capitalism assesses the huge political dilemmas this poses. and the need to challenge the entrenched power of many corporations. the culture of energy use. and global inequalities in energy consumption. Climate Capitalism is essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand the challenge we face.

We argue that a perspective which starts from the role of the state in promoting capital accumulation can much better explain the content both of state policies and of particular international agreements. We first outline the way that fossil fuel companies have been able to secure their interests in state policies on global warming. We then develop the argument that their ability to do this is best explained in terms of the structural power of capital. deriving from the role of the state within capitalist societies. Finally. we suggest that this may also be producing transformations within global warming politics. as insurance companies in particular become involved.

It discusses them in relation to a long-standing critique of trends towards individualisation amongst environmentalists. It suggests that this critique misses the complex way that subjects are produced by these practices and proposes to analyse subjectification in relation to climate change through the lens of governmentality. The paper then proceeds to examine five specific sorts of practice: carbon footprinting; carbon offsetting; carbon dieting; Carbon Reduction Action Groups; and Personal Carbon Allowances. By drawing on the concept of governmentality we show how contemporary forms of carbon government work through calculative practices that simultaneously totalise (aggregating social practices. overall greenhouse gas emissions) and individualise (producing reflexive …,True,im2kgFUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,279,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d4109,15226686599200082734,/scholar?cites=15226686599200082734,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johannes_Stripple/publication/228436887_My_Space_governing_individuals%27_carbon_emissions/links/0f317534e9e65b3014000000.pdf,0,0,0

This article contests that interpretation by showing how it focuses too closely on the interstate negotiations and neglects the ongoing development of carbon markets as governance practices and systems to deal with climate change. It shows that there remains a strong normative consensus about such markets. and a deepening set of transnational governance practices. These governance practices only partly depend on the interstate negotiations.

Much of the strength of the concept derives from its capacity to convey a sense of an overarching set of arrangements beyond the specificities of individual issue areas or thematic concerns that encompasses a broad range of political foci. Governance as a concept also connects GEP to more general patterns of global politics. It does this not only by showing how broader global political forces and trends shape GEP (narrowly understood). but also how the environment is increasingly central to the institutional arrangements governing global life.However. there is still great variation in how the term global environmental governance (GEG) is used.

Privatised governance in particular has come under considerable scrutiny. This paper attempts to contribute to this debate through an analysis of the widespread critiques of climate governance that focus on its ‘marketized’ or ‘privatized’ character. Such critiques fundamentally attempt to delegitimise dominant governance mechanisms which can be collectively known as the ‘global carbon market’. The paper argues that to understand the political dynamics of legitimacy surrounding these forms of governance we need to take into account the recurrent tension within capitalism between accumulation and legitimation.

Negotiations to date have already revealed serious divisions of interest. of which those dividing North and South still predominate. This article suggests that the best prospects for building an effective long-term regime will arise from seeking to develop non-traditional alliances across the North—South divide. so as to form a central coalition that more reluctant states will ultimately have to accept.

The first is concerned with the processes by which particular carbon market schemes are established. The second focuses on the role of particular actors in the creation of carbon markets. The third strand assesses carbon markets on efficiency. legitimacy or justice grounds. This existing literature is contrasted with the framework developed by the contributions to this volume. Broadly drawing on constructivist and poststructuralist approaches. the carbon economy is deconstructed. its history scrutinised and the practices and technologies that have been used to bring these markets into being are highlighted.

The diffusion of ET is best described as a case of polycentric diffusion. where ET systems diffused to multiple loci of governance. but where they all serve similar goals under a broad policy framework guided loosely by the UN-based climate regime. Using network analysis combined with qualitative data. we explain how this polycentric pattern of policy development emerged. who carried and spread it and how. and how the idea has spread into a polycentric governance system.

This is partly because the rhetorical differences between Bush. his predecessor Clinton and President Obama mask great continuities in US climate change politics since the early 1990s. It is also because. unlike in other issue areas. the EU has moved into a position of clear international leadership. which is likely to provoke diplomatic conflict. both for standard reasons of realpolitik but more precisely because of the different growth strategies pursued by each side and the different implications of those strategies for climate policy.

Politics and the development of climate policy,2012,Matthew Paterson,12,Climate Policy,1,82-97,Routledge,Why have carbon markets been rapidly adopted as policy solutions to climate change in the last decade? Perhaps surprisingly. this question has attracted virtually no attention in the large literature on such markets. The standard arguments given for why carbon markets are good ways to respond to climate change do not explain why such markets have flourished as governance mechanisms in relation to climate. Carbon markets have spread and become taken-for-granted because of the potential they give to certain powerful actors (financiers. specifically) to create new cycles of investment. profits and growth. As a consequence. they make possible a political coalition combining financiers with environmentalists. This coalition has considerable potential to legitimize substantial cuts in carbon emissions in the face of continued opposition from other interests.

While developing nations have been reluctant to accept binding emissions targets. asking that richer nations take action first. many are undertaking efforts that have significantly reduced the growth of their own greenhouse gas emissions. In most cases. climate mitigation is not the goal. but rather an outgrowth of efforts driven by economic. security. or local environmental concerns. This study attempts to document the climate mitigation resulting from such efforts in six key countries (Brazil. China. India. Mexico.

While their circumstances vary widely. these countries share common concerns that have motivated actions resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions growth. Primary among these concerns are economic growth. energy security. and improved air quality.

Recognising that intelligent metering (or smart metering) has the potential to revolutionise customer engagement and management of urban water by utilities. this paper provides a summary of the knowledge-base for researchers and industry practitioners to ensure that the technology fosters sustainable urban water management. To date. roll-outs of intelligent metering have been driven by the desire for increased data regarding time of use and end-use (such as use by shower. toilet. garden. etc.) as well as by the ability of the technology to reduce labour costs for meter reading. Technology development in the water sector generally lags that seen in the electricity sector. In the coming decade. the deployment of intelligent water metering will transition from being predominantly “pilot or demonstration scale” with the occasional city-wide roll-out. to broader mainstream implementation. This means that issues which have hitherto received little focus must now be addressed. namely: the role of real-time data in customer engagement and demand management; data ownership. sharing and privacy; technical data management and infrastructure security. utility workforce skills; and costs and benefits of implementation.

Meter under-and over-registration of flows has received considerable research attention over the years. but there has been limited focus on non-registration. particularly for domestic water meters over their life cycle. This paper presents empirical estimates on nonregistration for typically installed domestic water meters and emphasises that both under-and non-registration should be considered for any meter replacement assessments and associated policies. Economic modelling showed that domestic water meters should be replaced at lower throughput volumes when considering both of these meter inaccuracy categories. The key value of the paper is that it provides a methodology for determining nonregistration for a fleet of domestic meters.,True,gZMglSoAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,24,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/31252/4/82792_1.pdf,7808494224875282531,/scholar?cites=7808494224875282531,,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/31252/4/82792_1.pdf,0,0,0
1149253,Framework for adaptation to climate change in the city of Cape Town,2006,P Mukheibir and Gina Ziervogel,,,,,Energy Research Centre (ERC),The 20th century has seen the greatest warning in the past thousand years due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 2001b). Climate models now predict that the atmosphere’s temperature will increase by 1.4 ºC to 5.8 ºC by 2100. Climate change will continue to occur even if the global greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed significantly in the short-to mediumterm. Therefore. while controlling emissions is vital. this should be combined with efforts to minimise the effects of climate change. This is commonly called adaptation. and is generally defined as an adjustment in bio-physical. social and/or economic systems in response to an actual or expected climatic impact and its effect.The effect of climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather events such as droughts. floods and heat waves. The Northern and Western Cape provinces are projected as the two South African provinces most at risk of climate-induced warming and rainfall change.

Changes in the total amount of precipitation and in its frequency and intensity directly affect the magnitude and timing of runoff and the intensity of floods and droughts; however. at present. specific regional effects are uncertain”. “The impacts of climate change will depend on the baseline condition of the water supply system and the ability of water resource managers to respond not only to climate change but also to population growth and changes in demands. technology. and economic. social and legislative conditions. In some cases - particularly in wealthier countries with integrated water management systems - improved management may protect water users from climate change at minimal cost; in many others. however. there could be substantial economic. social and environmental costs. particularly in regions that already are water-limited and where there is considerable competition among users"".

Gold Coast,Small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) comprise 96 per cent of all private businesses in Australia. The SME sector is the economys largest employer and the largest contributor to GDP. Moreover. SMEs play a significant role within socio-economic systems: they provide employment. goods and services and tax revenue for communities. Climate change may result in adverse business outcomes including business interruptions. increased investment and insurance costs. and declines in financial indicators such as measures of value. return and growth. After natural disasters. SMEs face greater short-term losses than larger enterprises. and may have lower adaptive capacity for various reasons. This study examines the underlying factors and processes shaping adaptive capacity of Australian SMEs to climate change and associated sea level rise. Specifically. the research asks the following questions: 1) How have SMEs considered and integrated adaptation into business planning? 2) What are the key underlying processes that constrain and influence the adaptive capacities of SMEs? and 3) What types of support are required to promote SME business continuity under a changing climate? The study adopts theories from Political Ecology and draws on literature on vulnerability and hazards to understand the processes that mediate the adaptive capacity of SMEs.

A qualitative strategy assessment methodology is proposed and tested for climate conditions in the Northern Cape. The analysis of the results suggests that dry sanitation. education projects and tariff structures are identified as being the most useful strategies. Key factors which were perceived to inhibit the implementation of appropriate drought adaptation strategies are the lack of local capacity and the low financial resource base to cover the capital and running costs of most of the strategies.

This together with the impending impact of climate change and increased resource insecurity and variability will mean that planners and decision makers will need to adopt a new way of thinking and pooling resources. Customers are also demanding a whole society approach where water sensitive urban design and sustainable urban water management addresses all the needs of the urban landscape. A One Water approach is expected to bring together all these water streams through workable institutional arrangements and management. However. urban water planners and policymakers around the world are wrestling with the challenge of transitioning to a One Water approach. or as defined in the report as the One Water paradigm. Foremost of these is the inertia associated with the dominant paradigm of centralized systems and siloed institutions. This dominant paradigm results in the lack of engineering and community understanding of the benefits of integrated systems. such as lower costs. higher resilience to extreme events. more localized availability of water for reuse. etc. A further significant challenge is the complex structure of regulations that currently exist separately for water supply. wastewater and stormwater management.

Use of classical multidimensional scaling produces a low‐dimensional representation of the data for which Euclidean distances approximate the original dissimilarities.

Climate change research is largely global in focus. aims at enhanced understanding. and is driven by experts. all of which seem to be insufficient to anchor climate change action in regional and local contexts. We present results from a participatory scenario study conducted in collaboration with the municipality of Delta in SW British Columbia. Canada. This study applies a participatory capacity building approach for climate change action at the local level where the sources of emissions and the mechanisms of adaptation reside and where climate change is meaningful to decision-makers and stakeholders alike. The multi-scale scenario approach consists of synthesizing global climate change scenarios. downscaling them to the regional and local level. and finally …,True,c-KeIAcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,313,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378009000363,11500934395645567071,/scholar?cites=11500934395645567071,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48096106/j.gloenvcha.2009.04.00220160816-19208-1bqdhyh.pdf,0,0,0

Nevertheless. there are strong linkages between the two in both realms. This paper focuses on the scientific linkages and discusses the opportunities they provide for integrated policy development. and the necessity to consider the risk of trade-offs. It is suggested that integration may not only provide new opportunities. but may even be a prerequisite for successfully addressing both issues. Since the feasibility of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations is dependent on general socio-economic development paths. climate policy responses should be fully placed in the larger context of technological and socio-economic policy development rather than be viewed as an add-on to those broader policies.

A new. emerging notion of comfort is explored that embraces engagement with new conditions. new experiences. and new types of interactions between inhabitants and building systems and unfamiliar technologies. The emphasis is on communication and dialogue as two dynamic and adaptive processes necessary to achieve optimal building performance while valuing and responding to inhabitant knowledge and agency. and enhancing indoor environmental quality from the standpoint of the inhabitants.

It is argued that. in most cases. we are asking the wrong questions when we forecast. To the degree that the future is not already determined but remains to be created. then the search for the most likely future is not only misguided (since we are usually wrong) but actually counterproductive. What are needed are backcasting techniques that reveal the possibility. and test the feasibility and impacts. of alternative futures.

Evidence increasingly supports the finding that this transformation is not triggered by climate policy alone. but rather is shaped by a broad array of decisions and practices that are rooted in underlying patterns of development.

Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,l6nq2hkAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,481,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

Although they are still rather skeptical about the global environmental enterprise. they have come a long way from being the vigorous contestants that they were three decades ago. This fascinating evolution has not only changed the views of developing countries but has also transformed the shape of the global environmental discourse. most significantly by turning what used to be global environmental politics into what is now the global politics of sustainable development. This paper charts this evolution by using the twin conceptual lenses of effectiveness and legitimacy and the heuristic markers of the three key global conferences on the global environment (Stockholm 1972; Rio de Janeiro 1992; Johannesburg 2002).

While attention has been understandably focussed on the ratification process. it is time to begin thinking about the next steps for the global climate regime. particularly in terms of a deeper inclusion of developing countries' concerns and interests. This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries.

Dordrecht,This paper presents a framework for understanding energy issues in the context of sustainable development. It posits that there are three important ways in which energy is related to sustainable development: (a) energy as a source of environmental stress. (b) energy as a principal motor of macroeconomic growth and (c) energy as a prerequisite for meeting basic human needs. These three dimensions correspond to the three dimensions of the often-used triangle of sustainable development: environmental. economic. and social. Using this framework. the paper traces how successive environmental summits at Stockholm (1972). Rio de Janeiro (1992) and Johannesburg (2002) have dealt with energy issues.

A typical CDM project today mitigates a gas other than CO2 in Asia. with carbon credits purchased by a European private company. Despite significant limitations. the CDM provides an example of how financing for global public goods can support sustainable development. Looking forward. the CDM is not adapted to support the large-scale mitigation efforts that are required in large countries to meaningfully curb GHG emissions in the future. However.

This review fills in this gap by providing comprehensive methodological guidance on the quantification of co-impacts and their integration into climate-related decision making based on the literature. The article first clarifies the confusion in the literature about related terms and makes a proposal for a more consistent terminological framework. then emphasizes the importance of working in a multiple-objective–multiple-impact framework. It creates a taxonomy of co-impacts and uses this to propose a methodological framework for the identification of the key co-impacts to be assessed for a given climate policy and to avoid double counting.

The choice of a given proxy of climate change risks is actually more than a technical option. It is essentially motivated by the degree of distrust regarding the legitimacy of an assessment of climate damages and the possibility of providing in due time reliable and non controversial estimates.

Unlike many of the E3 models used to simulate mitigation options. IMACLIM-R represents both the technological and behavioural determinants of mobility. By comparing business-as-usual. carbon price only. and carbon price combined with transport policy scenarios. it is demonstrated that the measures that foster a modal shift towards low-carbon modes and a decoupling of mobility needs from economic activity significantly modify the sectoral distribution of mitigation efforts and reduce the level of carbon tax necessary to reach a …,True,aZwhTpYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,83,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2012.735916,2790294810876055281,/scholar?cites=2790294810876055281,,https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/799119/filename/WAISMAN_et_al._-_Transport_and_LCS_FINAL_HAL.pdf?frbrVersion=14,0,0,0

In light of the current literature a framework for assessing responses to this challenge is provided. The presence of climate change makes it necessary to at least review development strategies—even in apparently nonclimate-sensitive and nonpolluting sectors. There is a need for an integrated portfolio of actions ranging from avoiding emissions (mitigation) to coping with impacts (adaptation) and to consciously accepting residual damages. Proactive (ex ante) adaptation is critical. but subject to risks of regrets when the magnitude or location of damages is uncertain. Uncertainty on location favors nonsite-specific actions. or reactive (ex post) adaptation. However. some irreversible losses cannot be compensated for.

Our aim in this paper is to study in more depth how sectorally differentiated inertia impacts on optimal CO2-emission abatement policies.

Differential inertia is the critical determinant of this trade-off. especially in the case of a 20-year delay in the action. or in an underestimation of the growth of the transportation sector.

The paper finds that although the growth literature rarely addresses climate change per se. some issues discussed in the growth literature are directly relevant for climate change analysis. Notably. destruction of production factors. or decrease in factor productivity may strongly affect long-run equilibrium growth even in one-sector neoclassical growth models; climatic shocks have had large impacts on growth in developing countries because of rigidities; and the introducing increasing returns has a major impact on growth dynamics. in particular through induced technical change. poverty traps. or lock-ins.

Does it “buy time” for technical change in the energy sector?  Carbon sequestration aims at raising the amount of carbon sequestered in biomass and in soils. Whether it should be part of a global climate mitigation strategy. however. remains controversial. One of the key issues is that. contrary to emission abatement. carbon sequestration might not be permanent. But some argue that even temporary sequestration is beneficial as it delays climate change impacts and “buys” time for technical change in the energy sector.  To rigorously assess these arguments.

Temporary credits have value only if restrictions on carbon emissions are not expected to tighten substantially. The intuition is illustrated by assessing the value of a hypothetical temporary sulfur dioxide sequestration credit. using historical data on actual SO2 allowance prices.,True,aZwhTpYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,34,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2004.9685510,4324916467404789757,/scholar?cites=4324916467404789757,,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/17430/WPS3181.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

In France. fuelwood appears to be an important source for the renewable energy mix. Using the French Forest Sector Model. our paper aims to assess the impacts of three policy options to stimulate fuelwood consumption: a consumer subsidy. a producer subsidy and a fixed-demand contract policy. We explored their impacts in terms of five groups of criteria: (1) forest resource dynamics; (2) variations in wood products prices and quantities consumed and produced; (3) trade balance; (4) budgetary costs; and (5) variations in agent surpluses. We show that no policy option is more desirable than another on the basis of all of these criteria and that trade-offs will determine which is the best policy option to be implemented.,True,aZwhTpYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513007696,16371533455921636566,/scholar?cites=16371533455921636566,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sylvain_Caurla2/publication/259124304_Stimulating_fuelwood_consumption_through_public_policies_An_assessment_of_economic_and_resource_impacts_based_on_the_French_Forest_Sector_Model/links/5cb8692aa6fdcc1d499d5aec/Stimulating-fuelwood-consumption-through-public-policies-An-assessment-of-economic-and-resource-impacts-based-on-the-French-Forest-Sector-Model.pdf,0,0,0

This paper provides insights into this question by exploring the impacts of (1) a combination of a carbon tax and a fuelwood policy. and (2) a combination of a carbon tax and a sequestration policy on (i) the economy of the forest sector. and (ii) the dynamics of the forest resource. To do this. we used a modified version of the French Forest Sector Model (FFSM) and carried out simulations on a 2020 time horizon.

Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,1c-xODUAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C,469,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

Although. national level emissions provide general guidelines for assessing mitigation alternatives. but significant regional and sectoral variability exist in Indian emissions. Districts reasonably capture this variability to a fine grid as 80% of these districts are smaller than 1°×1° resolution with 60% being smaller than even 1/2°×1/2°. Moreover. districts in India have well-established administrative and institutional mechanisms that would be useful for implementing and monitoring measures.

Over the next decades the increase in rural population in many developing countries will be overshadowed by population flows to cities. Rural populations globally are expected to peak at a level of 3.5 billion people by around 2020 and decline thereafter. albeit with heterogeneous regional trends. This adds urgency in addressing rural energy access. but our common future will be predominantly urban. Most of urban growth will continue to occur in small-to medium-sized urban centers. Growth in these smaller cities poses serious policy challenges. especially in the developing world. In small cities. data and information to guide policy are largely absent. local resources to tackle development challenges are limited. and governance and institutional capacities are weak. requiring serious efforts in capacity building. novel applications of remote sensing. information. and decision support techniques. and new institutional partnerships. While'megacities' with more than 10 million inhabitants have distinctive challenges. their contribution to global urban growth will remain comparatively small.Energy-wise. the world is already predominantly urban.

Arlington. VA (United States),Greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries will likely surpass those from developed countries within the first half of this century. highlighting the need for developing country efforts to reduce the risk of climate change. While developing nations have been reluctant to accept binding emissions targets. asking that richer nations take action first. many are undertaking efforts that have significantly reduced the growth of their own greenhouse gas emissions. In most cases. climate mitigation is not the goal. but rather an outgrowth of efforts driven by economic. security. or local environmental concerns. This study attempts to document the climate mitigation resulting from such efforts in six key countries (Brazil. China. India. Mexico. South Africa. and Turkey) and to inform policy-making aimed at further mitigation in these and other developing nations. The six countries examined here reflect significant regional. economic. demographic. and energy resource diversity. They include the world's two most populous nations. a major oil exporter. Africa's largest greenhouse gas emitter. and the country with the largest expanse of tropical forest. While their circumstances vary widely. these countries share common concerns that have motivated actions resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions growth. Primary among these concerns are economic growth. energy security. and improved air quality. The analysis presented here demonstrates that actions taken by these countries to achieve these and other goals have reduced the growth of their combined annual greenhouse gas emissions over the past three decades by nearly 300 million tons a year.

Using domestic coal mitigates national energy security risks. However coal use exacerbates global climate change. Under a strict climate change regime. coal use is projected to decline in future. However this would increase imports of energy sources like natural gas (NG) and nuclear and consequent energy security risks for India. The paper shows that carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) can mitigate CO2 emissions from coal-based large point source (LPS) clusters and therefore would play a key role in mitigating both energy security risks for India and global climate change risks.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol represent important steps in that direction. Yet whether or not the Protocol enters into force. the same fundamental challenge remains: engaging all countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases in a common long-term effort. We need a durable strategy that can take us beyond Kyoto. This Pew Center report looks at core issues in crafting such a strategy. It represents the combined efforts of a dozen authors plus extensive input from policymakers. experts. and stakeholders who commented on drafts or participated in workshops in China. Germany. and Mexico. The six “think pieces” in this volume do not draw definitive conclusions about the best way forward; those can come only through further analysis and dialogue. Yet there do emerge from the papers. and from the discussions around them. some common themes and insights. First is the realization that while the climate challenge is ultimately one of mobilizing technology. it is in the first instance one of mustering political will. This depends in part on the resourcefulness of governments in fashioning common approaches. It also means not allowing scientific and economic uncertainties to obscure the urgent need for action. Indeed the analyses here conclude that. to the contrary. uncertainty is itself a reason to act now. Second. there is no getting around national interest.

Measurements made during BOMEX show that this Saharan air is characterized by high values of potential temperature. dust and radon-222 which confirm a desert origin.

The average concentration of mineral aerosol within this layer was 61 μg m−3; in contrast. the average concentration in the low‐level air was 22 μg m−3. These dust concentrations are comparable to those found in continental surface air. Because of the presence of a strong inversion at the base of the Saharan layer. sea salt was confined to te lower altitudes where the average concentration was 10 μg m−3.

Each model is compared to observations related to desert dust aerosols. their direct radiative effect. and their impact on the biogeochemical cycle. i.e.. aerosol optical depth (AOD) and dust deposition. Additional comparisons to Angström exponent (AE). coarse mode AOD and dust surface concentrations are included to extend the assessment of model performance and to identify common biases present in models. These data comprise a benchmark dataset that is proposed for model inspection and future dust model development. There are large differences among the global models that simulate the dust cycle and its impact on climate. In general. models simulate the climatology of vertically integrated parameters (AOD and AE) within a factor of two whereas the total deposition and surface concentration are reproduced within a factor of 10. In addition. smaller mean normalized bias and root mean square errors are obtained for the climatology of AOD and AE than for total deposition and surface concentration. Characteristics of the datasets used and their uncertainties may influence these differences. Large uncertainties still exist with respect to the deposition fluxes in the southern oceans. Further measurements and model studies are necessary to assess the general model performance to reproduce dust deposition in ocean regions sensible to iron contributions.

1149391,Minimizing energy losses: Optimal accommodation and smart operation of renewable distributed generation,2010,Luis F Ochoa and Gareth P Harrison,26,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,1,198-205,IEEE,The problem of minimizing losses in distribution networks has traditionally been investigated using a single. deterministic demand level. This has proved to be effective since most approaches are generally able to also result in minimum overall energy losses. However. the increasing penetration of (firm and variable) distributed generation (DG) raises concerns on the actual benefits of loss minimization studies that are limited to a single demand/generation scenario.

One means of dealing with such complexity is through the use of indices that indicate the benefit or otherwise of connections at a given location and which could be used to shape the nature of the contract between the utility and distributed generator.

The increase in the penetration of wind generation in recent years has led to a number of challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. A key metric for generation system adequacy is the capacity value of generation. The capacity value of a generator is the contribution that a given generator makes to generation system adequacy. The variable and stochastic nature of wind sets it apart from conventional energy sources. As a result. the modeling of wind generation in the same manner as conventional generation for capacity value calculations is inappropriate.

In this context. active management of the network. i.e.. the integration of assets and network participants through the real-time use of control and communication systems. will play a major role. This paper proposes a multi-period steady-state analysis for maximising the connection of intermittent distributed generation through an optimal power flow-based technique adapted for active network management. A medium voltage distribution network is analysed considering different loading levels and discretised wind power outputs over a year. Results are presented and discussed.

A closed-form expression for the effective load carrying capability or equivalent firm capacity of a small additional capacity is derived. This depends on the mean and variance of the distribution of available additional generation capacity. and the shape of the distribution of the difference between available existing capacity and demand. near zero margin. The theory extends naturally to the case where the pre-existing background and additional resource are not statistically independent.The theory may be used to explain and confirm the generality of various well-known properties of capacity value results. as is illustrated using Great Britain examples.

A problem of such scale however cannot be managed in a centralized manner in its full detail. This paper examines the idea of a decentralized approach in clearing the energy market. A general framework for the problem decomposition and its distributed solution is presented and analyzed.

This is of particular importance for wind generation. whose available capacity depends primarily on physical resource availability as opposed to mechanical availability; as a result. and differently from conventional generation. it is possible for the total available output of a system's wind generation to be very close to zero. This paper reviews different methods for calculating capacity credits. and discusses the important considerations for a realistic calculation with reference to a new Great Britain study.

The key finding is that the effective load carrying capability is very low as a percentage of installed capacity (less than 10% for the example presented here). This is because of the high probability of having zero available output at time of peak demand. if peak demand occurs on the wrong part of the tidal cycle; this result may be explained transparently using a simple two-state model of the barrage.

Here. a local control technique is proposed whereby individual electric vehicle charging units attempt to maximise their own charging rate for their vehicle while maintaining local network conditions within acceptable limits. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the benefits of the technique on a test distribution network. The results of the method are also compared to those from a centralized control method whereby EV charging is controlled by a central controller.

1149501,Rotor angle stability with high penetrations of wind generation,2011,Eknath Vittal and Mark O'Malley and Andrew Keane,27,IEEE transactions on Power Systems,1,353-362,IEEE,This paper explores the relationship between wind generation. particularly the control of reactive power from variable speed wind turbine generators. and the rotor angle stability of the conventional synchronous generators in the system. Rotor angle stability is a dynamic phenomenon generally associated with changes in active power flows that create angular separation between synchronous units in the system. With larger penetrations of wind generation being introduced into power systems. there will be large flows of active power from asynchronous generation in the system. These asynchronous active power flows can aid in maintaining the rotor angle stability of the system. However. the manner in which wind generation injects reactive power into the system can be critical in maintaining angular stability of the synchronous units.

In rural areas. voltage rise limits the permissible penetration levels of DG. Another increasingly important issue is the impact on transmission system voltages of DG reactive power demand. Here. a passive solution is proposed to reduce the impact on the transmission system voltages and overcome the distribution voltage rise barrier such that more DG can connect. The fixed power factors of the generators and the tap setting of the transmission transformer are determined by a linear programming formulation.

Controlled EV charging is seen as one possibility for reducing. or even eliminating. these issues. The implementation of controlled charging schemes. in particular centralized schemes. can require forecasts of a number of variables. e.g.. household loads. EV availability. and battery requirements.

Alternative work on intelligent distributed voltage and reactive power control of DG has also demonstrated benefits in terms of the minimization of voltage variation and violations as well as the ability to connect larger generators to the distribution network.

Therefore. decarbonising the heating system is essential and an option to achieve this is by heating system electrification through heat pumps (HP) installation in combination with renewable power generation.

1149531,Hybrid control of distributed generators connected to weak rural networks to mitigate voltage variation,2003,Aristides E Kiprakis and A Robin Wallace,,CIRED 2003,,12-15,,Distributed generators are normally operated in automatic power factor control. although this can be more difficult in weak areas of the distribution network as they are frequently connected to long open-ended radial feeders. which have low X/R ratios and high resistance. The un-constrained bidirectional power flow may cause unacceptable voltage fluctuations that would cause generator or other system protection to operate. Operating the generator in constant voltage mode is only occasionally acceptable to distribution network operators. since an unconstrained machine may attempt to define voltages that conflict with setting of their automatic voltage control equipment.

1149542,Increasing the capacity of distributed generation in electricity networks by intelligent generator control,2005,Aristides E Kiprakis,,KB thesis scanning project 2015,,,The University of Edinburgh,The rise of environmental awareness as well as the unstable global fossil fuel market has brought about government initiatives to increase electricity generation from renewable energy sources. These resources tend to be geographically and electrically remote from load centres. Consequently many Distributed Generators (DGs) are expected to be connected to the existing Distribution Networks (DNs). which have high impedance and low X/R ratios.Intermittence and unpredictability of the various types of renewable energy sources can be of time scales of days (hydro) down to seconds (wind. wave). As the time scale becomes smaller. the output of the DG becomes more difficult to accommodate in the DN. With the DGs operating in constant power factor mode. intermittence of the output of the generator combined with the high impedance and low X/R ratios of the DN will cause voltage variations above the statutory limits for quality of supply. This is traditionally mitigated by accepting increased operation of automated network control or network reinforcement. However. due to the distributed nature of RES. automating or reinforcing the DN can be expensive and difficult solutions to implement.

1149543,A new era for mini hydro?,2002,Gareth P Harrison and Aristides E Kiprakis and A Robin Wallace,54,International Water Power and Dam Construction,11,20-4,,Privately-owned distributed generation (DG) is fast replacing state-owned centralised generation in many liberalised electricity markets around the world. The EU Renewables Directive and national incentives such as the UK Renewables Obligation are encouraging the development of renewable energy resources including mini-hydro. Mini-hydro resources are commonly found in areas with low population and load densities and the capacities of potential new plant means that they will connect to medium or low voltage distribution networks. Historically. the distribution networks in these areas were designed to supply demand that tended to reduce with distance from the transmission system and were operated passively to ensure that the quality of electricity supplied to customers was within statutory limits.Connection of DG can fundamentally alter the operation of distribution networks. Where DG capacity is comparable to or larger than local demand there are likely to be observable impacts on network power flows and voltage regulation. New connections of DG must be evaluated to identify and quantify any adverse impact on the security and quality of local electricity supplies. While a range of options exist to mitigate adverse impacts. under current commercial arrangements the developer will largely bear the financial responsibility for their implementation. The economic implications can make potential schemes less attractive and have restricted the development of mini-hydro generation in liberalised markets.,True,2mhdTZ4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gareth_Harrison/publication/292405174_A_new_era_for_mini_hydro/links/56b207df08ae795dd5c79668/A-new-era-for-mini-hydro.pdf,4389281370728615843,/scholar?cites=4389281370728615843,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gareth_Harrison/publication/292405174_A_new_era_for_mini_hydro/links/56b207df08ae795dd5c79668/A-new-era-for-mini-hydro.pdf,0,0,0

The tracing methodology is based on the assumption that. at any network node. the incoming flows are proportionally distributed among the outcoming flows. This assumption can be neither proved nor disproved physically and the authors aim to rationalise it. The analysis presented here is of the loss allocation problem. First it is shown that the proportionality assumption leads to the cost allocation which is aggregation invariant.

In this paper. the IEEE PES working group on cascading failure reviews and synthesizes how benchmarking and validation can be done for cascading failure analysis. summarizes and reviews the cascading test cases that are available to the international community. and makes recommendations for improving the state of the art.,True,LqpwWYAAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,96,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7404289/,5661575866482198063,/scholar?cites=5661575866482198063,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/59/4374138/07404289.pdf,0,0,0

Two control structures are presented: a hierarchical structure In which the AVR is the master controller and the PSS the slave controller and a traditional structure in which the PSS constitutes a supplementary loop to the main AVR. Both controllers are shown to be robust. as the damping they introduce into the system is insensitive to changes in both the system topology/parameters and the pattern of network flows. Each individual controller contributes positively to the overall system damping with no undesirable interaction between controllers. These features should allow a decentralized approach to the design of the AVR+PSS.

1149567,Why has it happened again? Comparison between the UCTE blackout in 2006 and the blackouts of 2003,2007,Janusz W Bialek,,,,51-56,IEEE,The paper starts with an overview of. and comparison between. the UCTE blackout of 2006 and year 2003 blackouts in the US and Italy. The main conclusion of the paper is that the European utilities have not really learned the lessons from the blackouts of 2003. Increased liberalisation of electricity supply industry has resulted in a significant increase in inter-area (or cross-border) trades which often are not properly accounted for when assessing system security. The traditional decentralised way of operating systems by TSOs. with each TSO looking after its own control area and little information exchange. resulted in inadequate and slow response to contingencies. A new mode of coordinated operation for real-time security assessment and control is needed in order to maintain system security.

The assessment is performed by maximizing the total generation capacity in an optimal power flow model; this is solved by gradually adding limited numbers of line outage contingencies. until a solution to the complete problem is obtained. The limit on the number of contingencies added is key to the method's efficiency. as it reduces the size of the optimization problems encountered. Moreover. varying this limit on contingencies added provides a simple and highly efficient means of searching for multiple local optima of the nonlinear optimization problem.

Currently. it is approximated as the average emissions of the whole system. despite an acknowledgement that wind will actually displace only the generators operating on the margin. This article presents a methodology to isolate the marginal emissions displacement of wind power from historical empirical data. taking into account the impact on the operating efficiency of coal and CCGT plants. For Great Britain over 2009–2014. it was found that marginal emissions displacement has generally been underestimated with. for example. the emissions displacement factor for wind being 21% higher than that the average emissions factor in 2010.

1149578,Carbon and energy payback of variable renewable generation,2014,Rachel Camilla Thomson,,,,,,The continued drive to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in order to mitigate climate change has led to an increase in demand for low-carbon energy sources. and the development of new technologies to harness the available energy in the wind. waves and tides. Many controversies surround these technologies. however. particularly with regards to their economic cost. environmental impacts and the implications of the variability of their output for security of the electricity supply. In order to make informed policy decisions on future developments of the electricity system. it is necessary to address these controversies and confirm the environmental. economic and social sustainability of these new renewable generators. This thesis specifically examines two key issues: whether new variable-output renewable energy generators actually deliver a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetimes. and whether they produce a viable energy return on energy investment. Although renewable energy sources are themselves ‘carbon free’. GHG emissions (and energy consumption) occur during the construction. maintenance and decommissioning of the generator infrastructure required to convert this energy into electricity. Furthermore. the variability of the output power from such generators has implications for the operation of the grid - there may be a requirement for additional reserve capacity and the increased part-loading of conventional plant is likely to reduce its operating efficiency. Carbon and energy paybacks are measures of the time required for a new renewable installation to offset these life cycle impacts.

1149593,Optimal power flow for maximizing network benefits from demand-side management,2014,Barry Hayes and Ignacio Hernando-Gil and Adam Collin and Gareth Harrison and Sasa Djokic,29,IEEE Trans. Power Syst,4,1739-1747,,This paper applies optimal power flow (OPF) to evaluate and maximize network benefits of demand-side management (DSM). The benefits are quantified in terms of the ability of demand-responsive loads to relieve upstream network constraints and provide ancillary services. such as operating reserve. The study incorporates detailed information on the load structure and composition. and allows the potential network benefits. which could be obtained through management of different load types. to be quantified and compared. It is demonstrated that the actual network location of demand-manageable load has an important influence on the effectiveness of the applied DSM scheme. since the characteristics of the loads and their interconnecting networks vary from one location to another.

With driving voltages less than 15 V it is believed to be the lowest reported driving voltage for any material system compatible with post-processing on completed integrated circuits wafers. The process architecture uses anodically grown tantalum pentoxide as a pinhole free high dielectric constant insulator with an overlying 16 nm layer of Teflon-AF®. which provides the hydrophobic surface for droplets manipulation. This stack provides a very robust dielectric. which maintains a sufficiently high capacitance per unit area for effective operation at a reduced voltage (15 V) which is more compatible with standard CMOS technology.

These devices usually draw non-linear current and are. therefore. significant sources of harmonics. Although it is well known that the presence of harmonics will result in negative effects (e.g. higher thermal stresses and overloading. or increased neutral conductor currents). the assessment of the actual harmonic levels is not a simple task. Harmonic emission of individual SMPS loads will vary based on the differences in their circuits and operating conditions. As a consequence. these variations result in the cancellation of the same-order harmonics (due to phase angle dispersion). which is analysed in detail in this paper.
