We determined the active site for hydrogen evolution. a reaction catalyzed by precious metals. on nanoparticulate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) by atomically resolving the surface of this catalyst before measuring electrochemical activity in solution.

Developing sustainable. fossil-free pathways to produce fuels and chemicals of global importance could play a major role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions while providing the feedstocks needed to make the products we use on a daily basis. One prospective goal is to develop electrochemical conversion processes that can convert molecules in the atmosphere (e.g.. water. carbon dioxide. and nitrogen) into higher-value products (e.g.. hydrogen. hydrocarbons. oxygenates. and ammonia) by coupling to renewable energy. Electrocatalysts play a key role in these energy conversion technologies because they increase the rate. efficiency. and selectivity of the chemical transformations involved.

As H2 is considered as a future energy carrier. the need for these catalysts will increase and alternatives to the scarce and expensive Pt group catalysts will be needed. We analyze the ability of different metal surfaces and of the enzymes nitrogenase and hydrogenase to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction and find a necessary criterion for high catalytic activity. The necessary criterion is that the binding free energy of atomic hydrogen to the catalyst is close to zero. The criterion enables us to search for new catalysts. and inspired by the nitrogenase active site. we find that MoS2 nanoparticles supported on graphite are a promising catalyst.

We found that this process is highly structure-sensitive and also is sensitive to the presence of hydrogen: Under ultra-high vacuum. with no hydrogen present. the dissociation proceeds through a direct route in which only undercoordinated sites (e.g.. steps) are active.

In this work. we show that a sputtered 100 nm TiO2 layer on top of a thin Ti metal layer may be used to protect an n+p Si photocathode during photocatalytic H2 evolution. Although TiO2 is a semiconductor. we show that it behaves like a metallic conductor would under photocathodic H2 evolution conditions. This behavior is due to the fortunate alignment of the TiO2 conduction band with respect to the hydrogen evolution potential. which allows it to conduct electrons from the Si while simultaneously protecting the Si from surface passivation. By using a Pt catalyst the electrode achieves an H2 evolution onset of 520 mV vs NHE and a Tafel slope of 30 mV when illuminated by the red part (λ > 635 nm) of the AM 1.5 spectrum.

However. path integral simulations have traditionally required a computational cost around two orders of magnitude greater than treating the nuclei classically. making them prohibitively costly for most applications.

This situation provides a challenge to theoretical investigation since most approaches are accurate only when a certain energetic parameter is small compared to others in the problem. Here we show that in these difficult regimes. the Ehrenfest approach provides a good starting point for a dynamical description of the energy transfer process due to its ability to accurately treat coupling to slow environmental modes.

However. in practice. the largest outer time step possible is limited not by the physical forces but by resonances between the fast and slow modes. In this paper we show that this problem can be alleviated by using a simple colored noise thermostatting scheme which selectively targets the high frequency modes in the system. For two sample problems. flexible water and solvated alanine dipeptide. we demonstrate that this allows the use of large outer time steps while still obtaining accurate sampling and minimizing the perturbation of the dynamics.

The formalism is based on the partitioning of a system's environment into “core” and “reservoir” modes with the former to be treated quantum mechanically and the latter classically. The presented method only requires the calculation of the system's reduced density matrix averaged over the quantum core degrees of freedom which is then coupled to a classically evolved reservoir to treat the remaining modes. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the spin-boson problem using the noninteracting blip approximation to treat the system and core. and Ehrenfest dynamics to treat the reservoir. The resulting hybrid methodology is accurate for both fast and slow baths. since it naturally reduces to its composite methods in their respective regimes of validity.

It is however possible to improve on this estimate by decomposing the potential into a sum of slowly and rapidly varying contributions. If the slowly varying contribution changes only slightly over the length scale of the ring polymer. it can be evaluated on a contracted ring polymer with fewer than the full n beads (or equivalently on a lower order Fourier decomposition of the imaginary time path). Here we develop and test this idea for systems with polarizable force fields. The development consists of iterating the induction on the contracted ring polymer and applying an appropriate transformation to obtain the forces on the original n beads.

The proximity of a counterion to a charged catalyst in an ion paired complex gives rise to strong electrostatic interactions that could be used to energetically differentiate transition states. Here we investigate the effects of ion pairing on the regioselectivity of the hydroarylation of 3-substituted phenyl propargyl ethers catalyzed by cationic Au(I) complexes. which forms a mixture of 5- and 7-substituted 2H-chromenes. We show that changing the solvent dielectric to enforce ion pairing to a SbF6– counterion changes the regioselectivity by up to a factor of 12 depending on the substrate structure.

The resulting mean field generalized quantum master equation (MF-GQME) approach is a non-perturbative and non-Markovian theory to treat open quantum systems without any restrictions on the form of the Hamiltonian that it can be applied to. By studying relaxation dynamics in a wide range of dynamical regimes. typical of charge and energy transfer. we show that MF-GQME provides a much higher accuracy than a direct application of mean field theory. In addition. these increases in accuracy are accompanied by computational speed-ups of between one and two orders of magnitude that become larger as the system becomes more nonadiabatic.

This work has shown that protein reorganization energies are sensitive to the medium surrounding the redox sites and that an aqueous environment. in particular. leads to large reorganization energies.

1122630,Ligand substitution processes,1966,Cooper H Langford and Harry B Gray,,,,,WA Benjamin. inc.,From the preface:   The subject of the mechanistic study of ligand substitution reactions is currently undergoing an exciting growth. New fast-reaction techniques have removed the upper limit on rates that can be measured. and extension to less familiar central metal atoms has begun in earnest. This might seem the wrong moment for review of the field. As yet. definitive treatment is possible only for those complexes involving monodentate ligands with cobalt(III) and platinurn(II). But. because information is so extensive for these systems. it is clear that they are functioning as models from which concepts and experiments are generated for application over the fast-growing range of the subject. We believe that this is an important moment to reopen debate on fundamentals so that concepts will be most felicitously formulated to aid growth of understanding. This monograph is centrally concerned with three aspects of those fundamentals.   We have attempted to develop an approach to classification of ligand substitution reactions that is adapted to what seem to have emerged as the characteristic features of these reactions and is susceptible to operational tests. (We do recognize that any such scheme of ideas is necessarily obsolescent once it is formulated since new experiments will certainly follow immediately.) We have tried to evaluate the basis for making generalizations about ligand substitution processes and to formulate tests to show whether new reactions fall within familiar patterns. Finally. we have sought to base the models of ligand substitution processes in the language of molecular-orbital theory.

1122631,Molecular orbital theory: an introductory lecture note and reprint volume,1965,Carl A Ballhausen and Harry B Gray,,,,,WA Benjamin. Inc.,These notes are based on lectures on molecular orbital theory that we have presented at the University of Copenhagen and Columbia University. They were designed primarily for advanced-undergraduate and first-year graduate students as an introduction to molecular orbital theory.   It is apparent that the molecular orbital theory is a very useful method of classifying the ground and excited states of small molecules. The transition metal complexes occupy a special place here. and the last chapter is devoted entirely to this subject. We believe that modern inorganic chemists should be acquainted with the methods of the theory. and that they will find approximate one-electron calculations as helpful as the organic chemists have found simple Hückel calculations. For this reason. we have included a calculation of the permanganate ion in Chapter 8. On the other hand. we have not considered conjugated pi systems because they are excellently discussed in a number of books.   Our intuitive approach in the use of symmetry methods is admittedly nonrigorous and therefore will be unsatisfactory to purists. but we believe this is the best way to introduce symmetry ideas to the majority of students. Once the student has learned how to use symmetry methods. it will be easier for him to appreciate more formal and rigorous treatments.   Several reprints of papers on molecular orbital theory are included in the back of the book. The papers treat a substantial number of the important molecular geometries.

However. DCM slowly reacts with pyridine and a variety of other representative pyridine derivatives to form methylenebispyridinium dichloride compounds under ambient conditions. The proposed mechanism (two consecutive SN2 reactions) was studied by evaluating the kinetics of the reaction between 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine and DCM.

1122742,Ternary Hybrid Nanoparticle Isomers: Directing the Nucleation of Ag on Pt–Fe3O4 Using a Solid-State Protecting Group,2014,James M Hodges and Adam J Biacchi and Raymond E Schaak,8,ACS nano,1,1047-1055,American Chemical Society,Colloidal hybrid nanoparticles are an important class of materials that incorporate multiple nanoparticles into a single system through solid-state interfaces. which can result in multifunctionality and the emergence of synergistic properties not found in the individual components. These hybrid structures are typically produced using seeded-growth methods. where preformed nanoparticles serve as seeds onto which additional domains are added through subsequent reactions. For hybrid nanoparticles that contain more than two domains. multiple configurations with distinct connectivities and functionalities are possible. and these can be considered as nanoparticle analogues of molecular isomers. However. accessing one isomer relative to others in the same hybrid nanoparticle system is challenging. particularly when the formation of a target isomer is disfavored relative to more stable or synthetically accessible …,True,2MlHdxEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,32,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn405943z,2634923644770212696,/scholar?cites=2634923644770212696,,,0,0,0

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent an alternative group of 2D layered materials that differ from the semimetallic character of graphene.

Here. we use two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology in head-fixed walking flies to identify a different neural population that conjunctively encodes heading and angular velocity. and is excited selectively by turns in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. We show how these mirror-symmetric turn responses combine with the neurons’ connectivity to the compass neurons to create an elegant mechanism for updating the fly’s heading representation when the animal turns in darkness.

However. this model did not take into account the optical properties of a wire array device - in particular the inherently low packing fraction of wires within CVD-grown wire arrays. which might limit their ability to fully absorb incident sunlight. For this reason. we have combined a device physics model of Si wire solar cells with FDTD simulations of light absorption within wire arrays to investigate the potential photovoltaic efficiency of this cell geometry.

D.C. every spring to see the cherry trees blossom. Once in the city. they must find their way to the Tidal Basin where the Japanese trees grow. Fortunately. a number of visual landmarks can help them to navigate. In 1910. the United States Congress passed The Height of Buildings Act. limiting the elevation of commercial and residential structures in D.C. to 130 feet. Thus. the 555-foot-tall Washington Monument often looms large against the horizon. serving as an anchor point to help set the tourists’ sense of direction. Once their heading is set. they can lose sight of the monument behind buildings or groups of tall Scandinavian visitors and still use their internal compass to navigate to the Basin.

The mechanism of these reactions and the precise role of O2 in particular remains unclear. Herein. we test the hypothesis that thermochemical aerobic oxidation proceeds via two coupled electrochemical half-reactions for oxygen reduction and substrate oxidation. We collect electrochemical and thermochemical data on common noble metal catalysts under identical reaction/transport environments. and nd that the electrochemical polarization curves of the O2 reduction and the substrate oxidation half-reaction closely predict the mixed potential of the catalyst measured in operando during thermochemical catalysis across 13 diverse variables spanning reaction conditions. catalyst composition. reactant identity. and pH. Additionally. we nd that driving the oxidation half-reaction reaction electrochemically in the absence of O2 at the mixed potential leads to very similar rates and selectivities as for the thermochemical reaction in all cases examined. These ndings strongly indicate that the role of O2 in thermochemical aerobic oxidation is solely as an electron scavenger that provides an incipient electrochemical driving force for substrate oxidation.

AND THIOL FUNCTIONALIZATION OF METAL DICHALCOGENIDES,2018,Ryan Patrick Bisbey,,,,,,The study of organic chemistry has enabled remarkable control in the design of zerodimensional molecules and one-dimensional polymers. New methods to control polymerization and assembly in higher dimensions are now being demonstrated. Here we highlight the use of a new class of polymeric materials called covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to obtain and rationally design higher dimensional structures (Chapter 1). Traditional polymer syntheses. isolation. and processing technique are not often well suited or optimized for these materials yet. We investigate the advantages afforded the synthesis of these material as crystalline and oriented thin films on substrates from a flowed solution (Chapter 2). The ability to rationally-design these materials for specific applications is also investigated. We design and synthesize firstgeneration materials for photon upconversion in COFs and refine the design criteria for second generation material (Chapter 3). Lastly. we turn to the functionalization of the surface of single layers of 2D materials. While functionalization of interfaces is not a new field. the remarkable properties of single layer 2D materials has expanded the scope of this field to these fundamentally inert interfaces. New chemistry to functionalize these surfaces. specifically metal dichalcogenides. is considered (Chapter 4).,True,l31flKYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/59274,,,,,0,0,0

The smaller rate constant was attributed to the one-electron nature of excited-state injection that was charge-balanced by a monovalent cation and not by a divalent cation.

In this adaptive law the output error plays a dual role in the adjustment of the control parameter vector. The advantages of using the adaptive law over others proposed in the literature are discussed. In the ideal case the adaptive system has bounded solutions; in addition. the origin of the error equations is exponentially stable when the reference input is persistently exciting and has a sufficiently large amplitude. The adaptive system is also shown to be robust under bounded external disturbances. Finally. it is shown that. by suitably modifying the adaptive law. the overall system can be made robust in the presence of a class of unmodeled dynamics of the plant.

An adaptive Smith controller together with an adaptive law similar to the delay-free case is proposed. By using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals for an appropriate model transformation of the original system. semiglobal stability of the closed-loop system and asymptotic convergence of the output error is established. Strict positive realness together with the low relative degree of the plant is exploited to establish the stability properties.

Parametric studies. based on local stability analysis of a family of time-average velocity profiles modeling those observed in recirculating flows. show that the frequency of the absolute mode is determined primarily by the shear layer thickness. and the growth rate of the absolute mode is controlled by the amount of backflow. Given the known streamwise variation of the local velocity profile in the actual flow. this implies that the oscillations are likely to be generated at the middle of the recirculation zone. where the backflow is sufficiently strong. and shear layer thickness is comparable to the step height.

In this paper. we quantify both the transient performance in the classical adaptive systems and their improvement with CRMs. In addition to deriving bounds on L-2 norms of the derivatives of the adaptive parameters that are shown to be smaller. an optimal design of CRMs is proposed that minimizes an underlying peaking phenomenon.

In many cases. the flame is stabilized in the separating shear layer near the centerbody or abrupt expansion. where the high-speed nozzle flow transitions into the larger combustor. Several prior studies have shown that the flame position becomes increasingly unsteady as it approaches blowoff. due to local extinction and reattachment of the flame at one or both of these locations. This is apparently due to the local strain rate irregularly oscillating about the extinction strain rate values near the attachment point. In order to characterize these flame strain characteristics. particle image velocimetry measurements were obtained of several hydrogen/methane mixtures in this attachment region.

1123134,Dynamics of bluff body flames near blowoff,2007,Tim Lieuwen and Santosh Shanbhogue and Sachin Khosla and Clifford Smith,,,,169,,This paper compiles a number of experimental and computational results on the dynamics of bluff body stabilized flames and proposes a phenomenological explanation of the blowoff process. This work is motivated by observations that flames near blowoff exhibit a variety of transient characteristics. We believe that this unsteadiness is not simply a result of the flame’s proximity to blowoff. but also an important contributor to the processes ultimately leading to blowoff. As such. if this hypothesis is correct. then understanding and predicting blowoff requires a treatment of these dynamical processes. Moreover. it implies that classic blowoff explanations relying on purely steady state characteristics of the flow. such as a characteristic residence time and chemical time. are necessarily incomplete. We propose that the two key processes driving blowoff are the presence of vortex shedding in the wake of the bluff body and …,True,oY31AqwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,55,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2007-169,843514147745448667,/scholar?cites=843514147745448667,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Lieuwen/publication/267778279_Dynamics_of_Bluff_Body_Flames_Near_Blowoff/links/5530fb920cf20ea0a06fcd30/Dynamics-of-Bluff-Body-Flames-Near-Blowoff.pdf,0,0,0

Vortices/convective-structures play a dominant role in perturbing the flame during these combustion instabilities. This thesis addresses a number of issues related to the origin. evolution and the interaction of these structures with the flame.  The first part of this thesis reviews the fluid mechanics of non-reacting and reacting bluff body flows.  The second part describes the spatio/temporal characteristics of bluff-body flames responding to excitation. The key processes controlling the flame response have been identified as 1) the anchoring of the flame at the bluff body. 2) the excitation of flame-front wrinkles by the oscillating velocity field and 3) flame propagation normal to itself at the local flame speed. The first two processes control the growth of the flame response and the last process controls the decay.  The third part of this thesis describes the effect of acoustic excitation on the velocity field of reacting bluff body flows. Acoustic disturbances excite the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of the reacting shear layer. This leads to a spatially decaying vorticity field downstream of the bluff body in the shear layers. The length over which the decay occurs was shown to scale with the length of the recirculation zone of the bluff body. i.e. the length over which the velocity profile transitions from shear layer to wake.  The flame influences this decay process in two ways.  Gas expansion across the flame reduces the extent of shear by reducing the magnitude of negative velocities within the …,True,oY31AqwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,17,https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/24823,15277829942048205292,/scholar?cites=15277829942048205292,,https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/24823/shanbhogue_santosh_j_200808_phd.pdf?origin%3Dpublication_detail%26sequence%3D1,0,0,0

The heat-release dynamics their coupling and the injection dynamics. A heat-release model with fluctuations in the flame surface area as well as in the equivalence ratio is derived.

Injection at i the burning zone and ii further upstream is considered. The characteristics of fuel injectors including bandwidth. authority pulsed-fuel flow rate. and whether it applies a proportional or a two-position on-off injection are discussed.

Stochastic collocation methods. based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). are used to construct a polynomial approximation of the forward solution over the support of the prior distribution. This approximation then defines a surrogate posterior probability density that can be evaluated repeatedly at minimal computational cost. The ability to simulate a large number of samples from the posterior distribution results in very accurate estimates of the inverse solution and its associated uncertainty. Combined with high accuracy of the gPC-based forward solver. the new algorithm can provide great efficiency in practical applications. A rigorous error analysis of the algorithm is conducted. where we establish convergence of the approximate posterior to the true posterior and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate. It is proved that fast (exponential) convergence of the gPC forward solution yields similarly fast (exponential) convergence of the posterior.

High computational cost arises in several ways. First. thousands or millions of forward simulations may be required to evaluate estimators of interest or to characterize a posterior distribution. In the large-scale setting. performing so many forward simulations is often computationally intractable. Second. sampling may be complicated by the large dimensionality of the input space--as when the inputs are fields represented with spatial discretizations of high dimension--and by nonlinear forward dynamics that lead to multimodal. skewed. and/or strongly correlated posteriors. In this chapter. we present an overview of surrogate and reduced order modeling methods that address these computational challenges.

This leads to long runtimes if the model is expensive to evaluate. Importance sampling is one approach that can lead to a reduction in the number of model evaluations. Importance sampling uses a biasing distribution to sample the model more efficiently. but generating such a biasing distribution can be difficult and usually also requires model evaluations. A different strategy to speed up Monte Carlo sampling is to replace the computationally expensive high-fidelity model with a computationally cheap surrogate model; however. because the surrogate model outputs are only approximations of the high-fidelity model outputs. the estimate obtained using a surrogate model is in general biased with respect to the estimate obtained using the high-fidelity model.

When these evaluations are computationally intensive. approximations of the forward model are essential to accelerating sample-based inference. Yet the construction of globally accurate approximations for nonlinear forward models can be computationally prohibitive and in fact unnecessary. as the posterior distribution typically concentrates on a small fraction of the support of the prior distribution.

This work introduces new algorithms. based on k-means clustering. for partitioning parallel hierarchical N-body interactions. We demonstrate that the number of particle–cluster interactions and the order at which they are performed are directly affected by partition geometry.

In the context of statistics and machine learning. these transformations can be used to couple a tractable “reference” measure (eg. a standard Gaussian) with a target measure of interest. Direct simulation from the desired measure can then be achieved by pushing forward reference samples through the map. Yet characterizing such a map—eg. representing and evaluating it—grows challenging in high dimensions. The central contribution of this paper is to establish a link between the Markov properties of the target measure and the existence of low-dimensional couplings. induced by transport maps that are sparse and/or decomposable. Our analysis not only facilitates the construction of transformations in high-dimensional settings. but also suggests new inference methodologies for continuous non-Gaussian graphical models. For instance. in the context of nonlinear state-space models. we describe new variational algorithms for filtering. smoothing. and sequential parameter inference.

The velocity is obtained by summing the contribution of individual elements using the Biot-Savart law desingularized according to the vorticity cores. Vortex elements are transported in Lagrangian coordinates. and vorticity is redistributed. when necessary. among larger number of elements arranged along its direction.

A simplified physical model is used that combines a two-dimensional diffusion equation for the atomic concentration with a quasi-one-dimensional form of the energy equation which accounts for the melting of the reactants and products. The model thus generalizes previous formulations which have ignored melting effects. The computations are used to predict the evolution of self-propagating fronts in Ni/Al foils. and analyze the dependence of these fronts on the foil parameters.

For a given material system. higher applied joining pressure enhances the flow of the molten solder and thus improves wetting and bonding. Shear strengths of the reactive joints are shown to increase as the pressure that is applied during joining rises to a critical value. At higher applied pressures joint shear strengths remain relatively constant. The critical applied joining pressure is shown to be dependent on the foil thickness (or total heat of reaction). and the properties of the solder material and components. which determine the duration of melting of the solder and the maximum temperature at the solder/component interface.

Phys.,,424–451,,A low Mach-number compressible flow model for the simulation of acoustically driven flow in a thermoacoustic stack is constructed. The model is based on the assumption that the acoustic wavelength is much larger than the characteristic hydrodynamic lengthscale. Thus. a simplified description of the flow is obtained which still retains the essential features of acoustically induced velocity oscillations near solid boundaries. A vorticity-based formulation of the governing equation is derived which relies on the Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity vector into irrotational and divergence-free components.

The multi‐resolution scheme is based on representation of the uncertain concentration in terms of compact polynomial multi‐wavelets. allowing for the control of the convergence in terms of polynomial order and resolution level. The resulting representation is shown to greatly improve the robustness of the Galerkin procedure in presence of steep dependences.

Gasification-assisted attrition is a phenomenon whereby heterogeneous reactions progressively weaken a char’s structure throughout its lifetime leading to enhanced attrition and the production of a significant fraction of fines that exit the reactor unconverted. While this effect has been observed and measured experimentally. few models have been developed to quantitatively account for it. particularly for biomass chars. In this study. a transient gasification and combustion particle model is presented to describe primary fragmentation. attrition. and heterogeneous reactions of a single batch of particles.

Fluidized bed reactors are utilized for solid to gas conversion processes due to their ability to provide a high degree of gas–solid contact. fast solid–solid mixing and fast gas mixing within the bed-zone due to solids-induced flow. In many reactor models of fluidized bed gasifiers this has lead researchers to assume that the bed zone can be modeled as a continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In this work the limitations of this model are analyzed with reactive CFD simulations and an improved reactor network model (RNM) framework based on two-phase theory (TPT) is proposed which is capable of capturing the influence of mixing in the bed-zone on the thermochemical conversion.

1123251,Numerical investigation of the dynamics of unstable lean premixed hydrogen/air flames,2011,Christos Altantzis,,,,,,Premixed flame propagation has been the subject of extensive experimental. theoretical as well as numerical work. concerning both applications and aspects of fundamental interest. The recent progress in computational capabilities has made numerical studies of flames at scales comparable to laboratory experiments feasible. thus increasing their importance in combustion research. Although in most practical applications combustion occurs in a turbulent environment. the study of laminar flames and the transition to corrugated flames is important for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of turbulent flame propagation and the complex flame-flow interactions involved.In the absence of turbulence and gravity. hydrodynamic and thermaldiffusive effects can render laminar premixed flames unstable inducing selfwrinkling and transition to cellularity. Hydrodynamic effects result from the omnipresent density jump across the flame leading to the deflection of the streamlines ahead of a curved flame front. Thermal-diffusive effects stem from the disparity of the diffusion rates of heat away from. and mass towards the flame. thus their action is either stabilizing or destabilizing. depending on the Lewis number. the ratio of thermal to mass diffusivity. of the deficient reactant.,True,MT98ZqoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/43685/2/eth-2919-01.pdf,6690101199874397403,/scholar?cites=6690101199874397403,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/43685/2/eth-2919-01.pdf,0,0,0

The pressure trends are compared with those of laminar flame speed which is historically better studied.

1123296,Impact of fuel and oxidizer composition on premixed flame stabilization in turbulent swirling flows: dynamics and scaling,2016,Soufien Taamallah,,,,,,The world relies on fossil fuels as its main energy source (86.7% in 1973. 81.7% in 2012). Several factors including the abundance of resources and the existing infrastructure suggest that this is likely to continue in the near future (potentially 75% in 2040). Meanwhile climate change continues to be a pressing concern that calls for the development of low CO2 energy systems. Among the most promising approaches are pre-combustion capture technologies. e.g.. coal gasification and natural gas reforming that produce hydrogen-rich fuels. Another approach is oxy-combustion in which air is replaced by a mixture of O2/CO2/H2O as the oxidizer stream. However. modern gas turbines have been optimized to operate on methane-air combustion and several challenges. notably thermo-acoustic instability. arise when using other fuels or oxidizers because of their different thermochemical and transport properties. While these phenomena constitute a major challenge under conventional operations. using hydrogen-rich fuels or CO2-rich oxidizer exacerbates the problem by modifying the combustor stability map in ways that are not well understood. In this thesis. we identify combustion modes most prone to dynamics. predict the onset of thermo-acoustic instability over a wide range of fuel and oxidizer compositions. and define parameters that can scale the data. To this end. a combination of experimental and numerical tools were deployed.

Conventional CLC reactor designs employ two separate reactors. with metal/metal oxide particles circulating pneumatically in-between.

1123351,Characteristics of pressurized oxy-coal combustion under increasing swirl number,2010,L Chen and M Gazzino and AF Ghoniem,,"The 35th international technical conference on clean coal & fuel systems. Clearwater, FL",,,,Oxy-coal combustion is a promising technology for carbon capture in coal-fired power plants. Operating oxy-coal combustion at elevated pressures is expected to improve the thermal efficiency and combustion performance. In this paper. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the flow field and combustion characteristics of a pilot scale coal-water slurry (CWS) oxy-fuel combustor at elevated pressure. The overall flow fields under oxy-fuel and air-fuel conditions are similar. However. significantly lower combustion temperatures and delayed ignition under oxy-fuel condition are observed because of the higher specific heat of CO2 and H2O. The radiation intensity in oxy-fired condition is lower than that in the air-fired condition because of the lower combustion temperature in spite of the higher absorption coefficient of surrounding gases.A further study investigated the swirl number effect on the cold and reacting flow of oxy-coal combustion. Flow patterns significantly change in the cold oxidant stream flow at increasing swirl number (0-0.78): a central jet with a large external recirculation zone and strong re-entrainment dominates at small swirl numbers. while internal recirculation zone forms at higher swirl numbers. Therefore. distinct stabilization mechanisms were observed at small and large swirl numbers. The distributions of temperature. volatiles and carbon monoxide indicate shorter distance between the burner and combustion zone at high swirl number.,True,xMfw4VcAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,27,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed_Ghoniem2/publication/267708018_CHARACTERISTICS_OF_PRESSURIZED_OXY-COAL_COMBUSTION_UNDER_INCREASING_SWIRL_NUMBER/links/549169590cf2d1800d883643.pdf,14930578424954391930,/scholar?cites=14930578424954391930,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed_Ghoniem2/publication/267708018_CHARACTERISTICS_OF_PRESSURIZED_OXY-COAL_COMBUSTION_UNDER_INCREASING_SWIRL_NUMBER/links/549169590cf2d1800d883643.pdf,0,0,0

The focus of this study is to investigate the impact of ϕ on the fluidization hydrodynamics using a fully Eulerian description of the solid and gas phases in 3D cylindrical coordinates.

There are. however. subtle complexities associated with this choice when using the Two-Fluid Model. The center of the grid forms a computational “boundary” and requires special treatment. Conventionally. a free slip no-normal flow condition has been used which does not predict the hydrodynamics accurately even when predicted parameters are in good agreement with measurement. Another difficulty is posed by the extremely small cells near the grid center. especially when simulating small scale experiments. The presence of these small cells raises concerns over the applicability of the Two-Fluid Model and is known to result in slow simulation convergence. These issues are addressed in the present study and appropriate solutions are proposed including the centerline …,True,94xV7mwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,42,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003259101400360X,2475272490324347974,/scholar?cites=2475272490324347974,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/105408/Bakshi2014_PowderTechnology.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Their design and optimization continue to be a challenge; the dependence of mixing dynamics on operating conditions and the impact of the reactor scale are poorly understood. This is compounded by severe limitations on diagnostics in their harsh operating environment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will play a pivotal role in advancing this technology since it enables unrestricted access inside the reactor. enhancing fundamental understanding of several coupled phenomena and their interactions at various scales.

To ensure accuracy. critical submodels accounting for unresolved particle-scale interactions (solids stress tensor. particle-gas drag force and particle-wall slip condition) are identified. and computational efficiency gains are achieved through optimal choice of coordinate system. domain discretization and grid resolution.

1123414,Techno-economic analysis of pressurized oxy-fuel combustion power cycle for CO₂ capture,2009,Jongsup Hong,,,,,,Growing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions have driven extensive research into new power generation cycles that enable carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. In this regard. oxy-fuel combustion is a promising new technology for capturing carbon dioxide in power generation systems utilizing hydrocarbon fuels. Combustion of a fuel in an environment of oxygen and recycled combustion gases yields flue gases consisting predominantly of carbon dioxide and water. To capture carbon dioxide. water is condensed. and carbon dioxide is purified and compressed beyond its supercritical state. However. conventional atmospheric oxy-fuel combustion systems require substantial parasitic energy in the compression step within the air separation unit. a flue gas recirculation system and carbon dioxide purification and compression units. Moreover. a large amount of flue gas latent enthalpy. which has high water concentration. is wasted. Both lower the overall cycle efficiency. Alternatively. pressurized oxy-fuel combustion power cycles have been investigated. In this thesis. the analysis of an oxy-fuel combustion power cycle that utilizes a pressurized coal combustor is reported. We show that this approach is beneficial in terms of larger flue gas thermal energy recovery and smaller parasitic power requirements.

While the crank resolved model required the temporally resolved cylinder pressure. heat release rate. and fuel injection rate histories. the developed MVSM required only parameters available from the engine control unit. Because of this signi cant restriction in available information. the MVSM uses 16 model parameters to describe the combustion and soot formation and oxidation processes. which were determined for each engine and fuel combination using evolutionary algorithms. The parameterized MVSM was capable of calculating the engine out soot emissions in 10 ms per operating point. compared to 5 s required by the crank angle resolved model.,True,SobxzWMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,27,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/151121/1/eth-41665-01.pdf,9232523705020819598,/scholar?cites=9232523705020819598,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/151121/1/eth-41665-01.pdf,0,0,0

The general mechanism by which soot is formed in diesel engines is outlined in Fig. 1 and can be summarized as follows (for further details see Ref.[5] or 6. for example).1.1 PAH Formation. The formation of soot particles begins with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) being formed from the aromatic compounds through the hydrogen abstraction. acetylene addition (HACA) mechanism [7].

1123454,Impact of linear coupling on thermoacoustic instabilities,2008,KS Kedia and SB Nagaraja and RI Sujith,180,Combustion science and technology,9,1588-1612,Taylor & Francis Group,There have been conflicting opinions in literature. about the consequences of ignoring the linear coupling terms in finite-dimensional thermoacoustic models. We try to clarify this issue in this paper. We study consequences of ignoring the linear coupling terms on the non-normal thermoacoustic interactions in a horizontal Rijke tube. In the Galerkin formulation. we use pseudospectra and Henrici index of non-normality to study the impact of linear coupling between the Galerkin modes on the non-normality and the ensuing transient growth. This linear coupling is important for the energy transfer between the eigenmodes of the system (which are not the same as the natural acoustic modes of the duct). Although ignoring this linear coupling results in negligible shift in the eigenfrequencies. it may have serious consequences on the non-normality of the thermoacoustic system and its dynamics.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,The basic aims of parallel programming are to decrease the runtime for the solution to a problem and increase the size of the problem that can be solved. The conventional parallel programming practices involve aa pure OpenMP implementation on a shared memory architecture (Fig. 1) or a pure MPI implementation on distributed memory computer architectures (Fig. 2). The largest and fastest computers today employ both shared and distributed memory architecture (Fig. 3). This gives a flexibility in tuning the parallelism in the programs to generate maximum efficiency and balance the computational and communication loads in the program. A wise implementation of hybrid parallel programs utilizing the modern hybrid computer hardware can generate massive speedups in the otherwise pure MPI and pure OpenMP implementations.

1123457,Numerical simulations of perforated plate stabilized premixed flames with detailed chemistry,2010,Kushal Sharad Kedia,,,,,,The objective of this work is to develop a high efficiency two-dimensional reactive flow solver to investigate perforated-plate stabilized laminar premixed flames. The developed code is used to examine the impact of the operating conditions and the perforated plate design on the steady flame characteristics. It is also used to numerically investigate the response of these flames to imposed inlet velocity perturbations. The two-dimensional simulations are performed using a reduced chemical kinetics mechanism for methane-air combustion. consisting of 20 species and 79 reactions. Heat exchange is allowed between the gas mixture and the solid plate. The physical model is based on a zero-Mach-number formulation of the axi-symmetric compressible conservation equations. The steady results suggest that the flame consumption speed. the flame structure. and the flame surface area depend significantly on the equivalence ratio. mean inlet velocity. the distance between the perforated plate holes and the plate thermal conductivity. In the case of an adiabatic plate. a conical flame is formed. anchored near the corner of the hole. When the heat exchange between the mixture and the plate is finite. the flame acquires a Gaussian shape stabilizing at a stand-off distance. that grows with the plate conductivity. The flame tip is negatively curved; i.e. concave with respect to the reactants.

1123458,Effect of Compressibility Corrections to Turbulence Models Applied to a Hypersonic Re-entry Configuration,2006,Kushal S Kedia and Krishnendu Sinha,,,,,,Computation of high-speed turbulent flows using conventional turbulence models developed for incompressible flows can lead to significant errors. This is especially true for high-speed vehicles where the Mach number ranges from low subsonic at the nose to high supersonic values along the body. The flow field is further complicated by boundary layer transition on fore-body. flow separation behind the vehicle. and turbulent free shear layer re-compression in the reattachment region. Several compressibility corrections to conventional turbulence models have been proposed to account for these high Mach number effects. This paper evaluates such modifications to one-and two-equation turbulence models. The test case considered is the flow around a hypersonic re-entry configuration with a large recirculation region behind the vehicle. Issues pertaining to the implementation of the models/modifications to a practical configuration are discussed. The effect of the different models and compressibility corrections are studied in terms of the predicted boundary layer transition location. size of the recirculation region. and the resulting pressure and heat transfer rate on the vehicle. Conclusions are thus drawn on the merits and limitations of the turbulence models and their variations.,True,O20nwBwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kushal_Kedia/publication/260126538_Effects_of_Compressibility_Correction_to_Turbulence_Models_applied_to_a_Hypersonic_Re-entry_Configuration/links/00b4952faf8f157ed0000000.pdf,8732831357847490543,/scholar?cites=8732831357847490543,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kushal_Kedia/publication/260126538_Effects_of_Compressibility_Correction_to_Turbulence_Models_applied_to_a_Hypersonic_Re-entry_Configuration/links/00b4952faf8f157ed0000000.pdf,0,0,0

1123460,Unsteady flamelet modeling of CO emissions from a biomass combustor,2012,E Knudsen and H Pitsch and DJ Cook and K Kedia and X Li,,,,31-42,,Biomass fueled combustors are a widely considered (Demirbas 2005) alternative to petroleum and coal fueled combustors. The advantage offered by biomass fuel is that its carbon content has been extracted from the Earth’s atmosphere and surface environment. The combustion of these materials is therefore thought to have a minimal impact on atmospheric carbon concentrations. Disadvantages associated with the use of biomass include the material’s infrastructure costs (Caputo et al. 2005). lower heating value (Demirbas 2005). and complex burning characteristics. For example. biomass materials such as wood pellets are often burned in multi-stage processes (Fletcher et al. 2000; Albrecht et al. 2008) in which volatile fuel components first gasify and separate from the solid phase material. leaving particles consisting of char and ash. The volatile gases contain significant concentrations of CO and H2 that can be burned in a secondary process in which additional oxidizer is introduced. Predictive modeling of biomass combustors requires physical descriptions of processes such as pyrolysis. particle tracking. fluid/particle interaction. and turbulence/chemistry interaction. Although turbulence and chemistry interactions are expected to be important in biomass applications. only limited numbers of multi-scale and large eddy simulation studies of these devices exist. Existing work includes that of Fletcher et al.(2000). where a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework was used in conjunction with a particle tracking method and an eddy break-up chemistry model to study the dynamics of a biomass gasifier.

Harmonic velocity fluctuations are used to simulate the flame response to acoustic oscillations. which are of primary importance in the study of thermoacoustic instabilities. We use a fully resolved unsteady two-dimensional code with detailed chemistry and species transport. with no artificial flame anchoring boundary conditions. Calculations were conducted with different bluff body materials and different forcing frequencies and amplitudes. Results reveal significant displacement of the flame leading edge during the forcing. as well as large fluctuations in the flame stretch.

The objectives of this thesis are: (i) to develop a state-of-the-art numerical approach to capture the wide spectra of spatio-temporal scales associated with reacting flows around immersed boundaries. and (ii) to use this tool to investigate the underlying mechanisms of flame stabilization and blow-off in canonical configurations. A second-order immersed boundary method for reacting flow simulations near heat conducting. grid conforming. solid object has been developed. The method is coupled with a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) framework and a semi-implicit operator-split projection algorithm. The immersed boundary approach captures the flame-wall interactions. The SAMR framework and the operator-split algorithm resolve several decades of length and time efficiently. A novel ""buffer zone"" methodology is introduced to impose the solid-fluid boundary conditions such that symmetric derivatives and interpolation stencils can be used throughout the interior of the domain. thereby maintaining the order of accuracy of the method. Near an immersed solid boundary. single-sided buffer zones are used to resolve the species discontinuities. and dual buffer zones are used to capture the temperature gradient discontinuities.

We conducted a series of tests where two backward step blocks were used. made of ceramic and stainless steel. whose thermal conductivities are 1.06 and 12 W/m/K. respectively. Stability characteristics of the two flame-holder materials were examined using measurements of the dynamic pressure and flame chemiluminescence over a range of operating conditions. Results show that with the ceramic flameholder. the onset of instability is significantly delayed in time and. for certain operating conditions. disappears altogether. whereas with the higher conductivity material. the combustor becomes increasingly unstable over a range of operating conditions. We explain these trends using the heat flux through the flame-holder and the change in the burning velocity near the step wall.

In the SSFEM formalism. the stochastic dependence is represented in terms of the polynomial chaos system. and the coefficients in the corresponding spectral representation are obtained using a Galerkin approach. It is shown that incorporation of the spectral uncertainty representation scheme into the projection method results in a coupled system of advection-diffusion equations for the various uncertainty fields. and in a decoupled system of pressure projection steps.

Computational challenges in this construction arise from the need for repeated evaluations of the forward model (e.g.. in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo) and are compounded by high dimensionality of the posterior.

The direct measure of burning or heat release rate as a field variable is not possible. Numerous experimental investigations have relied on inferring this type of information as well as flame-front topology from indirect measures that are presumed to be correlated. A recent study has brought into question many of the commonly used flame-front marker and burning-rate diagnostics. This same study found that the concentration of formyl radical offers the best possibility for measuring flame burning rate.

The approach is based on recording the unsteady thermal response of a BHE that has been installed for the first time in Saudi Arabia. In this approach. the temperature of the circulating fluid has been recorded at the inlet and outlet sections of the BHE with time following the start of its operation. Severe fluctuations in these temperatures occur at small times (up to 8 h) due to the transient effects inside the borehole and must be excluded. A method has been developed for estimating the time period characterized by these severe fluctuations.

It is a technique by which huge amount of crude remaining in wells after natural extraction process is recovered. The natural extraction process (primary recovery). which employs the reservoir natural pressure for crude oil extraction. leaves huge amount (more than 70% in some cases) of original oil in place (OOIP) unextracted. due to decrease in reservoir pressure. Consequently. the use of secondary oil recovery that involves fluid (mainly water and gas) injection to augment the reservoir pressure. as well as EOR. also known as tertiary recovery. becomes imperative to improve oil recovery.

The shear force is produced at the left side of a cavity by a belt moving upward that constitutes the sixth wall of the cavity. The left wall of the cavity was cooled and the opposite (right wall) was heated. Hence. the buoyancy force tries to bring the fluid down. and the shear force tends to induce upward fluid flow. The test cell was equipped with two heat exchangers and three thermocouple racks for measuring the temperature distributions at 12 different positions. The temperature field was scanned in the cavity for various flow and temperature boundary conditions. Three-and-two-dimensional laminar models were used to analyze the problem theoretically.

In oxy-combustion. CH₄/O₂/CO₂ mixtures burn at low temperatures (~~1700 K). high pressures (~~40 bar). where laminar burning velocities are about 7 times lower than in traditional CH₄ /Air mixtures. Thus oxy-fuel combustors are more prone to blowoff and dynamic instabilities. In this thesis we examine turbulent oxy-combustion flame stabilization physics at the large and small scales using experimental studies and numerical simulations. Experimental measurements are used to establish the stability characteristics of flame macrostructures in a swirl stabilized combustor. We show that the transition in the flame macrostructure to a flame stabilized along both the inner and outer shear layers (Flame IV). scales according to the extinction strain rate. similar to air flames. To achieve accurate scaling. extinction strain rates must be computed at the thermal conditions of the outer shear layer. emphasizing the role of heat interactions with the wall boundary layer. Care must be exercised while modeling the chemical structure of oxy-flames.

We investigate the attributes of the kinetics mechanisms required to predict flow structures such as recirculation zones. Premixed methane-oxy combustion is modeled in a swirl-stabilized combustor. Results show that kinetic mechanisms that accurately predict the extinction strain rate of the underlying flames were able to predict the evolution of the flame macrostructure with equivalence ratio and the associated velocity profiles. The recirculation zone length was found to linearly scale with the extinction strain rate. in agreement with previous findings in different fuel-oxidizer mixtures and combustor geometry.

Swirling flows in combustion lead to the formation of complex flow dynamics and vortical structures that can interact with flames and influence its stabilization. Our experimental results for non-reacting flow show the existence of large scale precession motion. The precessing vortex core (PVC) dynamics disappears with combustion but only above a threshold of equivalence ratio. In addition. large scale vortices along the inner shear layer (ISL) are observed. These structures interact with the ISL stabilized flame and contribute to its wrinkling.

1123585,Techno-economic analysis of sour gas oxy-fuel combustion power cycles for carbon capture and sequestration,2014,Nadim Walid Chakroun,,,,,,The world's growing energy demand coupled with the problem of global warming have led us to investigate new energy sources that can be utilized in a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions than traditional fossil fuel power plants. One of these unconventional fuels is sour gas. Sour gas consists of mainly methane. containing large concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. Over 30% of the world's natural gas reserves are considered sour. However this unusual fuel poses many challenges due to the toxic and corrosive nature of the combustion products. One of the most promising technologies for carbon capture and sequestration is oxy-fuel combustion. This involves separating the nitrogen from air prior to the combustion itself. Then. after combustion. we separate the water and other substances and can use the resulting carbon dioxide stream for enhanced oil recovery representing an added economic benefit of this system. Firing temperatures for pure oxygen combustion can reach values up to 2500° C. which is well above what the combustor can handle. Therefore a diluent has to be added to reduce the temperature back to appropriate levels. but the key question is how this impacts the efficiency and performance of the entire cycle. Hence. if feasible. the use of sour gas in an oxy-fuel power plant could potentially allow us to harness the economic and environmental potential of this unconventional fuel. Depending on the cycle configuration. water or carbon dioxide can be used as diluents to control the flame temperature in the combustion process. All of these cycle types were modeled and the cycles' performances and …,True,wY5XVQEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/92148,,,,,0,0,0

They joined the approximately 3.000 stable and radioactive nuclides that either occur naturally on Earth or are synthesized in the laboratory 2. 3. Every atomic nucleus. characterized by a specific number of protons and neutrons. occupies a spot on the chart of nuclides. which is bounded by ‘drip lines’ indicating the values of neutron and proton number at which nuclear binding ends. The placement of the neutron drip line for the heavier elements is based on theoretical predictions using extreme extrapolations. and so is uncertain. However. it is not known how uncertain it is or how many protons and neutrons can be bound in a nucleus.

Tb. Ho. Tm. Lu. Ta. Ir and Au) rare-earth nuclei have been calculated using the shell correction method with an average Woods-Saxon potential and a monopole pairing residual interaction. Calculated equilibrium deformations of the lowest single-proton states are presented. and calculated band head excitation energies are compared with experimental proton band heads for odd-Z rare-earth nuclei. Good agreement is found between the experimental and calculated band heads. We find that strong polarisation effects due to the odd proton explain many of the systematic trends of known band heads. Different deformation driving forces of the odd-proton orbitals can also partly explain deviations seen in high-spin data. Shape co-existence effects in Ir and Au isotopes are discussed.

Over the last half century. this assumption has been verified by many successes. This does not mean. however. that the nuclear many body problem is close to being solved. The detailed microscopic under standing of the origin of the nuclear shell model was. and in some respect still remains. a major challenge. Even now the basic ingredient. namely the interaction between nucleons. is still a matter of discussion. Its dominant features are certainly known: a repulsive hard core at short distances. a strong attraction at intermediate distances. and a long-range force domi nated by the one-pion exchange. The interaction between nucleons is strong both in its attractive and repulsive components.

Proton half-lives of observed heavy proton emitters are. in general. well reproduced by spherical calculations with the spectroscopic factors calculated in the independent quasiparticle approximation.

As a result of the presence of a low-lying proton continuum resulting in a free particle gas. special attention is paid to the treatment of the single-particle level density. To cure the pathological behavior of the shell correction around the particle threshold. a method based on the Green’s function approach has been adopted. It is demonstrated that for the vast majority of Skyrme interactions commonly employed in nuclear structure calculations. the strongest shell stabilization appears for Z= 124 and 126. and for N= 184.

The development of this method is focussed on applications in nuclear γ-ray spectroscopy. In nuclear in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy a number of (position-sensitive) germanium detectors are placed around a target where the nuclei under investigation are produced. The γ-rays emitted by the nuclei can have energies up to several MeVs. The nuclear reactions in the target can cause emission of up to 25 coincident γ-rays and sometimes even more. In order to resolve the individual γ-rays from such events the detector systems currently under development will have such a high granularity that the energy of scattered γ-rays will be deposited in several different detector segments.

The shell-model Hamiltonian in the s d shell. such as USD. can thus be modified to reproduce the binding energies and energy levels of the weakly bound proton-rich nuclei around A= 20. The effect of the reduction of the effective interaction on the structure and decay properties of these nuclei is also discussed.,True,bScqsBYAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,38,https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.89.044327,2481434588033916725,/scholar?cites=2481434588033916725,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5202,0,0,0

Mottelson and Pines nearly 60 years ago. Nevertheless. few conclusions have been reached concerning the existence of analogous neutron–proton (np) pair correlated state. One can see a renaissance in np correlation studies in relation to the significant progress in radioactive ion beam facilities and detection techniques. The np pairs can couple isospin T= 1 (isovector) or 0 (isoscalar). In the isovector channel. the angular momentum zero component is expected to be the most important one. On the other hand. as one may infer from the general properties of the np two-body interaction. in the isoscalar channel. both the np pairs with minimum (J= 1) and maximum (J= 2j) spin values can be important …,True,bScqsBYAAAAJ:zTJoPluU4X4C,34,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-8949/91/1/013009/meta,11927667773260558432,/scholar?cites=11927667773260558432,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07296,0,0,0

The empirical average proton–neutron interaction V p n thus derived from experimental data can be described in a very simple form as the interplay of the nuclear mean field and the pairing interaction. It is found that the smooth behavior as well as the local fluctuations of the V p n in even–even nuclei with N≠ Z are dominated by the contribution from the proton–neutron monopole interactions.

We observe that such a simple scheme destroys the harmonic oscillator magic numbers N= 8 and 20 and generates new magic numbers like N= 6. 14. 16. 32 and 34. The traditional magic numbers like N= 28 and 50 and N= 14 seen in 22 O are eroded in neutron-rich nuclei due to the sensitivity of larger-l orbitals to the depth of the central potential but they are more robust than the harmonic oscillator magic numbers. The N= 82 shell closure persists in neutron-rich nuclei while the previously proposed shell closures like N= 40 and 70 do not emerge.

It is found. for the first time. that the tensor correlations have a unique. multipole-dependent effect on the SD excitations; that is. they produce a softening of 1− states. but a hardening of 0− and 2− states. This paves the way to a clear assessment of the strength of the tensor terms. We compare our results with a recent measurement. showing that our choice of tensor terms improves the agreement with experiment.

This asymmetry is more surprising since a mass-symmetric split of this extremely neutron-deficient nucleus would lead to two Zr 90 fragments. with magic N= 50 and semimagic Z= 40. This is a new type of asymmetric fission. not caused by large shell effects related to fragment magic proton and neutron numbers. as observed in the actinide region. The newly measured branching ratio for β-delayed fission of Tl 180 is 3.6 (7)× 10− 3%. approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than in an earlier study.,True,EqFXeSkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,245,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252502,2647342799665951442,/scholar?cites=2647342799665951442,,http://olympias.lib.uoi.gr/jspui/bitstream/123456789/17523/1/patronis-2010-New%20Type%20of%20Asymmetric%20Fission%20in%20Proton-Rich%20Nuclei.pdf,0,0,0

These arrays have revolutionised the field of γ-ray spectroscopy with their significant improvement in signal to background ratios enabling very weak photon lines to be detected in the presence of many stronger γ-rays. This enables the properties of nuclei to be studied at the highest spins and for very weak channels to be detected. The highlights of the new physics achieved with these arrays are described.

Analogous to the mirror symmetric centroid difference method. the generalized centroid difference method provides two independent “start” and “stop” time spectra obtained by a superposition of the N (N− 1) γ–γ time difference spectra of the N detector fast-timing system. The two fast-timing array time spectra correspond to a forward and reverse gating of a specific γ–γ cascade. Provided that the energy response and the electronic time pick-off of the detectors are almost equal. a mean prompt response difference between start and stop events is calibrated and used as a single correction for lifetime determination.

This led to the large increase in sensitivity realized by today's arrays of Compton-suppressed Ge detectors.

A tracking array consists of highly segmented Ge detectors (that can cover the full 4π solid-angle) in which γ rays will be identified by measuring and tracking every γ ray interaction. This article reviews the physics motivation for such detectors and the development of the new technologies involved.

In atomic nuclei with even numbers of neutrons and protons. the low-lying excitation spectrum is generally formed by nucleon pair breaking and nuclear vibrations or rotations. However. for certain numbers of protons and neutrons. a subtle rearrangement of only a few nucleons among the orbitals at the Fermi surface can result in a different elementary mode: a macroscopic shape change 1. 2. 3. The first experimental evidence for this phenomenon came from the observation of shape coexistence in 16 O (ref. 4).

We show that the derivative of the preformation amplitude is practically a constant along any α chain. while that of the outgoing wave function changes exponentially upon the Coulomb parameter. This leads to the breakdown of the continuity equation and therefore to wrong decay widths. The behavior cannot be explained within the standard shell model. We significantly correct this deficiency by considering an α-cluster factor in the preformation amplitude. depending exponentially upon the Coulomb parameter. Thus. four-body correlations. connected with the radial shape of the preformation factor. are directly evidenced by the α-decay systematics.

The equations of motion are derived within the multistep shell-model approach; the lowest collective two-particle eigenmodes are used as building blocks for the four-particle states. A good agreement with the low-lying states in 212 Po is obtained. A new technique to estimate the α-particle formation amplitude for any multipolarity is proposed. The spectroscopic factor of the α-decay between ground states is reproduced. but the total width is by two orders of magnitude less than the experimental total width. due to the absence of the background components. The α-like structure of the lowest states in 212 Po is analyzed and strong high-lying resonances are predicted.

The main building blocks are the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) phonons. A realistic microscopic nuclear Hamiltonian. based on the Bonn one-boson-exchange potential. is diagonalized in a basis containing one-phonon and two-phonon components. coupled to a given angular momentum and parity. The QRPA equations are directly used in deriving the equations of motion for the two-phonon states. The Pauli principle is taken into account by diagonalizing the metric matrix and discarding the zero-norm states.

Nonsynonymous sequence variants were significantly more common (16% versus 2%) in individuals with low HDL-C (95th percentile). Similar findings were obtained in an independent population. and biochemical studies indicated that most sequence variants in the low HDL-C group were functionally important.

1124163,Theory and application of quantum molecular dynamics,1998,John Zeng Hui Zhang,,,,,World Scientific,This book provides a detailed presentation of modern quantum theories for treating the reaction dynamics of small molecular systems. Its main focus is on the recent development of successful quantum dynamics theories and computational methods for studying the molecular reactive scattering process. with specific applications given in detail for a number of benchmark chemical reaction systems in the gas phase and the gas surface. In contrast to traditional books on collision in physics focusing on abstract theory for nonreactive scattering. this book deals with both the development and the application of the modern reactive or rearrangement scattering theory. and is written in a fashion in which the development of the reactive scattering theory is closely coupled with its computational aspects for practical applications for realistic molecular reactions. The volume includes such topics as methods for calculating rovibrational states of molecules. fundamental quantum theory for scattering (nonreactive and reactive). modern time-independent computational methods for reactive scattering. general time-dependent wave packet methods for reactive scattering. dynamics theory of chemical reactions. dynamics of molecular fragmentation. semiclassical description of quantum mechanics. and also some useful appendices.

In this work we report findings that the band structure of MoO 3 can be significantly altered by a distortion in the octahedral coordination structure. We discovered that. in addition to epitaxial type of structural strain. chemical force such as hydrogen inclusion can also cause extended lattice distortion. The lattice distortion in hydrogenated MoO 3 led to a significant reduction of the energy gap. overshadowing the Moss-Burstein effect of band filling. Charge doping simulations revealed that filling of conduction band drives the lattice distortion.

Multilayers form on ITO surface after adsorbing SASMs. including the monolayer deriving from chemical adsorption (called SAM) and the multilayer deriving from physical adsorption. The work function of ITO shows various change when modified by SASMs of different sorts and packing degree. and it is also governed by the physical pretreatment on substrate. We find the enhanced work function is not only originated from the formation of dipole between the halogenated molecule and substrate. but also rooted in the cleavable halogen atom on the aromatic nucleus. A novel triple dipole effect. composed of the intrinsic dipole moment of isolated individual molecule. the bond dipole from docking group in Cl-SASMs to substrate. and the novel bond dipole from Cl substituted headgroup directly bonding with substrate. has been discovered and confirmed when Cl-SASMs grafted on ITO.

1124189,The origin of the high work function of chlorinated indium tin oxide,2013,Peng-Ru Huang and Yao He and Chao Cao and Zheng-Hong Lu,5,NPG Asia Materials,8,e57-e57,Nature Publishing Group,The impact of halogenation. in particular Cl and F. on the work functions of indium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces was studied using density functional theory calculations. We found that a strong surface dipole layer induced by the halogen. rather than a change in the electrochemical potential (that is. Fermi level) of the ITO. led to a dramatic increase in the work function. However. the work function for F-coated ITO was lower than that of Cl-coated ITO. This result contradicts the well-known fact that F is much more electronegative than Cl. Detailed computations reveal that both electronegativity and atomic size collectively contribute to the extraordinarily high work function of Cl-ITO.

The oxygen surface exchange coefficient (k*) determined from EIS decreased with increasing poisoning time. For LSCF pellets. the k* values decreased linearly with poisoning time (the first stage) and then became nearly constant (the second stage). The first degradation of k* was attributed to the formation of SrCrO 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 within the initial 7~ 8 h poisoning time. whereas in the second stage.

The question if the polymer crystals are melting first and simultaneously the RAF devitrifies or the RAF devitrifies first and later on the crystals melt cannot be answered easily on the example of semicrystalline polymers. This is because the crystals. which are the reason for the immobilization of the polymer. often disappear (melt) in the same temperature range as the RAF.

The device,2010,E Zhuravlev and C Schick,505,Thermochimica Acta,1-2,1-13,Elsevier,Fast scanning calorimetry becomes more and more important because an increasing number of materials are created or used far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Fast scanning. especially on cooling. allows for the in situ investigation of structure formation. which is of particular interest in a wide range of materials like polymers. metals. and pharmaceuticals to name a few. Freestanding silicon nitride membranes are commonly used as low addenda heat capacity fast scanning calorimetric sensors. A differential setup based on commercially available sensors is described. To enhance performance of the device a new asymmetric power compensation scheme was developed.

This is due to the difficulty to investigate the melting of the originally formed crystals exclusively. Recrystallization is a fast process and most experimental techniques applied so far do not allow fast heating in order to prevent recrystallization totally. Developments in thin-film (chip) calorimetry allow scanning rates as high as several thousand Kelvin per second. We utilized a chip calorimeter based on a commercially available vacuum gauge. which is operated under non-adiabatic conditions.

If heat capacity is frequency dependent. for example. in the glass-transition region. one get a phase angle between heating rate and heat-flow rate which is related to material intrinsic properties. Because heat does not propagate but flows. the time-consuming heat transfer into the sample yields an additional phase angle. This phase angle has to be taken into account if one wants to calculate the imaginary part of the complex heat capacity of the sample from the measured phase angle. The heat transfer related phase angle depends on frequency. heat capacity and heat conductance.

Controlled fast cooling is possible in addition to fast heating at essentially non-adiabatic conditions. To allow fast cooling the measurements are performed in an ambient gas atmosphere. It is proved that the maximum rate of the controlled cooling can be achieved with a gas cooling agent. rather than in a system with a solid heat-sink. The advantage of the gauge TCG 3880 is that its central heated region is small enough to be considered as a point source of the heat-flow into the gas. which essentially simplifies the …,True,WaTiuY4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,153,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040603105001061,3521841569162697459,/scholar?cites=3521841569162697459,,,0,0,0

The decomposition process. which was carried out under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature and tracked by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. appears to proceed by way of a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) process.

The results indicate that the presence of NaCl and LiCl changes the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics of the 6LiBH4–Mg(AlH4)2 composite in addition to producing a distinct reduction in the hydrogen capacity. For the NaCl-containing sample. the chemical composition is changed due to the metathesis reaction between NaCl and LiBH4 during ball milling. which converts the NaCl and LiBH4 to LiCl and NaBH4. However. for the LiCl-containing system. the kinetic barriers of the dehydrogenation reaction were changed by the presence of LiCl. which is responsible for the change in the dehydrogenation temperature.

Mental models,1994,Ann Bostrom and M Granger Morgan and Baruch Fischhoff and Daniel Read,14,Risk Analysis,6,959-970,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,A set of exploratory studies and mental model interviews was conducted in order to characterize public understanding of climate change. In general. respondents regarded global warming as both bad and highly likely. Many believed that warming has already occurred. They tended to confuse stratospheric omne depletion with the greenhouse effect and weather with climate. Automobile use. heat and emissions from industrial processes. aerosol spray cans. and pollution in general were frequently perceived as primary causes of global warming. Additionally. the “greenhouse effect” was often interpreted literally as the cause of a hot and steamy climate. The effects attributed to climate change often included increased skin cancer and changed agricultural yields. The mitigation and control strategies proposed by interviewees typically focused on general pollution control. with few specific links to carbon dioxide and energy use. Respondents appeared to be relatively unfamiliar with such regulatory developments as the ban on CFCS for nonessential uses.

The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions. and the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate geoengineering has often been considered to be a"" last-ditch"" response to climate change. to be used only if climate change damage should produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on emissions control. there is a lack of information on these ways of potentially intervening in the climate system. As one of a two-book report. this volume of Climate Intervention discusses albedo modification-changing the fraction of incoming solar radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo modification raises political and governance issues at national and global levels. as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social. political. and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques. It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action.

Following a modified version of the mental model interview method. Study 1 involved face-to-face interviews with 18 nontechnical respondents. Respondents shared their beliefs after receiving basic information about the technologies and again after getting specific details. Many interviewees wanted to frame the issue in the broader context of alternative strategies for carbon management. but public understanding of mitigation strategies is limited. The second study. administered to a sample of 126 individuals. involved a closed-form survey that measured the prevalence of general beliefs revealed in study 1 and also assessed the respondent's views of these technologies.

Defining such categories requires value choices that can have important implications for the rankings that result. Most risk‐management organizations will find it useful to begin defining categories in terms of environmental loadings or initiating events. However. the resulting categories typically need to be modified in light of other considerations. Risk‐ranking projects can benefit from considering several alternative categorization strategies and drawing upon elements of each in developing their final categorization of risks. In principle. conducting multiple ranking exercises by using different categorizations could be interesting and useful.

To formally explore the uncertainty in the risk assessment of a GM crop. we conducted detailed interviews of seven leading experts on GM oilseed crops to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on their understanding of the uncertainties associated with the risks to agriculture from GM oilseed crops (canola or rapeseed). The results of these elicitations revealed three issues of potential concern that are currently left outside the …,True,ltRYan0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,92,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00546.x,12827786667889306039,/scholar?cites=12827786667889306039,,,0,0,0

This methodology combines a causative model for the reductive dechlorination of TCE and expert knowledge within a Bayesian Belief Network. The knowledge base for this expert system was obtained from 22 experts via an expert elicitation protocol. The resulting expert system can be used to aid environmental decision making by evaluating the adequacy of reductive dechlorination at TCE-contaminated sites. Comparisons between this expert system and a commonly used screening tool show that this expert system produces predictive models that may better discriminate between locations that were sampled.

The objective of this paper is to establish a theoretical basis for defining the syntax and semantics of a small subset of calculi of uncertainty operating on a given term set of linguistic statements of likelihood.

These families provide us with a formalism for defining an infinite number of different calculi of uncertainty.

1124500,Summarizing and propagating uncertain information with triangular norms,1987,Piero P Bonissone,1,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,1,71-101,Elsevier,A wide variety of numerical or symbolic approaches to reasoning with uncertainty have been proposed in the artificial intelligence (AI) literature. This article postulates a list of desiderata that any such formalism should try to satisfy. The author then proposes a new approach to reasoning with uncertainty. which is organized in three layers: representation. inference. and control.In the representation layer the structure required to capture information used in the inference layer and meta-information used in the control layer are described. In this structure. numerical slots take values on linguistic term sets with fuzzy-valued semantics. These term sets capture the input granularity usually provided by users or experts.In the inference layer a large number of uncertainty calculi based on triangular norms (T-norms). intersection operators whose truth functionality entails low computational complexity. are described.

Often not enough statistical data is available to allow for reliable probability estimation. Available information may not be directly amenable for encoding in the network. Finally. domain experts may be reluctant to provide numerical probabilities. In this paper. we propose a method for elicitation of probabilities from a domain expert that is non-invasive and accommodates whatever probabilistic information the expert is willing to state.

Models based on acyclic directed graphs and composed of discrete variables. currently most common in practice. require for every variable a number of parameters that is exponential in the number of its parents in the graph. which makes elicitation from experts or learning from databases a daunting task. In this paper. we review the so called canonical models. whose main advantage is that they require much fewer parameters. We propose a general framework for them. based on three categories: deterministic models. ICI models. and simple canonical models. ICI models rely on the concept of independence of causal influence and can be subdivided into noisy and leaky. We then analyze the most common families of canonical models (the OR/MAX. the AND/MIN. and the noisy XOR). generalizing them and offering criteria for applying them in practice.

The common thread of the entire spectrum of these tools is aiding in decision making under uncertainty: the choice of an interpretation of reality or the choice of a course of action. Although the importance of dealing with uncertainty in decision making is widely acknowledged. dissemination of probabilistic and decision-theoretic methods in Artificial Intelligence has been surprisingly slow. Opponents of probability theory have pointed out three major obstacles to applying it in computerized decision aids:(1) the counterintuitiveness of probabilistic inference. which makes it hard for system builders. experts. and users to translate knowledge into probabilistic form. create knowledge bases. and to interpret results;(2) the quantitative character of probability theory. which implies collection or assessment of vast quantities of numbers and. since these are not always readily available. raises questions about their quality; and (3) closely related to its quantitative character. the computational complexity of probabilistic inference. Its proponents. on the other hand. point out that probability theory is the soundest formalism for dealing with uncertainty. outperforming its competitors in most applications. These two extreme views suggest a dilemma: is it necessary to choose between sound and intuitive inference methods?This thesis argues for choosing sound inference methods and shows that this dilemma might not be as hard as it seems.

Bayesian network inference. and classical hypothesis testing to produce a more reliable and robust test of independence for constraintbased (CB) learning of causal structure. Our method produces a smoothed contingency table NXY Z that can be used with any test of independence that relies on contingency table statistics. NXY Z can be calculated in the same asymptotic time and space required to calculate a standard contingency table. allows the specification of a prior distribution over parameters. and can be calculated when the database is incomplete. We provide theoretical justification for the procedure. and with synthetic data we demonstrate its benefits empirically over both a CB algorithm using the standard contingency table. and over a greedy Bayesian algorithm. We show that. even when used with noninformative priors. it results in better recovery of structural features and it produces networks with smaller KL-Divergence. especially as the number of nodes increases or the number of records decreases.

Relevance-based decomposition approaches belief updating in large networks by focusing on their parts and decomposing them into partially overlapping subnetworks. This makes reasoning in some intractable networks possible and. in addition. often results in significant speedup. as the total time taken to update all subnetworks is in practice often considerably less than the time taken to update the network as a whole.

We propose a set of user interface tools for graphical probabilistic models. focusing on two aspects of probability elicitation:(1) navigation through conditional probability tables and (2) interactive graphical assessment of discrete probability distributions. We propose two new graphical views that aid navigation in very large conditional probability tables: the CPTree (Conditional Probability Tree) and the SCPT (shrinkable Conditional Probability Table). Based on what is known about graphical presentation of quantitative data to humans. we offer several useful enhancements to probability wheel and bar graph. including different chart styles and options that can be adapted to user preferences and needs.

For example. the authors have recently completed an extensive study in which they applied random noise to the numerical probabilities in a set of belief networks for medical diagnosis. subsets of the CPCS network. a subset of the QMR (Quick Medical Reference) focused on liver and bile diseases. The diagnostic performance in terms of the average probabilities assigned to the actual diseases showed small sensitivity even to large amounts of noise. In this paper. we summarize the findings of this study and discuss possible explanations of this low sensitivity. One reason is that the criterion for performance is average probability of the true hypotheses. rather than average error in probability. which is insensitive to symmetric noise distributions. But. we show that even asymmetric. logodds-normal noise has modest effects. A second reason is that the gold-standard posterior probabilities are often near zero or one. and are little disturbed by noise.,True,kr-OUp8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,94,https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3582,16222979177985547689,/scholar?cites=16222979177985547689,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.3582,0,0,0

The task of a diagnosis engine is to compute diagnoses. which are assumptions on the health of components in the diagnosed system that explain the observation. In this paper. we extend Reiter's well-known theory of diagnosis by exploiting the duality of the relation between conflicts and diagnoses. This duality means that a diagnosis is a hitting set of conflicts. but a conflict is also a hitting set of diagnoses. We use this property to interleave the search for diagnoses and conflicts: a set of conflicts can guide the search for diagnosis. and the computed diagnoses can guide the search for more conflicts. We provide the formal basis for this dual conflict-diagnosis relation. and propose a novel diagnosis algorithm that exploits this duality.

Such algorithms guarantee soundness and completeness. but are ΣP 2-hard. To overcome this complexity problem. which prohibits the computation of high-cardinality diagnoses for large systems. we propose a novel approximation approach for multiple-fault diagnosis. based on a greedy stochastic algorithm called SAFARI (StochAstic Fault diagnosis Algo-RIthm).

1124580,Query DAGs: A practical paradigm for implementing belief-network inference,1997,Adnan Darwiche and Gregory Provan,6,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,,147-176,,We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks. which consists of two steps:(1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation. a number. or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query. that is. the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG. and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line. real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough. Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference. such as network-pruning and computation-caching.,True,kr-OUp8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,65,https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10185,12963413026997988333,/scholar?cites=12963413026997988333,,https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/download/10185/24181,0,0,0

As evolution has no foresight. optimality of the modern genetic code suggests that it evolved from less optimal code variants. The length of codons in the genetic code is also optimal. as three is the minimal nucleotide combination that can encode the twenty standard amino acids. The apparent impossibility of transitions between codon sizes in a discontinuous manner during evolution has resulted in an unbending view that the genetic code was always triplet. Yet. recent experimental evidence on quadruplet decoding. as well as the discovery of organisms with ambiguous and dual decoding. suggest that the possibility of the evolution of triplet decoding from living systems with non-triplet decoding merits reconsideration and further exploration. To explore this possibility we designed a mathematical model of the evolution of primitive digital coding systems which can decode nucleotide sequences into protein sequences. These coding systems can evolve their nucleotide sequences via genetic events of Darwinian evolution. such as point-mutations. The replication rates of such coding systems depend on the accuracy of the generated protein sequences. Computer simulations based on our model show that decoding systems with codons of length greater than three spontaneously evolve into predominantly triplet decoding systems. Our findings suggest a plausible scenario for the evolution of the triplet genetic code …,True,kr-OUp8AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,51,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005708,7892562919943590492,/scholar?cites=7892562919943590492,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005708,0,0,0
1124589,The validity of Dempster-Shafer belief functions,1992,Gregory M Provan,6,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,3,389-399,Elsevier,This reply to papers by Pearl and Shafer focuses on two issues underlying the debate on the validity of using Dempster-Shafer theory. namely the requirement of a process-independent semantics and the a priori need for multiple uncertainty calculi. Pearl shows deficiencies of Dempster-Shafer theory in dealing with several instances of commonsense reasoning in a process-independent manner. Although this argument is correct under the assumptions stated. it is weakened somewhat by introducing questions of whether a process-independent semantics is always necessary or desirable.Another issue underlying both papers. whether multiple uncertainty representations are necessary. is also discussed. Shafer claims that multiple uncertainty representations are necessary. He presents a goal of developing all uncertainty representations in parallel and defining domains in which each representation is best suited …,True,kr-OUp8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0888613X9290032U,8923705402088375199,/scholar?cites=8923705402088375199,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0888613X9290032U/pdf?md5=ae13d8bb271a21e0acdda6d7866a0a30&pid=1-s2.0-0888613X9290032U-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

Using qualitative probabilities could substantially reduce the effort for knowledge engineering and improve the robustness of results. We examine experimentally how well infinitesimal probabilities (the kappa-calculus of Goldszmidt and Pearl) perform a diagnostic task — troubleshooting a car that will not start — by comparison with a conventional numerical belief network. We found the infinitesimal scheme to be as good as the numerical scheme in identifying the true fault. The performance of the infinitesimal scheme worsens significantly for prior fault probabilities greater than 0.03. These results suggest that infinitesimal probability methods may be of substantial practical value for machine diagnosis with small prior fault probabilities.,True,kr-OUp8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,42,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781558603325500456,8853387573343519645,/scholar?cites=8853387573343519645,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6818,0,0,0

This paper examines the eficiency of multiple-context TMSs. such as the ATMS. in solving a scene representation problem which we call the Vision Constraint Recognition problem. The ATMS has been claimed to be quite eficient for solving problems with multiple possible solutions. even for problems with large databases. However. we present evidence that for large databases with multiple possible solutions (which we argue occur frequently in practice). such multiple-context TMSs can be very inefficient. We present a class of problems for which using a multiple-context TMS is both intrinsically interesting and ideal. but which will be computationally infeasible because of the exponential size of the database which the TMS must explore.

This approach. based on model-based diagnostic representations and algorithms. integrates diagnostics and control reconfiguration for discrete event systems using a single modeling mechanism and suite of algorithms. When the system functionality degrades (i.e.. failures occur in the systems). the diagnostic algorithm will isolate the most likely failures. and then the control mechanism will generate the least-cost actions that attempt to recover from the failure and maintain the control objectives. Results about the quality of the control actions generated and the complexity of computing these actions ate also presented.

1124595,Causality,2009,Judea Pearl,,,,,Cambridge university press,Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field. this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics. artificial intelligence. economics. philosophy. cognitive science. and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic. manipulative. counterfactual. and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics. artificial intelligence. business. epidemiology. social sciences. and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models. simple inferential procedures. and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics. philosophy. computer science. social science. and economics. Cited in more than 5.000 scientific publications. it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition. Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues. answers readers' questions. and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research.

The paper then presents a method of generating heuristic advice to guide the order of value assignments based on both the sparseness found in the constraint network and the simplicity of tree-structured CSPs.

1124608,A theory of inferred causation,1995,Judea Pearl and Thomas S Verma,134,,,789-811,Elsevier,This chapter discusses the theory of inferred causation. The study of causation is central to the understanding of human reasoning. Inferences involving changing environments require causal theories that make formal distinctions between beliefs based on passive observations and those reflecting intervening actions. In applications such as diagnosis. qualitative physics. and plan recognition. a central task is that of finding a satisfactory explanation to a given set of observations. and the meaning of explanation is intimately related to the notion of causation. In some systems. causal ordering is defined as the ordering at which subsets of variables can be solved independently of others; in other systems. it follows the way a disturbance is propagated from one variable to others. An empirical semantics for causation is important for several reasons.

1124611,On the logic of iterated belief revision,1997,Adnan Darwiche and Judea Pearl,89,Artificial intelligence,1-2,1-29,Elsevier,We show in this paper that the AGM postulates are too weak to ensure the rational preservation of conditional beliefs during belief revision. thus permitting improper responses to sequences of observations. We remedy this weakness by proposing four additional postulates. which are sound relative to a qualitative version of probabilistic conditioning. Contrary to the AGM framework. the proposed postulates characterize belief revision as a process which may depend on elements of an epistemic state that are not necessarily captured by a belief set. We also show that a simple modification to the AGM framework can allow belief revision to be a function of epistemic states. We establish a model-based representation theorem which characterizes the proposed postulates and constrains. in turn. the way in which entrenchment orderings may be transformed under iterated belief revision.,True,bAipNH8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,787,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370296000380,1828656338954926535,/scholar?cites=1828656338954926535,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370296000380/pdf?md5=77b55bd6d785c54dffd327d90c84ec1d&pid=1-s2.0-S0004370296000380-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

1124615,Identifying independence in Bayesian networks,1990,Dan Geiger and Thomas Verma and Judea Pearl,20,Networks,5,507-534,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,An important feature of Bayesian networks is that they facilitate explicit encoding of information about independencies in the domain. information that is indispensable for efficient inferencing. This article characterizes all independence assertions that logically follow from the topology of a network and develops a linear time algorithm that identifies these assertions. The algorithm's correctness is based on the soundness of a graphical criterion. called d‐separation. and its optimality stems from the completeness of d‐separation. An enhanced version of d‐separation. called D‐separation. is defined. extending the algorithm to networks that encode functional dependencies. Finally. the algorithm is shown to work for a broad class of nonprobabilistic independencies.,True,bAipNH8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,602,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/net.3230200504,8141531209754797202,/scholar?cites=8141531209754797202,,http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~dang/journal_papers/geiger1990identifying.pdf,0,0,0

1124620,Causation. prediction. and search,2000,Peter Spirtes and Clark N Glymour and Richard Scheines and David Heckerman,,,,,MIT press,What assumptions and methods allow us to turn observations into causal knowledge. and how can even incomplete causal knowledge be used in planning and prediction to influence and control our environment? In this book Peter Spirtes. Clark Glymour. and Richard Scheines address these questions using the formalism of Bayes networks. with results that have been applied in diverse areas of research in the social. behavioral. and physical sciences. The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences. they are subject to uniform principles. They axiomatize the connection between causal structure and probabilistic independence. explore several varieties of causal indistinguishability. formulate a theory of manipulation. and develop asymptotically reliable procedures for searching over equivalence classes of causal models. including models of categorical data and structural equation models with and without latent variables. The authors show that the relationship between causality and probability can also help to clarify such diverse topics in statistics as the comparative power of experimentation versus observation.

In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task. including techniques based on correlation coefficients. vector-based similarity calculations. and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas. 4 experimental protocols. and the 2 evaluation metrics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions. Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks. the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset. nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation). and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other considerations include the size of database. speed of predictions. and learning time.,True,VTGXKrYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7443,https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7363,7906292212910286661,/scholar?cites=7906292212910286661,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7363,0,0,0
1124622,Learning Bayesian networks: The combination of knowledge and statistical data,1995,David Heckerman and Dan Geiger and David M Chickering,20,Machine learning,3,197-243,Kluwer Academic Publishers,We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost. we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as well as the assumption oflikelihood equivalence. which says that data should not help to discriminate network structures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the user's priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen—aprior network—and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second. using these priors. we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data.

1124623,A tutorial on learning with Bayesian networks,2008,David Heckerman,,,,33-82,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with statistical techniques. the graphical model has several advantages for data analysis. One. because the model encodes dependencies among all variables. it readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two. a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships. and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three. because the model has both a causal and probabilistic semantics. it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which often comes in causal form) and data. Four.

When used inconjunction with statistical techniques. the graphical model hasseveral advantages for data modeling. One. because the model encodesdependencies among all variables. it readily handles situations wheresome data entries are missing. Two. a Bayesian network can be used tolearn causal relationships. and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequencesof intervention.

We argue that it is more appropriate to view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential optimization problem and. consequently. that Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a more appropriate model for recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation and the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice. an MDP-based recommender system must employ a strong initial model. must be solvable quickly. and should not consume too much memory. In this paper. we describe our particular MDP model. its initialization using a predictive model. the solution and update algorithm. and its actual performance on a commercial site. We also describe the particular predictive model we used which outperforms previous models. Our system is one of a small number of commercially deployed recommender systems. As far as we know. it is the first to report experimental analysis conducted on a real commercial site.

Our results apply whenever the learning algorithm uses a scoring criterion that favors the simplest structure for which the model is able to represent the generative distribution exactly. Our results therefore hold whenever the learning algorithm uses a consistent scoring criterion and is applied to a sufficiently large dataset. We show that identifying high-scoring structures is NP-hard. even when any combination of one or more of the following hold: the generative distribution is perfect with respect to some DAG containing hidden variables; we are given an independence oracle; we are given an inference oracle; we are given an information oracle; we restrict potential solutions to structures in which each node has at most k parents. for all k≥ 3. Our proof relies on a new technical result that we establish in the appendices.

These models are of particular interest and applicability in problems of prediction. but also for elucidating underlying structure in predictor variables. One key motivating application here is in studies of gene expression in functional genomics. I first discuss empirical factor (principal components) regression. and the use of general classes of shrinkage priors. with an example. These models raise foundational questions for Bayesians. and related practical issues. due to the use of design-dependent priors and the need to recover inferences on the effects of the original. high-dimensional predictors. I then discuss latent factor models for high-dimensional variables. and regression approaches in which low-dimensional latent factors are the predictor variables. These models generalise empirical factor regression. provide for more incisive evaluation of factor structure underlying high-dimensional predictors. and resolve the modelling and practical issues in empirical factor models by casting the latter as limiting special cases. Finally. I turn to questions of prior specification in these models. and introduce sparse latent factor models to induce sparsity in factor loadings matrices. Embedding such sparse latent factor models in factor regressions provides a novel approach to variable selection with very many predictors.

It is shown that the original definition of certainty factors is inconsistent with the functions used in MYCIN to combine the quantities. This inconsistency is used to argue for a redefinition of certainty factors in terms of the intuitively appealing desiderata associated with the combining functions. It is shown that this redefinition accommodates an unlimited number of probabilistic interpretations. These interpretations are shown to be monotonic transformations of the likelihood ratio p(E‖H)/p(E‖˜H). The construction of these interpretations provides insight into the assumptions implicit in the certainty factor model.

This method constructs and optimises a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using variational calculus. resulting in an iterative algorithm which generalises the EM algorithm by maintaining posterior distributions over both latent variables and parameters. We define the family of conjugate-exponential models—which includes finite mixtures of exponential family models. factor analysis. hidden Markov models. linear state-space models. and other models of interest—for which this bound on the marginal likelihood can be computed very simply through a modification of the standard EM algorithm. In particular. we focus on applying these bounds to the problem of scoring discrete directed graphical model structures (Bayesian networks). Extensive simulations comparing the variational bounds to the usual approach based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and to a sampling-based gold standard method known as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) show that variational bounds substantially outperform BIC in finding the correct model structure at relatively little computational cost. while approaching the performance of the much more costly AIS procedure.

The authors show that although experimental and observational study designs may not always permit the same inferences. they are subject to uniform principles.

We developed a simple regular expression algorithm called NegEx that implements several phrases indicating negation. filters out sentences containing phrases that falsely appear to be negation phrases. and limits the scope of the negation phrases. We compared NegEx against a baseline algorithm that has a limited set of negation phrases and a simpler notion of scope.

This book is about the second—much more difficult—type of problem. Typical problems of causal discovery are: How will a change in commission rates affect the total sales of a company? How will a reduction in cigarette smoking among older smokers affect their life expectancy? How will a change in the formula a college uses to award scholarships affect its dropout rate?

1124654,A Bayesian approach to causal discovery,1999,David Heckerman and Christopher Meek and Gregory Cooper,19,"Computation, causation, and discovery",,141-166,,We examine the Bayesian approach to the discovery of causal DAG models and compare it to the constraint-based approach. Both approaches rely on the Causal Markov condition. but the two di er signi cantly in theory and practice. An important difference between the approaches is that the constraint-based approach uses categorical information about conditional-independence constraints in the domain. whereas the Bayesian approach weighs the degree to which such constraints hold. As a result. the Bayesian approach has three distinct advantages over its constraint-based counterpart. One. conclusions derived from the Bayesian approach are not susceptible to incorrect categorical decisions about independence facts that can occur with data sets of nite size. Two. using the Bayesian approach. ner distinctions among model structures| both quantitative and qualitative| can be made. Three. information from several models can be combined to make better inferences and to better account for modeling uncertainty.

The domain of hypercalcemic disorders is used to test solution methods that should be applicable to other medical areas. A key design philosophy underlying NESTOR is that the physicians should have control of the computer interaction to determine what is done and when. In order to provide such controllable. interactive aid. specific technical tasks to be addressed. The unifying philosophy in addressing them is the use of knowledge-based methods within a formal probability theory framework. A user interface module gives the physician control over when and how these tasks are used to aid in diagnosing the cause of a patients condition. This dissertation presents the problems that are addressed by each of the three tasks. and the details of the methods used to address them.

Observational data are passively observed. Experimental data. such as that produced by randomized controlled trials. result from the experimenter manipulating one or more variables (typically randomly) and observing the states of other variables. The paper presents a Bayesian method for learning the causal structure and parameters of the underlying causal process that is generating the data. given that (1) the data contains a mixture of observational and experimental case records. and (2) the causal process is modeled as a causal Bayesian network. This learning method was applied using as input various mixtures of experimental and observational data that were generated from the ALARM causal Bayesian network. In these experiments. the absolute and relative quantities of experimental and observational data were varied systematically. For each of these training datasets. the learning method was applied to predict the causal structure and to estimate the causal parameters that exist among randomly selected pairs of nodes in ALARM that are not confounded.

1124660,Bayesian network anomaly pattern detection for disease outbreaks,2003,Weng-Keen Wong and Andrew W Moore and Gregory F Cooper and Michael M Wagner,,,,808-815,,Early disease outbreak detection systems typically monitor health care data for irregularities by comparing the distribution of recent data against a baseline distribution. Determining the baseline is difficult due to the presence of different trends in health care data. such as trends caused by the day of week and by seasonal variations in temperature and weather. Creating the baseline distribution without taking these trends into account can lead to unacceptably high false positive counts and slow detection times. This paper replaces the baseline method of (Wong et al.. 2002) with a Bayesian network which produces the baseline distribution by taking the joint distribution of the data and conditioning on attributes that are responsible for the trends. We show that our algorithm. called WSARE 3.0. is able to detect outbreaks in simulated data with almost the earliest possible detection time while keeping a low false positive count.

This system incorporates a module for determining the entropy of a belief network and a module for constructing belief networks based on entropy calculations. Kutato constructs an initial belief network in which all variables in the database are assumed to be marginally independent. The entropy of this belief network is calculated. and that arc is added that minimizes the entropy of the resulting belief network. Conditional probabilities for an arc are obtained directly from the database. This process continues until an entropy-based threshold is reached. We have tested the system by generating databases from networks using the probabilistic logic-sampling method. and then using those databases as input to Kutato.

1124666,Bounded conditioning: Flexible inference for decisions under scarce resources,2013,Eric J Horvitz and Jaap Suermondt and Gregory F Cooper,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1304.1512,,,,We introduce a graceful approach to probabilistic inference called bounded conditioning. Bounded conditioning monotonically refines the bounds on posterior probabilities in a belief network with computation. and converges on final probabilities of interest with the allocation of a complete resource fraction. The approach allows a reasoner to exchange arbitrary quantities of computational resource for incremental gains in inference quality. As such. bounded conditioning holds promise as a useful inference technique for reasoning under the general conditions of uncertain and varying reasoning resources. The algorithm solves a probabilistic bounding problem in complex belief networks by breaking the problem into a set of mutually exclusive. tractable subproblems and ordering their solution by the expected effect that each subproblem will have on the final answer.

Traditional techniques for anomaly detection are unsatisfactory for this problem because they identify individual data points that are rare due to particular combinations of features. When applied to our scenario. these traditional algorithms discover isolated outliers of particularly strange events. such as someone accidentally shooting their ear. that are not indicative of a new outbreak. Instead. we would like to detect anomalous patterns. These patterns are groups with specific characteristics whose recent pattern of illness is anomalous relative to historical patterns. We propose using a rulebased anomaly detection algorithm that characterizes each anomalous pattern with a rule. The significance of each rule is carefully evaluated using Fisher’s Exact Test and a randomization test. Our algorithm is compared against a standard detection algorithm by measuring the number of false positives and the timeliness of detection. Simulated data. produced by a simulator that creates the effects of an epidemic on a city. is used for evaluation.

A psychometric study of attitudes towards technological risks and benefits,1978,Baruch Fischhoff and Paul Slovic and Sarah Lichtenstein and Stephen Read and Barbara Combs,9,Policy sciences,2,127-152,Kluwer Academic Publishers,One of the fundamental questions addressed by risk-benefit analysis is “How safe is safe enough?” Chauncey Starr has proposed that economic data be used to reveal patterns of acceptable risk-benefit tradeoffs. The present study investigates an alternative technique. in which psychometric procedures were used to elicit quantitative judgments of perceived risk. acceptable risk. and perceived benefit for each of 30 activities and technologies. The participants were seventy-six members of the League of Women Voters. The results indicated little systematic relationship between perceived existing risks and benefits of the 30 risk items. Current risk levels were generally viewed as unacceptably high. When current risk levels were adjusted to what would be considered acceptable risk levels. however. risk was found to correlate with benefit. Nine descriptive attributes of risk were also studied.

1124673,Hindsight is not equal to foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgment under uncertainty.,1975,Baruch Fischhoff,1,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human perception and performance,3,288,American Psychological Association,Notes that a major difference between historical and nonhistorical judgment is that the historical judge typically knows how things turned out. 3 experiments are described with a total of 479 college students. In Exp I. receipt of such outcome knowledge was found to increase the postdicted likelihood of reported events and change the perceived relevance of event-descriptive data. regardless of the likelihood of the outcome and the truth of the report. Ss were. however. largely unaware of the effect that outcome knowledge had on their perceptions. As a result. they overestimated what they would have known without outcome knowledge (Exp II). as well as what others (Exp III) actually did know without outcome knowledge. It is argued that this lack of awareness can seriously restrict one's ability to judge or learn from the past.(16 ref)(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA. all rights reserved),True,GxvFzdcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3185,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-00159-001,15864037317814267201,/scholar?cites=15864037317814267201,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA008580.pdf,0,0,0

Dordrecht,From the subjectivist point of view (de Finetti. 1937) a probability is a degree of belief in a proposition whose truth has not been ascertained. A probability expresses a purely internal state; there is no “right” or “correct” probability that resides somewhere “in reality” against which it can be compared. However. in many circumstances. it may become possible to verify the truth o£ falsity of the proposition to which a probability was attached. Today. we assess the probability of the proposition“it will rain tomorrow”. Tomorrow. we go outside and look at the rain gauge to see whether or not it has rained.

Drawing on their own experience in risk management as well as the relevant research literatures. they identify and characterise the variety of methods that have been proposed for resolving acceptable-risk problems. They subject these methods to a rigorous critique in terms of philosophical presuppositions. technical feasibility. political acceptability. and validity of underlying assumptions about human behaviour. The authors construct a framework for deciding how to make decisions about risks. and offer recommendations for research. public policy. and practice.

On the basis of appraisal-tendency theory. we predicted opposite effects for anger and fear on risk judgments and policy preferences.

1124685,Debiasing,1981,Baruch Fischoff,,,,,DECISION RESEARCH EUGENE OR,Once judgmental biases are identified. researchers start trying to eliminate them using one of two strategies. The first accepts the existence of the bias and concentrates on devising schemes. such as training programs. that will reduce it. The second claims that the bias is not very robust and important and concentrates on devising experimental situations in which it will not appear. Together. these strategies circumscribe the universe of debiasing procedures. The present paper attempts to describe the specific kinds of procedures that can and have emerged from these strategies. It then applies this list of 25 procedures to a reanalysis of debiasing studies relating to two judgmental biases. hindsight bias and overconfidence. The ten published articles on hindsight bias have attempted 14 of the 25 procedures and found none of them effective except restructuring the task so as to highlight reasons why a reported event might not have happened. One of another of the 40 papers reviewed dealing with overconfidence has tried most of the possible debiasing procedures. Here. too. most proved ineffective except for task restructuring that highlights the existence of reasons why an answer that appears right might be wrong and training with individualized feedback. Although similar reanalyses need to be done on debiasing attempts applied to other biases here. the picture that emerges here allows some speculations about the robustness of judgmental biases and the most profitable ways to study them.Descriptors:,True,GxvFzdcAAAAJ:mJbmKSuM8toC,1338,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA099435,14143779276048391961,/scholar?cites=14143779276048391961,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA099435.pdf,0,0,0

Creation of that definition is a political act. expressing the definers' values regarding the relative importance of different possible adverse consequences for a particular decision. Those values. and with them the definition of risk. can change with changes in the decisionmaker. the technologies considered. or the decision problem. After a review of the sources of controversy in defining risk. a general framework is developed. showing how these value issues can be systematically addressed. As an example. the approach is applied to characterizing the risks of six competing energy technologies. the relative riskeness of which depends upon the particular definition used.,True,GxvFzdcAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,770,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00146924,17518236324393526508,/scholar?cites=17518236324393526508,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.206.3613&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1124694,Value elicitation: Is there anything in there?,1991,Baruch Fischhoff,46,American psychologist,8,835,American Psychological Association,Eliciting people's values is a central pursuit in many areas of the social sciences. including survey research. attitude research. economics. and behavior decision theory. These disciplines differ considerably in the core assumptions they make about the nature of the values that are available for elicitation. These assumptions lead to very different methodological concerns and interpretations. as well as to different risks of reading too much or too little into people's responses. The analysis here characterizes these assumptions and the research paradigms based on them. It also offers an account of how they arise. rooted in the psychological and sociological contexts within which different researchers function.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA. all rights reserved),True,GxvFzdcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,768,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-33155-001,12085456934300324804,/scholar?cites=12085456934300324804,,,0,0,0

In each study. participants rated a given set of hazards on a range of risk characteristics and indicated the degree of risk reduction and regulation they desired. Based on this data. we explore the relationships among risk characteristics and a smaller number of dimensions (factors) derived from them. We also relate risk characteristics to people's perception of risk and their desire for risk reduction and regulation.

1124696,For those condemned to study the past: Heuristics and biases in hindsight,2002,Baruch Fischhoff and Daniel Kahneman and Paul Slovic and Amos Tversky,,Foundations of cognitive psychology: Core readings,,621-636,,Benson (1972) has identified four reasons for studying the past: to entertain. to create a group (or national) identity. to reveal the extent of human possibility. and to develop systematic knowledge about our world. knowledge that may eventually improve our ability to predict and control. On a conscious level. at least. we behavioral scientists restrict ourselves to the last motive. In its pursuit. we do case studies. program evaluations. and literature reviews. We even conduct experiments. creating artificial histories upon which we can perform our postmortems.Three basic questions seem to arise in our retrospections:(a) Are there patterns upon which we can capitalize so as to make ourselves wiser in the future?(b) Are there instances of folly in which we can identify mistakes to avoid?(c) Are we really condemned to repeat the past if we do not study it? That is. do we really learn anything by looking backward? Whatever the question we are asking. it is generally assumed that the past will readily reveal the answers it holds. Of hindsight and foresight. the latter appears as the troublesome perspective. One can explain and understand any old event if an appropriate effort is applied. Prediction. however. is acknowledged to be rather more tricky. The present essay investigates this presumption by taking a closer look at some archetypal attempts to tap the past. Perhaps its most general conclusion is that we should hold the past in a little more respect when we attempt to plumb its secrets. While the past entertains. ennobles. and expands quite readily. it enlightens only with delicate coaxing.,True,GxvFzdcAAAAJ:6Zm5LS9gQ5UC,695,http://www.umpalangkaraya.ac.id/dosen/dwisariusop/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/COGNITIVE-PSYCHOLOGY.pdf#page=638,17533914242368113097,/scholar?cites=17533914242368113097,,http://www.umpalangkaraya.ac.id/dosen/dwisariusop/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/COGNITIVE-PSYCHOLOGY.pdf#page=638,0,0,0
1124697,The role of social and decision sciences in communicating uncertain climate risks,2011,Nick Pidgeon and Baruch Fischhoff,1,Nature climate change,1,35-41,Nature Publishing Group,A major challenge facing climate scientists is explaining to non-specialists the risks and uncertainties surrounding potential changes over the coming years. decades and centuries. Although there are many guidelines for climate communication. there is little empirical evidence of their efficacy. whether for dispassionately explaining the science or for persuading people to act in more sustainable ways. Moreover. climate communication faces new challenges as assessments of climate-related changes confront uncertainty more explicitly and adopt risk-based approaches to evaluating impacts. Given its critical importance. public understanding of climate science deserves the strongest possible communications science to convey the practical implications of large. complex. uncertain physical. biological and social processes.

Our work extends previous work by Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. We design a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework. and prove that it converges to a Nash equilibrium under specified conditions. This algorithm is useful for finding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game. this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies.,True,UruIct4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1006,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.138.2589&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16611886949038527904,/scholar?cites=16611886949038527904,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.138.2589&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1124699,Nash Q-learning for general-sum stochastic games,2003,Junling Hu and Michael P Wellman,4,Journal of machine learning research,Nov,1039-1069,,We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context. using the framework of generalsum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions. and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (defined by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However. learning consistently converges in the first grid game. which has a unique equilibrium Q-function. but sometimes fails to converge in the second. which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of offline learning performance in both games. we find agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning. the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation. yielding improved performance.,True,UruIct4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,998,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume4/temp/hu03a.pdf,15770908142918829857,/scholar?cites=15770908142918829857,,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume4/temp/hu03a.pdf,0,0,0

Market mechanisms use prices derived through distributing bidding protocols to determine schedules. We investigate the existence of equilibrium prices for some general classes of scheduling problems. the quality of equilibrium solutions. and the behavior of an ascending auction mechanism and bidding protocol. To remedy the potential nonexistence of price equilibria due to complementarities in preference. we introduce additional markets in combinations of basic goods.

1124705,Fundamental concepts of qualitative probabilistic networks,1990,Michael P Wellman,44,Artificial intelligence,3,257-303,Elsevier,Graphical representations for probabilistic relationships have recently received considerable attention in AI. Qualitative probabilistic networks abstract from the usual numeric representations by encoding only qualitative relationships. which are inequality constraints on the joint probability distribution over the variables. Although these constraints are insufficient to determine probabilities uniquely. they are designed to justify the deduction of a class of relative likelihood conclusions that imply useful decision-making properties.Two types of qualitative relationship are defined. each a probabilistic form of monotonicity constraint over a group of variables. Qualitative influences describe the direction of the relationship between two variables. Qualitative synergies describe interactions among influences.The probabilistic definitions chosen justify sound and efficient inference procedures based on graphical manipulations of …,True,UruIct4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,512,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029090026V,10485194750867624525,/scholar?cites=10485194750867624525,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/191395500.pdf,0,0,0

Agents trade tasks and resources at prices determined by an auction protocol. We specify a simple set of bidding policies that. along with the auction mechanism. exhibits desirable convergence properties. The system always reaches quiescence. If the system reaches quiescence below the consumer's reserve price for the high level task. it will be in a solution state.

For the past few years. I have been exploring this approach not only as a methodology for solving particular distributed control problems. but also as a generic programming paradigm for the development of distributed systems based on these methods. By a programming paradigm. I mean that the exercise of defining a computational market leads to the specification of a procedural solution to the underlying allocation problem facing that market. I call this approach\market-oriented programming"". y To support the practice of market-oriented programming. we need an infrastructure for building market-based systems| that is. a market-oriented programming environment. Such an environment would provide a set of generic constructs for specifying the elements of a computational economy. and implement some of the facilities to manage the interaction of these elements. according to defined protocols.

1124717,Formulation of tradeoffs in planning under uncertainty,1990,Michael P Wellman,,,,,Pitman,The tradeoffformulation task is to identify the central issues in a decision problem by recognizing strategies that are inadmissible on qualitative grounds. SUDO-PLANNER formulates tradeoffs for an example medical decision problem by proving decisiontheoretically that certain plan classes are dominated based on a knowledge base of qualitative relations in the domain. The classical planning representation of goals as predicates is inadequate for choice among plans that may achieve objectives in part or with uncertainty. SUDO-PLANNER's dominance-proving architecture is a general framework for planning for partially satisfiable goals. Dominance-proving planners characterize the space of admissible plans by maintaining a specialization graph of plan classes annotated with dominance conditions derived from a domain model.Qualitative Probabilistic Networks (QPNs) are decision models expressing constraints on the joint probability distribution over a set of variables. Qualitative influences describe the direction of the relationship between two variables. Qualitative syn-ergies describe interactions among influences. The probabilistic definitions of these constraints justify sound and efficient inference procedures based on graphical manipulations of the network. SUDO-PLANNER's dominance prover uses these procedures to establish dominance relations among plan classes. SUDO-PLANNER constructs decision models (QPNs) from a multilevel knowledge base describing the effects of actions and relations among events.

Agents must simultaneously negotiate production relationships at multiple levels. with important interdependencies among inputs and outputs at each level. Combinatorial auctions address this problem by global optimization over expressed offers to engage in compound exchanges. A one-shot combinatorial auction that optimizes the reported value of the bids results in optimal allocations with truthful bids. But autonomous self-interested agents have an incentive to bid strategically in an attempt to gain extra surplus.

We introduce Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars (PSDGs) to represent an agent's plan-generation process.

Given a PSDG description of the plan-generation process. we can then use inference algorithms that exploit the particular independence properties of the PSDG language to efficiently answer plan-recognition queries.

Theoretical work has shown that explicitly accounting for uncertainty and learning in climate change can have a large impact on optimal policy. especially technology policy. However. theory also shows that the specific impacts of uncertainty are ambiguous. In this paper. we provide a framework that combines economics and decision analysis to implement probabilistic data on energy technology research and development (R&D) policy in response to global climate change. We find that. given a budget constraint. the composition of the optimal R&D portfolio is highly diversified and robust to risk in climate damages. The overall optimal investment into technical change. however. does depend (in a non-monotonic way) on the risk in climate damages.

The paper puts particular emphasis on understanding how optimal near-term R&D expenditures might vary based on the technologies pursued in the R&D program. The exploration is conducted in the context of varying impacts from R&D on the global abatement cost function. The R&D planning problem is considered first within a theoretical framework and is then pursued in a stylized application using the DICE model.

1124741,Forecasting wind energy costs and cost drivers: the views of the world’s leading experts,2016,Ryan Wiser and Karen Jenni and Joachim Seel and Erin Baker and Maureen Hand and Eric Lantz and Aaron Smith,,,,,,Wind energy supply has grown rapidly over the last decade. supported by a myriad of national and subnational energy policies and facilitated by technology advancements and related cost reductions (IEA 2013; GWEC 2015; IRENA 2015; REN21 2015). Though the vast majority of this expansion has occurred onshore (> 97%). offshore wind power deployment has also recently increased. especially in Europe. The rising maturity of wind power technology suggests that wind energy might play a significant future role in global electricity supply. perhaps especially in the context of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Wiser et al. 2011; IPCC 2014; GWEC 2014; Luderer et al. 2014; IEA 2015).The long-term contribution that wind energy makes to global energy supply. and the degree to which policy support is necessary to motivate higher levels of deployment. depends—in part—on the future costs of both onshore and offshore wind. Those costs will be affected by technology advancements. as impacted by private and public research and development (R&D). among other factors. Yet there remains sizable uncertainty about both the degree to which costs will continue to decline and the conditions that might drive greater cost reduction (Wiser et al. 2011; Lantz et al. 2012; DOE 2015a).,True,Ik2Eb_oAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,63,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0s43r9w4/qt0s43r9w4.pdf,14757238442390521009,/scholar?cites=14757238442390521009,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0s43r9w4/qt0s43r9w4.pdf,0,0,0

Expert opinions about the EP of each technology varied substantially. Measuring EP in terms of the fractional decrease in output per unit input. we found that a scenario of worldwide carbon pricing leads to a decrease in the mean energy penalty of 1–10% across the technologies. and a scenario of increased US government research and development (R&D) funding leads to a decrease in the mean energy penalty of 6–14%.

A data center can comprise many thousands of servers and can use as much energy as a small city. The massive amounts of computation power contained in these systems results in many interesting distributed systems and resource management problems. In this thesis we investigate challenges related to data centers. with a particular emphasis on how new virtualization technologies can be used to simplify deployment. improve resource efficiency. and reduce the cost of reliability. all in application agnostic ways. We first study problems that relate to the initial capacity planning required when deploying applications into a virtualized data center. We demonstrate how models of virtualization overheads can be utilized to accurately predict the resource needs of virtualized applications. allowing them to be smoothly transitioned into a data center. We next study how memory similarity can be used to guide placement when adding virtual machines to a data center. and demonstrate how memory sharing can be exploited to reduce the memory footprints of virtual machines. This allows for better server consolidation. reducing hardware and energy costs within the data center.

We begin with three key insights from scholarship and practice. First. technological innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global scales.

This study evaluates the potential costs of this approach in the industrial and municipal sectors. exploring economic. energy. and environmental costs (including CO2 emissions and possible coastal impacts). Although the energy intensity of desalination is a global concern. it is particularly urgent to rethink water supply options in Saudi Arabia because the entirety of its natural gas production is consumed domestically. primarily in petrochemical and desalination plants. This burgeoning demand is necessitating the development of more expensive high-sulfur gas resources that could make desalination even pricier.

As a response to water scarcity. air-cooled coal power plants have experienced dramatic diffusion in China since the middle 2000s. By the end of 2012. air-cooled coal-fired thermal power plants in China amounted to 112 GW. making up 14% of China’s thermal power generation capacity. But the water conservation benefit of air-cooled units is achieved at the cost of lower thermal efficiency and consequently higher carbon emission intensity. We estimate that in 2012 the deployment of air-cooled units contributed an additional 24.3–31.9 million tonnes of CO2 emissions (equivalent to 0.7–1.0% of the total CO2 emissions by China’s electric power sector …,True,sM4yknMAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,73,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es5026454,16241006196921651205,/scholar?cites=16241006196921651205,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/280424/Chaoetal_WaterPower_Accepted.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further “lock-in” of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (450 ppm CO2e).

The economic adjustment effects of long-term climate policy are investigated based on the cross-comparison of the intertemporal optimization models ReMIND-R and WITCH as well as the recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model IMACLIM-R. A number of robust findings emerge. If the international community takes immediate action to mitigate climate change. the costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 450 ppm (roughly 530–550 ppm-e) discounted at 3% are estimated to be 1.4% or lower of global consumption over the twenty-first century.

In order to assess the optimal response of the carbon market to forest sequestration. we couple two global models. An energy–economy–climate model for the study of climate policies is linked with a detailed forestry model through an iterative procedure to provide the optimal abatement strategy. Results show that forestry is a determinant abatement option and could lead to significantly lower policy costs if included. Linking forestry management to the carbon market has the potential to alleviate the policy burden of 50 ppmv or equivalently of 1 4∘ C. and to significantly decrease the price of carbon.

This recent literature has emphasized that four factors Ð two inputs and two outputs Ð should play a major role when modeling technical change in climate models. The two inputs are R&D investments and Learning by Doing. the two outputs are energy-saving and fuel switching. Indeed. R&D investments and Learning by Doing are the main drivers of a climate-friendly technical change that eventually affect both energy intensity and fuel-mix. In this paper. we present and discuss an extension of the FEEM-RICE model in which these four factors are explicitly accounted for. In our new specification of endogenous technical change. an index of energy technical change depends on both Learning by Researching and Learning by Doing. This index enters the equations defining energy intensity (ie the amount of carbon energy required to produce one unit of output) and carbon intensity (ie the level of carbonization of primarily used fuels). This new specification is embodied in the RICE 99 integrated assessment climate model and then used to generate a baseline scenario and to analyze the relationship between climate policy and technical change.

The survey focuses on eliciting probabilistic information on the future costs of advanced biofuels and on the potential role of Research. Development and Demonstration (RD&D) efforts in reducing these costs and in supporting the deployment of biofuels in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. Fifteen leading experts from different EU member states provide insights on the future potential of advanced biofuel technologies both in terms of costs and diffusion.

Under idealized conditions climate policies significantly reduce coal use in the short- and long-term. Reductions in oil and gas use are much smaller. particularly until 2030. but revenues decrease much more because oil and gas prices are higher than coal prices. A first deviation from optimal transition pathways is delayed action that relaxes global emission targets until 2030 in accordance with the Copenhagen pledges. Fossil fuel markets revert back to the no-policy case: though coal use increases strongest. revenue gains are higher for oil and gas. To balance the carbon budget over the 21st century. the long-term reallocation of fossil fuels is significantly larger—twice and more—than the short-term distortion.

To what extent can innovation policies complement carbon pricing (taxes or permit trading) and improve the economic efficiency of a mitigation policy package? To answer these questions. we use an integrated assessment model with multiple externalities and an endogenous representation of the technical progress in the energy sector. We evaluate a range of innovation policies. both as stand-alone and in combination with other mitigation policies. Our analysis indicates that innovation policies alone are unlikely to stabilize global concentration and temperature.

People are concerned about the dangers of carcinogens in air. water. and food. and they expect their representatives in government to protect them from such hazards. On the other hand. the economic costs of eliminating every suspected carcinogen from the environment would cause tremendous economic hardship. How should policymakers use science to help strike a balance between the benefits of lowering the risk of cancer and the economic costs of regulation? In this important book the authors squarely address the complex interaction of science and regulatory policy. They begin by clarifying the scientific issues that are central to regulatory decisions. then explain how and why scientists can honestly disagree about these issues. They demonstrate with two cogent case studies: the heated debates about formaldehyde and benzene. both useful but potentially toxic chemicals. By examining how scientists evaluated the risks from these chemicals. and what kinds of legislative. administrative. and judicial decisions emerged from the evaluations. the authors furnish insight into the checks and balances of health-risk regulation. They point out that overselling science in this context is harmful to both science and democracy.

Results suggest that such laws have reduced mortality among car occupants to a degree that is compatible with the predictions of technologists. However. there is weak evidence of increased mortality among some nonoccupants. a pattern predicted by risk-compensation theorists. The lifesaving effects of belt-use laws are largest in states that …,True,XmWXjosAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,158,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00057886,5776211513243546115,/scholar?cites=5776211513243546115,,,0,0,0

Would the installation of these devices necessarily reduce the fatality rate by 25 percent? The answer depends upon the response of drivers to the increased protection from dangerous accidents. If they increase their"" driving intensity""(speed. recklessness. driving while intoxicated. driving in unsafe conditions. etc.). they may realize substantially less than a 25 percent reduction in expected fatalities. Such offsetting behavior is not irrational: it merely represents a substitution of the marginal benefits of driving intensity for the reduced marginal cost of risk. If offsetting behavior actually occurs. it may be realized in increased risks for bicyclists. motorcyclists. and pedestrians.

We regulate potentially carcinogenic benzene emissions during waste operations at a cost of $19 million per year of life saved. while 70 percent of women over age fifty do not receive regular mammograms. an intervention that costs roughly $17.000 per year of life saved.That pattern of resource allocation is important because all investments. including investments in survival. carry some opportunity cost.

Using monthly Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) data from January 1976 through November 1988. time-series regression equations—including policy variables. seasonal variables. and surrogate exposure variables—are estimated for each state. The results suggest that the new laws have increased fatalities on both rural interstate and rural noninterstate highways in most states. but also that these effects differ substantially across the states.

Making sense of these methods. including the comparative benefits of one approach over another is highly significant to both research and practice of creative design. This paper demonstrates the benefit of conducting analyses of methods with the aid of a theory. Such an approach provides a clear basis for analysing different methods that could in turn be compared with each other. This approach is demonstrated through the critical analysis of advanced systematic inventive thinking (ASIT) – a practical method – using the C–K theory. a design theory that offers a formal model of creative thinking. The analysis uncovers a paradox in ASIT operation: being creative while ‘staying in the box’.

1124852,A framework using institutional analysis and the capability approach in ICT4D,2013,Julian M Bass and Brian Nicholson and Eswaran Subhramanian,9,Information Technologies & International Development,1,pp. 19-35,,Institutional theory and the capability approach have grown influential in development research and practice. Both theories offer analytical tools for interpreting and guiding information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) interventions. In this article. we propose an analytical framework that applies institutional theory and the capability approach in the domain of ICT4D. Using empirical evidence from a case study. we argue that there are benefits for both ICT4D-research and-practice of using the contrasting strengths of these analytical tools. A combined theoretical framework offers analytical and practical insights in terms of potential for stimulation (excitation) and degradation (inhibition) of development goals. The novel approach taken for combining institutional theory with the capability approach uses institutional theory to understand the social drivers that may inhibit or enable individuals from taking full advantage of ICT resources for furtherance of their lives. These social drivers could be overlooked when using any of the approaches in isolation. We also observe how enhanced capabilities can strengthen and develop institutions. In this article. we contribute a combined framework linking both theories and their attendant exciters and inhibitors. The framework’s utility is illustrated with a case study based on empirical work in the Ethiopian higher education sector.

Approaches to supporting creativity are diverse and numerous. The only way to understand the diversity and utility of these methods is through their careful analysis.

As a first step. we use Infused Design (ID) method to generate new concepts and methods in the classic discipline of statics. in addition to its prior use in the generation of a number of creative designs. The use of the ID method in the creative scientific discovery process is modeled with CK design theory. leading to better understanding of ID and CK.

This method uses a select set of nodes. the loop cutset. to render the multiply connected network singly connected. We discuss the function of the nodes of the loop cutset and a condition that must be met by the nodes of the loop cutset. We show that the problem of finding a loop cutset that optimizes probabilistic inference using the method of conditioning is NP-hard.

Air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects. First. it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty. so its cost provides an absolute cap on the cost of mitigation.

Third. because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure. air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies.We assess the ultimate physical limits on the amount of energy and land required for air capture and describe two systems that might achieve air capture at prices under 200 and 500 $/tC using current technology.Like geoengineering. air capture …,True,PfciJkgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,470,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-005-9026-x,5318072251993807984,/scholar?cites=5318072251993807984,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/file/Keithetal-AirCapture.pdf,0,0,0

1124886,A case for climate engineering,2013,David Keith,,,,,MIT Press,A leading scientist argues that we must consider deploying climate engineering technology to slow the pace of global warming. Climate engineering—which could slow the pace of global warming by injecting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere—has emerged in recent years as an extremely controversial technology. And for good reason: it carries unknown risks and it may undermine commitments to conserving energy. Some critics also view it as an immoral human breach of the natural world. The latter objection. David Keith argues in A Scientist's Case for Climate Engineering. is groundless; we have been using technology to alter our environment for years. But he agrees that there are large issues at stake. A leading scientist long concerned about climate change. Keith offers no naïve proposal for an easy fix to what is perhaps the most challenging question of our time; climate engineering is no silver bullet. But he argues that after decades during which very little progress has been made in reducing carbon emissions we must put this technology on the table and consider it responsibly. That doesn't mean we will deploy it. and it doesn't mean that we can abandon efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But we must understand fully what research needs to be done and how the technology might be designed and used. This book provides a clear and accessible overview of what the costs and risks might be. and how climate engineering might fit into a larger program for managing climate change.,True,PfciJkgAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C,344,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JXf6AAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:6QKFdUX455IJ:scholar.google.com&ots=BDuyLc5YIy&sig=YLyfljwgIr8f-MJ41Vb5sul_7Mg,10585702426365723369,/scholar?cites=10585702426365723369,,http://www.piahellertz.com/David%20Keith%20-%20Geoengineering.pdf,0,0,0
1124887,Carbon dioxide capture from atmospheric air using sodium hydroxide spray,2008,Joshuah K Stolaroff and David W Keith and Gregory V Lowry,42,Environmental science & technology,8,2728-2735,American Chemical Society,In contrast to conventional carbon capture systems for power plants and other large point sources. the system described in this paper captures CO2 directly from ambient air. This has the advantages that emissions from diffuse sources and past emissions may be captured. The objective of this research is to determine the feasibility of a NaOH spray-based contactor for use in an air capture system by estimating the cost and energy requirements per unit CO2 captured. A prototype system is constructed and tested to measure CO2 absorption. energy use. and evaporative water loss and compared with theoretical predictions. A numerical model of drop collision and coalescence is used to estimate operating parameters for a full-scale system. and the cost of operating the system per unit CO2 captured is estimated. The analysis indicates that CO2 capture from air for climate change mitigation is technically feasible using …,True,PfciJkgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,332,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702607w,3389748460710351619,/scholar?cites=3389748460710351619,,https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/davidkeith/files/97.stolaroff.aircapturecontactor.e.pdf,0,0,0
1124888,The influence of large-scale wind power on global climate,2004,David W Keith and Joseph F DeCarolis and David C Denkenberger and Donald H Lenschow and Sergey L Malyshev and Stephen Pacala and Philip J Rasch,101,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,46,16115-16120,National Academy of Sciences,Large-scale use of wind power can alter local and global climate by extracting kinetic energy and altering turbulent transport in the atmospheric boundary layer. We report climate-model simulations that address the possible climatic impacts of wind power at regional to global scales by using two general circulation models and several parameterizations of the interaction of wind turbines with the boundary layer. We find that very large amounts of wind power can produce nonnegligible climatic change at continental scales. Although large-scale effects are observed. wind power has a negligible effect on global-mean surface temperature. and it would deliver enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of CO2 and air pollutants. Our results may enable a comparison between the climate impacts due to wind power and the reduction in climatic impacts achieved by the substitution of wind for fossil fuels.,True,PfciJkgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,327,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16115.short,14700068686649728269,/scholar?cites=14700068686649728269,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/46/16115.full.pdf,0,0,0
