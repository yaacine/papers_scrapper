1277207,Reconfiguring Modularity: Closing Capability Gaps inDigital Innovation,2009,Ola Henfridsson and Lars Mathiassen and Fredrik Svahn,,,,,Association for Information Systems,It is widely acknowledged that modularity. as an approach to both product design and organization design. provides product developing firms with dynamic capabilities that allow them to more effectively respond to changes in the environment. However. the innovation literature is silent on how such dynamic capabilities might require reconfiguration as firms in traditional industries embed digital technology into their products. Drawing on theories of modularity. capability. and software engineering. we therefore conducted a multi-level study of car navigation technology. On the industry level. we investigated how automakersâ traditional hierarchical control over the innovation process was challenged as they faced multiple digital options for navigation systems design. On the firm level. we investigated how one large automaker exploited these options by reconfiguring modularity and distributing control over the innovation process. The paper makes two inter-related contributions. First. we extend the innovation literature by identifying and characterizing a capability gap that product developing firms in traditional industries face if they merely accommodate digital technology within the confines of current approaches to modularity. Second. we present a new understanding of modularity that draws on the innovation literature as well as the software engineering literature. Rather than relying mainly on components as interrelated physical parts of a hierarchical system. we argue that digital innovation requires product developers to fully exploit physical as well as logical design perspectives. and to differentiate between components as parts. as patterns. and …,True,mqk-uZAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,36,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:228421,10975955221202430802,/scholar?cites=10975955221202430802,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:228421/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0
1277208,Digital Product Innovation: Building Generative Capability through Architectural Frames,2012,Fredrik Svahn,,,,,,Over the last decades we have witnessed a profound digitalization of tangible products. While this shift offers great opportunities. it also exposes product developing industries to significant challenges. In these industries organizations. markets. and technologies are tuned for mass production. providing competitive advantage through scale economics. Typically. firms exercise modular strategies to deliver such scale benefits. Rooted in Herbert Simon’s notion of near decomposability. modular product architectures allow for production assets. such as tools. processes. and plants. to be effectively reused across product variants and over generations of designs. However. they come at a price; modularity requires overall design specifications to be frozen well before production. In practice. this tends to inscribe functional purpose in the structures of the system. effectively preventing firms from taking advantage of the speed by which digitized products can be developed and modified. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate and explain how product developing organizations adapt architectural thinking to balance the proven benefits of modularity and the emerging opportunities provided by digital technology. In doing so. it introduces a complementary architectural frame. grounded in Christopher Alexander’s seminal work on patterns. This frame associates the concept of architecture with generativity and reuse of ideas. rather than scale economics and reuse of physical assets. Sensitizing the theoretical framework through a longitudinal case study of digital product innovation this thesis derives several implications for theory and practice.

1277209,Applying options thinking to shape generativity in digital innovation: An action research into connected cars,2015,Fredrik Svahn and Rikard Lindgren and Lars Mathiassen,,,,4141-4150,IEEE,Although extant research convincingly argues that managers can change product innovation practices by exploiting new forms of generativity afforded by digital technology. the literature has so far been silent on how incumbent firms may conceive of and implement requisite generative capability. Against this backdrop. we report from an action research study into a digital innovation initiative aimed at developing connected cars. The managers in charge of the initiative engaged us as they faced considerable skepticism and push-back from the organization. To help the firm embrace new innovation norms and practices. we therefore infused innovation theory and options thinking into the group of managers as a means to conceive of and implement generative capability. As a result. we present and validate an integrative theoretical model of how incumbent firms may leverage digital options thinking to shape their …,True,mqk-uZAAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,23,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7070316/,17898410953656248207,/scholar?cites=17898410953656248207,,,,0,0,0

This data is often multivariate and increasingly. the datasets are very large. To help us explore all this data. numerous visualisation applications. both commercial and research prototypes. have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. Whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data. most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays. brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. This paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods. classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly. in terms of the benefits and losses. The aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance. and …,True,m6AAw9wAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,466,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4376143/,8153732051450270284,/scholar?cites=8153732051450270284,,,http://asus.myds.me:6543/paper/ktall/198%20-%202007%20-%20A%20Taxonomy%20of%20Clutter%20Reduction%20for%20Information%20Visualisation.pdf,0,0,0

Previous work on the development of formal models of ‘undo’ has been restricted to single user systems and has focused on the functionality of undo. as opposed to discussing the support that users require from any error recovery facility. Motivated by new issues that arise in the context of computer supported co-operative work. the authors aim to integrate formal modelling of undo with an analysis of how users understand undo facilities. Together. these combined perspectives of the system and user lead to concrete design advice for implementing an undo facility.

Evaluating architectures is difficult for two main reasons. First. there is no common language used to describe different architectures. Second. there is no clear way of understanding an architecture with respect to an organization's life cycle concerns -software quality concerns such as maintainability portability. modularity. reusability. and so forth.

1277232,Affective interaction: How emotional agents affect users,2009,Russell Beale and Chris Creed,67,,9,755-776,Academic Press,Embodied agents have received large amounts of interest in recent years. They are often equipped with the ability to express emotion. but without understanding the impact this can have on the user. Given the amount of research studies that are utilising agent technology with affective capabilities. now is an important time to review the influence of synthetic agent emotion on user attitudes. perceptions and behaviour. We therefore present a structured overview of the research into emotional simulation in agents. providing a summary of the main studies. re-formulating appropriate results in terms of the emotional effects demonstrated. and an in-depth analysis illustrating the similarities and inconsistencies between different experiments across a variety of different domains.

This paper investigates the psychological impact of simulated emotional expressions on computer users with a particular emphasis on how mismatched facial and audio expressions are perceived (e.g. a happy face with a concerned voice). In a within-subjects repeated measures experiment (N = 68). mismatched animations were perceived as more engaging. warm. concerned and happy when a happy or warm face was in the animation (as opposed to a neutral or concerned face) and when a happy or warm voice was in the animation (as opposed to a neutral or concerned voice). The results appear to follow cognitive dissonance theory as subjects attempted to make mismatched expressions consistent on both the visual and audio dimensions of animations. resulting in confused perceptions of the emotional expressions.

1277237,Using emotion simulation to influence user attitudes and behavior,2005,Chris Creed and Russell Beale,,Proceedings of the 2005 Workshop on the role of emotion in HCI,,,,Humans have a natural tendency to unconsciously treat computers as though they are social actors. Many of the human-human social rules that have been well researched and defined in social psychology also seem to apply in human-computer interaction (HCI). This presents an opportunity for computers to use many of the principles and rules from human-human interaction and utilise them for enhancing HCI. One such set of principles that have been extensively investigated and examined in social psychology are influence strategies. A number of different approaches and techniques can be used to influence another’s attitudes and behaviour. These persuasive techniques could potentially be used by computers to influence or change user attitudes and behaviour for beneficial purposes (eg smoking cessation or improving exercise behaviour).In this project I will investigate how we respond to interface agents which make use of influence strategies when attempting to change our attitudes and behaviour toward eating. The manipulation of emotions is an essential aspect of attitude and behaviour change and it is proposed that the role of emotion in HCI will also be investigated. Interface designers often incorporate emotional expressions and statements into interface agents. through the use of textual content. synthetic or recorded speech. embodied characters. or multimedia video. without an understanding of the psychological impact on users. Moreover. it is largely unknown how strong user responses are to the synthetic emotional expressions made by computers.

In a parallel development to the spread of personal technology. since the early 1980s schools. colleges and universities have experimented with handheld technology for learning. including classroom response systems. data probes. and handheld writing tools. Universities allow students to bring laptop computers to lectures and some schools are now providing pupils with Personal Digital Assistants and tablet computers.

The relationship of fun to usability is discussed and three dimensions of fun; Endurability. Engagement. and Expectations are described. A set of tools that can be used in empirical studies to measure these dimensions of fun is described in detail. These tools include a Smileyometer. a Fun-Sorter and an Again-Again table. Three user trials. in which the tools have been used. are described and suggestions are made for the use of each of the tools with children. A discussion of the efficacy of the tools presents the findings that there is a sufficient subset that can be used to give a reliable measure of fun. Dependent on the nature of the event being evaluated and on the number of activities being compared; the subset will be differently constructed.

At the same time context-aware applications can provide timely support for user activities by responding to changes in the user’s state and acting accordingly. We describe our work on developing a generic context awareness architecture that is being deployed in a gallery space to enhance learner engagement with the gallery exhibits. Our system makes use of contextual information to determine what content should be displayed on the device. Users can also navigate this content by explicitly changing their context in the dimensions of physical location and dwell time. Visitors have the opportunity to physically interact with the abstract information layer that is overlaid on the gallery space.

One of the most obvious aspects of context is location (Small. Smailagic and Siewiorek 2000). and several methods exist to determine a user’s position. varying not just in the accuracy of the information they provide. but also in the extent to which they intrude on the user’s experience. Issues with intrusiveness also arise when this information is used. For instance. a user may not necessarily want content in their browser automatically updated whenever they change position. or when they are busy with other activities.This paper describes the ongoing development of a testbed to explore some of these methods and issues by modelling a mobile learning scenario involving a visit to an art gallery.

The objective is to enable a building-management system to be used for forecasting and detection of abnormal energy use. First. an outlier-detection method is proposed to identify abnormally high or low energy use in a building. Then a canonical variate analysis is employed to describe latent variables of daily electricity-consumption profiles. which can be used to group the data sets into different clusters. Finally. a simple classifier is used to predict the daily electricity-consumption profiles. A case study. based on a mixed-use environment. was studied.

Given that a significant proportion of that energy is typically used to maintain building temperature. establishing the optimal control of the buildings thermal system is important. This requires an understanding of the thermal dynamics of the building. which is often obtained from physical thermal models. However. these models require detailed building parameters to be specified and these can often be difficult to determine. In this paper. we propose an evolutionary approach to parameter identification for thermal models that are formulated as an optimization task. A state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm. i.e.. SaNSDE+. has been developed. A fitness function is defined. which quantifies the difference between the energy-consumption time-series data that are derived from the identified parameters and that given by simulation with a …,True,k7MboYgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,29,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6105579/,16333681117839795959,/scholar?cites=16333681117839795959,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.421.1943&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1277325,Simulating evolution with a computational model of embryogeny,2006,Christopher Paul Bowers,,,,,,Natural evolution is an incredibly complex dynamical system which we are still grasping to understand. One could argue that the evolutionary search process itself is not the most important part of evolution. but rather it is the evolved representational structures and physical implementations of the genotype-phenotype mappings that make it so powerful. One such behaviour is embryogeny. the process by which genetic representations within cells control the development of a multi-cellular organism. Evolution of complex organisms is highly dependent upon biological mechanisms such as embryogeny. and this has fundamental consequences.The objective of this work is to investigate these consequences for a simulated evolutionary search process using a computational model of embryogeny. The model simulates the dynamics achieved within biological systems between the genetic representation of an individual and the mapping to its phenotypic representation. It is not an attempt to produce a biologically accurate or plausible model of the cell. growth or genetics. The model is used to create individuals which develop into multi-component patterns in two dimensions. and their properties are analysed. Solutions obtained for these pattern formation problems are shown to produce robust behaviour when exposed to perturbations and to be scalable in terms of the size of solutions produced. Modularity in the structure of these solutions is also demonstrated. The extent and limitations of these capabilities are explored.,True,k7MboYgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,14,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.113.2806&rep=rep1&type=pdf,18036653855400432281,/scholar?cites=18036653855400432281,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.113.2806&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This approach may help to promote a better understanding of technology-mediated interaction in systems. as well as helping in the formulation of hypotheses and predictions concerning distributed situation awareness. It is proposed that agents within a system each hold their own situation awareness. which may be very different from (although compatible with) that of other agents. It is argued that we should not always hope for. or indeed want. sharing of this awareness. as different system agents have different purposes.

The first is that the learning landscape is extraordinarily turbulent at present. in no small part due to technological drivers. Online social learning is emerging as a significant phenomenon for a variety of reasons. which we review. in order to motivate the concept of social learning. The second challenge is to identify different types of SLA and their associated technologies and uses. We discuss five categories of analytic in relation to online social learning; these analytics are either inherently social or can be socialised.

In helping children understand participation in PD. a central aspect is the necessity to help children understand how their design ideas are used which itself challenges researchers to seek a fair and equitable process that is describable and defensible. The TRAck (tracking. representing and acknowledging) Method. is described as an initial process that could meet this need. This is evaluated. in two forms. in a PD study with 84 children.

We crafted a trajectory through each sculpture. combining textual and audio instructions to drive directed viewing. movement and touching while listening to accompanying music. We designed key transitions along the way to oscillate between moments of social interaction and isolated personal engagement. and to deliver official interpretation only after visitors had been given the opportunity to make their own. We describe how visitors generally followed our trajectory. engaging with sculptures and making interpretations that sometimes challenged the received interpretation.

We then consider the deployment of network control and policy system interfaces in domestic settings. highlighting the ways in which household members collaboratively exploited these to support network governance. Our results suggest that an important feature of network policy in domestic contexts is that rules about network activity are shaped by and answerable to the moral reasoning that governs domestic life.

Formal methods-the attempt to provide methods that rigourously and unambiguously describe the behaviour of a computer program or system-is receiving a great deal of attention in human-computer interaction (HCI). Topics such as the specification of a system. the construction of a system from its specification and the abstraction of a specification from an existing system. are clearly of great theoretical and practical interest. The contributors to the work are well-known in the field of HCI and their articles cover much of the work in the area.

People entering numbers are to be expected to make errors. but shockingly few systems make any effort to detect. block or otherwise manage errors. Worse. errors may be ignored but processed in arbitrary ways. with unintended results. A standard class of error (defined in the paper) is an ‘out by 10 error’. which is easily made by miskeying a decimal point or a zero. In safety-critical domains. such as drug delivery. out by 10 errors generally have adverse consequences. Here. we expose the extent of the problem of numeric errors in a very wide range of systems.

1277424,Generating accurate rule sets without global optimization,1998,Eibe Frank and Ian H Witten,,,,,University of Waikato. Department of Computer Science,The two dominant schemes for rule-learning. C4.5 and RIPPER. both operate in two stages. First they induce an initial rule set and then they refine it using a rather complex optimization stage that discards (C4.5) or adjusts (RIPPER) individual rules to make them work better together. In contrast. this paper shows how good rule sets can be learned one rule at a time. without any need for global optimization. We present an algorithm for inferring rules by repeatedly generating partial decision trees. thus combining the two major paradigms for rule generation-creating rules from decision trees and the separate-and-conquer rule-learning technique. The algorithm is straightforward and elegant: despite this. experiments on standard datasets show that it produces rule sets that are as accurate as and of similar size to those generated by C4.5. and more accurate than RIPPER’s. Moreover. it operates efficiently. and because it avoids postprocessing. does not suffer the extremely slow performance on pathological example sets for which the C4.5 method has been criticized.,True,BSFdGw0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1653,https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/1047,309517554613110512,/scholar?cites=309517554613110512,,,https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/1047/uow-cs-wp-1998-02.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1277425,Data compression using adaptive coding and partial string matching,1984,John Cleary and Ian Witten,32,IEEE transactions on Communications,4,396-402,IEEE,The recently developed technique of arithmetic coding. in conjunction with a Markov model of the source. is a powerful method of data compression in situations where a linear treatment is inappropriate. Adaptive coding allows the model to be constructed dynamically by both encoder and decoder during the course of the transmission. and has been shown to incur a smaller coding overhead than explicit transmission of the model's statistics. But there is a basic conflict between the desire to use high-order Markov models and the need to have them formed quickly as the initial part of the message is sent. This paper describes how the conflict can be resolved with partial string matching. and reports experimental results which show that mixed-case English text can be coded in as little as 2.2 bits/ character with no prior knowledge of the source.,True,BSFdGw0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1619,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1096090/,2440749388181571503,/scholar?cites=2440749388181571503,,,,0,0,0

1277433,Learning. trust. and technological collaboration,1993,Mark Dodgson,46,Human relations,1,77-95,Sage Publications,Companies increasingly collaborate in their technological activities. Collaboration enables firms to learn about uncertain and turbulent technological change. and enhances their ability to deal with novelty. A number of studies reveal the importance for successful collaboration of high levels of inter-personal trust between scientists. engineers. and managers in the different partners. However. these individual relationships are vulnerable to labor turnover and inter-personal difficulties. Using two examples of highly successful technological collaborations. it is argued that the survival of such relationships in the face of these inevitable inter-personal problems requires the establishment of interorganizational trust. Such trust is characterized by community of interest. organizational cultures receptive to external inputs. and widespread and continually supplemented knowledge among employees of the status and purpose …,True,ju1sjFoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,967,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872679304600106,12175928328156475663,/scholar?cites=12175928328156475663,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31369060/Human_Relations.pdf,0,0,0

Some eminent economists such as JK Galbraith (1957) have argued for the importance of large size and monopoly power while others. perhaps most notably EF Schumacher (1973). have strongly argued that'small is beautiful'. We will argue that the role played in innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs-here taken to be firms employing under 500) is strongly sectorally influenced; that the relative innovatory roles of large and small firms can vary over the industry lifecycle; and that dynamic complementarities frequently exist between the technological change activities of large and small firms.,True,ju1sjFoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,453,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16261561689342566511&hl=en&oi=scholarr,16261561689342566511,/scholar?cites=16261561689342566511,,,,0,0,0
1277439,Think. play. do: Technology. innovation. and organization,2005,Mark Dodgson and David Gann and Ammon J Salter,,,,,Oxford University Press on Demand,The innovation process is the most important of all business processes. Innovation is the means by which value is constructed and efficiencies are created. It is the source of sustainable competitive advantage. This book shows how the innovation process is changing profoundly. Part of the change results from the application of new technologies to the innovation process itself. A new category of technology has emerged which we call'innovation technology'. This includes simulation and modeling. visualization and economical and ameliorates some of its uncertainties. These technological changes are accompanied by changing organization structures and skills requirements. The technologies are used in fast moving. creative environments and are suite to project-based organization. They also require the development of new'craft'skills to realize the possibilities created by the new'code'. The book outlines a new way of thinking about innovation. Traditional definitions of'research'.'development'and'engineering'. imply a progressive linearity which doesn't exist in reality. They are also associated with organizational departments. which are breaking down where once they existed. and are in any case non-existent in the vast majority of firms. They also fail to capture the central importance of design in innovation. We propose a new schema for the innovation process: Think. Play. Do. Innovation requires creating new ideas and thinking about new options. playing with them to see if they are practical. economical and marketable. and then doing: making the innovation real.

Justifications for innovation policy generally relate to notions of market failure that are applicable in all nations in all conditions. In this paper we develop a broad framework for NIS analysis. involving free market. coordination and complex-evolutionary system approaches. Within this framework we explore the evolving relationship between market failure and systems approaches to innovation policy in the case of Australia. Drawing on information and analysis collected for a major review of Australia's NIS. and the government's 10-year plan in response to it. we show how the free market trajectory of policy-making of past decades is being extended …,True,ju1sjFoAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,305,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733311000965,3305583473729035756,/scholar?cites=3305583473729035756,,,https://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/centre-for-business-research/downloads/working-papers/wp397.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,A central part of the innovation process concerns the way firms go about organizing search for new ideas that have commercial potential. New models of innovation have suggested that many innovative firms have changed the way they search for new ideas. adopting open search strategies that involve the use of a wide range of external actors and sources to help them achieve and sustain innovation.

In that literature. three main methodological approaches have been adopted — econometric studies. surveys and case studies. Econometric studies are subject to certain methodological limitations but they suggest that the economic benefits are very substantial. These studies have also highlighted the importance of spillovers and the existence of localisation effects in research. From the literature based on surveys and on case studies. it is clear that the benefits from public investment in basic research can take a variety of forms. We classify these into six main categories. reviewing the evidence on the nature and extent of each type. The relative importance of these different forms of benefit apparently varies with scientific field. technology and industrial sector.

It is based on a study of how design. engineering and construction firms develop and produce buildings and structures. We contend that these project-based. service-enhanced forms of enterprise are not adequately addressed in the innovation literature. Project-based firms rely upon combining technical expertise from other organisations in order to deliver their own technical capabilities. usually in one-off processes. The paper argues that these firms are only able to effectively harness and reproduce their technological capabilities by integrating project and business processes within the firm.

At the same time. firms need also to be focused on capturing the returns from their innovative ideas. This gives rise to a paradox of openness—the creation of innovations often requires openness. but the commercialization of innovations requires protection. Based on econometric analysis of data from a UK innovation survey. we find a concave relationship between firms’ breadth of external search and formal collaboration for innovation. and the strength of the firms’ appropriability strategies. We show that this concave relationship is stronger for breadth of formal collaboration than for external search. There is also partial evidence suggesting that the relationship is less pronounced for both external search and formal collaboration if firms do not draw ideas from or collaborate with competitors.

Rather than simply ‘moving downstream’ into services (as much of the business strategy literature assumes). this paper argues that the provision of integrated solutions is attracting firms—traditionally based in manufacturing and services—to occupy a new base in the value stream centred on ‘systems integration’.

First. it describes the bottom-up.                 ‘project-led’ phases of learning that occur when a firm moves                 into a new technology/market base: an exploratory ‘vanguard                 project’ phase; a ‘project-to-project’ phase to                 capture lessons learned; and a ‘project-to-organization’ phase                 when an organization increases its capabilities to deliver many projects. Second. it                 addresses the ‘business-led’ learning (within which the                 project-led learning is embedded) that occurs when ‘top-down’                 strategic decisions are taken to create and exploit the company-wide resources and                 capabilities required to perform increasingly predictable and routine project activities.,True,hRiMcx0AAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,832,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0170840604048002,4058931639421700661,/scholar?cites=4058931639421700661,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Davies10/publication/215915423_Building_Project_Capabilities_From_Exploratory_to_Exploitative_Learning/links/5540d1580cf23222272f90e1.pdf,0,0,0

The industrial marketing literature suggests that the origins of this business model can be traced back to early 1960s when firms adopted strategies and organizations for ‘systems selling’. The marketing literature helps us to identify two contrasting types of organizations: (1) the vertically-integrated systems seller that produces all the product and service components in a system; and (2) the systems integrator that coordinates integration of components supplied by external firms. The paper uses these two ideal types to analyse the strategies and organizations of five case study firms that have recently attempted to move into the provision of integrated solutions.

Rather than performing all productive tasks in-house. companies are building the capabilities to design and integrate systems. while managing networks of component and subsystem suppliers.

Systems integration is a strategic task that pervades business management not only at the technical level but also at the management and strategic levels. This book shows how and why this new kind of systems integration has evolved into an emerging model of industrial organization whereby firms. and groups of firms. join together different types of knowledge. skill and activity. as well as hardware. software. and human resources to produce new products for the marketplace. This book is the first to systematically explore systems integration from a business and innovation perspective. Contributors delve deeply into the nature. dimensions and dynamics of the new systems integration. deploying research and analytical techniques from a wide variety of disciplines including. the theory of the firm. the history of technology. industrial organization. regional studies. strategic management. and innovation studies. This wealth of research capability provides deep insights into the new model of systems integration and supports this with an abundance of empirical evidence.

Organizations cope with complexity by decomposing a project into different levels of systems integration with clearly-defined interfaces and buffers between levels and individual component subsystems. At the “meta systems integration” level. an organization has to be established with the capabilities to understand the total system of systems. manage external interfaces with the multiple stakeholder sand coordinate the integration of its component parts.

A particular feature of OSS is that important resources are not directly controlled by firms. but partly reside within communities that co-exist with the firms. Despite this. firms explicitly try to utilize the resources within these communities in order to create and appropriate value. Consequently. the relationships that firms have to these communities influence their way of doing business. Based on case studies of Nordic OSS firms. a typology consisting of symbiotic. commensalistic. and parasitic approaches to handle the firm–community relationship is developed. Depending on the chosen approach. firms encounter different managerial issues and also use different operational means of subtle control.

A new more open model of innovation suggests that firms can benefit from sources of innovation that stem from outside the firm. The central theme of this paper is how firms try to unlock communities as complementary assets. These communities exist outside firm boundaries beyond ownership or hierarchical control. Because of practices developed by communities to protect their work. firms need to assign individuals to work in these communities in order to gain access to developments and. to an extent. influence the direction of the community.

Soliciting suggestions is a form of distant search. since it allows organizations to tap into knowledge that may not reside within their organizational boundaries. Organizations engaging in distant search often face a large pool of suggestions. an outcome we refer to as crowding. When crowding occurs. organizations. given a limited attention span. can attend to only a subset of suggestions. Our core argument is that crowding narrows the attention of organizations; that is. despite organizations’ efforts to reach out to external contributors and access suggestions that capture distant knowledge. they are more likely to pay attention to suggestions that are familiar. not distant.

We highlight six factors: shared organizational foci. shared traits and interests. tie advantages from popularity. tie reinforcement from third parties. tie strength and multiplexity. and the instrumental returns from the products of ties. Findings suggest that ties form when unfamiliar people identify desirable and matching traits in potential partners. By contrast. ties persist when familiar people reflect on the quality of their relationship and shared experiences. The former calls for shallow. short-term strategies for assessing a broad array of potential ties; the latter calls for long-term strategies and substantive assessments of a relationship’s worth so as to draw extended rewards …,True,vUN2e88AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,278,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839212474272,14859763317904266499,/scholar?cites=14859763317904266499,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43808364/Ties_That_Last_Tie_Formation_and_Persist20160317-32411-1j2j4zm.pdf,0,0,0

The industrial marketing literature suggests that the origins of this business model can be traced back to early 1960s when firms adopted strategies and organizations for ‘systems selling’. The marketing literature helps us to identify two contrasting types of organizations: (1) the vertically-integrated systems seller that produces all the product and service components in a system; and (2) the systems integrator that coordinates integration of components supplied by external firms.

Research has began to illustrate the specific ways in which so-called complex products and systems (CoPS) are produced by firms. often working together in projects. and how innovation processes in CoPS differ from those commonly found in mass produced goods. This is an important research endeavour for at least three reasons. First. CoPS play a vital part in the modern economy and wider society. As the major capital goods which underpin manufacturing. services. trade and distribution. CoPS play a critical role in modern industrial and economic progress. As Rosenberg. N. 1976.

Second. because much conventional innovation wisdom is derived from research on high volume consumer products. new evidence. models and concepts are needed to properly understand innovation processes in CoPS. Third. at the practical levels of firm strategy and government policy. a robust understanding of innovation in CoPS is needed to enable firms to improve their performance and to guide the policy and regulatory agencies directly involved in decision-making in CoPS.

Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable or in flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across practices. We clarify these dimensions. drawing on and extending the literature on boundary objects. and connecting it with work on epistemic and technical objects.

It seeks to complement methods for measuring performance in construction by providing feedback and capturing perceptions of design quality embodied in buildings. The research team worked closely with the sponsors and an industry steering group to develop the indicators that could be readily used by clients and practitioners to better understand and promote value through design. The development and piloting process was explored within a context of lessons from earlier attempts by others.

What is missing is a sense of how the use of these ‘things’ is patterned across both industrial settings and time. This research addresses this gap with a particular emphasis on visual materials. Practices are analysed in two contrasting design settings: a capital goods manufacturer and an architectural firm. Materials are observed to be treated both as frozen. and hence unavailable for change; and as fluid. open and dynamic. In each setting temporal patterns of unfreezing and refreezing are associated with the different types of materials used.

We investigate the sense-making that scientists engage in as part of their participation in technology transfer and postulate that this process involves a potential modification in their role identity. We analyzed more than 70 h of interview data at a premier U.S. public research university. We observe that scientists invoke rationales for involvement that are congruent with their academic role identity. They typically adopt a hybrid role identity that comprises a focal academic self and a secondary commercial persona.

1277519,Innovation ecosystems,2014,Erkko Autio and L Thomas,,,,204-288,The Oxford handbook of innovation management,The notion of ‘ecosystems’ provides an attractive metaphor to describe a range of value creating interactions and relationships between sets of interconnected organizations. First introduced in practitioner literature in the mid-1990s (Moore. 1993. 1996). this metaphor has been increasingly adopted in research journals such as the Strategic Management Journal (Teece. 2007; Pierce. 2009; Adner and Kapoor. 2010; Gulati. Puranam. and Tushman. 2012). It has recently been argued that the focus of marketing and strategy must be on shaping the ecosystem in which the firm resides (Singer. 2006). and firms should increasingly move away from industry-focused strategic planning towards strategizing within and around ecosystems (Iansiti and Levien. 2004b). Arguably. the attractiveness of this rather loosely defined and versatile metaphor rests on its ability to evoke and highlight interdependencies between organizations and to provide a fresh way to think about specialization. co-evolution. and co-creation of value (Frels. Shervani. and Srivastava. 2003; Adner and Kapoor. 2010). But. to use another often (ab?) used metaphor. do ecosystems have legs? Do notions of ecosystem add insight beyond existing constructs of broadly similar content. such as value chains and supply networks. or are we dealing simply with yet another convenient catchphrase that allows management consultants to substitute impression for substance? A cursory reading of the literature would certainly suggest ample reason to be sceptical. Most of the uses of the term are found in practitioner literature. with only few treatments in academic journals; definitions proliferate and …,True,t1qZ7xwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,489,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZBJwAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA204&dq=info:cvcL_JeDqmkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Duvb5JZswh&sig=yV7CQDViK7dxwbTWFaJ5mvWwMqw,7614042808815187826,/scholar?cites=7614042808815187826,,,http://platformvaluenow.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e012_Autio-Thomas-LDWT_01.pdf,0,0,0

Specifically. the conceptual similarities and differences of entrepreneurial ecosystems relative to. for instance. clusters. “knowledge clusters.” regional systems of innovation. and “innovative milieus” remain unclear. Drawing on research on industrial districts and agglomerations. clusters. and systems of innovation. we suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystems differ from traditional clusters by their emphasis on the exploitation of digital affordances; by their organization around entrepreneurial opportunity discovery and pursuit; by their emphasis on business model innovation; by voluntary horizontal knowledge spillovers; and by cluster‐external locus of entrepreneurial opportunities.

Together these constitute a strategic process of ecosystem evolution from incumbent‐centred to disruptor‐centred. We identify the phenomenon of a ‘disruptor's gambit’. where the disruptor reveals its intentions early on through effective framing. followed by rapid adaptation of its business model to satisfy ecosystem needs. These processes generate a virtuous framing‐adaptation cycle. where feed‐forward and feedback enable rapid response to customers and partners. while engaging them as force multipliers during new ecosystem creation.

The model consists of three circuits. First. in circuits of activity. individuals attempt to introduce new discursive statements. through the use of symbols. narratives. metaphors. etc. aimed at evoking concepts to create particular objects. These activities must intersect with circuits of performativity. This occurs when. for example. concepts are contextually embedded and have meaning for other actors; when symbols. narratives and metaphors possess receptivity; and when the subject position of the enunciator warrants voice. Third. when these two circuits intersect. connectivity occurs as the new discursive statements `take'.

1277539,Metaphors of communication and organization,1999,Linda L Putnam and Nelson Phillips and Pamela Chapman and SR Clegg and Cynthia Hardy and WR Nord,,Managing organizations: Current issues,,125-158,Sage Publications Ltd,Perhaps no other construct pervades organizational studies more than the term communication. The ubiquitous nature of the term. however. contributes to its elusiveness and to the difficulty in distinguishing it from such related terms as information. channel. and media and from the myriad of organizational concepts that incorporate nuances of the term. Classical organizational theorists have equated communication with written documents and the authority to give commands (Weber 1947). the upward flow of messages and the persuasion of workers (Taylor 1947). the horizontal flow of information (Fayol 1949). listening and informal communication (Roethlisberger 1941). feedback and circular behavior (Follett 1941). decision premises (Simon 1957). and formal channels of communication (Barnard 1968). Contemporary organizational theorists treat communication as synonymous with such constructs as information processing (Galbraith 1973). social networks (Rogers and Kincaid 1981; Tichy and Fombrun 1979). coordination (Hage 1974). and participation (Likert 1967; Miller and Monge 1986). Communication. then. has become a catch-all term that infuses most topics in organization studies and crosses most chapters in this Handbook.Confusion also exists. at both the theoretical and the practical level. concerning the relationship between organization and communication (Smith 1993; Taylor 1995; Taylor and Van Every 1993).

The discussion addresses recent theory in understanding the regime transformation process. We argue that these approaches place too much emphasis on the role of technological'niches' as the principal locus for regime change. Instead. we argue that there is a range of different'transition contexts' in which regime change can take place. Niches are protected'experimental settings'(Rip and Kemp. 1998) where norms and practices are developed which depart from those of an incumbent technological regime. According to niche-based understandings. regime changes begin when practices and norms developed in the niche become adopted more widely. Their influence grows and gathers momentum. until eventually the wider technological regime becomes completely transformed by the configurations originally nurtured within the niche. This is an elegant and plausible model. supported by a rich body of historical empirical evidence. However. there is a danger that attention to this particular mechanism may have inhibited complementary and more multidimensional understandings of regime change. In this chapter. we pose the question as to whether there may be a greater plurality of possible transformation pathways. We discuss the possibility of a number of specific alternative contexts and drivers for regime change. with significant implications for both research and policy analysis.

It argues that adaptation to climate change has many similarities with processes of organisational learning. The paper suggests that business organisations face a number of obstacles in learning how to adapt to climate change impacts. especially in relation to the weakness and ambiguity of signals about climate change and the uncertainty about benefits flowing from adaptation measures.

Technology is seen as both the root-cause of many environmental problems. while also offering the means for reducing the ecological footprint of human activities. Recently this debate has become more urgent. partly as a result of renewed interest in policy communities. and partly as an outcome of conceptual and theoretical developments in the study of innovation and the environment. Policy communities are faced with major challenges including questions about how industrial economies can be radically decarbonised. and how step-jumps in resource efficiency may be achieved. New research on innovation and the environment emphasises the importance of looking at the level of technological systems and at the link between technologies and the institutional settings they are embedded within. In The Netherlands this has led to an important policy debate about the management of ‘system innovations’ in pursuit of high-level sustainability objectives (VROM. 2001).

Key to explanations of change is the interaction between nested levels (niche. regime. landscape) constituting socio-technical systems over time. This paper proposes a second generation. multi-scalar MLP that explicitly incorporates a spatial scale. Recent developments in innovation studies and contributions from regional studies and geography are reviewed. We draw on notions of space as being relational. fluid and contested by institutionally situated actors. Dynamics in socio-technical systems are explained not only by interactions between modes of structuration and developments over time. but also by interactions between actors and institutions situated across different levels of spatial scale.

Research has began to illustrate the specific ways in which so-called complex products and systems (CoPS) are produced by firms. often working together in projects. and how innovation processes in CoPS differ from those commonly found in mass produced goods. This is an important research endeavour for at least three reasons. First. CoPS play a vital part in the modern economy and wider society. As the major capital goods which underpin manufacturing. services. trade and distribution. CoPS play a critical role in modern industrial and economic progress. As Rosenberg. N. 1976. Technological change in the machine tool industry. 1840–1910. In: Perspectives on Technology. Cambridge Univ. Press. Cambridge. Rosenberg (1976) has argued. capital goods are a key point of entry of new technology into the economic system. Second. because much conventional innovation wisdom is derived from research on high volume consumer products. new evidence. models and concepts are needed to properly understand innovation processes in CoPS. Third. at the practical levels of firm strategy and government policy. a robust understanding of innovation in CoPS is needed to enable firms to improve their performance and to guide the policy and regulatory agencies directly involved in decision-making in CoPS.

Contrasting the sources of incremental and radical process innovation. our study indicates that there may be complementarities between them.

R eichstein T. and S alter A. Exploring the effect of geographical proximity and university quality on university–industry collaboration in the United Kingdom. Regional Studies. This paper concerns the geographical distance between a firm and the universities in its local area. It is argued that firms' decisions to collaborate with universities for innovation are influenced by both geographical proximity to universities and the quality of these universities. The findings show that being located close to a lower-tier university reduces the propensity for firms to collaborate locally. while co-location with top-tier universities promotes collaboration. However. it is also found that if faced with the choice. firms appear to give preference to the research quality of the university partner over geographical closeness.

Using a comprehensive dataset covering the entire Danish labor market from 1980 to 2000. we are able to trace prior activities of all employees working in all Danish start‐ups with at least one employee. We examine whether spin‐offs from surviving parents. spin‐offs from exiting parents or other start‐ups are more likely to survive. Moreover. we investigate whether firms managed and founded by teams with higher levels of industry‐specific experience have a higher chance of surviving. We find that spin‐offs from a surviving parent and to a lesser degree industry‐specific experience positively affects the likelihood of survival.

Utilizing longitudinal data from the U.S. Panel Study for Income Dynamics. we investigate the reasons for the low rate of entrepreneurship from the public sector. We conjecture that it is due to labor market matching processes and the bureaucratic nature of public organizations and bureaucratization of individuals. Our life-course analysis identifies labor market matching as a major determinant: nonentrepreneurial types choose public sector employment. We also uncover tenure and context effects. which decrease and increase the hazard rate of entrepreneurial exit. respectively.

1277580,Firm size and firm growth rate distributions—the case of Denmark,2005,Toke Reichstein and Morten Berg Jensen,14,Industrial and Corporate Change,6,1145-1166,Oxford University Press,There has been a recent renewed interest in the study of firm size distributions and firm growth rate distributions. Gibrat’s law assumes firm growth rates are independent and identically distributed and that size is determined by a first-order integrated process. leaving the size distribution log-normal. This article analyzes these distribution patterns in an empirical context. questioning the foundation of this model. In a cross-section analysis of four industries using Danish data. we show that the foundation and the outcome of Gibrat’s law are empirically far-fetched.

It is novel in two respects. First. rather than limiting the analysis to a focus on the conditional mean. we investigate the entire shape of the distribution. Second. we show that differences in the firm growth rate process between large and small firms are highly circumstantial and depend on the industry dynamics.

Using longitudinal matched employer–employee data from Denmark. the analysis reveals that a transition to entrepreneurship decreases individual's employment turnover tendency. Three explanations are identified and empirically explored: (i) job matching. (ii) labour market value. and (iii) personal commitment. Entrepreneurs appear to be more productive and thus better matched compared to wageworkers. However. they also appear to be locked in entrepreneurship because of their anticipated lower value in the labour market and because of their personal attachment to the venture. The counter-intuitive finding – entrepreneurship yields greater employment stability – only holds with respect to subsequent transitions to wagework and not for new venture founding.

Ltd.,The provision of health and social care for an increasing elderly population is a challenge facing many societies. Telecare. the delivery of health and social care to individuals within the home or wider community. with the support of information and communication technologies. has been advocated as an approach to reduce the rise in the number of elderly people in institutional care and to contain costs.

This paper builds on the literature on concepts of project-based firms to develop an approach to innovation management linking work acquisition. execution and learning. The conceptual framework is expressed in diagrammatic form. providing a succinct representation of the complex relationships and a starting point for analysis of the opportunities and challenges facing the management of project-based firms. including those impeding success. in particular the role of time pressures. The analysis helps to elucidate findings from prior in-depth studies of a large number of engineering and design firms.

Two multi-state population models. with and without accounting for educational composition respectively. were developed. parameterized with age-gender-(education)-specific transition probabilities (between active. functional disability and death states) estimated from two waves (2009 and 2011) of a nationally representative survey of community-dwelling Singaporeans aged ≥60 years (N=4.990). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis with the bootstrap method was used to obtain the 95% confidence interval of the transition probabilities. Not accounting for educational composition overestimated the young-old with functional disability by 65 percent and underestimated the old-old by 20 percent in 2040. Accounting for educational composition. the proportion of old-old with functional disability increased from 40.8 percent in 2000 to 64.4 percent by 2040; not accounting for educational composition. the proportion in 2040 was 49.4 percent.

Tie strength has been operationalized as weights. A few network measures have been proposed for weighted networks. including three common measures of node centrality: degree. closeness. and betweenness. However. these generalizations have solely focused on tie weights. and not on the number of ties. which was the central component of the original measures.

Yet. most network measures do not take weights into consideration. and thus do not fully capture the richness of the information contained in the data.

A number of issues arise in this transformation process. especially when analyzing ties among nodes’ contacts. For example. the values attained by the global and local clustering coefficients on projected random two-mode networks deviate from the expected values in corresponding classical one-mode networks. Moreover. both the local clustering coefficient and constraint (structural holes) are inversely associated to nodes’ two-mode degree.

A gender representation law was introduced in Norway. which required public limited companies’ boards to have at least 40% representation of each sex by 2008. This law acted as an external shock. and this paper aims to explore its effects. In particular. it explores the gender bias. the emergence and sex of prominent directors. and directors’ social capital. We utilize data from May 2002 to August 2009 to analyze these aspects. The implied intention of the law was to create a larger pool of women acting as directors on boards. and the law has had the effect of increasing the representation of women on boards.

Our analysis of the regional network shows that. within India. the productivity of inventors does not improve when they move from foreign to Indian organizations. In the global network. we find that Indian organizations remain located in the periphery as a result of employing a small number of inventors from foreign organizations. However. in the instances when inventors are hired from foreign organizations. they are able to produce patents with a higher impact in comparison to inventors hired from other Indian organizations.

We show that there remains significant heterogeneity among networks classified as small-world networks. We develop measures of the efficiency of a network. which allow us to refine predictions associated with small-world networks. A network is classified as a small-world network if it exhibits a distance between nodes that is comparable to the distance found in random networks of similar sizes—with ties randomly allocated among nodes—in addition to containing dense clusters. To assess how efficient a network is. there are two questions worth asking: (a) What is a compelling random network for baseline levels of distance and clustering? and (b) How proximal should an observed value be to the baseline to be deemed comparable?

1277627,A review and simulation of business angel investment returns,2017,Geoff Gregson and Adam J Bock and Richard T Harrison,19,Venture Capital,4,285-311,Routledge,Business angels are widely recognized as a significant source of entrepreneurial finance. particularly for early-stage businesses. However. rigorous investigation on angel investment performance has been limited. This paper examines investment returns of business angels in addressing the question of whether angel investing generates attractive returns. We review the few published studies which report on more than 100 investment exits to establish baseline returns expectations and clarify returns measurement limitations. We then use data from one of the largest studies of angel returns to populate a Monte Carlo simulation of returns profiles to explore the link between portfolio size and the probability of the desired level of returns. The study reveals that angel deal returns are highly skewed; smaller portfolios have higher average returns but dramatically lower median returns.

The concept of boundary object is                 receiving growing attention in the management literature. These artefacts are argued                 to provide a basis for negotiation and knowledge exchange between differentiated                 communities of practice. The paper assesses these claims theoretically and                 empirically in the context of global projects. Theoretically it draws on the                 literatures on boundary objects. dispersed work and project management tools and                 organization.

It presents quantitative data comparing work interactions between dispersed and co-located teams in five international. project-based firms. It shows that contrary to conventional wisdom. their respective practices are similar for many work activities such as search and routine information exchange. However dispersed team members validate. verify and consult differently to the respective co-located teams. Qualitative data from interviews and observation then illustrates typical interactions using the differing means and media available to the observed project teams. such as task decomposition and emergency corrective work.

However this variety may be understood by considering two dimensions: semiotic codes; the signifiers of symbolic value that consumers derive from products. and material base; the formats. fabrics. and physical human activities underpinning these products. We characterize four types of change. based on high and low change combinations with semiotic codes and material base: Preserve. Ideate. Transform and Recreate. This framework is applied to a range of creative industries. from mature sectors like museums. architecture and fashion. through the many transitions of film production. to contemporary digital advertising and online content creation.

1277637,Influences of knowledge sharing and hoarding in project-based firms,2005,Jeremy Hall and Jonathan Sapsed,1,Management of knowledge in project environments,1,57-79,Elsevier. Oxford,The sharing and application of knowledge have been widely identified as key sources of sustained competitive advantage. Yet. in spite of recent advances in our understanding of how to manage knowledge (Dixon. 2000; Szulanski. 2003). its capture and transfer remain acute problems for project-based firms and organizations (DeFillippi and Arthur. 1998; Gann and Salter. 2000; Prencipe and Tell. 2001; Keegan and Turner. 2002). This is particularly so in the context of incentives to share or hoard knowledge (Gupta and Govindarajan. 2000). an area on which this chapter focuses. So. drawing on theory from several sources and empirical research from four different industrial settings. this chapter presents an analytical framework represented by a matrix that suggests determinants of knowledge transfer behaviour within project-based firms. All these organizations operate dissimilar and discontinuous projects. and thus illustrate a particularly challenging knowledge transfer environment. The authors argue that the tendency to share or hoard knowledge depends on organizational incentives and motivational characteristics. which are in turn shaped by industrial and organizational circumstances. It is concluded that an understanding of these underlying characteristics and circumstances will facilitate better utilization of explicit knowledge management (KM) tools such as intranets. expert systems and ‘lessons learned’reporting.,True,1XFuADsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,57,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dlAsBgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA57&dq=info:ZzpYTjsCNqAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_aCXuIR2k8&sig=sn2ds3hVxgHPcjETzV9YGsyzGXA,11544417148551576167,/scholar?cites=11544417148551576167,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Fong4/publication/283256596_Management_of_Knowledge_in_Project_Environments/links/5feb0ea5a6fdccdcb8136621/Management-of-Knowledge-in-Project-Environments.pdf#page=76,0,0,0

By analysing words co-located with innovation in Hansard. the UK's parliamentary record. both the stable and the changing uses of the word over the decades are examined. Considering the results in the light of ‘stylised facts’ in innovation policy studies reveals that use of the term innovation has increased over the period studied.

Although contributors make their work publicly available. they do not forfeit their rights to it. Community managed software projects protect their work by using several legal and normative tactics. which should not be conflated with a disregard for or neglect of intellectual property rights.

We use the term “nexus work” to refer to brokerage requiring synthesis or integration. rather than just communication or transference of ideas. With an ethnographic investigation of 23 independent music producers in the Nashville country music industry. we examined how producers in the brokerage role fostered the integration of others' contributions throughout four phases of the creative process. We discovered that ambiguity was an inherent part of the collective creative process and identified three types: (1) an ambiguous quality metric (What makes a hit or constitutes success?); (2) ambiguous occupational jurisdictions (Whose claim of expertise entitles them to control the process?); and (3) an ambiguous transformation process (How should the work be done?).

1277645,Exploring the foundations of cumulative innovation: Implications for organization science,2007,Fiona Murray and Siobhán O'Mahony,18,Organization Science,6,1006-1021,INFORMS,Organizational theorists have built a deep understanding of the conditions affecting knowledge sharing. However. for innovation to occur. knowledge must not just be shared. but also reused. recombined. and accumulated. Such accumulation is not inherent to the innovation process but can be either supported or limited by the context in which it occurs. We propose a framework arguing that three conditions shape this context: disclosure. access. and rewards. We show how these conditions operate at the institutional. field. community. and organizational levels. Our framework highlights how when innovators encounter barriers to the accumulation of knowledge. their solutions are often organizational ones rather than legal ones.

Using comparative field studies. we examine how contract workers try to achieve career progression without the benefit of organizational guidance. Specifically. we examine how contract workers manage the career progression paradox: the problem of finding a job without prior experience. “Stretchwork” bridging from proven competencies to new ones helps reconcile this paradox. We identify four tactics used to acquire stretchwork. explore the conditions affecting the success of those tactics. and offer theoretical implications for career progression in external labor markets.,True,jKMdyEQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,327,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMJ.2006.22798174,277867926213738745,/scholar?cites=277867926213738745,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Beth_Bechky/publication/40969580_Stretchwork_Managing_the_Career_Progression_Paradox_in_External_Labor_Markets/links/594c6e10a6fdcc14c97d9860/Stretchwork-Managing-the-Career-Progression-Paradox-in-External-Labor-Markets.pdf,0,0,0

Since 1998. the concept has been adapted and diffused to new settings that extend beyond software. While the open source community has maintained control over which software licenses can be considered ‘open source’. little attention has been paid to the elements that constitute community management. More private parties now contribute to OSS communities and more hybrid governance models have emerged. Before we can understand how hybrid models differ from a community managed model. a more precise definition is needed.

We argue that progression without hierarchy unfolds when people assume lateral authority over project tasks without managing people. With a longitudinal study of a mature. collectively managed open source software project. we predict the individual behaviors that enable progression to lateral authority roles at two different stages. Although technical contributions are initially important. coordination work is more critical at a subsequent stage. We then explore how lateral authority roles affect subsequent behavior—after gaining authority. individuals spend significantly more time coordinating project work.

University of Minnesota,The information systems field emerged as a new discipline of artificial science as a result of intellectual efforts to understand the nature and consequences of computer and communication technology in modern organizations. As the rapid development of digital technology continues to make computers and computing a part of everyday experiences. we are once again in need of a new discipline of the artificial. In this essay. I argue that the IS community must expand its intellectual boundaries by embracing experiential computing as an emerging field of inquiry in order to fill this growing intellectual void. Experiential computing involves digitally mediated embodied experiences in everyday activities through everyday artifacts that have embedded computing capabilities.

Using data from 36. four-person MBA student teams from six universities competing in a web-based business simulation game over an 8-week period. we found that both high- and low-performing teams started with similar levels of trust in both cognitive and affective dimensions. However. high-performing teams were better at developing and maintaining the trust level throughout the project life. Moreover. virtual teams relied more on a cognitive than an affective element of trust.

University of Minnesota,In contemporary knowledge-based organizations. teams often play an essential role in leveraging knowledge resources. Organizations make significant investments in information technology to support knowledge management practices in teams. At the same time. recent studies show that the transactive memory system (TMS)—the specialized division of cognitive labor among team members that relates to the encoding. storage. and retrieval of knowledge—is an important factor that affects a team's performance. Yet little is known of how IT support for knowledge management practices in organizations affects the development of TMS.

Prescriptive knowledge models may support a more professional approach to process design. However. their impact on the practice of process design is still too limited.

1277680,Locating meaning making in organizational learning: The narrative basis of cognition,1993,Ramkrishnan V Tenkasi and Richard J Boland,7,Research in organizational change and development,,77-103,JAI Press,We call for a fundamental reorientation of our understanding of human cognition and its relation to organizational learning. a turn that sees the basic organizing principle of cognition as essentially narrative and not schematic or representational. A schema-based image of cognition has guided research in the organizational learning and change literature and is inherently limiting in addressing issues of change. We trace this limitation to the structuralist lineage of the widely used computer information processing model of the mind. We argue that this model fails as a theory of action because of its emphasis on invisible underlying structures. at the expense of actors' own descriptions of social life. Giddens' theory of structuration allows us to recognize the virtual nature of social and organizational structures; they exist only as constituted in the social practices and narratives of human actors. It is in narratives that we find cognitive structures and schemas being produced and reproduced. As our narratives change. structures change. Narratives are the generative process in cognition. What frames or schemas we do have are constructed through the primary cognitive activity of narrativizing our experiences.

1277682,Technology transfer as collaborative learning,1995,Ramkrishnan V Tenkasi and Susan A Mohrman,155,,,147-168,National Institute on Drug Abuse,The field of technology transfer studies has been traced back to the European beginnings of social science (Rogers 1983). In the United States. a wave of interest and activity began in the 1920s and continued until the 1980s (Backer 1991). After a brief lull. the field has seen a resurgence in the late 1980s and the 1990s (Backer 1991). From the domains of business. government. and academia come uniform calls to develop more creative approaches to the problem of technology transfer (Breuder 1988; Reich 1989).Although application of the term carries unique interpretations in different domains such as government. business. economic development. and health care. the common definition of technology transfer reflects the transmission of ideas. knowledge. information. and equipment from the developer (often a research laboratory) to the user (marketplace). The implicit model of the process is a source-destination paradigm (Williams and Gibson 1990) or a conduit model of communication with the sender (s) transmitting information from one end and the receiver (s) faithfully receiving it at another (Doheny-Farina 1992; Reddy 1979).,True,j6JNKmkAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,64,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_RdhMys3h_0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA147&dq=info:uEx2GMuCXPEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ifgX4bgRmW&sig=ts4SG3VyjMztPw2Xy1ZFG-Vjos0,17391919669798390968,/scholar?cites=17391919669798390968,,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_RdhMys3h_0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA147&dq=info:uEx2GMuCXPEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ifgX4bgRmW&sig=ts4SG3VyjMztPw2Xy1ZFG-Vjos0,0,0,0

For each. we evaluated how effectively the proposed technique was compared with alternatives (effectiveness of validation) and how well the technique was implemented (effectiveness of implementation). We found that eleven of the studies were both effectively validated and implemented. Another eleven studies were effectively validated and produced positive results. even though there were some problems with respect to the quality of their NN implementations.

Drawing on game theory. the authors hypothesize that managers are competitor oriented under certain conditions. in particular. when they are provided with information about competitors’ performance. Empirical studies lead to the additional hypothesis that a competitor orientation is detrimental to performance. To examine these hypotheses. the authors conduct two studies. The first is a laboratory study in which 1016 subjects made pricing decisions. When information about the competitor's profits was provided. over 40% of the subjects were willing to sacrifice part of their company's profits to beat or harm the competitor.

Prescriptive knowledge models may support a more professional approach to process design. However. their impact on the practice of process design is still too limited. The reasons for this may include that the potential of professional process design to produce effective and efficient design processes is still underestimated as well as the potential of prescriptive design knowledge to support that professional process design. This paper contributes to a better understanding of these potentials by analysing the nature of prescriptive design knowledge. the way it can be used to produce sound design processes and an approach to develop prescriptive process-design knowledge.

1277692,Integration of statistical methods and judgment for time series forecasting: Principles from empirical research,1998,J Scott Armstrong and Fred Collopy,,,,269-293,John Wiley & Sons Ltd,We consider how judgment and statistical methods should be integrated for time-series forecasting. Our review of published empirical research identified 47 studies. all but four published since 1985. Five procedures were identified: revising judgment; combining forecasts; revising extrapolations; rule-based forecasting; and econometric forecasting. This literature suggests that integration generally improves accuracy when the experts have domain knowledge and when significant trends are involved. Integration is valuable to the extent that judgments are used as inputs to the statistical methods. that they contain additional relevant information. and that the integration scheme is well structured. The choice of an integration approach can have a substantial impact on the accuracy of the resulting forecasts. Integration harms accuracy when judgment is biased or its use is unstructured. Equal-weights combining should be regarded as the benchmark and it is especially appropriate where series have high uncertainty or high instability. When the historical data involve high uncertainty or high instability. we recommend revising judgment. revising extrapolations. or combining. When good domain knowledge is available for the future as well as for the past. we recommend rule-based forecasting or econometric methods.,True,2YvswBYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,168,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=648736,1044133542484139431,/scholar?cites=1044133542484139431,,,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=marketing_papers,0,0,0

Neural network forecast performance on 384 economic and demographic time series was compared to two traditional alternatives: linear regression and the even average of six exponential smoothing methods. On these kinds of partially stochastic series. the use of neural networks as function approximators was found to generally give significantly less accurate forecasts than linear regression. The use of pre-processing to remove seasonal variation improved the forecast accuracy of neural networks. but an even average of exponential smoothing methods was still more accurate.

The concept of fit is often used to explain how system design can improve performance and overall value. So far. the literature has focused mainly on performance evaluation criteria that are based on measures of task efficiency. accuracy. or productivity. However. nowadays. productivity gain is no longer the single evaluation criterion. In many instances. computer systems are expected to enhance our creativity. reveal opportunities and open new vistas of uncharted frontiers.To address this void. we introduce the concept of generativity in the context of IS design and develop two corresponding design considerations –‘generative capacity’ that refers to one's ability to produce something ingenious or at least new in a particular context. and ‘generative fit’ that refers to the extent to which an IT artefact is conducive to …,True,-rxuqEIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,212,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2575.2007.00291.x,11171602389348136398,/scholar?cites=11171602389348136398,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/3471444/RP_113_Teeni.pdf,0,0,0

Governments around the world have become ac-tive participants in this evolution. opening up their data for access and re-use by public and private agents alike. The phenomenon of Open Government Data has spread around the world in the last four years. driven by the widely held belief that use of Open Government Data has the ability to generate both economic and social value. However. a cursory review of the popular press. as well as an investigation of academic research and empirical data. reveals the need to further understand the relationship between Open Government Data and value. In this paper. we focus on how use of Open Government Data can bring about new innovative solutions that can gen-erate social and economic value. We apply a critical realist approach to a case study analysis to uncover the mechanisms that can explain how data is transformed to value.

Whereas early peer-to-peer platforms were designed to enable file sharing and goods trading. we recently witness the emergence of a new breed of peer-to-peer platforms that are designed for ordinary service sharing. Ordinary services entail intangible provisions and are defined as an economic activity that generates immaterial benefits and does not result in ownership of material goods. Based on a structured analysis of 41 internet-based rideshare platforms. we explore and layout the unique characteristics of peer-to-peer service sharing platforms based on three distinct temporal patterns that entail specific consequences for platform use as well as provide insights about their overall design imperative.,True,-rxuqEIAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,131,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:887752,13374412656176390957,/scholar?cites=13374412656176390957,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:887752/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0
1277713,Share and share alike: The social and technological influences on knowledge sharing behavior,2005,Sean Hansen and Michel Avital,,,,,,In recent years. attempts to capture and leverage a firm's knowledge resources have become a primary focus in the pursuit of competitive advantage. Business leaders have increasingly looked to their firms' bases of knowledge-on topics such as customers. suppliers. markets. and business practices-as their most critical strategic resource. This trend has led to the widespread adoption of knowledge management initiatives aimed at capturing and leveraging the knowledge of social actors within an organization to advance the economic interests of the firm. Within such an effort. the behavior of knowledge sharing by individual business professionals stands as a necessary first condition for programmatic success. This essay explores the determinants of knowledge sharing by applying Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior to the context of knowledge management. The implications of the model provide support for an emphasis on organizational culture and relationship issues in the development and initiation of a knowledge management program. The model presented incorporates both formal and informal features of organizational contexts that can promote or discourage knowledge sharing behavior. The critical nature of social factors. reflected in the organizational culture of a firm. is strongly supported by the model. In addition. the analysis will illustrate the degree to which technological resources can influence the expected knowledge sharing behavior of business professionals.,True,-rxuqEIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,124,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sean_Hansen/publication/277997878_Share_and_Share_Alike_The_Social_and_Technological_Influences_on_Knowledge_Sharing_Behavior/links/55ea04b808aeb6516265e200/Share-and-Share-Alike-The-Social-and-Technological-Influences-on-Knowledge-Sharing-Behavior.pdf,15105505764672057572,/scholar?cites=15105505764672057572,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sean_Hansen/publication/277997878_Share_and_Share_Alike_The_Social_and_Technological_Influences_on_Knowledge_Sharing_Behavior/links/55ea04b808aeb6516265e200/Share-and-Share-Alike-The-Social-and-Technological-Influences-on-Knowledge-Sharing-Behavior.pdf,0,0,0

While the value generated by OGD has been widely discussed by public bodies and other stakeholders. little attention has been paid to this phenomenon in the academic literature. Hence. we developed a conceptual model portraying how data as a resource can be transformed to value.

We use empirical data from 61 countries to test these relationships. using the PLS method. The results mostly support the hypothesized relationships.

The discrepancy between what researchers think about the incorporation of temporal factors in their research and what they actually do was explained by various pragmatic. methodological. and normative grounds. but they were not aware of other epistemological and ontological barriers related to their choice. The interviews also drew attention to a paradox that stemmed from an experience of ongoing tension between the methodologically prescribed sense of time and the experientially lived impression of time. Further analysis suggests that incorporation of time factors may significantly improve social process research. The study demonstrates that temporal elements do not merely change one's perception of a situation. but also provide a space for a richer and more …,True,-rxuqEIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,115,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.11.6.665.12532,12679644112671164538,/scholar?cites=12679644112671164538,,,,0,0,0

By conceiving of work systems as mutually-shaping social and technological systems. the STS approach has provided decades of researchers and practitioners with robust analytical tools to consider both the social and the technical elements of organizational contexts. However. we identify two areas where the conceptualization of sociotechnical systems must be updated to reflect the role of information infrastructures as an enabler of trans-organizational work arrangements.

1277727,Is it time to rethink your pricing strategy,2012,Andreas Hinterhuber and Stephan Liozu,53,MIT Sloan management review,4,69-77,,Renowned investor Warren Buffett has said.“The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power. If you’ve got the power to raise prices without losing business to a competitor. you’ve got a very good business. And if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10%. then you’ve got a terrible business.” Yet pricing receives scant attention in most companies. Fewer than 5% of Fortune 500 companies have a full-time function dedicated to pricing. according to data from the Professional Pricing Society. the world’s largest organization dedicated to pricing. McKinsey & Company has estimated that fewer than 15% of companies do systematic research on this subject.

However. after interviews with 50 executives and the analysis of pricing practices of 70 companies worldwide. our research suggests that innovation in pricing may be a company's most powerful—and. in many cases. least explored—source of competitive advantage. Innovation in pricing brings new-to-the-industry approaches to pricing strategies. to pricing tactics. and to the organization of pricing with the objective of increasing customer satisfaction and company profits; too many companies today see pricing as a win/lose proposition between themselves and their customers. Innovation in pricing breaks this deadlock and shows how to increase profits and customer satisfaction conjointly.

Our interviews with 44 executives in 15 US industrial firms show that those practicing value-based pricing interpret customer value in ways fully consistent with the current academic literature.

1277773,Construction principles and design rules in the case of circular design,2006,A. Georges L. Romme and G. Endenburg,17,Organization Science,2,287-297,INFORMS,This paper proposes science-based organization design that uses construction principles and design rules to guide practitioner-academic projects. Organization science implies construction principles for creating and implementing designs. These principles serve to construct design rules that are instrumental in developing organization designs. Testing and implementing designs require pragmatic experimentation in complex. dynamic settings. The authors explore a circular design process as an example of science-based organization design.

The main questions are: what is organizational learning. and how can organizations develop into effective learning systems? First. the link between individual and organizational learning and the distinction between single loop and double loop learning is discussed. Subsequently. several approaches to organizational learning are described. including contingency theory. psychology. information theory and system dynamics.

Value creation by these ecosystems draws on the dynamics of single firms (interacting and partnering) as well as the ecosystem at large. Drawing on a field study of a Dutch high‐tech campus. two key sources of value creation are identified: (1) facilitation of the innovation process for individual companies and (2) creation of an innovation community. Furthermore. the coevolution of the ecosystem's business model with firm‐level business models explains why technology‐based firms join. stay in. or leave the ecosystem at a certain point in time.

A promising approach instead involves positioning organization studies as a science for design. While the natural sciences seek description. explanation or prediction of what is. design scientists ask what could be. seeking betterment of the human condition. Inspired by Simon’s (1969) The Sciences of the Artificial. an organization science for design seriously addresses the need for scholars and managers alike for better organizational forms and processes.

The model incorporates mindfulness and tool utility (positive) effects as well as experience and inertia (negative) effects on dynamic capability. The simulation experiments conducted with the model suggest that the impact of deliberate learning on dynamic capability is non-linear. complex. and in some instances counter-intuitive.

Adopting a micro-institutional perspective. this paper addresses why and how embedded agency may overcome legitimacy crises within established systems. Drawing on a sample of 20 legitimacy problems identified in five radical innovation trajectories at two mature companies. we develop an empirically grounded theory of the institutional work through which proponents legitimize radical innovations within established firms. This theory describes a variety of micro-institutional affordances that enable different strategic responses to legitimacy crises.

1277798,Positive image. positive action: The affirmative basis of organizing,1990,David L Cooperrider,91125,Appreciative management and leadership,,,,Modern management thought was born proclaiming that organizations are the triumph of the human imagination. As made and imaged. organizations are products of human imagination. As made and imagined. organizations are products of human interaction and mind rather than some blind expression of an underlying natural order (McGregor. 1960; Berger and Luckmann. 1967; Pfeffer. 1981; Gergen. 1982; Srivastva and Associates. 1983; Schein. 1985; Unger. 1987). Deceptively simple yet so entirely radical in implication. this insight is still shattering many beliefs—one of which is the longstanding conviction that bureaucracy. oligarchy. and other forms of hierarchical domination are inevitable. Today we know that this simply is not true.Recognizing the symbolic and socially constructed nature of the human universe. we now find new legitimacy for the mounting wave of socio-cognitive and socio-cultural research. all of which is converging around one essential and empowering thesis: that there is little about collective action or organization development that is preprogrammed. unilaterally determined. or stimulus bound in any direct physical or material way. Seemingly immutable ideas about people and organizations are being directly challenged and transformed on an unprecedented scale. Indeed. as we move into a postmodern global society we are breaking out of our parochial perspectives and are recognizing that organizations in all societies exist in a wide array of types and species and function within a dynamic spectrum of beliefs and lifestyles.

1277800,Appreciative inquiry: The power of the unconditional positive question,2006,James D Ludema and David L Cooperrider and Frank J Barrett,,Handbook of action research: The concise paperback edition,,155-165,,This chapter describes appreciative inquiry as a positive mode of action research which liberates the creative and constructive potential of organizations and human communities. Appreciative inquiry contrasts with problem-focused modes of inquiry using deficit-based questions. which lead to deficit-based conversations. which in turn lead to deficit-based patterns of action. A case illustration is offered to show how appreciative inquiry uses the power of the unconditional positive question to overturn the tyranny of deficit-based vocabularies and opens up new alternatives for conversation and action.In their original formulation of appreciative inquiry. Cooperrider and Srivastva (1987) argue that action research. especially in the guise of organizational development. has largely failed as an instrument for advancing ‘second order’social-organizational transformation (where organizational paradigms. norms. ideologies or values are changed in fundamental ways) because of its romance with critique at the expense of appreciation. To the extent that action research maintains a problem-oriented view of the world it diminishes the capacity of researchers and practitioners to produce innovative theory capable of inspiring the imagination. commitment and passionate dialogue required for the consensual reordering of social conduct. If we devote our attention to what is wrong with organizations and communities. we lose the ability to see and understand what gives life to organizations and to discover ways to sustain and enhance that life-giving potential.

By intervening at a tacit. indirect level of awareness. group members are able to generate fresh perceptions of one another. thereby allowing for the revitalization of the social bond and a heightened collective will to act. After exploring insights into the recent literature on social cognition and selective perception. a case is presented in which generative metaphor was successfully used to help a dysfunctional group build (1) liberated aspirations and the development of hope. (2) decreased interpersonal conflict. (3) strategic consensus around a positive vision for the future. (4) renewed collective will to act. and (5) egalitarian language reflecting a new sense of unity and mutuality in the joint creation of the group's future.

1277802,On the ethics of intervention in human psychological research: With special reference to the Stanford prison experiment,2017,Philip G Zimbardo,2,Cognition,,,,Research was conducted recently (August 14–21. 1971) in which subjects assumed the roles of ‘prisoner’or ‘guard’for an extended period of time within an experimentally devised mock prison setting on the Stanford University campus. The projected two-week study had to be prematurely terminated when it became apparent that many of the ‘prisoners’ were in serious distress and many of the ‘guards’ were behaving in ways which brutalized and degraded their fellow subjects. In addition. the emerging reality of this role-playing situation was sufficiently compelling to influence virtually all those who operated within it to behave in ways appropriate to its demand characteristics. but inappropriate to their usual life roles and values; this included the research staff. faculty observers. a priest. lawyer. ex-convict. and relatives and friends of the subjects who visited the prison on several occasions (for details see Zimbardo. Banks. Haney and Jaffe. 1973; Haney. Banks and Zimbardo. 1973). This research represents one of the most extreme experimental demonstrations of the power of situational determinants in both shaping behaviour and predominating over personality. attitudes and individual values. As such it extends the conclusions from Stanley Milgram’s research on obedience to authority (1974). But the ethical concerns voiced over Milgram’s treatment of placing subject-teachers in a conflict situation where they believed (incorrectly) that they were hurting another person are even more pronounced in the present case.

To cooperate effectively across boundaries requires organisations to overcome the tension between their distinct backgrounds and the need to create shared understandings with their partners for collaboration. This requires the creation of shared artefacts such as boundary objects. Whereas the past work on boundary objects has highlighted their role as translation devices. we examine them in relation to the information infrastructures within which they are embedded. and the identities of the organisations that use them.

1277805,The dynamics of boundary objects. social infrastructures and social identities,2004,Uri Gal and Youngjin Yoo and Richard J Boland,,,,,,This paper takes a dynamic approach to understanding the nature and role of boundary objects by examining them in relation to the social infrastructures within which they are embedded and to the social identities of the groups that share them. It explores the premise that boundary objects are used not only as a translation device. but also as a resource to form and express social identities. It further suggests the occurrence of a dynamic process whereby changes in boundary objects enable changes in social infrastructures and social identities in one group. These changes. in turn. create the conditions for change in bordering groups through shared boundary objects. Based on interviews which were conducted over three years. we illustrate these ideas by presenting three vignettes that describe the introduction of 3D modelling technologies into the AEC industry and the changes that consequently occurred.,True,khG_qXEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,102,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.333.567&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2081865700820981228,/scholar?cites=2081865700820981228,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.333.567&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This theorizing goes beyond user-aided. participatory design to consider users as designers in their own right during the ongoing creation and recreation of information systems. Recent theorizing about an emerging class of tailorable systems proposes that such systems undergo an initial. primary design process where features are built in prior to general release. Following implementation. people engage in a secondary design process where functions and content emerge during interaction. modification. and embodiment of the system in use. This case study reveals that people are engaged designers. framed by dualities in behaviors including planned and emergent behaviors. and participatory and reifying behaviors.

This growth has also been perceived as an endless evolution in Thailand where freedom is always granted for new developments. and where foreign investment is not particularly restricted. Surprisingly. however. the growth of mobile industry in Thailand has recently appeared to be slower and has led to the important question of whether it will be worthwhile for both onshore and offshore investors to allocate large amounts of capital to Thailand in response to the upcoming 3G technology. Before predicting the near future. it would be a good opportunity here to provide the background to mobile technology and business in Thailand. The following six sections cover a variety of information related to mobile technology and business in Thailand. The first section provides a brief background of Thailand together with its economy and business environment. The development. growth. and competition of the mobile communication industry in Thailand are then discussed entailing the current market situation. and competitive strategies.

1277831,Where ideas come from: A systematic view of inquiry,2001,Betty Vandenbosch and Sharon Fay and Argun Saatçioglu,,,,,,For the most part. models and theories about idea generation and creativity can be divided into three types: theories about individual characteristics conducive to generating ideas. theories about the contexts in which ideas flourish. and theories about the processes by which ideas are developed. The reductionist nature of the contingency theories and their neglect of intertwined causality limits their usefulness in helping us to understand ideation. People do not come up with ideas in complete isolation. nor do contexts alone determine whether or not ideas will emerge. The process theories disregard the possibility of equifinality-different combinations of contextual and personal characteristics may result in different but equally effective processes. Rather than studying idea generation in terms of lists of categories. continua of characteristics. or details about process. we explore its systemic nature and investigate the inter-relatedness of idea generation. problem solving and inquiry. We propose that Churchman's interpretation of the philosophies of Liebniz. Locke. Kant. Hegel and Singer provides insight into idea generation archetypes that reflect managers' dominant approaches.

Second Edition builds on the intellectual origins of experiential learning as defined by figures such as John Dewey. Kurt Lewin. Jean Piaget. and LS Vygotsky. while also reflecting three full decades of research and practice since the classic first edition. Kolb models the underlying structures of the learning process based on the latest insights in psychology. philosophy. and physiology. Building on his comprehensive structural model. he offers an exceptionally useful typology of individual learning styles and corresponding structures of knowledge in different academic disciplines and careers. Kolb also applies experiential learning to higher education and lifelong learning. especially with regard to adult education. This edition reviews recent applications and uses of experiential learning. updates Kolb's framework to address the current organizational and educational landscape. and features current examples of experiential learning both in the field and in the classroom.

The theory is called experiential learning to emphasize the central role that experience plays in the learning process. an emphasis that distinguishes ELT from other learning theories. The term experiential is used therefore to differentiate ELT both from cognitive learning theories. which emphasize cognition over affect. and behavioral learning theories. which deny any role for subjective experience in the learning process. Another reason the theory is called experiential is its intellectual origins in the experiential works of Dewey. Lewin. and Piaget. Taken together—Dewey’s philosophical pragmatism. Lewin’s social psychology. and Piaget’s cognitive-developmental genetic epistemology—form a unique perspective on learning and development (Kolb. 1984).,True,MBn_GG4AAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C,3043,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=rBuQAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA227&dq=info:2OEgD1R-LlAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=RyUJDcujAw&sig=sFUF9iB-sNNO_QI_zlho6rGp8lU,5777694271459090904,/scholar?cites=5777694271459090904,,,http://secondarycontent.pbworks.com/f/experiential-learning-theory.pdf,0,0,0

Building on the foundational works of Kurt Lewin. John Dewey and others. experiential learning theory offers a dynamic theory based on a learning cycle driven by the resolution of the dual dialectics of action/reflection and experience/abstraction. These two dimensions define a holistic learning space wherein learning transactions take place between individuals and the environment. The learning space is multi-level and can describe learning and development in commensurate ways at the level of the individual. the group. and the organization. This approach is illustrated by reviewing current research on individual learning styles and managerial problem solving/decision making. the process of team learning and organizational learning.

1277866,Cooperating heterogeneous systems,2012,David G Schwartz,299,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Cooperating Heterogeneous Systems provides an in-depth introduction to the issues and techniques surrounding the integration and control of diverse and independent software components. Organizations increasingly rely upon diverse computer systems to perform a variety of knowledge-based tasks. This presents technical issues of interoperability and integration. as well as philosophical issues of how cooperation and interaction between computational entities is to be realized. Cooperating systems are systems that work together towards a common end. The concepts of cooperation must be realized in technically sound system architectures. having a uniform meta-layer between knowledge sources and the rest of the system. The layer consists of a family of interpreters. one for each knowledge source. and meta-knowledge. A system architecture to integrate and control diverse knowledge sources is presented. The architecture is based on the meta-level properties of the logic programming language Prolog. An implementation of the architecture is described. a Framework for Logic Programming Systems with Distributed Execution (FLiPSiDE). Knowledge-based systems play an important role in any up-to-date arsenal of decision support tools. The tremendous growth of computer communications infrastructure has made distributed computing a viable option. and often a necessity in geographically distributed organizations.

But studies of KT barriers do not explicitly consider the relationship and impact of specific communication modalities on KT. The modalities of computer-mediated communication (CMC). namely email. Voice Over Internet Protocol. Instant Messaging (IM) and the like are generally viewed as a group ‘CMC’. In this paper. we analyze the KT literature to distill 21 key barriers to successful KT. These barriers are then categorized according to basic communication theory. We then examine leading theories of CMC and discuss how based on these theories individual CMC modalities can be applied to KT barriers. We conclude with a model that presents the categorized KT barriers in a communication channel model that can be addressed by CMC modalities and that can potentially break down those barriers.,True,WswKQ2AAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,50,https://orsociety.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1057/palgrave.kmrp.8500153,1814183671628983718,/scholar?cites=1814183671628983718,,,,0,0,0

1277871,The interpretation of documents and material culture,1994,Ian Hodder,1,Sage biographical research,,,,T his chapter is concerned with the interpretation of mute evidence–that is. with written texts and artifacts. Such evidence. unlike the spoken word. endures physically and thus can be separated across space and time from its author. producer. or user. Material traces thus often have to be interpreted without the benefit of indigenous commentary. There is often no possibility of interaction with spoken emic “insider” as opposed to etic “outsider” perspectives. Even when such interaction is possible. actors often seem curiously inarticulate about the reasons they dress in particular ways. choose particular pottery designs. or discard dung in particular locations. Material traces and residues thus pose special problems for qualitative research.

1277877,The archaeological process: an introduction,1999,Ian Hodder,,,,138,Blackwell,Archaeological writing careers often go through several stages. They begin with an early bright ideas phase. when interesting but often in retrospect rather naïve prognostications are made. Having got everyone's attention. the scholar often then moves into an over-achieving phase where too much is published. representing often superficial and undigested ideas. The aim here is to achieve a measure of job security and rise up meteorically through the pecking order. If this tactic works. a mature phase then follows. usually after the scholar has achieved Reader or Professor rank. Bigger and well-thought out projects are often the basis for more mature reflection on where the discipline is headed. Sometimes. usually attendant upon retirement. a magisterial phase begins. but with this always comes with the danger of increasing pomposity. In some sad cases. the espousal of extreme right-wing politics at this stage is a clear sign of approaching dementia.I loved Hodder's early work of the 1970s. drawing heavily upon the'new geography'of Chorley and Haggett et. al. In retrospect. a lot of the assumptions of the spatial archaeology he helped pioneer can be seen as naïve. but they were stimulating and liberating ideas in British archaeology which even at the beginning of the 1970s was desperately trying to distance itself from the more extreme Hempel-worshipping forms of Americanist'New Archaeology'.

There has long been a need for archaeologists and anthropologists to correlate their ideas and methods for interpreting the material culture of past civilisations. Archaeological interpretation of the past is inevitably based on the ideas and experiences of the present and the use of such ethnographic analogy has been widely adapted and criticised. not least in Britain. In this challenging study. Ian Hodder questions the assumptions. values and methods which have been too readily accepted. At the same time. he shows how anthropology can be applied to archaeology. He examines the criteria for the proper use of analogy and. in particular. emphasises the need to consider the meaning and interpretation of material cultures within the total social and cultural contexts. He discusses anthropological models of refuse deposits. technology and production. subsistence. settlement. burial. trade exchange. art form and ritual; he then considers their application to comparable archaeological data. Throughout. Professor Hodder emphasises the need for a truly scientific approach and a critical self-awareness by archaeologists. who should be prepared to study their own social and cultural context. not least their own attitudes to the present-day material world.,True,oS90Hm0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,760,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=uBfOAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:SBKIr40T8YEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=0jAHasYk93&sig=0OJvp3Xdrg4Ia0-VnMG8yJg47qw,9363286599536218696,/scholar?cites=9363286599536218696,,,,0,0,0

1277883,An archaeology of socialism,2021,Victor Buchli,,,,,Routledge,This highly original case study. which adopts a material culture perspective. is unprecedented in social and cultural histories of the Soviet period and provides a unique window on social relations. The author demonstrates how Moisei Ginzburg's Constructivist masterpiece. the Narkomfin Communal House. employed classic Marxist understandings of material culture in an effort to overturn capitalist and patriarchal social structures. Through the edifying effects of architectural forms. Ginzburg attempted to induce socialist and feminist-inspired social and gender relations. The author shows how. for the inhabitants. these principles manifested themselves. from taste to hygiene to gender roles. and how individuals variously appropriated architectural space and material culture to cope with the conditions of daily life. from the utopianism of the First Five Year Plan and Stalin's purges to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Its characteristics are as follows: archaeology conceived as anthropological science rather than allied with history; explanation of the past valued over description; explanation via the incorporation of particular observations of the material past into cross-cultural generalisations pertaining to (natural and social) process (hence the term ‘proces-sual’); explanation via explicit methodologies modelled on the hard sciences; an earlier interest in laws of human behaviour has shifted to an interest in formation processes of the archaeological record–regularities which will allow inferences about processes to be made from material remains.For many. processual archaeology is a good means. if not the best. of acquiring positive knowledge of the archaeological past. Positive archaeological knowledge is of the past. which means that it aspires to objectivity in the sense of being neutral and. indeed. timeless (the past happened in the way it did; that much at least will not change). Under a programme of positive knowledge. archaeologists aim to accumulate more knowledge of the past. The timeless and objective quality of knowledge is important if the aim is to accumulate and build on what is already known; it would be no good building on facts which cannot be relied upon. because they might change.

1277894,Breaking down cultural complexity: inequality and heterogeneity,1983,Randall H McGuire,,,,91-142,Academic Press,This chapter presents several widely held assumptions concerning the nature of cultural evolution. Cultural evolution does not reduce to a unitary phenomenon measurable by a taxonomy or a single variable. Indeed. the latter conceptualizations lead to unproductive taxonomic debate and bind to the assumptions. The broad sweep of human history encompasses a dynamic process of cultural evolution by which human societies have both grown in complexity and collapsed in disarray. The concept of cultural evolution implies not just any change but developmental change. specifically the process of change that separated the late Pleistocene world of independent. internally homogeneous human societies from the modern world of interdependent. internally heterogenous industrial nations.

But alternative temporalities and analytical possibilities are also emerging. ones attentive to the folding and recycling of cultural elements that Walter Benjamin described with such philosophical depth.

The Arts and Crafts Movement of the late nineteenth century established craftwork as an aesthetic of opposition. We establish craft in a Marxian critique of alienated labor. and we propose a unified practice of hand. heart. and mind for archaeology. The debates engendered by postprocessual archaeology have firmly situated archaeology in the present as a cultural and political practice. Many. however. still do not know how to work with these ideas. We argue that a resolution to this dilemma lies in thinking of archaeology as a craft.

This paper presents a theory of ethnic group formation and change drawn from both anthropological and sociological research. The theory is based on the examination of the relationship of three variables: competition. ethnocentrism. and differential power. Of these variables. the differential distribution of power is given the most weight in determining changes in ethnic boundary maintenance. The development of ethnic boundaries in southern Arizona between 1854 and the early 1900s provides an example of the interrelationships among these variables.

Working at the cutting edge of live performance. an emerging generation of artists is employing digital technologies to create distinctive forms of interactive. distributed. and often deeply subjective theatrical performance. The work of these artists is not only fundamentally transforming the experience of theater. it is also reshaping the nature of human interaction with computers. In this book. Steve Benford and Gabriella Giannachi offer a new theoretical framework for understanding these experiences--which they term mixed reality performances--and document a series of landmark performances and installations that mix the real and the virtual. live performance and interactivity. Benford and Giannachi draw on a number of works that have been developed at the University of Nottingham's Mixed Reality Laboratory. describing collaborations with artists (most notably the group Blast Theory) that have gradually evolved a distinctive interdisciplinary approach to combining practice with research. They offer detailed and extended accounts of these works from different perspectives. including interviews with the artists and Mixed Reality Laboratory researchers. The authors develop an overarching theory to guide the study and design of mixed reality performances based on the approach of interleaved trajectories through hybrid structures of space. time. interfaces. and roles.

There are three kinds. Canonical trajectories express an author's intended mapping of story time onto clock time as part of the plot and schedule of an experience. Participant trajectories reflect a participant's actual journey through story time and clock time as they interact with the experience. Historic trajectories represent the subsequent selection and reuse of segments of recorded participant trajectories to create histories of past events.

Cultural institutions are progressively exploring crowdsourcing. and projects’ related research is increasing. Nonetheless. few studies in the digital humanities have investigated crowdsourcing as a whole. The aim of this paper is to shed light on crowdsourcing practices in the digital humanities. thus providing insights to design new paths of collaboration between cultural organisations and their audiences. A web survey was carried out on 36 crowdsourcing projects promoted by galleries. libraries. archives. museums. and education institutions. A variety of practices emerged from the research.

We argue that Hodder's position comes close to the romantic conception of interpretation developed by German philosophers and historians. Central to this position is the equation of meaning and intention. context and origin. making historical understanding a transaction between the creative consciousness of the prehistoric agents and the receptive or reconstructive consciousness of the archaeologist. Drawing on Gadamer's critique of early hermeneutics we argue that Hodder's contextual archaeology disregards the dialectic between past and present horizons. a dialectic embedded in past material culture itself lying before us as present traces of a past.,True,fFl84vUAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,167,https://www.jstor.org/stable/280931,17555102911117994085,/scholar?cites=17555102911117994085,,,,0,0,0

1277923,Scenes from a troubled engagement,2006,Bjørnar Olsen,,,,,Sage,As signified by their common prefix. poststructuralism belongs to the number of oppositional intellectual projects that emerged in the (late) twentieth century. Despite the fact that most of these enterprises were united in opposing dominant regimes of power/knowledge and associated essentialist conceptions of truth. their differences should not be underrated. This even counts for post-structuralism’s relations to its closest relative. postmodernism. with which it is often confused. Although postmodernism as a concept has proved extremely elusive (which may actually be seen as representative of the very condition it is meant to signify). some identifying distinctions can nonetheless be noted. Writ large. postmodernism can be conceived of as an epistemic rupture that has shaken the foundational pillars on which modern life was built. announcing a new condition tellingly signified by the numerous ‘ends’ it became associated with (of grand narratives. the nation state. universal reason. authenticity. history. etc.). Probably more conspicuously. however. postmodernism has surfaced as a new aesthetic or ‘style’characterized by a playful allusiveness that stresses irony. genre mixing. eclecticism and ambiguity (Connor 1997; Jameson 1984; Lyotard 1984). Although clearly related to the wider orbit of postmodernism (like fish to water. to paraphrase Foucault). post-structuralism is distinctive in being confined mainly to academic discourses and more firmly located within a defined body of knowledge. As an intellectual project. it became heavily marked by its close (although oppositional) relations with the structuralist programme which constituted the breeding …,True,fFl84vUAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,117,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=CLA-kzevgu4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA85&dq=info:tHSO6HE4c0kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=b7mrgxyp8K&sig=9DMZBstVXQsJJU-APGopud8cnZw,2916650322548757439,/scholar?cites=2916650322548757439,,,,0,0,0

At the same time. processes of destruction have immensely intensified. although largely overlooked when compared to the research and social significance devoted to consumption and production. The outcome is a ruin landscape of derelict factories. closed shopping malls. overgrown bunkers and redundant mining towns; a ghostly world of decaying modern debris normally omitted from academic concerns and conventional histories. The archaeology of the recent or contemporary past has grown fast during the last decade. This development has been concurrent with a broader popular. artistic and scholarly interest in modern ruins in general. Ruin Memories explores how the ruins of modernity are conceived and assigned cultural value in contemporary academic and public discourses. reassesses the cultural and historical value of modern ruins and suggests possible means for reaffirming their cultural and historic significance. Crucial for this reassessment is a concern with decay and ruination. and with the role things play in expressing the neglected. unsuccessful and ineffable. Abandonment and ruination is usually understood negatively through the tropes of loss and deprivation; things are degraded and humiliated while the information. knowledge and memory embedded in them become lost along the way.

At the same time. the reader is taken on a phenomenological journey into various pasts. immersed in the lives of peoples from other times. compelled to engage their senses with the sights. smells. and noises of the publics and places whose remains they study.

At a point when archaeology has arguably never been more relevant. it finds itself in a climate of necessary plurality where incommensurability is routinely shrugged off as a symptom of diversity; it finds itself in a state where seemingly incompatible differences proliferate on either side of the divide between the humanities and the sciences; it finds itself perplexed by divides between ideas and things. past and present. and so on. A symmetrical archaeology holds that these divides are of our own making.

1277936,What money can't buy: Family income and children's life chances,1997,Susan E Mayer and Mark P Leone,,,,,Harvard University Press,Children from poor families generally do a lot worse than children from affluent families. They are more likely to develop behavior problems. to score lower on standardized tests. and to become adults in need of public assistance. Susan Mayer asks whether income directly affects children's life chances. as many experts believe. or if the factors that cause parents to have low incomes also impede their children's life chances. She explores the question of causation with remarkable ingenuity. First. she compares the value of income from different sources to determine. for instance. if a dollar from welfare is as valuable as a dollar from wages. She then investigates whether parents' income after an event. such as teenage childbearing. can predict that event. If it can. this suggests that income is a proxy for unmeasured characteristics that affect both income and the event. Next she compares children living in states that pay high welfare benefits with children living in states with low benefits. Finally. she examines whether national income trends have the expected impact on children. Regardless of the research technique. the author finds that the effect of income on children's outcomes is smaller than many experts have thought. Mayer then shows that the things families purchase as their income increases. such as cars and restaurant meals. seldom help children succeed. On the other hand. many of the things that do benefit children. such as books and educational outings. cost so little that their consumption depends on taste rather than income. Money alone. Mayer concludes. does not buy either the material or the psychological well-being that children …,True,74J7n9gAAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC,1546,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=d5Qg1JNSqGQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:EyMOAMI4LbwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_-1aLbN_nx&sig=__txKo7Dtl1cG0uVO-EXu-zZvzQ,13559556458958168851,/scholar?cites=13559556458958168851,,,,0,0,0

One obvious shortcoming of this theoretical position has been the development of archaeological systematics that have obviated any possibility of measuring multivariate phenomena and permit only the measurement of unspecified ""cultural differences and similarities."" as if these were univariate phenomena. As an alternative to this approach. it is proposed that culture be viewed as a system composed of subsystems. and it is suggested that differences and similarities between different classes of archaeological remains reflect different subsystems and hence may be expected to vary independently of each other in the normal operation of the system or during change in the system.

The mission of a critical archaeology of this period is not only telling alternative stories but also unveiling what the supermodern power machine does not want to be shown.

We show that demography is a major determinant in the maintenance of cultural complexity and that variation in regional subpopulation density and/or migratory activity results in spatial structuring of cultural skill accumulation. Genetic estimates of regional population size over time show that densities in early Upper Paleolithic Europe were similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa when modern behavior first appeared. Demographic factors can thus explain geographic variation in the timing of the first appearance of modern behavior without invoking increased cognitive capacity.,True,nRKnCZkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,948,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5932/1298.abstract,10017817449658988288,/scholar?cites=10017817449658988288,,,https://doc.rero.ch/record/210393/files/PAL_E4401.pdf,0,0,0

1277951,Demography and cultural innovation: a model and its implications for the emergence of modern human culture,2001,Stephen Shennan,11,Cambridge archaeological journal,1,5-16,Cambridge University Press,In recent years there has been a major growth of interest in exploring the analogies between the genetic transmission of information from one generation to the next and the processes of cultural transmission. in an attempt to obtain a greater understanding of how culture change occurs. This article uses computer simulation to explore the implications of a specific model of the relationship between demography and innovation within an evolutionary framework. The consequences of innovation appear far more successful in larger populations than in smaller ones. In conclusion. it is suggested that the model has major implications for the origins of modern human culture in the last 50.000 years. which may be seen not as the result of genetic mutations leading to improved cognitive capacities of individuals. but as a population consequence of the demographic growth and increased contact range which are evident at …,True,nRKnCZkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,588,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-archaeological-journal/article/demography-and-cultural-innovation-a-model-and-its-implications-for-the-emergence-of-modern-human-culture/12A6A86C774C4AF95D23B72946999DAB,8140409770062489158,/scholar?cites=8140409770062489158,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/11423/1/11423.pdf,0,0,0

Here we show that. in contrast to the steady population growth usually assumed. the introduction of agriculture into Europe was followed by a boom-and-bust pattern in the density of regional populations. We demonstrate that summed calibrated radiocarbon date distributions and simulation can be used to test the significance of these demographic booms and busts in the context of uncertainty in the radiocarbon date calibration curve and archaeological sampling. We report these results for Central and Northwest Europe between 8.000 and 4.000 cal. BP and investigate the relationship between these patterns and climate.

This fuctionalist account of elite origins goes against a uniformitarian understanding of what ruling classes do in complex societies. It also is poorly suited to the concrete evidence for Bronze Age cultures in Europe. The rise of hereditary. superordinate social strata in prehistoric Europe is better understood as a consequence of the development of capital-intensive subsistence techniques. Plow agriculture. Mediterranean polyculture. irrigation. and offshore fishing limited the possibility of group fission and thereby gave leaders the opportunity to exploit basic producers over the long term.

This involves a consideration of the processes affecting cultural transmission. Many of these are strongly affected by the history of the biological populations in which cultural transmission occurs. It can be shown that prehistoric populations fluctuated much more than used to be thought and that these fluctuations can be hard to detect archaeologically. They can often be associated with cultural changes. and. in fact. the size of populations affects the nature of cultural processes in a variety of ways.

Although we acknowledge some potential difficulties. it is our contention that both materials scientists and archaeologists have gained much and have much to gain by cooperating together to study ancient technologies. and that the concept of ‘technological choices’can facilitate a wider consideration of the factors shaping technological developments.,True,k5e_Fk4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,345,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2000.tb00863.x,16529318804873691964,/scholar?cites=16529318804873691964,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bill_Sillar/publication/227643789_The_Challenge_of_%27Technological_Choices%27_for_Materials_Science_Approaches_in_Archaeology/links/5e1851bf92851c8364c07d5d/The-Challenge-of-Technological-Choices-for-Materials-Science-Approaches-in-Archaeology.pdf,0,0,0
1277970,The social agency of things? Animism and materiality in the Andes,2009,Bill Sillar,19,Cambridge Archaeological Journal,3,367-377,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,A major focus of inter-disciplinary debate has been the need to bridge the Cartesian divide between people as active subjects and inert passive objects. to better reflect how things provoke and resist human actions through their 'secondary agency'. Many Central Andean people express a deep concern about their relationship with places and things. which they communicate with through daily work and rituals involving 'sympathetic magic'. A consideration of Andean animism emphasizes how agency is located in the social relationship people have with the material world and how material objects can have social identities.,True,k5e_Fk4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,135,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/408686/,6793994480253141292,/scholar?cites=6793994480253141292,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/408686/1/408686_Andean%20Animism.pdf,0,0,0

The most common choice of fuel in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia is animal dung (mainly cow. sheep. and llama). This technological choice is related to wider social and economic practices (particularly in relation to animal husbandry) which has further repercussions that affect other technologies (such as agriculture practices). Such a succession of interrelated activities is not unique to pottery; it is fundamental to all technologies and should be considered within archaeological analysis.,True,k5e_Fk4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,127,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2000.tb00865.x,9920359324110591799,/scholar?cites=9920359324110591799,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/55602903/j.1475-4754.2000.tb00865.x20180122-12451-6nrazu.pdf,0,0,0

The choice of raw materials and the techniques used to process them depend on the representation of these materials and tech niques within society. Such 'technical representations' play an important role in the trajectory of social and technological change. Examples drawn from present-day pottery making in the South-Central Andes are compared to other subsistence activities in the area to show how techniques may be used in a wide range of different social contexts. This has imbued the tech niques with culturally specific meanings. which affects the choice of con texts within which they are considered appropriate.

1277977,Acts of god and active material culture. Agency and commitment in the Andes,2004,Bill Sillar,15390,"Agency uncovered. Archaeological perspectives on social agency, power and being human, London",,,,A sacrifice or offering is predicated on the assumption that it is part of a twoway process. The people making the sacrifice assume that a rational being will sense the offering. and they hope that in presenting a suitable gift in an acceptable manner they can express thanks for prior benevolence or persuade this being to reciprocate in an appropriate way. In the Andes such offerings have ranged from a few leaves of coca to large sacrifices including the lives of animals and people. In making these offerings Andean people are interacting with the dead. mountain deities. saints and sacred objects and requesting these knowledgable beings to intervene in the world to the benefit of the supplicant. It is relatively easy for a critical observer from outside the culture to see this as the tragic outcome of misguided animistic beliefs. Truly modern rationalist readers may group this with belief in astrology. divine kingship. shamanism. the virgin birth. and life after death. claiming that all of these attribute nonexistent powers to non-sentient materials or imagined beings. Most sociologists (following Durkheim. Weber and Marx) would silently assume the falsity of these beliefs and concentrate on assessing how such ritual practices bound the society together. structured the social and economic world. or justified exploitation by a dominant elite. This is also the position adopted by Giddens (1984) who assumes that agency rests solely within the reflexive practice of knowledgable human beings. everything else being part of the structure within which people are socialised and which people's actions continually reproduce and transform.

A socially meaningful archaeology needs to take seriously where the popular demand and the appeal of archaeology actually lie. Arguably non-archaeologists know better what the subject is all about than most of its professionals do. This is the first full-length study of the meaning of archaeology in contemporary popular culture. It is fully illustrated with cartoons by Quentin Drew.

The emphasis is on"" doing"" archaeology rather than on its actual results.

1277992,By weapons made worthy: lords. retainers. and their relationship in Beowulf,1999,Jos Bazelmans,5,,,,Amsterdam University Press,In this book Jos Bazelmans offers a new perspective on the relationship between lord and retainer in early medieval society. This perspective goes beyond established politico-economic interpretations and aims for an interpretation of this relationship in ritual-cosmological terms. Drawing on recent developments within French structuralist anthropology and the anthropology of gift exchange. Bazelmans develops a new model of early medieval socio-political structure (as represented in Old English Beowulf) which explicitly deals with exchange relations between the living and the supernatural. the commensurablity of subject and object in gift exchange. and the whole set of interdependent life-cycle rituals of lords and their warrior-followers. The value of gifts is considered to be determined not only by their function within a competitive game about prestige. status and power. but also by its equivalence with a constituent. The value of the gift is fundamental to the noble person and develops through a man's life-time. It is. ultimately. of a supernatural origin. The model enables us to understand certain acts at Beowulf's funeral pyre which at first sight appear to be no more than an ethnographic curiosity (Beowulf 3111b-3114a). The warrior's contributions to his pyre form the concluding part of a grand ritual undertaking in which society as a whole is involved and in which the constitution of the noble person. and the disarticulation of that person at his death. is realized. This ritual undertaking goes beyond the politico-economic concerns of the participants which are central to established power-based models of early medieval societal structure.

Amsterdam,We first encounter the names of most northwest European early-medieval tribes in literary and epigraphical sources from the 3rd or 4th centuries. This is generally thought to be linked to the collective ethnogenesis that had its roots in the large-scale migrations that began in this period. 1 These migrations are believed to have made deep inroads into the old tribal order. leading to a fundamental transformation of the original ethnic geography of Germania magna. The Frisians are an exception. however: they are one of the few early-medieval tribes whose name we know from 1st-and 2nd-century sources. 2 The obvious explanation for this exceptional continuity would be to assume that the early-medieval inhabitants of the North and West Netherlands coastal region were the direct descendants of their older namesakes and that successive generations of people living there had continued to call themselves Frisians.

Manuf. Sci. Eng.,4,576-581,,The grinding process is one of the most common finishing operations. Although it has been a topic of extensive research. a complete understanding of the process has yet to be achieved. The inherent nature of the grinding wheel ie. the random distribution of the grits and the inability to completely characterize the grit cutting edge geometry is regarded as the primary obstacle to describing the surface generation process. The complex geometry of the wheel complicates the kinematic analysis of the process. Many variables contribute to ground surface texture. These factors include geometric or primary factors. noise or secondary factors and miscellaneous or tertiary factors as shown in Fig. 1. The geometric factors include the cutting parameters such as wheel speed and table speed. workpiece geometry including initial surface texture and form errors. and grinding wheel topography characteristics such as grit size. wheel dressing and wear. The intrinsic nature of these factors in the surface generation mechanism distinguishes them from the secondary and tertiary factors which may or may not be present in the process. The noise factors are disturbances in the grinding environment and are not always significantly involved in the cutting process. Surface finish is an important functional feature and quality characteristic of manufactured products. It has an important role in the wear. lubricating and optical properties of the manufactured products.

The conventional approach to design evaluation is limited in two respects. First. the direct measurement of attribute performance levels does not reflect the subsequentworth to the designer. Second. ad hoc methods for determining the relative importance or priority of attributes do not accurately quantify beneficial attribute tradeoffs. This information is critical to the iterative redesign process.

The legislation mandates that manufacturers bear the economic burden of collection and disposal of products at the end of their useful lives. Reuse or remanufacturing of some components might be more cost-effective than disposal and provide an opportunity for recovery of their economic value. However. manufacturers have not traditionally engaged in the long-range planning over several product lifecycles that cost-effective reuse or remanufacturing requires. This paper develops a model for incorporating long-range planning for component reuse in product design.

Learning surfaces using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a challenging task. Current paradigms to tackle this challenge are to either adapt the convolutional filters to operate on surfaces. learn spectral descriptors defined by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. or to drop surfaces altogether in lieu of voxelized inputs. Here we adopt an approach of converting the 3D shape into a ‘geometry image’ so that standard CNNs can directly be used to learn 3D shapes. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate that creating geometry images using authalic parametrization on a spherical domain is suitable for robust learning of 3D shape surfaces. This spherically parameterized shape is then projected and cut to convert the original 3D shape into a flat and regular geometry image.

The availability of such extensive document resources has created new challenges and opportunities for research. These include improving design information retrieval to achieve a more coherent environment for design exploration. learning. and reuse. One critical issue is related to the construction of a structured representation for indexing design documents that record engineers’ ideas and reasoning processes for a specific design. This representation should explicitly and accurately capture the important design concepts as well as the relationships between these concepts so that engineers can locate their documents of interest with less effort. For design information retrieval. we propose to use shallow natural language processing and domain-specific design ontology to automatically construct a structured and semantics-based representation from unstructured design documents. The design concepts and relationships of the representation are recognized from the document based on the identified linguistic patterns. The recognized concepts and relationships are joined to form a concept graph.

DP problem is NP-hard and its complexity increases exponentially with the size of problem. Sequence-dependent cost due to varying quality of the parts to be retrieved further increases the complexity of DP problems. This paper investigates the DP considering sequence-dependent costs among disassembly operations. A mathematical model is proposed with the objective to maximize the recovery profit using an AND/OR graph (AOG) subject to sequence-dependent costs. A novel two-phase heuristic method is developed to effectively generate feasible disassembly sequence according to the AOG in reasonable computation time.

As a starting point. we focus on decentralized shortest path interdiction (DSPI) games. where multiple interdictors try to increase the shortest path lengths of their own adversaries. who all attempt to traverse a common network. We first establish results regarding the existence of equilibria for DSPI games under both discrete and continuous interdiction strategies. To compute such an equilibrium. we present a reformulation of the DSPI games. which leads to a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) with non-shared constraints. While such a problem is computationally challenging in general. we show that under continuous interdiction actions. a DSPI game can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem and solved by Lemke's algorithm. In addition. we present decentralized heuristic algorithms based on best response dynamics for games under both continuous and discrete interdiction strategies. Finally. we establish theoretical bounds on the worst-case efficiency loss of equilibria in DSPI games. with such loss caused by the lack of coordination among noncooperative interdictors. and use the decentralized algorithms to empirically study the average-case efficiency loss.,True,IRuvBjcAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,13,https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01100,17945099798495786778,/scholar?cites=17945099798495786778,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01100,0,0,0

In particular. early design decisions can have a very significant impact on sustainability. These decisions not only relate to material and manufacturing choices but have a far-reaching effect on the product’s entire life cycle. including transportation. distribution. and end-of-life logistics. However. key challenges have to be overcome to enable eco-design methods to be applicable in early design stages. Lack of information models. semantic interoperability. methods to influence eco-design thinking in early stages. measurement science and uncertainty models in eco-decisions. and ability to balance business decisions and eco-design methodology are serious impediments to realizing sustainable products and services.

The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain of hBRCA2. a protein involved in recombination-mediated DNA repair (HRR) and replication fork maintenance. Cells deficient in hBRCA2 are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Phosphorylation of the residue in hBRCA2 targeted by the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases regulates its interaction with Rad51. Furthermore. the cell line lex1/lex2. which lacks the carboxy-terminal domain containing the phosphorylated residue. does not support localization of Rad51 to nuclear foci after exposure to UV or treatment with ionizing radiation (IR).

Here. we report the cloning of a fifth member of the polo-like kinase family named Plk5. DNA and protein sequence analyses show that Plk5 shares more similarities with Plk2 and Plk3 than with Plk1 and Plk4. Consistent with this observation. we show that mouse Plk5 is a DNA damage inducible gene. Mouse Plk5 protein localizes predominantly to the nucleolus. and deletion of a putative nucleolus localization signal (NoLS) within its N-terminal moiety disrupts its nucleolar localization. Ectopic expression of Plk5 leads to cell cycle arrest in G1. decreased DNA synthesis. and to apoptosis. a characteristic it shares with Plk3.

These organizations require recent graduates to have a strong handle on environmental issues related to new product development. Since mechanical engineering curricula are saturated with courses covering a broad spectrum of engineering fundamentals. there is little room to develop a separate course to teach principles related to sustainable product design. This manuscript presents a novel method for teaching Design for Environment (DfE) strategies within a mechanical engineering product design course through the use of expert critiques. The results from this study indicate that integration of a critique based module within an existing design project is an effective medium for teaching sustainable product design.

1278165,Targeting plug-in hybrid electric vehicle policies to increase social benefits,2010,Steven J Skerlos and James J Winebrake,38,Energy Policy,2,705-708,Elsevier,In 2009 the U.S. federal government enacted tax credits aimed at encouraging consumers to purchase plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). These tax credits are available to all consumers equally and therefore do not account for the variability in social benefits associated with PHEV operation in different parts of the country. The tax credits also do not consider variability in consumer income. This paper discusses why the PHEV subsidy policy would have higher social benefits at equal or less cost if the tax credits were offered at different levels depending on consumer income and the location of purchase. Quantification of these higher social benefits and related policy proposals are left for future work.,True,2-Au_HkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,151,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142150900843X,14855987284443777302,/scholar?cites=14855987284443777302,,,http://www-personal.umich.edu/~skerlos/phev.pdf,0,0,0

UPLCI is a modeling approach that allows users to estimate the energy and materials flow of a unit process. A UPLCI model can be reused in different manufacturing settings where a wide range of machines and materials are used. GMAW is in the joining category of the taxonomy of manufacturing processes. and this work is part of the effort to build UPLCI models for all common manufacturing processes. Following UPLCI approach. the energy consumption is not limited to the energy needed to initiate and maintain the arc (i.e. active energy). Energy spent during idle and standby are also accounted. An example calculation is provided to demonstrate how the GMAW model can be used. It should be noted that the GMAW model can be linked to UPLCI models of other unit processes.

1278209,Economic model-based control of sustainable buildings with photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems considering battery degradation costs,2018,Jie Cai and Xing Jin and Hao Zhang,,,,5406-5411,IEEE,This paper presents a model-based predictive control approach for operation of sustainable buildings with on-site photovoltaic and battery systems. A battery life span is highly dependent on the operation strategy. To capture the battery capacity loss during operation. a simplified battery cost formulation. derived from a physically-based battery degradation model. is implemented in the control optimization. A model predictive control problem is formulated to find the balance between the building utility cost and the battery life cycle cost. To reduce computational complexities. a set of piece-wise linear fits are used to approximate the battery capacity degradation and a convex formulation is derived for the control problem. Simulation test results have shown that the proposed strategy could reduce the battery degradation rate by 40 % and the total operation cost by 9% to 16% under time-of-use electricity tariffs.,True,45udssEAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8431619/,17558198903962154572,/scholar?cites=17558198903962154572,,,,0,0,0

Current efforts on optimizing manufacturing schedules under fixed or time- varying electricity prices for reduced energy cost. peak demand. and carbon footprint are largely focusing on a single facility or shop floor. In this paper. scheduling of multiple factories under two time-varying pricing schemes. i.e.. time-of-use (TOU) tariff and combined TOU with two-level inclining block rates (IBR) are investigated using mixed integer programming (MIP). Under TOU. the factories do not have incentives to collaborate and each factory optimizes its own schedule for minimal electricity cost independently. However. this leads to the shift of grid peak load from one time period to another. In this paper. TOU-IBR is proposed to address the peak shifting issue.

Typically. one of the trained NNs is chosen as best. while the rest are discarded. Hashem and Schmeiser (1992) propose using optimal linear combinations of a number of trained neural networks instead of using a single best network. In this paper. we discuss and extend the idea of optimal linear combinations of neural networks. Optimal linear combinations are constructed by forming weighted sums of the corresponding outputs of the networks. The combination-weights are selected to minimize the mean squared error with respect to the distribution of random inputs. Combining the trained networks may help integrate the knowledge acquired by the component networks and thus improve model accuracy.

Unfortunately. such systems are not applicable to production environments with dynamic characteristics.

The generic kanban system behaves similarly to the push system except that it is more flexible with respect to system performance and more robust as to the location of the bottleneck.

When the capacity is available. patients with a higher priority are selected from the waiting list and put on the schedule. At the beginning of each period. a decision of the number of patients to be scheduled is made based on the trade-offs between the cost for overtime work and the cost for surgery postponement. A stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated to address this problem. A structural analysis of the proposed model is conducted to understand the properties of an optimal schedule policy.

Yet. despite their demonstrated potential. GSS have been slow to diffuse across organizations. Drawing on the Technology Transition Model. the paper argues that the high conceptual load of GSS (i.e.. understanding of the intended effect of GSS functionality) encourages organizations to employ expert facilitators to wield the technology on behalf of others.

Our experience to date in the use of the idea generation models suggests that the technology does significantly influence the planning process. The automated version of the brainstorming model appears to neutralize many of the group effects that have been responsible for poor performance of group brainstorming in the past. Anonymity is maintained and group members appear to express their true feelings without fear of social disapproval. In addition. the automated idea generation models appear to neutralize the effects of an authority hierarchy in the group. The models allow parallel processing of ideas and prevent one group member from dominating the group discussion.

We then evaluate additional effects of a knowledge management (KM) system that collects and shares knowledge from expert individuals in an organization. We find that in the absence of personnel turnover. a management strategy of high exploitation and low exploration for a multi-tier hierarchical organization. representative of a top-down knowledge management strategy. reduces the accuracy of average individual knowledge levels compared to alternative strategies. The magnitude of this reduction in accuracy increases as the number of tiers in a hierarchical organization increase. Managers operating in a flat organization will see less of a reduction compared to a multi-tier organization. Two weighted-least-squares regressions performed on two additional data sets corroborate this central observation: a bottom-up strategy demonstrates greater resiliency to environmental turbulence than a top-down knowledge management strategy for hierarchical organizations.,True,SBSwKmEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,24,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962535,3573794941021164391,/scholar?cites=3573794941021164391,,,,0,0,0

In this article we recognize that knowledge application. among the three phases of knowledge management. has received little research attention. Paradoxically. this phase contributes most to value creation. Extending communication theory. we identify four challenges to knowledge integration in virtual team environments: constraints on transactive memory. insufficient mutual understanding. failure in sharing and retaining contextual knowledge. and inflexibility of organizational ties.

Further. we posit that in conditions of greater turbulence. the relationship between IMC and innovation capability is stronger. We suggest that IMC is a higher-order capability comprising three underlying dimensions: information acquisition. information integration and infrastructure flexibility. Then. we posit innovation capability as a multidimensional construct that incorporates innovation in the outputs of a firm and the means by which the outputs are produced. Based on a unique dataset collected through survey of 147 firms in India. we find broad support for our theoretical model.,True,LvuSlu0AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,14,https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2016/ISStrategy/Presentations/18/,3059785881582807228,/scholar?cites=3059785881582807228,,,,0,0,0
1278275,Missing Impact of Ratings on Platform Participation in India: A Call for Research in GREAT Domains,2020,Prasanna Karhade and Abhishek Kathuria,47,Communications of the Association for Information Systems,1,19,,In this study. we propose that research conducted in Western. educated. industrialized. rich. and democratic (WEIRD) domains does not necessarily generalize to the rest of the world. Growing. rural. eastern. aspirational. transitional (GREAT) domains now account for a significant proportion of world economic output and. thereby. warrant special attention. We submit that a tolerant stance under which scholars investigate GREAT domains with an open mind that allows for theoretical plurality will likely enrich IS theories. To exemplify this stance. we consider how online ratings affect ratee decisions to participate in financial transactions on a digital platform in a GREAT economy. The production and consumption of food affects every strata of society. and. thus. we choose to investigate our research question in the context of platform-enabled food delivery. We applied decision tree induction on a population-level dataset that included restaurants. their features. online ratings. and financial participation decisions from a major food discovery and delivery platform in India. Tree induction makes no distributional assumptions and makes no a priori assumptions on the combinations of factors. which allows one to put forth the most lenient test for uncovering any impact that online ratings have on the decisions that rates make tacitly. After conducting multiple computational experiments. we consistently found that online restaurant ratings did not have a significant bearing on their decision to participate on the food-delivery platform. Our counterintuitive finding serves as an example WEIRD domain logic that does not generalize to a GREAT domain and forms a …,True,LvuSlu0AAAAJ:wkm4DBaukwsC,11,https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol47/iss1/19/,13779020597668231387,/scholar?cites=13779020597668231387,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/351022487.pdf,0,0,0

Considering an organizational systems view. BI extends beyond a tool or artifact to include a number of capabilities. We draw on IT capabilities and prior research on BI to uncover potential capabilities that BI bestows to an organization. A three category BI capability classification is suggested: BI innovation infrastructure capability. BI process capability and BI integration capability. We discuss the attributes of these three BI capabilities to provide insights into how the capabilities help organizations.

Managers will have to sell more with fewer new products in an environment where new products are providing lower revenue yields. Therefore. understanding what drives successful innovation is of paramount importance. This paper examines the organizational innovation hypothesis that innovation is a function of individual efforts and organizational systems to facilitate creativity. Our model formulates creativity as a property of thought process that can be acquired and improved through instruction and practice. In this context. individual creativity mechanisms refer to activities undertaken by individual employees within an organization to enhance their capability for developing something. which is meaningful and novel within their work environment.

To compete effectively. at home or globally. firms often coordinate their activities in the world markets. Coordination has become a key to competitive advantage. Market and product innovation often involves coordination and partnership across a diverse set of organizational and geographically dispersed entities. What is often lacking for many global firms is a clear strategy for alignment in the evolution of infonnation technology (IT) architecture and the evolving global business strategy.

1278297,The effects of MIS steering committees on information technology management sophistication,2000,Jahangir Karimi and Anol Bhattacherjee and Yash P Gupta and Toni M Somers,17,Journal of Management Information Systems,2,207-230,Routledge,Despite the ever increasing importance of information technology (IT) in firms. the extent to which IT management practices are applied creatively to critical tasks varies widely across firms. For over a decade. firms have employed IT steering committees to manage their IT resources. However. the impacts of such committees on the IT management function have not been examined in depth. This paper hypothesized relationships between the level of sophistication of IT steering committees and level of IT sophistication of management within firms. and tested those relationships empirically via a field survey of 213 IT managers in the financial services industry. Results of the study suggest that presence and roles of IT steering committees are significantly related to the level and nature of IT management sophistication within firms.

Konsynski,14,IEEE transactions on software engineering,2,242,IEEE Computer Society,Forms are natural choices for primary input to an organization's database design process. The proposed approach involves an expert system for logical database design which creates an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). The ERD is created by analyzing a collection of forms. The model distinguishes among a form type. a form schema. a form template. and a form instance. The first is a collection of form fields. form schema. and a form template. which can be represented on video screen. paper. or even voice. A form instance is a collection of values for the form fields. whose properties are defined by the form schema. The model permits form fields to be structured hierarchically.

1278307,The cost-minimizing inverse classification problem: a genetic algorithm approach,2000,Michael V Mannino and Murlidhar V Koushik,29,Decision Support Systems,3,283-300,North-Holland,We consider the inverse problem in classification systems described as follows. Given a set of prototype cases representing a set of categories. a similarity function. and a new case classified in some category. we find the cost-minimizing changes to the attribute values such that the case is reclassified as a member of a (different) preferred category. The problem is “inverse” because the usual mapping is from a case to its unknown category. The increased application of classification systems in business suggests that this inverse problem can be of significant benefit to decision makers as a form of sensitivity analysis.Analytic approaches to this inverse problem are difficult to formulate as the constraints are either not available or difficult to determine. To investigate this inverse problem. we develop several genetic algorithms and study their performance as problem difficulty increases.

Many expert systems in business. engineering. and medicine have benefited from sequential decision technology. In this survey. we unify the disparate literature on sequential decision models to improve comprehensibility and accessibility. We separate formulation of sequential decision models from solution techniques.

1278318,Team leader strategies for enabling collaboration technology adaptation: team technology knowledge to improve globally distributed systems development work,2010,Dominic M Thomas and Robert P Bostrom,19,European Journal of Information Systems,2,223-237,Palgrave Macmillan UK,Active management of team adaptation of collaboration technologies offers an important lever for influencing success rates in distributed project work. particularly in settings characterized by high task interdependence. such as information systems development (ISD). Substantial uncertainty exists as to how a leader might influence such technology adaptation during project work. Prior research indicates that a major leader resource to accomplish technology adaptation in these settings would be team technology knowledge (TTK).

1278320,Limits to effective leadership style and tactics in critical incident interventions,2009,Dominic Thomas and Elliot Bendoly,40,Project Management Journal,2,70-80,SAGE Publications,Leadership effectiveness takes many forms. Its impact on performance can be critical. but by no means does it stand alone. and hence cannot truly be evaluated in isolation. Nor can it be assumed that more of any one effective style is necessarily a good thing. In project management contexts. these issues are particularly salient. Here we study the impact of multiple leadership styles on project performance. as well as the joint role that intervention tactics in general play. Our empirical study demonstrates the benefit of moderate mixes of leadership style and the declining returns on active interventions in these settings.,True,kdyRvDgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,41,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pmj.20118,13943856397154130738,/scholar?cites=13943856397154130738,,,,0,0,0

The two axes representing the structure and volatility of the information are really continuums rather than discrete branches of dichotomy. Applications in the two domains we mentioned—product catalogs and hypermedia front-ends of databases or legacy applications—are highly structured and have high information volatility. making the RMM methodology particularly appropriate. At the opposite end of the spectrum. an artistic work may not have a readily discernible structure and usually remains unchanged over time. In this case. RMM is not applicable. Highly structured applications that remain unchanged over a long period of time can benefit from the RMM methodology during the design and construction phases but do not require much maintenance. so that the updating problem is relatively …,True,fpbxFMoAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,1309,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/208344.208346,15455436595161191889,/scholar?cites=15455436595161191889,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.31.4183&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Given the high cost and difficulty of developing high-quality software. the idea of capitalizing on previous software investments is appealing. However. software reuse has not been as effective as expected and has not been very broadly or systematically used in industry. This paper surveys recent software-reuse research using a framework that helps identify and organize the many factors that must be considered to achieve the benefits of software reuse in practice.

Our discourse compares systematically CC and CPM on three conceptual levels to reveal the differences between the two approaches. We conclude that the philosophy behind the CP and CC approaches is remarkably different resulting in a different mindset for managers and a different set of management practices.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) understand the extent to which IS projects are prone to escalate. (2) compare the outcomes of projects that escalate with those that do not. and (3) test whether constructs associated with different theories of escalation can be used to discriminate between projects that escalate and those that do not. A survey was administered to IS audit and control professionals and. to establish a baseline for comparison. the survey was designed to gather data on projects that did not escalate as well as those that did escalate.

Building on prior work. software project risk was conceptualized along six dimensions. A questionnaire was built and 507 software project managers were surveyed. A cluster analysis was then performed to identify aspects of low. medium. and high risk projects. An examination of risk dimensions across the levels revealed that even low risk projects have a high level of complexity risk. For high risk projects. the risks associated with requirements. planning and control. and the organization become more obvious. The influence of project scope. sourcing practices. and strategic orientation on project risk dimensions was also examined.

Although initial research posited that POS data can improve forecast accuracy. recent research has called some of these findings into question. We identify item order quantity. item order variability. and item order frequency of orders as specific factors that can affect the degree of improvement in POS demand forecasting accuracy when compared to order history-based techniques. Using a hierarchical linear model. we examine 60.651 orders for hundreds of items across 25 different distribution centers.

Bcl-2 and a related gene. Bcl-X. inhibit several forms of apoptosis. Herein. we report that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. characteristic of apoptosis and induced by ionizing radiation. is accompanied by concomitant decreases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-X mRNA levels in HL-60 and U-937 human leukemia cells. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation after exposure to TNF-α and C2-ceramide was also associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA in HL-60 and U-937 cells. while Bcl-X mRNA production was unaffected. These results suggest that modulation of Bcl-2 gene expression may be a target for ceramide-mediated apoptosis following exposure to ionizing radiation and TNF-α.

One solution could be the application of lossless compression. Among available methods. JPEG-LS has excellent coding performance. However. it only compresses a single picture with intracoding and does not utilize the interframe correlation among pictures. Therefore. this paper proposes a method that combines the JPEG-LS and an interframe coding with motion vectors to enhance the compression performance of using JPEG-LS alone. Since the interframe correlation between two adjacent images in a medical image sequence is usually not as high as that in a general video image sequence. the interframe coding is activated only when the interframe correlation is high enough.

In this study. we enhance the technology acceptance model to explain the factors that influence the acceptance of Google Applications for collaborative learning. The enhanced model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 136 students enrolled in a full-time degree program that used Google Applications to support project work. According to the research results. determinants of the technology acceptance model are the major factors influencing the adoption of the technology.

We investigate the impacts of individual online social networking engagement (e.g.. on Facebook) from a pedagogical standpoint. Based on social learning theory. we argue that two socialization processes. social acceptance and acculturation. bridge individual online social networking engagement with three domains of social learning outcomes. Results from a survey accompanied by focus group discussions demonstrate the substantial impacts of university student online social networking engagement on social learning processes and outcomes. Online social networking not only directly influences university students’ learning outcomes. but also helps the students attain social acceptance from others and adapt to university culture. both of which play prominent roles in improving their learning outcomes.,True,p8YrZKsAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C,636,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131510001752,7309187491127282938,/scholar?cites=7309187491127282938,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34999482/1-s2.0-S0360131510001752-main.pdf,0,0,0

When parties to commercial exchange become involved in a manifest conflict episode. it might be expected that the types of norms that govern their relationship will affect their characterization of each other's conflict behavior. This article proposes a model of conflict in commercial exchange relationships. The model focuses on how the prevailing exchange norms of solidarity. role integrity. and mutuality impact a party's perception of unfair treatment. and how causal attributions mediate those effects. The perception of unfairness is then linked to the level of hostility that is retained after the conflict episode ostensibly has been terminated.

There have been two leading reasons proposed for this preference. First. that franchisees provide the financial capital necessary for expansion. and second that franchisees manage the outlets better than company employees would if the unit were company owned. Interestingly. although many entrepreneur/franchisors confirm the relevance of the capital acquisition argument in their decision-making. theoretical analysis has discounted its importance.

We find that the present value of the ex ante rents is around $300K-$455K 1982 dollars. Ex post rents are. of course. even larger. We argue that the ex post rents represent an incentive mechanism that complements the use of profit-sharing rights at McDonald's. We also argue that ex ante rents arise here because franchisees' wealth constraints prevent the up-front extraction of the full present value of the ex post rents. Finally. we note that McDonald's desire for a particular type of individual to operate its franchises--namely. owner-operators whose livelihoods are tied to the success of their outlets--increases the likelihood that downstream operators face liquidity constraints.

We compare the predictions made by three alternative theories within the context of the fast food industry. Signaling theory predicts that franchise systems will move toward a greater reliance on franchised outlets as systems mature. while resource acquisition theory (or as it is sometimes known. ownership redirection thesis) predicts a tendency in the opposite direction. A third theoretical perspective. tapered integration or plural forms. suggests a tendency toward maintaining a steady state of mixed distribution. Results indicate that although franchisors value the benefits of the mix of ownership types and do maintain that mix over time. there is some evidence of a greater tendency to permanently convert existing franchised outlets to company-owned outlets as fast food systems mature and gain greater access to resources.,True,8TpZqqEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,318,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022435903000113,9088402263675574714,/scholar?cites=9088402263675574714,,,,0,0,0

1278415,Intangible assets and the economic impact of computers,2005,Eric Brynjolfsson and Lorin Hitt,,Transforming enterprise: The economic and social implications of information technology,,27-48,MIT Press Boston,Productivity is arguably the single most important statistic for measuring the performance of an economy. Since 1995. productivity in the United States has increased by an average of over 3.1 percent per year. This is more than double the 1.4 percent productivity growth rate that prevailed from 1973 through 1995. An increasing body of evidence suggests that computers have made a significant contribution to this productivity revival. In part. this is a by-product of the tremendous technological progress in the computer industry. There has been a long-term trend. dating back to the beginning of the century. of rapid technological progress in information processing functions. This is evident in sustained annual improvements in the priceperformance ratio of computers of more than 20 percent overall. However. this trend accelerated around 1995. with faster improvements in semiconductors. Furthermore. the performance of components such as disk drives and data communications have also advanced more rapidly. The technology improvements have led to falling real prices. Nonetheless. corporations actually increased nominal spending on computers and communications equipment (collectively referred to as information technology. or IT) in the late 1990s. leading to a dramatically growing stock of real IT capital and capabilities. This sustained growth combined with the mathematics of growth accounting—the contribution of capital asset to output growth is equal to the product of its growth rate and factor share (input quantity per unit of output)—suggests that it was only a matter of time before sufficient IT capital accumulation would have a substantial …,True,Y5HkrCIAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,50,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lgsosuF2LBgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA27&dq=info:GqGgEKhRM88J:scholar.google.com&ots=09vOUP7zWN&sig=zPaYTQ0yQQJJZGDY0WaecyUhWY4,14930366971938644250,/scholar?cites=14930366971938644250,,,,0,0,0
1278416,On the viability of the open source development model for the design of physical objects: Lessons learned from the RepRap project,2010,Erik de Bruijn and R O’Callaghan and P Ribbers and J de Jong and EA von Hippel,,Unpublished Diss.(MSc Thesis). Tilburg University,,,,While open source software development has been studied extensively. relatively little is known about the viability of the same development model for a physical object’s design. This thesis addresses this deficit by exploring the extent to which this model is viable for the development of physical objects. It starts with a review of the relevant literature on open source and user innovation communities followed by a case study and survey of the RepRap community.This community develops a digital fabrication system that can 3D print a large share of its own parts. This allows for a decentralized community to independently produce physical parts based on digital designs that are shared via the internet. Apart from improving the device. dedicated infrastructure was developed by user innovators. The survey reveals substantial adoption and development of 3D printer technology. comparable to the larger vendors in the industry. RepRap community members are spending between 145 and 182 full-time equivalents and have spent between 382.000 and 478.000 dollars on innovation alone. At the RepRap project’s 6 month doubling interval. it is entirely feasible that its adoption and disruptive levels of innovation will exceed that of the incumbent industry. Within the community there is a higher incidence in modifications of hardware than in software. and. surprisingly. hardware modifications are expected to be relatively easier for others to replicate. The level of collaboration is also higher for hardware than for software. Through Thingiverse. a web-based sharing platform originating from the RepRap project. 1.486 designs of physical objects in the last 6 …,True,Y5HkrCIAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC,47,https://thesis.erikdebruijn.nl/master/Latex/thesis.pdf,13947086638228623787,/scholar?cites=13947086638228623787,,,https://thesis.erikdebruijn.nl/master/Latex/thesis.pdf,0,0,0

1278421,Managing information technology in multinational corporations,1992,Edward Mozley Roche,,,,,Barraclough Ltd,This book is intended to build a bridge between two different sets of literature and ideas. On the one side. it is concerned with the multinational corporation and the rather considerable amount of literature and academic thought developed over the past few decades regarding international business and its principal actor. the multinational corporation. This literature has many important themes of thought. its great debates. and an intellectual tradition that finds sustenance in the deeper currents of political economy and economic history. On the other side. I explored the management information systems (MIS) field to examine what we know about information technology. including telecommunications systems. with particular regard to how it is used in business and commerce. This field is relatively new—information technology is relatively new—and is. as yet. quite ill-defined. Although this gives it the chance to carry more flexibility than other academic disciplines. it still suffers from not having the deep well of tradition and history from which to draw its intellectual currents. The MIS field sometimes reminds me of Japan during the Meiji period. Ideas were being imported from all over the world by the ryugaku trips overseas to absorb foreign knowledge. So it is with MIS. to which many of its proponents have come as intellectual refugees from other areas (many from the social sciences). bringing with them the myriad of methodologies. approaches. and values associated with those other fields. iii,True,hG0mZhcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,110,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8ik0VyfSQR0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:6Eb_dNs3304J:scholar.google.com&ots=uSHW2HQ79H&sig=DFsGcYpuVhwG1KYFhfnjbhGMSF8,5683322670465107688,/scholar?cites=5683322670465107688,,,,0,0,0

To examine this. a laboratory experiment examining the influence of group history (i.e.. established versus ad-hoc groups) and the level of computer support (i.e.. communicating via a computer-mediated system versus face-to-face) was conducted. Dependent variables examined in the research include information-sharing performance. decision quality. and member perceptions.

Six different numerical group sizes were studied. which ranged from 5 to 10 members. Logical size was manipulated by varying the amount of task-relevant information given to a particular group member. Larger logical group sizes (heterogeneous groups) were induced by distributing unique task-relevant information among group members; smaller logical group sizes (homogeneous groups) were induced by providing all task information to all members. A significant main effect for numerical group size showed that larger groups outperformed smaller groups.

To realize large-scale social simulations. we have developed the scenario description languages Q and IPC (Interaction Pattern Card); they enable experts in the application domain (often not computing professionals) to easily create complex scenarios.

In training for collaboration based on face-to-face interaction. the generation of emotional expressions is one key. In training for guidance based on one-to-many interaction such as direction giving for evacuations. emotional expressions must be supplemented by diverse agent behaviors to make the training realistic. To reproduce diverse behavior. we characterize agents by using a various combinations of operation rules instantiated by the user operating the agent. To accomplish this goal. we introduce a user modeling method based on participatory simulations. These simulations enable us to acquire information observed by each user in the simulation and the operating history. Using these data and the domain knowledge including known operation rules. we can generate an explanation for each behavior. Moreover. the application of hypothetical reasoning. which offers consistent selection of hypotheses. to the generation of explanations allows us to use otherwise incompatible operation rules as domain knowledge. In order to validate the proposed modeling method. we apply it to the acquisition of an evacuee’s model in a fire-drill experiment.

1278447,Context-based approach for pivot translation services,2009,Rie Tanaka and Yohei Murakami and Toru Ishida,,,,,,Machine translation services available on the Web are becoming increasingly popular. However. a pivot translation service is required to realize translations between non-English languages by cascading different translation services via English. As a result. the meaning of words often drifts due to the inconsistency. asymmetry and intransitivity of word selections among translation services. In this paper. we propose context-based coordination to maintain the consistency of word meanings during pivot translation services. First. we propose a method to automatically generate multilingual equivalent terms based on bilingual dictionaries and use generated terms to propagate context among combined translation services. Second. we show a multiagent architecture as one way of implementation. wherein a coordinator agent gathers and propagates context from/to a translation agent. We generated trilingual equivalent noun terms and implemented a Japanese-to-German-and-back translation. cascading into four translation services. The evaluation results showed that the generated terms can cover over 58% of all nouns. The translation quality was improved by 40% for all sentences. and the quality rating for all sentences increased by an average of 0.47 points on a five-point scale. These results indicate that we can realize consistent pivot translation services through context-based coordination based on existing services.,True,YrVN3CQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,40,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.150.4185&rep=rep1&type=pdf,7961316694967769169,/scholar?cites=7961316694967769169,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.150.4185&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

MA,This paper presents a new algorithm for solving distributed constraint satisfaction problems (distributed CSPs) called the distributed breakout algorithm. which is inspired by the breakout algorithm for solving centraiized CSPs. In this algorithm. each agent tries to optimize its evaluation value (the number of constraint violations) by exchanging its current value and the possible amount of its improvement among neighboring agents. Instead of detecting the fact that agents as a whole are trapped in a local-minimum. each agent detects whether it is in a quasi-local-minimum. which is a weaker condition than a local-minimum. and changes the weights of constraint violations to escape from the quasi-local-minimum.

We take advantage of the multi-touch surface to combine biometric techniques with gestural input. We defined a comprehensive set of five-finger touch gestures. based upon classifying movement characteristics of the center of the palm and fingertips. and tested them in a user study combining biometric data collection with usability questions. Using pattern recognition techniques. we built a classifier to recognize unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate with single gestures. and saw significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found user ratings of a gestures desirable characteristics (ease. pleasure. excitement) correlated with a gestures actual biometric recognition rate-that is to say. user ratings aligned well with gestural security. in contrast to …,True,0kVAdOIAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,341,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2207676.2208543,17223630116032821683,/scholar?cites=17223630116032821683,,,http://katherineinterface.com/napachi.pdf,0,0,0
1278501,Truth is beauty: Researching embodied conversational agents,2000,Clifford Nass and Katherine Isbister and Eun-Ju Lee,,Embodied conversational agents,,374-402,,GH Hardy (1941) argues that the sole criterion for excellent research is that the researcher produces “beauty.” While seemingly ineffable and frustratingly imprecise. Hardy instead suggests that creating beauty is straightforward. First. the work must be accurate: erroneous results are useless. Second. one’s peers must recognize the work to be interesting. exciting. elegant. and “cool.” While this second criterion might seem arbitrary. there is generally good agreement between scholars in a given community about “interesting” work (see Cole and Cole 1973 for a discussion). so one need not survey numerous researchers to ensure research is beautiful; asking a couple is equivalent to asking them all.With certain caveats. the work in embodied conversational agents (ECA) can make claims to beauty. ECAs are phenomenologically “accurate” to the extent that the agent’s outward appearance objectively matches the appearance. language. attitudes and behavior of humans. Thus. questions that address manifestation accuracy include “Does the agent walk like a person walk?” and “Does the agent use language and make grammatical errors the same way a person does?” An alternative approach to accuracy. generally associated more with the artificial intelligence literature than with the ECA literature. assesses the extent to which the processes that produce aspects of the ECA are the same as the processes in humans.

1278502,How games move us: Emotion by design,2016,Katherine Isbister,,,,,Mit Press,This is a renaissance moment for video games--in the variety of genres they represent. and the range of emotional territory they cover. But how do games create emotion? In How Games Move Us. Katherine Isbister takes the reader on a timely and novel exploration of the design techniques that evoke strong emotions for players. She counters arguments that games are creating a generation of isolated. emotionally numb. antisocial loners. Games. Isbister shows us. can actually play a powerful role in creating empathy and other strong. positive emotional experiences; they reveal these qualities over time. through the act of playing. She offers a nuanced. systematic examination of exactly how games can influence emotion and social connection. with examples--drawn from popular. indie. and art games--that unpack the gamer's experience. Isbister describes choice and flow. two qualities that distinguish games from other media. and explains how game developers build upon these qualities using avatars. non-player characters. and character customization. in both solo and social play. She shows how designers use physical movement to enhance players' emotional experience. and examines long-distance networked play. She illustrates the use of these design methods with examples that range from Sony's Little Big Planet to the much-praised indie game Journey to art games like Brenda Romero's Train. Isbister's analysis shows us a new way to think about games. helping us appreciate them as an innovative and powerful medium for doing what film. literature. and other creative media do: helping us to understand ourselves and what it means to …,True,0kVAdOIAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,262,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Xp-iCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:XdyAOnFQAtsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=HqbZIwV9Ac&sig=K7rI7-IBLl82TZe9eVJp7KrP_Jo,15781264491502689373,/scholar?cites=15781264491502689373,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d559/564a49a560331b0fdd4944bec9901e71c705.pdf,0,0,0

The key technology to conduct truly useful MABS is agent modeling for reproducing realistic behaviors. In order to make agent models realistic. it seems natural to learn from human behavior in the real world.

We show a methodology that can elicit prior knowledge for explaining human driving behavior in specific environments. and then construct a driving behavior model based on the set of prior knowledge.

Each driver might have different set of rules and their priorities. We apply a method to acquire individual operation models using hypothetical reasoning. Because of the method. we are able to obtain operation models which can explain driver’s operation during driving simulation.

Previous methods eliminate irrelevant documents from the pages accessed using heuristics based on human knowledge about the domain in question. Accordingly. they are hard to build and can not be applied to other domains. The keyword spice method. in contrast. improves search performance by adding domain-specific keywords. called keyword spices. to the user’s input query; the modified query is then forwarded to a general-purpose search engine. Keyword spices can be effectively discovered automatically from web documents allowing us to build high quality domain-specific search engines in various domains without requiring the collection of heuristic knowledge.

The vast majority of this work has assumed that negotiation issues are independent. so agents can aggregate the utilities of the issue values by simple summation. producing linear utility functions.

We cannot. for example. just add up the value of car’s carburetor and the value of car’s engine when engineers negotiate over the design a car. These value of these choices are interdependent. resulting in nonlinear utility functions. In this paper. we address this important gap in current negotiation techniques.

One way to handle contextual polarity is to revise the prior polarity of the sentiment dictionary to fit the domain. This paper presents a data-driven method of adapting sentiment dictionaries to diverse domains. Our method first merges multiple sentiment dictionaries at the entry word level to expand the dictionary. Then. leveraging the ratio of the positive/negative training data. it selectively removes the entry words that do not contribute to the classification. Finally. it selectively switches the sentiment polarity of the entry words to adapt to the domain. In essence. our method compares the positive/negative review’s dictionary word occurrence ratios with the positive/negative review ratio itself to determine which entry words to be removed and which entry words’ sentiment …,True,TS30d0kAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,90,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705114002196,1917290971436812043,/scholar?cites=1917290971436812043,,,,0,0,0

In recent years. deep learning techniques have further improved HAR performance on several benchmark datasets. In this paper. we propose one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) for HAR that employs a divide and conquer-based classifier learning coupled with test data sharpening. Our approach leverages a two-stage learning of multiple 1D CNN models; we first build a binary classifier for recognizing abstract activities. and then build two multi-class 1D CNN models for recognizing individual activities. We then introduce test data sharpening during prediction phase to further improve the activity recognition accuracy. While there have been numerous researches exploring the benefits of activity signal denoising for HAR. few researches have examined the effect of test data sharpening for HAR. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on two popular HAR benchmark datasets. and show that our approach outperforms both the two-stage 1D CNN-only method and other state of the art approaches.

1278545,Performance of ensemble classifier for location prediction task: emphasis on Markov Blanket perspective,2010,Kun Chang Lee and Heeryon Cho,3,"International Journal of u-and e-Service, Science and Technology",3,2010,,As the ubiquitous computing becomes popular. its applications come to real life as a form of a wide variety of ubiquitous decision support systems (UDSS). However. such ubiquity should be supported by prediction capability no matter which kind of contexts users are in. In this sense. context prediction capability. which is to predict future contexts users are going to enter sooner or later. becomes an extremely important part of ubiquitous decision support systems. This study proposes a new breed of context prediction mechanism using the Markov Blanket obtained from General Bayesian Network (GBN) as a main vehicle. To improve the prediction accuracy. ensemble of robust prediction classifiers is suggested on the basis of the GBN Markov Blanket. Three classifiers included in the ensemble mechanism are Bayesian networks. decision classifiers. and an SVM (Support Vector Machine). The proposed GBN Markov blanket-assisted ensemble classifier is applied to a real dataset of location prediction. Results were promising enough to conclude that the proposed ensemble classifier based on the GBN Markov Blanket is worthwhile for being adopted in developing a powerful context prediction purpose UDSS.

Among many content-based retrieval systems. sketch-based media retrieval systems have attracted attention recently with the proliferation of tablet PCs and smart mobile devices. Sketch-based retrieval requires the user to draw a freehand sketch query. but freehand drawing can be challenging for those with limited drawing skills. This degrades retrieval performance. since successful retrieval depends on the quality of the sketch query image drawn by the user.

First. we compare the positive/negative book review classification performance of eight individual sentiment dictionaries. Then. we select the seven dictionaries with greater than 50% accuracy and combine their results using (1) averaging.(2) weighted-averaging. and (3) majority voting. We show that the combined dictionaries perform only slightly better than the best single dictionary (65.8%) achieving (1) 67.8%.(2) 67.7%. and (3) 68.3% respectively. To improve this. we combine seven dictionaries at a deeper level by merging the dictionary entry words and averaging the sentiment scores. Moreover. we leverage the skewed distribution of positive/negative threshold setting data to update the merged dictionary by selectively removing the dictionary entries that do not contribute to classification while switching the polarity of selected sentiment scores that hurts the classification performance. We show that the revised dictionary achieves 80.9% accuracy and outperforms both the individual dictionaries and the shallow dictionary combinations in the book review classification task.,True,TS30d0kAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,9,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I13-1053.pdf,18325556296966017725,/scholar?cites=18325556296966017725,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I13-1053.pdf,0,0,0

1278562,Interpretation of emotionally expressive characters in an intercultural communication,2004,Tomoko Koda,,,,862-868,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,This paper reports an early result of an evaluation experiment of emotionally expressive characters for intercultural communication. The experiment was conducted as a series of discussions on a multilingual BBS with expressive characters between China and Japan. The result shows some characters and facial expressions used in the experiment were interpreted completely differently and used for different purposes between Chinese and Japanese participants. As emoticons are widely used for international business communications as well as daily casual ones via instant messengers. this finding rises an important research questions. i.e.. what is an appropriate character representation for intercultural communication. what kind of character traits are suitable for intercultural representation. what kind of facial expressions are universally understood and interpreted. and so on.,True,U1dDFYMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,21,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30133-2_113,15972811816258885164,/scholar?cites=15972811816258885164,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomoko_Koda/publication/226774392_Interpretation_of_Emotionally_Expressive_Characters_in_an_Intercultural_Communication/links/0fcfd50b7db03ed701000000/Interpretation-of-Emotionally-Expressive-Characters-in-an-Intercultural-Communication.pdf,0,0,0

To realize large-scale social simulations. we have developed the scenario description languages Q and IPC (Interaction Pattern Card); they enable experts in the application domain (often not computing professionals) to easily create complex scenarios. We have also established a four-step process for creating scenarios: 1) defining a vocabulary. 2) describing scenarios. 3) extracting interaction patterns. and 4) integrating real and virtual experiments. In order to validate the scenario description languages and the four-step process. we ran a series of evacuation simulations based on the proposed languages and process.

Heidelberg,This paper proposes a new e-procurement model for a large number of buyers and sellers interacting via the Internet. The goal of e-procurement is to create a satisfactory match between buyers’ demand and sellers’ supply. From our real-world experience. we view e-procurement as a process of negotiation to increase the matching quality of two corresponding specifications: one for buyers’ demand and another for sellers’ supply. To model scalable e-procurement. we propose a co-adaptive matchmaking mechanism using mutual relevance feedback. In order to understand the nature of the mechanism. we have developed two types of software agents. called e-buyers and e-sellers. to simulate human buyers and sellers.

Participatory Design (PD) was introduced and applied in the Scandinavian and American context as a practical design method for collective creativity and stakeholder involvement. In this paper. by fusing game elements into PD. we suggest a first step towards a culturally independent PD method called the ICT Service Design Game to ease the prevailing concern that PD has limited applicability in other cultural settings. We conduct four experiments on ICT Service Design Game in Scandinavia and Asia to evaluate its feasibility. The experiments identify some differences in the PD process and the created Persona characteristics. probably due to cultural differences.

However. the behavior of real-time search agents is far from rational during the learning (convergence) process. in that they fail to balance the efforts to achieve a short-term goal (ie. to safely arrive at a goal state in the present problem solving trial) and a long-term goal (to find better solutions through repeated trials). As a remedy. we introduce two techniques for controlling the amount of exploration. both overall and per trial. The weighted real-time search reduces the overall amount of exploration and accelerates convergence. It sacrifices admissibility but provides a nontrivial bound on the converged solution cost. The real-time search with upper bounds insures solution quality in each trial when the state space is undirected.

Intuitively. it corresponds to the expected cost incurred by a random walker in order to reach a destination node from a starting node while maintaining a constant entropy (related to θ) spread in the graph. The parameter θ is therefore biasing gradually the simple random walk on the graph towards the shortest-path policy.

While the k-nearest neighbor graphs have been the de facto standard method of graph construction. this paper advocates using the less well-known mutual k-nearest neighbor graphs for high-dimensional natural language data. To compare the performance of these two graph construction methods. we run semi-supervised classification methods on both graphs in word sense disambiguation and document classification tasks. The experimental results show that the mutual k-nearest neighbor graphs. if combined with maximum spanning trees. consistently outperform the knearest neighbor graphs. We attribute better performance of the mutual k-nearest neighbor graph to its being more resistive to making hub vertices.

To this end. a probability distribution on the (usually infinite) countable set of paths through the graph is defined by minimizing the total expected cost between all pairs of nodes while fixing the total relative entropy spread in the graph. This results in a Boltzmann distribution on the set of paths such that long (high-cost) paths occur with a low probability while short (low-cost) paths occur with a high probability. The sum-over-paths (SoP) covariance measure between nodes is then defined according to this probability distribution: two nodes are considered as highly correlated if they often co-occur together on the same - preferably short - paths. The resulting covariance matrix between nodes (say n nodes in total) is a Gram matrix and therefore defines a valid kernel on the …,True,5hIe8OoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,74,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4815265/,15115878484665567835,/scholar?cites=15115878484665567835,,,http://www.isys.ucl.ac.be/staff/marco/Publications/2009_SumOverPathsCovariance.pdf,0,0,0

The need for developing such distances has risen from the observation that the above-mentioned common distances in many situations fail to take into account the global structure of the graph. In this article. we develop the theory of one family of graph node distances. known as the randomized shortest path dissimilarity. which has its foundation in statistical physics. We show that the randomized shortest path dissimilarity can be easily computed in closed form for all pairs of nodes of a graph. Moreover. we come up with a new definition of a distance measure that we call the free energy distance. The free energy distance can be seen as an upgrade of the randomized shortest path dissimilarity as it defines a metric. in addition to which it satisfies the …,True,5hIe8OoAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,65,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437113008479,10714473263850509022,/scholar?cites=10714473263850509022,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1666,0,0,0

In semantic web services. an ontology is used by the matching system to determine the semantic relationship between the requests and the registered services. In this paper. we propose that the semantic relationship can be measured quantitatively in order to provide a more precise similarity measures between the requested and advertised services and to produce a better ranking of relevant services. We proposes and develops a Semantic Distance Measure that is tailored to provide a quantitative measure that indicates similarity between advertised and requested services.

However. existing QoS techniques do not accommodate users' skills and preferences. We propose user-centered QoS. which is a QoS defined by the interaction between skills/preferences of service user(s) and quality of service provider(s). By implementing user-centered QoS approach. the best service is delivered to users based on the calculation not only the quality of the services but also the skill/information of users. We proposed a novel two-stage approach for combining services in user-centered QoS. i.e. intra-workflow and inter-workflow service selection.

Two important ideas in human‐robot communication through research from the viewpoint of cognitive science have been obtained – one is importance of physical expressions using the body and the other is the effectiveness of the robot’s autonomy in the robot’s utterance recognition by humans. Based on these psychological experiments. a new architecture that generates episode chains in interactions with humans is developed. The basic structure of the architecture is a network of situated modules. Each module consists of elemental behaviors to entrain humans and a behavior for communicating with humans.,True,BL9EACgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,317,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/01439910110410051/full/html,17827694895252714318,/scholar?cites=17827694895252714318,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.926.3170&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A series of experiments addressed whether there are systematic differences in information processing styles between chronically heavy and light media multitaskers. A trait media multitasking index was developed to identify groups of heavy and light media multitaskers. These two groups were then compared along established cognitive control dimensions. Results showed that heavy media multitaskers are more susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli and from irrelevant representations in memory. This led to the surprising result that heavy media multitaskers performed worse on a test of task-switching ability. likely due to reduced ability to filter out interference from the irrelevant task set.

1278635,Emotion in human–computer interaction,2009,Scott Brave and Clifford Nass,20094635,,,53-68,CRC Press,Emotion is a fundamental component of being human. Joy. hate. anger. and pride. among the plethora of other emotions. motivate action and add meaning and richness to virtually all human experience. Traditionally. human–computer interaction (HCI) has been viewed as the “ultimate” exception; users must discard their emotional selves to work efficiently and rationality with computers. the quintessentially unemotional artifact. Emotion seemed at best marginally relevant to HCI and at worst oxymoronic.Recent research in psychology and technology suggests a different view of the relationship between humans. computers. and emotion. After a long period of dormancy and confusion. there has been an explosion of research on the psychology of emotion (Gross. 1999). Emotion is no longer seen as limited to the occasional outburst of fury when a computer crashes inexplicably. excitement when a video game character leaps past an obstacle. or frustration at an incomprehensible error message. It is now understood that a wide range of emotions plays a critical role in every computer-related. goal-directed activity. from developing a three-dimensional (3D) CAD model and running calculations on a spreadsheet. to searching the Web and sending an e-mail. to making an online purchase and playing solitaire. Indeed. many psychologists now argue that it is impossible for a person to have a thought or perform an action without engaging. at least unconsciously. his or her emotional systems (Picard. 1997b).,True,2trZ2IYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,719,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=npLEMUzgQ_0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA53&dq=info:hx-s8Os0YsoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=VJe2pO-nGo&sig=G9YNtHPxN2jQDbEgyIg6oP0We9Q,14583276731338858375,/scholar?cites=14583276731338858375,,,http://usd-apps.usd.edu/coglab/schieber/hedonomics/pdf/Emotion-HCI.pdf,0,0,0
1278636,Wired for speech: How voice activates and advances the human-computer relationship,2005,Clifford Ivar Nass and Scott Brave,,,,9,MIT press,Spoken dialogue systems have received increased interest because they are potentially much more natural and powerful methods of communicating with machines than are current graphics-based interfaces. Wired for Speech presents basic research in the psychological and sociological aspects of voice synthesis and recognition. Its major lesson is that people attribute human characteristics to spoken dialogue systems for reasons related to human evolution. But although it contains interesting basic research. the book is mainly aimed at giving technological or marketing advice to those seeking to use voice interfaces when creating commercial applications. The book is oriented around a series of simple experiments designed to show just how pervasive psychological and social influences can be on the opinions and behaviors of people confronted with voice interfaces. Each chapter describes a basic research hypothesis. introduces an experiment to test it. and discusses its implications for designing voice interfaces: gender. personality. accent. ethnicity. emotion. number of distinct voices. use of “I” by the system. voices in concert with faces. mixed synthetic and recorded voices. context. and the effects of errors in human–computer cooperation.Although Wired for Speech is very accessible. especially to the non-scientist. it is written with an unusual bibliography style for an academic book: All references and details are given in a notes section at the end of the book. making up one third of the content.

We try to expand user interests significantly by letting the user browse those topics. We first generate user-interest ontologies that allow user profiles to be constructed as a hierarchy of classes where a user interest weight is assigned to each class and instance. Next. we measure the similarity between user interests by using interest weights on their user-interest ontologies and generate user group G U that has high similarity to user u.

If the graph is large. this approach is infeasible due to its high computational cost. The goal of this study is to find top-k Page\-Rank score nodes efficiently for a given graph without sacrificing accuracy. Our solution. F-Rank. is based on two ideas:(1) It iteratively estimates lower/upper bounds of Page\-Rank scores. and (2) It constructs subgraphs in each iteration by pruning unnecessary nodes and edges to identify top-k nodes.

Heidelberg,Recently. the use of blogs has been a remarkable means to publish user interests. In order to find suitable information resources from a large amount of blog entries which are published every day. we need an information filtering technique to automatically transcribe user interests to a user profile in detail. In this paper. we first classify user blog entries into service domain ontologies and extract interest ontologies that express a user’s interests semantically as a hierarchy of classes according to interest weight by a top-down approach. Next. with a bottom-up approach. users modify their interest ontologies to update their interests in more detail.

1278648,Recommendations Over Domain Specific User Graphs.,2010,Makoto Nakatsuji and Yasuhiro Fujiwara and Akimichi Tanaka and Tadasu Uchiyama and Toru Ishida,,,,607-612,,Content providers want to make recommendations across multiple interrelated domains such as music and movies. However. existing collaborative filtering methods fail to accurately identify items that may be interesting to the user but that lie in domains that the user has not accessed before. This is mainly because of the paucity of user transactions across multiple item domains. Our method is based on the observation that users who share similar items or who share social connections. can provide recommendation chains (sequences of transitively associated edges) to items in other domains. It first builds domain-specific-user graphs (DSUGs) whose nodes. users. are linked by weighted edges that reflect user similarity. It then connects the DSUGs via the users who rated items in several domains or via the users who share social connections. to create a cross-domainuser graph (CDUG). It performs Random Walk with Restarts on the CDUG to extract user nodes that are related to the starting user node on the CDUG even though they are not present in the DSUG of the starting user node. It then adds items possessed by those users to the recommendations of the starting node user. Furthermore. to extract many more user nodes. we employ a taxonomy-based similarity measure that states that users are similar if they share the same items and/or same classes. Thus we can set many suitable routes from the starting user node to other user nodes in the CDUG.

However. the widely-used time-decay-based approach worsens the sparsity problem because it deemphasizes old item transactions. We introduce two ideas to solve the sparsity problem. First. we divide the users’ transactions into epochs i.e. time periods. and identify epochs that are dominated by interests similar to the current interests of the active user. Thus. it can eliminate dissimilar transactions while making use of similar transactions that exist in prior epochs. Second. we use a taxonomy of items to model user item transactions in each epoch.

Analyzing the linked information provided by an SA assigned by a user to an item can improve the recommendation accuracy. This is because this information contains the reason why the user assigned a high or low rating value to the item. However. previous studies have failed to use SAs in an effective manner to improve the recommendation accuracy because few users rate the same items with the same SAs. which leads to the sparsity problem during collaborative filtering.

The median optimal solution length appears to be 18 moves. The algorithm used is iterative-deepening-A*(IDA*). with a lowerbound heuristic function based on large memory-based lookup tables. or “pattern databases”(Culberson and Schaeffer 1996). These tables store the exact number of moves required to solve various subgoals of the problem. in this case subsets of the individual movable cubies. We characterize the effectiveness of an admissible heuristic function by its expected value. and hypothesize that the overall performance of the program obeys a relation in which the product of the time and space used equals the size of the state space.

Culberson. J. Schaeffer. Comput. Intelligence 14 (3) (1998) 318–334]. While many heuristics. such as Manhattan distance. compute the cost of solving individual subgoals independently. pattern databases consider the cost of solving multiple subgoals simultaneously. Existing work on pattern databases allows combining values from different pattern databases by taking their maximum. If the subgoals can be divided into disjoint subsets so that each operator only affects subgoals in one subset. then we can add the pattern-database values for each subset. resulting in a more accurate admissible heuristic function.

Here we partition the problem into disjoint subproblems for each state of the search dynamically. We discuss the pros and cons of each of these methods and apply both methods to three different problem domains: the sliding-tile puzzles. the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem. and finding an optimal vertex cover of a graph.

This algorithm offers mathematical guarantees for convergence to a point arbitrarily close to the global minimum for the large class of twice-differentiable NLPs. The key idea is the construction of a converging sequence of upper and lower bounds on the global minimum through the convex relaxation of the original problem. This relaxation is obtained by (i) replacing all nonconvex terms of special structure (i.e.. bilinear. trilinear. fractional. fractional trilinear. univariate concave) with customized tight convex lower bounding functions and (ii) by utilizing some α parameters as defined by Maranas and Floudas (1994b) to generate valid convex underestimators for nonconvex terms of generic structure.

Multipurpose batch processes,1998,MG Ierapetritou and CA Floudas,37,Industrial & engineering chemistry research,11,4341-4359,American Chemical Society,During the last decade. the problem of production scheduling has been realized to be one of the most important problems in industrial plant operations especially when multipurpose/multiproduct batch processes are involved. This paper presents a novel mathematical formulation for the short-term scheduling of batch plants. The proposed formulation is based on a continuous time representation and results in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem.

In this process. the granules are formed by spraying the liquid binder on the fluidized powder bed. The fluid flow field has been solved implementing CFD principles and the behavior of the solid particles has been modeled using DEM techniques whereas the change in particle size has been quantified with the help of PBM. The liquid binder droplets have been modeled implicitly in DEM. A detailed understanding of the process aids in the development of better design. optimization and control strategies. The model predicts the evolution of important process variables (ie. average particle diameter. particle size distribution (PSD) and particle liquid content) over time. which have qualitative similarity with experimentally observed trends. The advantage of incorporating the multi-scale approach is that the model can be used to study the distributions of collision frequencies. particle velocity and particle liquid content in different sections of the fluid bed granulator (FBG). in a more mechanistic manner.

We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus. the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure. we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems.

The algorithm is based on the decomposition of the initial problem into the restricted master problem (RMP) and a series of problems named slave problems (SP). The proposed approach is based on Benders decomposition method where in each iteration a set of variables are fixed which are controlled by the upper level optimization problem. The RMP is a relaxation of the MIBLP and the SP represents a restriction of the MIBLP. The RMP interacts in each iteration with the current SP by the addition of cuts produced using Lagrangian information from the current SP.

The latter case assumes an expected time of arrival for each vessel. which is a function of the departure time of the vessel from the previous port. the average operating speed and the distance between the two ports.

Better analysis of this activity gives rise to better use of a system's resources. as well as control of the entire supply chain. It is important that the crude oil is loaded and unloaded contiguously. primarily for security reasons (e.g. possibility of system failures) but also to reduce the setup costs incurred when flow between a dock and a tank or between a tank and a crude distillation unit is reinitialized. The aim of the present paper is to develop an exact solution approach. widely applicable to most refineries where several modes of blending and several recipe preparation alternatives are used.

The inventory/admission control policies considered are base stock. echelon base stock and partial backordering. and the objective is to maximize the mean profit rate of the system.

Although persisters form during normal growth from native stresses. the pathways responsible for this phenomenon remain elusive. Here we have discovered that carbon source transitions stimulate the formation of fluoroquinolone persisters in Escherichia coli. Further. through a combination of genetic. biochemical. and flow cytometric assays in conjunction with a mathematical model. we have reconstructed a molecular-level persister formation pathway from initial stress (glucose exhaustion) to the activation of a metabolic toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (the ppGpp biochemical network) resulting in inhibition of DNA gyrase activity. the primary target of fluoroquinolones.

Persister survival has been attributed to inhibition of essential cell functions during antibiotic stress. followed by reversal of the process and resumption of growth upon removal of the antibiotic. Metabolism plays a critical role in this process. since it participates in the entry. maintenance. and exit from the persister phenotype.

While persisters have been observed to be growth inhibited prior to antibiotic exposure. we sought to determine whether such a trait was essential to the phenotype. Furthermore. we sought to provide direct experimental evidence of the persister metabolic state so as to determine whether the common assumption of metabolic inactivity was valid. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). a fluorescent indicator of cell division. a fluorescent measure of metabolic activity. and persistence assays. we found that bacteria that are rapidly growing prior to antibiotic exposure can give rise to persisters and that a lack of replication or low metabolic activity prior to antibiotic treatment simply increases the likelihood that a cell is a persister.

Persisters have been hypothesized to underlie the recalcitrance of biofilm infections. and strategies to eliminate these cells have the potential to improve treatment outcomes for many hospital-treated infections. Here we investigate the role of stationary phase metabolism in generation of type I persisters in Escherichia coli. which are those that are formed by passage through stationary phase. We find that persisters are unlikely to derive from bacteria with low redox activity. and that inhibition of respiration during stationary phase reduces persister levels by up to∼ 1.000-fold. Loss of stationary phase respiratory activity prevents digestion of endogenous proteins and RNA. which yields bacteria that are more capable of translation. replication and concomitantly cell death when exposed to antibiotics.

These conjugates were characterized extensively by an array of chemical. chromatographic. and spectroscopic means. Multiple (approximately six) oligonucleotides can be conjugated to each ASGP molecule. The molecular conjugates were used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the mRNA of the interleukin 6 signal transduction protein (gp130) to modulate the acute phase response of hepatoma (HepG2) cells in vitro. These conjugates were biologically active. as measured by inhibition of the cytokine-stimulated up-regulation of the acute phase protein haptoglobin.

1278791,Children in family purchase decision making in India and the West: A review,2006,Pavleen Kaur and Raghbir Singh,2006,,,1,Academy of Marketing Science Review,Children constitute an important target market segment and merit attention from a marketing perspective. The role that children play in making decisions concerning the entire family unit has prompted researchers to direct attention to the study of influence of children. The amount of influence exerted by children varies by product category and stage of the decision making process. For some products. they are active initiators. information seekers. and buyers; whereas for other product categories. they influence purchases made by the parents. The purchasing act is governed by how they have been socialized to act as consumers. Family. peers. and media are key socializing agents for children wherein family-specific characteristics such as parental style. family’s Sex Role Orientation (SRO). and patterns of communication play key roles. More so. changes taking place in the socio-cultural environment in India (such as emergence of dualcareer. single parent families) entail that dimensions of children’s influence in family purchase decision making be investigated in a specific context. Indian society vastly differs from the West in terms of family composition and structure. values. norms. and behavior. which affect the role that children play in purchase decision making in families. Hence. the aim of this paper is not only to explore the dimensions already investigated by previous researchers in India and Western countries but also to identify directions for future research.,True,qRXl3WYAAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC,233,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.7977&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1168206718834154072,/scholar?cites=1168206718834154072,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.570.7977&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Longitudinal symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often characterized by heterogeneous trajectories. which may have unique pre-. peri-and post-trauma risk and protective factors. To date. however. no study has evaluated the nature and determinants of predominant trajectories of PTSD symptoms in World Trade Center (WTC) responders.Method. A total of 10835 WTC responders. including 4035 professional police responders and 6800 non-traditional responders (eg construction workers) who participated in the WTC Health Program (WTC-HP). were evaluated an average of 3. 6 and 8 years after the WTC attacks.Results. Among police responders. longitudinal PTSD symptoms were best characterized by four classes. with the majority (77.8%) in a resistant/resilient trajectory and the remainder exhibiting chronic (5.3%). recovering (8.4%) or delayed-onset (8.5%) symptom trajectories. Among non-traditional responders. a six-class solution was optimal. with fewer responders in a resistant/resilient trajectory (58.0%) and the remainder exhibiting recovering (12.3%). severe chronic (9.5%). subsyndromal increasing (7.3%). delayed-onset (6.7%) and moderate chronic (6.2%) trajectories. Prior psychiatric history. Hispanic ethnicity. severity of WTC exposure and WTC-related medical conditions were most strongly associated with symptomatic trajectories of PTSD symptoms in both groups of responders. whereas greater education and family and work support while working at the WTC site were protective against several of these trajectories.Conclusions.

In practice. to alleviate the computational complexity. the reactive flow models use a skeletal kinetic model instead of the detailed mechanism. However. the reduced chemistry models can accurately predict the detailed model only over a limited range of conditions. Since the reactive flow simulation encounters a broad range of conditions. using a single reduced model throughout the simulation incorporates inaccuracy into the predictive capacity of the flow model.

Inc.,The pluripotent property of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) makes them attractive for treatment of degenerative diseases such as diabetes. We have developed a stage-wise directed differentiation protocol to produce alginate-encapsulated islet-like cells derived from hESCs. which can be directly implanted for diabetes therapy. The advantage of alginate encapsulation lies in its capability to immunoisolate. along with the added possibility of scalable culture. We have evaluated the possibility of encapsulating hESCs at different stages of differentiation. Encapsulation of predifferentiated cells resulted in insufficient cellular yield and differentiation.

Upon generation of functionally mature ESC derived islet-like cells. they need to be implanted into diabetic patients to restore the loss of islet activity. Encapsulation in alginate microcapsules is a promising route of implantation. which can protect the cells from the recipient’s immune system. While there has been a significant investigation into islet encapsulation over the past decade. the feasibility of encapsulation and differentiation of ESCs has been less explored. Research over the past few years has identified the cellular mechanical microenvironment to play a central role in phenotype commitment of stem cells. Therefore it will be important to design the encapsulation material to be supportive to cellular functionality and maturation. This work investigated the effect of stiffness of alginate substrate on initial differentiation and phenotype commitment of murine ESCs. ESCs grown on alginate substrates tuned to similar biomechanical properties of native pancreatic tissue elicited both an enhanced and incrementally responsive differentiation towards endodermal lineage traits.

The VRR is deduced quantitatively using the Fourier series of the feed rate variability and the residence time distribution (RTD). which facilitate the explicit decomposition of VRR into intensities of different frequency components. It provides a novel model to determine whether the integrated feeder‐mixer system satisfies specific solid mixing performance criteria. and provides guidelines of system improvement. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J. 2011,True,0mP1RkIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,41,https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aic.12348,9996379300840904671,/scholar?cites=9996379300840904671,,,,0,0,0
1278809,Optimizing continuous powder mixing processes using periodic section modeling,2012,Yijie Gao and Fernando J Muzzio and Marianthi G Ierapetritou,80,Chemical engineering science,,70-80,Pergamon,While continuous powder mixing has been an area of active research in recent years. effects of operating conditions on the mixing performance has not been well understood yet. Based on our previously developed periodic section modeling (Gao et al.. 2012). this paper examines the effects of operating conditions on two significant parameters of the continuous blending processes: axial velocity and local mixing rate of the mixture. Four mixing cases differing in particle size. density and cohesiveness are simulated. Results show that when the local mixing rate improves at low fill levels and high blade speed. particles also move faster in the axial direction and reside for a shorter time inside the mixer. This trade-off between ascending local mixing rate and descending residence time indicates a non-optimal overall blending performance even when the best operating condition is applied. Based on these results …,True,0mP1RkIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250912003181,14262697015196513616,/scholar?cites=14262697015196513616,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.261.1949&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,This study aims to develop a general model of the convective continuous mixing process. The main idea is that continuous mixing can be considered as a combination of powder flow and mixing processes. Although powder flow is characterized by the residence time distribution (RTD). powder mixing can be described by a batch mixing process simulated in one periodic section of the continuous mixer. By characterizing the two processes separately. we can calculate the number of sections required to achieve certain homogeneity. In this study. continuous mixing is simulated using the discrete element method. and segregating and non‐segregating mixing cases are tested to investigate the applicability of the model. Results show satisfactory predictions by the model. which is able to characterize the continuous mixing performance of both mixing cases.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Previous experimental and computational work has demonstrated that the geometry of the impeller has a significant effect on the mixing performance of continuous powder mixers. In particular. different blade patterns using either all blades pushing the powder forward (‘forward pattern’) are less effective than patterns where some of the blades push the powder backwards (‘alternate pattern’).

Fluorescence quenching and excitation spectra indicate that the singlet energy transfer is efficient for the dyad triplet photosensitizers. Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy has confirmed that the triplet excited states of the dyads are distributed on both the energy donor and acceptor. which is the result of forward singlet energy transfer from the energy donor to the energy acceptor and in turn the backward triplet energy transfer.

This can be difficult when the process models include black‐box constraints or the simulation is computationally expensive.

A full factorial design of experiments was conducted on three process parameters: water amount. impeller speed and wet massing time. Statistical analysis showed that the water amount has the largest impact on the granule characteristics. and that the effect of other process variables was more pronounced at higher water amount. At high water amounts. an increase in impeller speed and/or wet massing time showed a decrease in granule porosity and compactability.

Compared to analytical and mathematical programming techniques. they offer the capability to include a greater deal of fidelity. Different kinds of simulation models have been widely used to study various aspects of supply chain management. These models provide a very convenient approach to generate various"" what-if"" scenarios and find the optimal values of the discrete variables. However stand-alone simulation models cannot be used to optimize the continuous variables. It is necessary to couple the simulation model with an optimization approach in order to find the optimal values of the continuous variables. During the recent years. supply chains have evolved into global. highly complex networks and the overall supply chain operations are a result of numerous autonomous. adaptive and intelligent entities. A high fidelity simulation model is not only difficult to develop but also difficult to use in an optimization framework due to computational complexity involved in each function evaluation. In order to optimize the variables in these simulation models. deterministic optimization solvers cannot be used as the derivatives are unavailable. Also. since the simulations take long times to run. it is not possible to perform a large number of simulation runs in order to approximate the derivatives.

Designers can support companies in exploring customers' needs and the appropriate signs (such as form. colours. materials. etc) that give meaning to products. Managing collaborations with designers is therefore a critical issue for companies that operate in design-intensive industries. This paper analyses how a company may develop a proper collaborative strategy by identifying an effective portfolio of designers. It shows that companies that innovate collaborate with a broad range of external designers.

More specifically. it focuses on the interplay between the functional and semantic dimensions of a product. Case studies of two leading Italian companies in the furniture industry—Kartell and Luceplan—illustrate two principal interpretations of the role of technology in radical design-driven innovation: technology as an enabler of new product meanings for the customer. and the importance of supply networks that allow manufacturers to change product technologies quickly and experiment with new technologies.,True,Qm6WamUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,149,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2010.11657617,2953709642097355238,/scholar?cites=2953709642097355238,,,https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/573297/1/DellEra%20et%20al.%20%282010%29_RTM_Mastering%20Technologies%20in%20Design-Driven%20Innovation%5BRe.Public%5D.pdf,0,0,0

Data analysis showed some important results. First of all environmental turbulence should be considered to be project specific rather than company or industry specific.

As a consequence. almost every country in the world has chosen to invest significantly in this area. This choice. however. is only a first step in the investment decision process. given that almost any scientific discipline can be taken at the scale of a nanometre. In this paper. it is argued that foresight studies to decide where to invest in the nanotechnology area should be designed in a different way from what is normally done.

Because of the lack of data. evidence regarding the performance of science parks in a nation is very limited and there is a lack of comparisons between different systems. This paper aims to introduce a simple framework to analyse SPSs and to show its use for comparing the state of development and the main differences of two or more SPSs. Its application to the Italian and Spanish systems shows that science parks play a more important role in Spain than in Italy. The main causes of these differences are argued to be (i) the presence of a set of coherent and particular policies which favour science parks in Spain and (ii) the internal factors of the Spanish science park system. including business models of the science parks and the role of the …,True,nBt3qaQAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,65,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09537325.2013.785508,2354498520615819282,/scholar?cites=2354498520615819282,,,,0,0,0

1278918,Forecasting demand from heterogeneous customers,2006,Matteo Kalchschmidt and Roberto Verganti and Giulio Zotteri,,International Journal of operations & Production management,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,In many industrial contexts. firms are encountering increasingly uncertain demand. Numerous factors are driving this phenomenon; however. a major change that is spreading among different sectors is the ever‐growing attention to customers. Companies have identified that customers are critical not only because they directly influence the success of specific products or firms. but also because they play a fundamental role in many internal processes. Although the role of customers in business processes has been deeply analysed. the issue of demand forecasting and the role of customers has not been fully explored. The present study aims to examine the impact of heterogeneity of customer requests on demand forecasting approaches. based on three action research cases. Based on the analysis of customer behaviour. an appropriate methodology for each case is designed based on clustering …,True,QIQYnQ0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,72,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/01443570610666975/full/html,4322331971038011,/scholar?cites=4322331971038011,,,,0,0,0
1278919,Factors influencing co‐design adoption: drivers and internal consistency,2002,Gianluca Spina and Roberto Verganti and Giulio Zotteri,,International Journal of Operations & Production Management,,,MCB UP Ltd,As customers ask for increasing levels of performance. functionality and customisation. firms rely on suppliers not only as a source of components. but also as a source of innovation. Several researchers have investigated the adoption of co‐design. its potential benefits and its costs. Recently. scholars have increasingly underlined the need for bringing this rich stream of studies within a contingency framework. taking into account context variables and internal characteristics of the firm. This paper contributes to this contingency theory of co‐design adoption. We investigate the role of three factors that might influence the intensity of supplier involvement in product development: structural characteristics (industry. size and degree of vertical integration). strategic priorities (strategic fit) and internal consistency with purchasing and new product development practices.

1278920,A model for selecting the appropriate level of aggregation in forecasting processes,2007,Giulio Zotteri and Matteo Kalchschmidt,108,International Journal of Production Economics,1-2,74-83,Elsevier,Demand forecasting is a major issue in several industrial sectors. A relevant choice for companies is the proper level of forecast aggregation. Forecasters need to properly identify what is the object of the forecasting process. in terms of time bucket (e.g.. forecasts are produced on a daily level or on weekly one). set of items the demand refers to (e.g.. single item or group of items). set of locations the demand refers to (e.g.. single store or chain of stores). Managers can follow two basic approaches: on the one hand they can adopt a detailed forecasting approach. i.e.. they can forecast demand for the item at the store by simply looking at the demand for the specific item/store; on the other hand they can adopt an aggregated forecasting approach.In this paper. we aim at figuring out what is the balance between the strengths and weaknesses of these two options. and to identify the contingent variables that might lead …,True,QIQYnQ0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,64,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527306003057,12993333884303511397,/scholar?cites=12993333884303511397,,,,0,0,0
1278921,An empirical investigation on causes and effects of the Bullwhip-effect: Evidence from the personal care sector,2013,Giulio Zotteri,143,International Journal of Production Economics,2,489-498,Elsevier,This paper analyses the empirical demand data for fast moving consumer goods to measure the Bullwhip-effect. The data consist of the sell-in from a large manufacturer to the retailers and the sell-out from a retailer to the consumers. Our findings show that the Bullwhip-effect can be substantial. Indeed. in more than 50% of the cases. the demand upstream (sell-in) is twice as variable as the demand downstream (sell-out). However. in other cases it can be negligible (and in one case. the demand upstream is slightly less variable than the demand downstream). So. while the Bullwhip-effect can be very large. it need not be so. Finally. we attempted to delve into the dynamics that generate a significant Bullwhip-effect and discovered that among the various causes that create the Bullwhip-effect discussed by Lee et al. (1997a). price fluctuations and forward buys driven by sales targets play a decisive role. We show that …,True,QIQYnQ0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,63,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527312002344,17293119463167976137,/scholar?cites=17293119463167976137,,,,0,0,0

In the past several papers have investigated forecasting practices. This research uses data from the GMRG survey to achieve three main objectives. First of all. we aim to describe current practices in the machinery and textile sectors; in particular we investigate: (i) aims and usage of the demand forecast for decision making; (ii) structure of the forecasting process; (iii) algorithms and tools adopted; (iv) both upstream and downstream cooperative forecasting and (v) performance. On a second perspective we investigate contingent variables such as structure (company size and sector). strategy (improvement priorities) and demand characteristics (e.g. number of products) and their relationship with forecasting practices.

1278923,Measuring the impact of asymmetric demand distributions on inventories,1999,Emilio Bartezzaghi and Roberto Verganti and Giulio Zotteri,60,International Journal of Production Economics,,395-404,Elsevier,Most studies on inventory management under demand uncertainty analyse the detrimental impacts of demand variability (i.e.. its coefficient of variation). Consequences of the shape of demand distribution (i.e.. its multi-modality and asymmetry) have instead received only minor attention. This paper focuses on the study of the effects of the shape of demand distribution on inventories. Results from a simulation show that demand shape plays a key role in the determination of the stock investments. In particular. this paper measures asymmetry of demand distributions and shows its significant impact on inventories. Moreover. it is demonstrated how multi-modality and asymmetry can both have a negative or a positive impact. depending on the type of asymmetry and the target service level the firm is facing.,True,QIQYnQ0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,56,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527398001935,9238329362487684831,/scholar?cites=9238329362487684831,,,,0,0,0

Aims to assess the dynamic impacts on performance of various practices that are generally regarded as typical of a customer‐supplier partnership. Also. investigates internal consistency of various practices and possible path dependencies. Shows. in the case of single sourcing. the complementarity and the synergistic effects of co‐design. sharing production plans. dedicating up‐stream capacity and assuring down‐stream demand. Finds the key role of a complete performance control system to monitor delivery. quality and cost performance. even when tight control over suppliers might be regarded as less crucial due to trust and long‐termism.

As innovative processes for products become more frequent and strategically relevant. long-term competitiveness compels firms to exploit synergy and learning among projects. In fact. mastering the overall process of knowledge creation. dissemination and application is the basis for creating and continuously improving a capability in product development. Learning through sequences of unique innovations. however. is neither simple nor natural. but requires adequate enabling mechanisms. This paper proposes an interpretative model of learning in product innovation. The objective is to identify the barriers that inhibit learning and the main enabling mechanisms to overcome them.

1278926,The evolution of production models: is a new paradigm emerging?,1999,Emilio Bartezzaghi,,International Journal of Operations & Production Management,,,MCB UP Ltd, The evolution of production models raises a number of questions on the changes which are taking place. on the continuity of or break with consolidated models. and on whether new production paradigms are emerging. Traces back this broad and multi‐faceted debate to five theses which summarise the principal interpretative approaches: the emergence of lean production as the dominant model; the indeterminacy of production models and the unpredictability of their evolution; the existence of a number of different models which are strongly dependent on context; the asymptotic convergence over time of different models on a single point of reference which is not lean production. while the latter will decline or be revised; and the emergence of a new unifying paradigm which leaves room for and even requires specific variations and adaptations.

This study analyses the behaviour of forecasting techniques when dealing with lumpy demand at the master production scheduling level. In particular. three forecasting techniques (exponentially weighted moving average. early sales and order overplanning) are considered. It is argued that demand lumpiness is a multidimensional phenomenon. generated by different market characteristics. namely. numerousness of customers. heterogeneity of customers. frequency of order placing. variety of each customer's request and correlation between customers behaviour. Hence. the performances of the three forecasting methods are compared. through simulation experiments. with different values of the sources of lumpiness.

When applied to a context characterized by irregular and sporadic demand these techniques show poor performances. In fact. in such a case uncertainty management calls for the gathering of information that directly anticipates future requirements. Although contexts with irregular and sporadic demand have received only minor attention in the past. they are currently gaining ever more importance and extending their occurrence. This paper illustrates and discusses a method. called order overplanning. specifically designed to cope with uncertainty in these environments. It consists of an articulate and coherent set of forecasting procedures. planning principles and slack control techniques.
