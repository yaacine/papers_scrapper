Now in its fifth edition. the book has been comprehensively rewritten and updated whilst maintaining the clarity of its predecessors. Two new chapters discuss' in vivo'and'dietary'antioxidants. the first emphasising the role of peroxiredoxins and integrated defence mechanisms which allow useful roles for ROS. and the second containing new information on the role of fruits. vegetables. and vitamins in health and disease. This new edition also contains expanded coverage of the mechanisms of oxidative damage to lipids. DNA. and proteins (and the repair of such damage). and the roles played by reactive species in signal transduction. cell survival. death. human reproduction. defence mechanisms of animals and plants against pathogens. and other important biological events. The methodologies available to measure reactive species and oxidative damage (and their potential pitfalls) have been fully updated. as have the topics of phagocyte ROS production. NADPH oxidase enzymes. and toxicology. There is a detailed and critical evaluation of the role of free radicals and other reactive species in human diseases. especially cancer. cardiovascular. chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. New aspects of ageing are discussed in the context of the free radical theory of ageing.

VEGF has also been implicated in pathological angiogenesis associated with tumors. intraocular neovascular disorders and other conditions. The biological effects of VEGF are mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. which differ considerably in signaling properties. Non-signaling co-receptors also modulate VEGF RTK signaling. Currently. several VEGF inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing in several malignancies. VEGF inhibition is also being tested as a strategy for the prevention of angiogenesis. vascular leakage and visual loss in age-related macular degeneration.,True,GsfvB24AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,10344,https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0603-669,4392851991479254103,/scholar?cites=4392851991479254103,,http://sites.unifoa.edu.br/portal/plano_aula/arquivos/04054/Angiogenese%20-%20Biologia%20do%20VEGF.pdf,0,0,0

10087929,Elements of physical biology,1925,Alfred James Lotka,,,,,Williams & Wilkins,The preface is that part of a book which is written last. placed first. and read least. As I approach my concluding task I am moved to reflect why a preface should be written at all. This question. if followed into all the intricacies of which it holds potentiality. should apparently result in a composition new in literature. a Preface to the Preface. Such precedent should not be lightly established. for it suggests a vista of future degenerations after the pattern of Josiah Royce's infinite succession of maps. each containing within itself its own replica on a reduced scale. But without going to such lengths as this. the philosophy of the preface may perhaps briefly be summarized to this effect. that it is the author's subjective introduction to the more objective matter that should follow. Here he may. if this is deemed of any interest. say something regarding the circumstances that gave origin to the work. and the conditions under which it came into being. He may express his feelings as to its alleged purpose. and may follow custom by giving voice to pious wishes as to the function which the product of his presumptive mind may fulfill in an Universe in which no event. however trivial-be it no more than the addition of one more book to the groaning library shelves-is without distant reverberations.As to origin. the first plan of the work was laid about 1902. in the author's student days in Leipzig. The development of the topic is recorded. in outline. in various publications. of which the first appeared in 1907 in the American Journal of Science.

Circular Statistics in Biology seeks to provide a comprehensible guide to this field for the biologist and scientist who have a large amount of circular data to deal with but a limited knowledge of mathematical and statistical theory. The emphasis is on interpretation and analysis rather than unnecessary theory and many illustrative examples are provided. The book is divided into two parts. The first part contains descriptive and inferential tools of circular statistics.

10087931,The Oceans: Their physics. chemistry. and general biology,1942,Harald Ulrik Sverdrup and Martin Wiggo Johnson and Richard Howell Fleming,1087,,,,Prentice-Hall,Four years ago when we started the preparation of this book. we hoped to give a survey of well-established oceanographic knowledge. but it soon became apparent that the book could not be brought up to date without summarizing and synthesizing the wealth of information that has been acquired within the past dozen years. as well as the many new ideas that have been advanced. Consequently. the book has grown far beyond its originally planned scope. and the presentation has become colored by the personal concepts of the authors. Discussion of many topics. such as the absorption of radiation in the sea. the relations of organisms to the chemical composition of sea water. or the productivity of the sea. has led to tentative conclusions that are perhaps presented here as better substantiated than is actually the case. At the risk of premature generalizations we have. however. preferred definite statements to mere enumeration o uncorrelated observations and conflicting interpretations. believing that the treatment selected would be more stimulating.The book is intended to provide a good deal of factual information. but above all it should be an aid to the beginner and specialist alike in the coordination of the various fields of oceanography. The lists of literature at the ends of chapters are not intended to be exhaustive. but will serve as guides to recent publications.

They are known principally for their pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. but their ability to influence cell polarity. microtubule dynamics. membrane transport pathways and transcription factor activity is probably just as significant. Underlying this biological complexity is a simple biochemical idea. namely that by switching on a single GTPase. several distinct signalling pathways can be coordinately activated.

There has been a compara-ble leap in the elucidation of protein structures as well. Thus. in the last few years. the structures of the huge molecular machines that drive the basic processes discussed in this book—DNA transcription. replication. protein synthesis. and so forth—have largely been solved at the atomic level. and many details of their inner workings revealed. The new edition of Molecular Biology of the Gene reflects these advances. and many others besides. But when we sat down to plan this latest version. we were all of a mind that much of the organiza-tion and scope of the original book should be retained. This was not a matter of convenience-inevitably. in light of the dramatic changes that had taken place since the last edition. the vast bulk of the text had to be completely rewritten anyway. and all the art rendered afresh. No. the reasoning was simply that. more than ever in this genomic era. there seemed a need for a book that explained what genes are and how they work. and this was exactly what Molecular Biology of the Gene had originally been designed to do.

They are also produced when an organism is exposed to ionizing radiation. to drugs capable of redox cycling. or to xenobiotics that can form free radical metabolites in situ.

10087946,The biology of moral systems,1987,Richard D Alexander,,,,,Transaction Publishers,Thoughtful people seem increasingly to agree that our society—indeed. world society as a whole—has entered into a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. and with potential consequences almost too horrible and irreversible to contemplate. This deepening crisis arises from the interaction of several contributing factors. First. is an accelerating technological alteration of the environment and. concomitantly. of our social structures and ourselves. Second. is an accelerating depletion of the world's resources. and an accompanying interest among the more powerful nations in manipulating and competing over those less powerful who possess the scarce resources they need. Third. is an elaboration and proliferation of weapons now so terrible as to assure. for the first time in history. that almost no imaginable alternative is worse than their employment. Finally. coincident with the rise of weaponry. there has been an effective shrinking of the social brain that controls it. No matter how many millions of citizens may exist in a given nation-state. no matter how hideous its weaponry. the decision regarding use of that weaponry eventually comes down to about the same small number of individuals. or even to the calculations of a single brain. At least as a final step. it takes only one finger to push a button that could bring on what might aptly be termed the ultimate holocaust.

10087954,Basic methods in molecular biology,2012,Leonard Davis,,,,,Elsevier,Basic Methods in Molecular Biology discusses the heart of the most recent revolution in biology—the development of the technology of genetics. The achievements in this field have simply changed what biologists do and. perhaps even more important. the way they think. Moreover. never before have scientists from such a broad range of disciplines rushed into such a small and slightly arcane field to learn and carry off a bit of the technology. This book comprises 21 chapters. opening with three introductory ones that discuss the basics of molecular biology; the tools of the molecular biologist; and general preparations. procedures. and considerations for use of the book. The following chapters then discuss cloning vectors and bacterial cells; preparation of DNA from eukaryotic cells; probing nucleic acids; plasmid DNA preparation; DNA restriction fragment preparation; purification of DNA; and preparation and analysis of RNA from eukaryotic cells. Other chapters cover preparation of DNA from bacteriophage clones; cloning DNA from the eukaryotic genome; subcloning into plasmids; M13 cloning and sequencing; further characterization of cloned DNA; transfection of mammalian cells in culture; protein methods; general methods; and specialized methods.

10087955,The biology of the honey bee,1991,Mark L Winston,,,,,harvard university press,From ancient cave paintings of honey bee nests to modern science's richly diversified investigation of honey bee biology and its applications. the human imagination has long been captivated by the mysterious and highly sophisticated behavior of this paragon among insect societies. In the first broad treatment of honey bee biology to appear in decades. Mark Winston provides rare access to the world of this extraordinary insect. In a bright and engaging style. Winston probes the dynamics of the honey bee's social organization. He recreates for us the complex infrastructure of the nest. describes the highly specialized behavior of workers. queens. and drones. and examines in detail the remarkable ability of the honey bee colony to regulate its functions according to events within and outside the nest. Winston integrates into his discussion the results of recent studies. bringing into sharp focus topics of current bee research. These include the exquisite architecture of the nest and its relation to bee physiology; the intricate division of labor and the relevance of a temporal caste structure to efficient functioning of the colony; and. finally. the life-death struggles of swarming. supersedure. and mating that mark the reproductive cycle of the honey bee. The Biology of the Honey Bee not only reviews the basic aspects of social behavior. ecology. anatomy. physiology. and genetics. it also summarizes major controversies in contemporary honey bee research. such as the importance of kin recognition in the evolution of social behavior and the role of the well-known dance language in honey bee communication.

The metapopulation concept has now been firmly established in population biology. Two key premises in this approach to population biology are that populations are spatially structured into assemblages of local breeding populations. and that migration among the local populations has some effect on local dynamics. including the possibility of population reestablishment following extinction. These premises contrast with those of standard models of demography. population growth. genetics. and community interaction that assume a panmictic population structure. with all individuals equally likely to interact with any others. The focus on metapopulations. combined with that on genetics. has led to the population and the species becoming the dominant levels of concern in conservation.

Plants possess defences that are effective against almost all herbivorous insect species. Host-plant specialization. observed in over 80 percent of these animals. appears to be an effective adaptation to breach these defence systems. The mechanisms underlying plant defence to invading herbivores on the one side. and insect adaptations to utilize plants for nutrition. defence and shelter on the other. are the main subjects of this book. For plants exposed to insect herbivores. these mechanisms include the activation of defence systems and the emission of chemical signals which may attract natural enemies of the invading herbivores and may even be exploited by neighbouring plants to induce an early defence.,True,GsfvB24AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,3102,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zcQRDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:XehmxTMkMBcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=w9alUJpBS-&sig=Z2qh6WvhRD13Vmn0GmM3LZ22XGw,1670875266528241757,/scholar?cites=1670875266528241757,,,0,0,0

Their growth and differentiation into antibody producing cells require the presence of T cells and macrophages; the function of these cells was found to be replaced by soluble factors. 3 In the early i980s it was shown that at least two different kinds of factors were required in the regulation of B cell response. one for growth of activated B cells. B-cell growth factor (BCGF). and the other for antibody induction in B cells. B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF). 6 Since then. a variety of factors regulating the B cell response have been reported in the human and murine systems.

10087975,Directions in conservation biology,1994,Graeme Caughley,,,,215-244,British Ecological Society,1. Conservation biology has two threads: the small-population paradigm which deals with the effect of smallness on the persistence of a population. and the declining-population paradigm which deals with the cause of smallness and its cure. 2. The processes relevant to the small-population paradigm are amenable to theoretical examination because they generalize across species and are subsumed by an inclusive higher category: stochasticity. 3. In contrast. the processes relevant to the declining-population paradigm are essentially humdrum. being not one but many.

Only a decade ago information about cytokines was limited to the description of a multitude of ill-defined “factors” present in crude super-natants of cultures of mononuclear cells. Modern tech-niques of protein chemistry and molecular biology have led to the isolation and precise functional definition of many cytokines. including the interferons. colony-stimulating factors. and a heterogeneous group of agents termed interleukins. The name “interleukins” was originally conceived to designate proteins produced by lymphocytes or monocytes. affecting the growth and/or differentiation of lymphoid. monocytic or myeloid cells. With time it has become apparent that many interleu-kins are not produced exclusively by white blood cells. nor are their actions restricted to leukocytes.

DNA fragments are purified from agarose gels directly by ethanol precipitation and are then denatured and labeled with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I. using random oligonucleotides as primers. Over 70% of the precursor triphosphate is routinely incorporated into complementary DNA. and specific activities of over 109 dpm/μg of DNA can be obtained using relatively small amounts of precursor.

10088002,A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis,1990,Eric R Fearon and Bert Vogelstein,61,,5,759-767,Cell Press,Tumorigenesis has long been thought to be a multistep process (Foulds. 1958); however. only recently has it become possible to identify the molecular events that underlie the initiation and progression of human tumors (Weinberg. 1989; Bishop. 1987). Colorectal tumors provide an excellent system in which to search for and study the genetic alterations involved in the development of a common human neoplasm. Abundant clinical and histopathological data suggest that most. if not all. malignant colorectal tumors (carcinomas) arise from preexisting benign tumors (adenomas)(Sugarbaker et al.. 1985). Tumors of various stages of development. from very small adenomas to large metastatic carcinomas. can be obtained for study. unlike the situation in most other common human tumor types.

This multistep process is well illustrated by colorectal cancers. which typically develop over decades and appear to require at least seven genetic events for completion. Even so. inheritance of a single altered gene can result in a marked predisposition to colorectal cancer in two distinct syndromes. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). Recent evidence suggests that the genetic defect in FAP affects the rate of tumor initiation by targeting the gatekeeper function of the APC gene. In contrast. the defect in HNPCC largely affects tumor progression by targeting the genome guardian function of DNA mismatch repair.

Primary murine fibroblasts became deficient in a G1 checkpoint activated by ionizing radiation (IR) when both wild-type p53 alleles were disrupted. In addition. cells from patients with the radiosensitive. cancer-prone disease ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lacked the IR-induced increase in p53 protein levels seen in normal cells. Finally. IR induction of the human GADD45 gene. an induction that is also defective in AT cells. was dependent on wild-type p53 function. Wild-type but not mutant p53 bound strongly to a conserved element in the GADD45 gene. and a p53-containing nuclear factor. which bound this element. was detected in extracts from irradiated cells.

10088039,p53 function and dysfunction,1992,Bert Vogelstein and Kenneth W Kinzler,70,,4,523-526,Cell Press,The word “cancer” is used to describe a group of heterogeneous pathologic states in which cells multiply abnormally and invade surrounding tissues. There are hundreds of different kinds of cancers. at least one originating from nearly every cell type in the mammalian organism. One long-standing hope has been that the same biochemical pathway for controlling growth is disrupted in many different kinds of cancers. despite their biologic heterogeneity; this would provide acommon denominator for understanding. treating. and preventing these diseases. The pathway involving p53 fulfills this hope. as alterations of this tumor suppressor gene appear to be involved. directly or indirectly. in the majority of human malignancies. This has in turn stimulated an intense search for the biochemical functions of p53 and the effects of mutation on these properties.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,2520,https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/0092-8674(92)90421-8.pdf,3132668801378972198,/scholar?cites=3132668801378972198,,,0,0,0

We have now identified 18 human genomic clones that bind to p53 in vitro. Precise mapping of the binding sequences within these clones revealed a consensus binding site with a striking internal symmetry. consisting of two copies of the 10 base pair motif 5′-PuPuPuC (A/T)(T/A) GPyPyPy-3′ separated by 0-13 base pairs. One copy of the motif was insufficient for binding. and subtle alterations of the motif. even when present in multiple copies. resulted in loss of affinity for p53.

We show here that colorectal tumours without microsatellite instability exhibit a striking defect in chromosome segregation. resulting in gains or losses in excess of 10–2 per chromosome per generation.

Single molecules are isolated by dilution and individually amplified by PCR; each product is then analyzed separately for the presence of mutations by using fluorescent probes. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through the detection of a mutant ras oncogene in the stool of patients with colorectal cancer.

The G1 arrest is due to p53-mediated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1. but the basis for the G2 arrest is unknown. Through a quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in CRC cell lines. we have discovered that 14-3-3σ is strongly induced by γ irradiation and other DNA-damaging agents. The induction of 14-3-3σ is mediated by a p53-responsive element located 1.8 kb upstream of its transcription start site. Exogenous introduction of 14-3-3σ into cycling cells results in a G2 arrest.

These proteins also exhibit appreciable affinity for nonspecific DNA. and thus this apparently facilitated binding rate must be interpreted in terms of a two-step binding mechanism. The first step involves free diffusion to any nonspecific binding site on the DNA. and the second step comprises a series of protein translocation events that are also driven by thermal fluctuations.

One consequence of this inactivation is constitutive activation of β-catenin/Tcf-mediated transcription. To further explore the role of the APC/β-catenin/Tcf pathway in CR tumorigenesis. we searched for mutations in genes implicated in this pathway in CR tumors lacking APC mutations. No mutations of the γ-catenin (CTNNG1). GSK-3α (GSK3A). or GSK-3β (GSK3B) genes were detected. In contrast. mutations in the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of β-catenin (CTNNB1) were found in 13 of 27 (48%) CR tumors lacking APC mutations. Mutations in the β-catenin regulatory domain and APC were observed to be mutually exclusive. consistent with their equivalent effects on β-catenin stability and Tcf transactivation.

Such tumors have been thought to manifest replication errors (RER+). but the basis for the alterations has remained conjectural. We demonstrate that the mutation rate of (CA)n repeats in RER+ tumor cells is at least 100-fold that in RER− tumor cells and show by in vitro assay that increased mutability of RER+ cells is associated with a profound defect in strand-specific mismatch repair. This deficiency was observed with microsatellite heteroduplexes as well as with heteroduplexes containing single base-base mismatches and affected an early step in the repair pathway.

Injection of tumor cells engineered by gene transfection to secrete IL-2 stimulated an MHC class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the parental tumor. The tumor cells secreting IL-2 produced an antitumor response in vivo. even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Animals immunized with the engineered cells were protected against subsequent challenge with the parental tumor cell line. Similar findings were demonstrated for other tumor types. Thus. provision of a helper lymphokine in a paracrine fashion induced a tumor-specific immune response involving activation of endogenous CTLs and other immune effector cells.

Although massively parallel sequencing instruments are in principle well suited to this task. the error rates in such instruments are generally too high to allow confident identification of rare variants. We here describe an approach that can substantially increase the sensitivity of massively parallel sequencing instruments for this purpose. The keys to this approach. called the Safe-Sequencing System (“Safe-SeqS”). are (i) assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each template molecule. (ii) amplification of each uniquely tagged template molecule to create UID families. and (iii) redundant sequencing of the amplification products. PCR fragments with the same UID are considered mutant (“supermutants”) only if ≥95% of them contain the identical mutation.

We show that overexpression of the gene encoding wild-type p53 blocks the growth of osteosarcoma cells. The growth arrest was determined to be due to an inability of the transfected cells to progress into S phase.

Recent work has strengthened the proposal that mutational alterations conferring instability occur early during tumour formation. The ensuing genetic instability drives tumour progression by generating mutations in oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes.

To evaluate the consequences of PIK3CA alterations. the two most common mutations were inactivated by gene targeting in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Biochemical analyses of these cells showed that mutant PIK3CA selectively regulated the phosphorylation of AKT and the forkhead transcription factors FKHR and FKHRL1. PIK3CA mutations had little effect on growth under standard conditions. but reduced cellular dependence on growth factors. PIK3CA mutations resulted in attenuation of apoptosis and facilitated tumor invasion. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated PIK3CA signaling and preferentially inhibited growth of PIK3CA mutant cells.

Studies in other organisms suggest that differences in gene expression levels account for a major part of the variation within and among species (1. 2). To address this in humans. we developed methods to quantitatively evaluate allelic variation in gene expression.The analysis of variation in gene expression is complicated by the potentially small differences associated with alterations in a single allele as well as by potential variations between individuals that arise from environmental or physiological rather than genetic factors. To circumvent these analytic problems. we compared the relative expression levels of two alleles of the same gene within the same cellular sample. To make these comparisons. we used a fluorescent dideoxy terminator–based method (3) to distinguish the mRNA products of alleles from normal individuals who were heterozygous for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the transcript of interest (fig. S1). We estimated that this approach could confidently identify variations when the differences between expression of the two alleles differed by more than 20%(3).,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,793,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hai_Yan3/publication/11203088_Allelic_Variation_in_Human_Gene_Expression/links/540fb6c50cf2df04e75a3739.pdf,7940278824827389740,/scholar?cites=7940278824827389740,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hai_Yan3/publication/11203088_Allelic_Variation_in_Human_Gene_Expression/links/540fb6c50cf2df04e75a3739.pdf,0,0,0

Cloning and sequencing of PCR-amplified segments of the abnormally spliced transcripts showed that exons were joined accurately at consensus splice sites. but in an order different from that present in the primary transcript. Four scrambled transcripts were identified. each involving a different pair of exons. The scrambled transcripts were found at relatively low levels in a variety of normal and neoplastic cells of rodent and human origin. primarily in the nonpolyadenylated component of cytoplasmic RNA.

In colon cancer. one of the earliest manifestation of this imbalance is the formation of polyps. caused by somatic and inherited mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene in both humans and mice. While the importance of APC in tumorigenesis is well documented. how it functions to prevent tumors remains a mystery. Using a novel inducible expression system. we show that expression of APC in human colorectal cancer cells containing endogenous inactive APC alleles results in a substantial diminution of cell growth. Further evaluation demonstrated that this was due to the induction of cell death through apoptosis.

The vast majority of these mutations result in the loss of the carboxyl terminus of the protein. To further elucidate the function of APC. we searched for cellular proteins that associate with its carboxyl terminus. One million human cDNA clones were screened with the use of the interaction trap two-hybrid system. and 67 clones were found to have a phenotype suggestive of an APC-interacting protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that 48 of these clones were derived from a single novel gene named EB1. The association of APC and EB1 proteins was confirmed with in vitro Binding assays. mAbs against EB1 were then produced and used to demonstrate the association of APC and EB1 in vivo.

Mutation of CIN genes increases the probability that whole chromosomes or large fractions of chromosomes are gained or lost during cell division. The consequence of CIN is an imbalance in the number of chromosomes per cell (aneuploidy) and an enhanced rate of loss of heterozygosity. A major question of cancer genetics is to what extent CIN. or any genetic instability. is an early event and consequently a driving force for tumor progression.

One of the binding sites was contained within a 63-base-pair repeat of the variable number of tandem repeat type. whereas the other two sites were represented once in the genome.

A significant number of these mutations occur in or around amino acids 143. 175. 273. or 281. Experiments presented here demonstrate for the first time that p53 DNA clones containing any one of these mutations cooperate with the activated ras oncogene to transform primary rat embryo cells in culture. These transformed cells produce elevated levels of the human p53 protein. which has extended half-lives (1.5-7 h). as compared to the wild-type human p53 protein (20-30 min). The p53 mutant with an alteration at residue 175 (p53-175H) binds tightly to the cellular heat shock protein. hsc70. In contrast. the p53 mutants possessing mutations at either residue 273 or 281 (p53-273H/281G) do not bind detectably to this heat shock protein and generally are less efficient at forming transformed foci in culture. The transformed cell lines are tumorigenic in nude mice. Thus. two classes of p53 mutant proteins can be distinguished: p53-175H. which cooperates with ras efficiently and binds to hsc70. and p53-273H/281G. which has a reduced efficiency of transformed foci formation and does not bind hsc70. This demonstrates that complex formation between mutant p53 and hsc70 is not required for p53-mediated transformation. but rather it facilitates this function. perhaps by ensuring sequestration of the endogenous wild-type p53 protein. The positive effect on cell proliferation by these mutant p53 proteins is consistent with a role for activated p53 mutants in the genesis of colorectal carcinomas.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,516,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2288874,3144422927752130193,/scholar?cites=3144422927752130193,,,0,0,0

However. the mechanisms through which c-MYC achieves these effects have been unclear. Using serial analysis of gene expression. we have identified the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene as a transcriptional target of c-MYC. c-MYC induced a rapid increase in CDK4 mRNA levels through four highly conserved c-MYC binding sites within the CDK4 promoter. Cell-cycle progression is delayed in c-MYC-deficient RAT1 cells. and this delay was associated with a defect in CDK4 induction. Ectopic expression of CDK4 in these cells partially alleviated the growth defect. Thus.

We find that dual therapy results in long-term disease control for most patients. if there are no single mutations that cause cross-resistance to both drugs; in patients with large disease burden. triple therapy is needed.

We have assessed the ability of CD4 to synergize with the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) for induction of transmembrane signals that result in lymphokine production. Mutant CD4 molecules were introduced into T cells that lacked endogenous CD4 but expressed TCRs specific for lysozyme peptides or the superantigen SEA bound to Ab or Abm12 class II MHC molecules. With either ligand. T cell activation occurred only when CD4 was associated with p56lck.

Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual cancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different cancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sjöblom et al. (2006) to develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters of this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the expected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the relative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the average selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective advantages during tumorigenesis.

Cells from these tumours have been found to contain either the paternal or maternal copies of loci on the affected chromosome. but not both. Thus. the somatic loss of heterozygosity for sequences on chromosome 13 or 11 is hypothesized to result in homozygosity for a recessive mutant allele on these chromosomes 1. and in this way the chromosomal loss may contribute to the development of these tumours.

Using nuclease digestion. one can progressively cleave DNA from the loops. thereby isolating residual DNA that is progressively closer to the nuclear matrix anchorage sites. We have determined that the ovalbumin gene is preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix of chicken oviduct cells. but is not preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix of chicken liver cells. As a control. the β-globin gene. which is not transcribed in oviduct cells. was found not to be preferentially associated with the oviduct nuclear matrix. The observation that the transcriptionally active ovalbumin gene is preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix may have significant implications for gene expression and the organization of nuclear DNA into supercoiled-loop domains.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,367,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867482903798,467058393884065400,/scholar?cites=467058393884065400,,,0,0,0

M. et al. Nature 416. 648–653 (2002) Ubiquitination of p53 is the principal mechanism through which p53 concentrations in the cell are regulated 1. 2 in order to maintain its effects on tumori-genesis and normal cell growth. The protein HAUSP (also known as USP7) is a ubiquitin-specific protease (deubiquitinase) 3. 4 that has been shown by Li et al. to bind to p53 (ref. 5); in overexpression experiments. Li et al. showed that p53 could be stabilized as a result of deubiquitination by HAUSP and suggested that HAUSP may thereby act as a tumour suppressor 5. 6. Here we use a different approach to investigate the relationship between HAUSP and p53 stability. in which we disrupt the HAUSP gene in human cells by targeted homologous recombination. Instead of the expected increase in ubiquitinated p53 and destabilization of p53. we find that disruption of HAUSP results in the opposite phenotype …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC,365,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02501,2228578977957945819,/scholar?cites=2228578977957945819,,https://www.academia.edu/download/64397290/nature0250120200909-20252-gqj5ib.pdf,0,0,0

To gain insights into this fundamental issue. we formulated a mathematical model for the evolution of somatic mutations in which all relevant phases of a tissue’s history are considered. The model makes the prediction. validated by our empirical findings. that the number of somatic mutations in tumors of self-renewing tissues is positively correlated with the age of the patient at diagnosis. Importantly. our analysis indicates that half or more of the somatic mutations in certain tumors of self-renewing tissues occur before the onset of neoplasia.

10088237,Somatic mutations of EGFR in colorectal cancers and glioblastomas,2004,Thomas D Barber and Bert Vogelstein and Kenneth W Kinzler and Victor E Velculescu,351,N Engl J Med,27,2883,,to the editor: Recent reports suggest that mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene predict sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors. In particular. patients with lung cancers containing mutations in the EGFR kinase domain have had responses to gefitinib. 1. 2 Are similar EGFRmutations present in a significant fraction of other tumor types for which gefitinib might be suitable therapy? To answer this question. we screened DNA from 293 colorectal tumors and 59 glioblastomas for alterations in the EGFR kinase domain (exons 17 to 24). These tumors were chosen for analysis because they have been linked to EGFR signaling: EGFR-targeted antibodies (cetuximab) have been approved for use in patients with colorectal cancer. and structural alterations of the EGFR gene (amplifications and rearrangements) have been described in glioblastomas. 3 However. our analysis showed that only one of the colorectal cancers and none of the glioblastomas harbored a mutation. The single mutation was a G-to-S substitution at amino acid 719. which is identical to an activating mutation previously reported in lung tumors. 2 Our results show EGFRmu-tations occur at a very low frequency in colorectal cancers and glioblastomas and suggest that gefitinib is unlikely to be effective in patients with these tumors. Furthermore. these data suggest that mutations in the EGFR kinase domain are unlikely to be responsible for the reported success of cetuximab against many colorectal cancers. 4. 5 Thomas D. Barber.

Scleroderma is an autoimmune connective tissue disease in which patients make antibodies to a limited group of autoantigens. including RPC1. encoded by the POLR3A gene. As patients with scleroderma and antibodies against RPC1 are at increased risk for cancer. we hypothesized that the “foreign” antigens in this autoimmune disease are encoded by somatically mutated genes in the patients’ incipient cancers. Studying cancers from scleroderma patients. we found genetic alterations of the POLR3A locus in six of eight patients with antibodies to RPC1 but not in eight patients without antibodies to RPC1.

To test this hypothesis mutations of hprt were studied in RER and non-RER tumor cell lines. Increased mutation rates of greater than 100-fold were found in RER compared to non-RER lines. Heterogeneity within the RER group suggests the likely existence of different classes of RER tumors. One non-RER cell line demonstrated a greater than 10-fold increase in mutation rate. suggesting that a novel mutator phenotype may exist in some non-RER tumors.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,278,https://europepmc.org/article/med/7824277,15482134222988392640,/scholar?cites=15482134222988392640,,,0,0,0

Mutation of the APC gene is also an early. if not initiating. event for sporadic colorectal tumorigenesis. In both cases. almost all of the currently identified mutations of APC result in the truncation of the protein. In this study. we demonstrate that truncated APC proteins can associate with the wild type APC in vivo. Using in vitro expression and immunoprecipitation. we show that the first 171 residues of APC are sufficient for APC oligomerization and that the first 45 amino acids of APC is necessary for this interaction. These results indicate that most mutant APC proteins should be able to bind to wild type APC protein and perhaps inactivate it in a dominant negative manner.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C,278,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/53/12/2728.short,14883633626892303095,/scholar?cites=14883633626892303095,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/53/12/2728.full.pdf,0,0,0

To assess functionally the role of the p53 gene in the development of human breast cancer. we introduced either wild-type or mutant p53 cDNA into three human breast cancer cell lines by DNA transfection. The cell lines MDA-MB 468 and T47 D contain only single mutated copies of the p53 gene. whereas the status of p53 in the breast cancer cell line MCF 7 remains equivocal. Following transfection. MCF 7 cells continued to grow unaffected both in vitro and in vivo in the presence of high levels of expression of the exogenous wild-type p53 gene. In contrast. however. the continued expression of an exogenous wild-type p53 gene was incompatible with cellular growth in both the MDA-MB 468 and T47 D cell lines. Elevated levels of expression of the exogenous mutant p53 gene did not alter the growth of the cell lines in vitro. These data strongly suggest that the wild-type p53 gene can function as a suppressor of cellular growth in breast cancer cells. That the wild-type p53 gene does not suppress the growth of MCF 7 cells indicates that at least some human breast tumors can arise without functional inactivation of the p53 gene by mutation.

A novel gene. DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). located within the region of LOH on chromosome 18q was identified and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene.

HAUSP (also known as USP7) has been proposed to serve as a substrate-specific deubiquitinase of p53. and an increase in p53 levels was reported upon overexpression of HAUSP.  We have disrupted the HAUSP genomic locus by homologous recombination and shown that HAUSP ablation results in a phenotype opposite to that predicted.  Rather than decreasing p53 levels associated with increased p53 ubiquitination. the absence of HAUSP resulted in p53 accumulation accompanied by decreased p53 ubiquitination.  The p53 protein in HAUSP-deficient cells was active. as assessed by the induction of its transcriptional targets and growth arrest.   The basis for this phenotype was traced to the increased ubiquitination of MDM2. a negative regulator of p53 levels.

These genes encode proteins that function in growth regulatory and differentiation pathways. Mutations in those genes increase the net reproductive rate of cells. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a feature of most human cancers. Mutations in CIN genes increase the rate at which whole chromosomes or large parts of chromosomes are lost or gained during cell division. CIN causes an imbalance in chromosome number (aneuploidy) and an enhanced rate of loss of heterozygosity. which is an important mechanism of inactivating tumor suppressor genes.

The peptides expressed from normal and mutant alleles were detected by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) of their product ions using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. As a prototypical example of this approach. we demonstrated that it is possible to quantify the number and fraction of mutant Ras protein present in cancer cell lines. There were an average of 1.3 million molecules of Ras protein per cell. and the ratio of mutant to normal Ras …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC,162,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/6/2444.short,15250839640152534788,/scholar?cites=15250839640152534788,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/6/2444.full.pdf,0,0,0

Because cell cycle disruption appears crucial for tumorigenesis. we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression patterns of the prototype cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 and the proliferation marker Ki67 in the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis. In colorectal epithelium. p21 WAF1/CIP1 expression was undetectable in the lower third of the crypts. where Ki67 was expressed. but then sharply increased as cells passed out of the proliferating zone and migrated toward the humen. Hyperplastic polyps retained this normal compartmentalized pattern.

Here we describe a method that can quantify such variation at a scale and ease heretofore unattainable. Each DNA molecule in a collection of such molecules is converted into a single particle to which thousands of copies of DNA identical in sequence to the original are bound. This population of beads then corresponds to a one-to-one representation of the starting DNA molecules. Variation within the original population of DNA molecules can then be simply assessed by counting fluorescently-labeled particles via flow cytometry. Millions of individual DNA molecules can be assessed in this fashion with standard laboratory equipment. Moreover. specific variants can be isolated by flow sorting and employed for further experimentation.

To address the biochemical and physiologic effects of mutant β-catenin. we disrupted either the mutant or wild-type CTNNB1 allele in a human colorectal cancer cell line. Cells with only wild-type β-catenin had decreased colony-forming ability when plated at low density. although their growth was similar to that of parental cells when passaged under routine conditions. Immunohistochemistry and cell-fractionation studies suggested that mutant β-catenin activity was distinguished primarily by cellular localization and not by protein degradation.

Recently. a highly conserved gene called'deleted in colorectal cancer'(DCC) has been identified on chromosome 18q. DCC has been postulated to be a colorectal tumor-suppressor gene. In order to understand the role of DCC in cell transformation. we have established a stable Rat-1 cell line expressing dexamethasone-inducible DCC antisense RNA. High levels of dexamethasone-inducible DCC antisense RNA were detected in the Rat-1 transfectants. The antisense DCC-expressing Rat-1 cells showed a faster growth rate. anchorage independence and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Exposure of the parental Rat-1 cells to antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides to DCC resulted in inhibition of cell adhesion to the substratum which could be abrogated by various extracellular matrices. On the other hand. a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line which does not express DCC showed no detachment from the substratum when treated with the antisense oligo to DCC. These results suggest that the DCC gene is involved in cell adhesion and provide the first direct biological evidence for the possible role of DCC as a tumor-suppressor gene.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC,119,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1549369,10680125100133004509,/scholar?cites=10680125100133004509,,,0,0,0

Inference of a temporal ordering on the level of genes is challenging because clinically and histologically identical tumors often have few mutated genes in common. This heterogeneity may at least in part be due to mutations in different genes having similar phenotypic effects by acting in the same functional pathway. We estimate the constraints on the order in which alterations accumulate during cancer progression from cross-sectional mutation data using a probabilistic graphical model termed Hidden Conjunctive Bayesian Network (H-CBN). The possible orders are analyzed on the level of genes and. after mapping genes to functional pathways. also on the pathway level. We find stronger evidence for pathway order constraints than for gene order constraints. indicating that temporal ordering results from selective pressure acting at the pathway level. The accumulation of changes in core pathways differs among cancer types. yet a common feature is that progression appears to begin with mutations in genes that regulate apoptosis pathways and to conclude with mutations in genes involved in invasion pathways. H-CBN models provide a quantitative and intuitive model of tumorigenesis showing that the genetic events can be linked to the phenotypic progression on the level of pathways.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC,110,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027136,7165934346751436929,/scholar?cites=7165934346751436929,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027136,0,0,0

DEC1 was of particular note in light of the rapidity and consistency of its induction and its potential biochemical activities. We identified a consensus DNA-binding site for DEC1 and showed that DEC1 could repress the transcription of a reporter containing this binding site in its promoter. Finally. both alleles of the DEC1 locus in HaCaT cells were inactivated through targeted homologous recombination.

In colorectal cancer. two specific types of genetic instabilities have been identified: microsatellite instability (MIN) leads to a 1000-fold increase in the rate of subtle DNA changes. whereas chromosomal instability (CIN) enhances the rate at which gross chromosomal changes occur during cell division. In this paper. we develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of colon cancer initiation. We outline the processes and rate constants that determine the fraction of colon cancers where MIN or CIN mutations precede the inactivation of the first tumor suppressor gene. For a wide range of parameter values. we find support for the radical hypothesis that genetic instability initiates colonic tumorigenesis.

Two of these genes (MCC and APC) were found to be somatically altered by point mutation. deletion or insertion in tumors of sporadic colorectal cancer patients. One of them (adenomatous polyposis coli; APC) was also found to mutate in the germ-line of both APC and GS patients. The identification of these genes has significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia and for the diagnosis and counseling of individuals with inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer. Furthermore. in one colon carcinoma. we identified an interesting mechanism causing dysfunction of the APC gene.

As an insertional sequence contains a 3'portion of the L1 consensus sequence including the poly (A) tract and an 8 bp target-site duplication was observed. this insertion is suspected to be caused by a retrotranscriptional insertion of one of the L1 sequences.

Class I mutants do not bind to this antibody unless the proteins are first denatured.

Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of Paget’s disease. In some families. the disease has been found to be linked to a susceptibility locus on chromosome 18q21-22. which also contains the gene responsible for familial expansile osteolysis (FEO)—a rare bone dysplasia with many similarities to Paget’s disease. Insertion mutations of the TNFRSF11A gene encoding Receptor Activator of NFκB (RANK) have recently been found to be responsible for FEO and rare cases of early onset familial Paget’s disease. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting the PDB/FEO critical region has also been described in osteosarcomas suggesting that TNFRSF11A might also be involved in the development of osteosarcoma.

Soon after the method became established (1. 2). it was demonstrated that the frequency of homologous recombination was adversely affected by the presence of vector-target mismatches (3). To optimize the efficiency of gene targeting. it therefore became common practice to construct vectors from “isogenic” DNA.Recent improvements in methodology have opened the door to gene targeting in somatic cells (4).

However. only a small proportion of the inherited susceptibility can be ascribed to dominant syndromes. such as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) or Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). In an attempt to identify novel colorectal cancer predisposing genes. we have performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in 30 Swedish non-FAP/non-HNPCC families with a strong family history of colorectal cancer. Statistical analysis was performed using multipoint parametric and nonparametric linkage. Parametric analysis under the assumption of locus homogeneity excluded any common susceptibility regions harbouring a predisposing gene for colorectal cancer. However. several loci on chromosomes 2q. 3q. 6q. and 7q with suggestive linkage were detected in the parametric analysis under the assumption of locus heterogeneity as well as in the nonparametric analysis. Among these loci. the locus on chromosome 3q21.1-q26.2 was the most consistent finding providing positive results in both parametric and nonparametric analyses Heterogeneity LOD score (HLOD) = 1.90. alpha = 0.45. Non-Parametric LOD score (NPL) = 2.1). The strongest evidence of linkage was seen for the region on chromosome 3. Interestingly. the same region has recently been reported as the most significant finding in a genome-wide analysis performed with SNP arrays; thus our results independently support the finding on chromosome 3q.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC,42,https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-8-87,16141781704275914226,/scholar?cites=16141781704275914226,,https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-8-87,0,0,0

We interpreted this correlation to mean that random genomic alterations (termed replicative or intrinsic) arising during DNA replication. as well as mutations that arise owing to environmental (extrinsic) and inherited factors. have important roles in tumorigenesis 1–3; however. we did not quantify the contribution of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors to any cancer type 1. In their study. Wu et al. 4 estimated an upper bound for the contribution of intrinsic factors to many cancer types. concluding that intrinsic factors account for “less than 10–30%” of cancer cases.

Tumors with MRD are deficient in the repair of specific DNA replication errors and as a result accumulate hundreds to thousands of mutations per tumor genome. The high number of somatic mutations increase the chances for at least one of these mutations to result in a highly immunogenic neo-antigenic protein that can trigger a potent anti-tumor immune response in the presence of PD-1 blockade. Methods: To further test this hypothesis. we conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab (pembro). a programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody in MRD tumors independent of tumor histology using a basket design. Pembro was administered at 10 mg/kg every 14 days in patients with > 1 prior therapy.

LLC,While nanoparticles have shown great promise as drug carriers in cancer therapy. their effectiveness is critically dependent on the structural characteristics of the tumor vasculature. Here we demonstrate that several agents capable of inducing vascular responses akin to those observed in inflammatory processes enhance the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors. The vascular-active agents tested in this study included a bacterium. a pro-inflammatory cytokine. and microtubule-destabilizing drugs. Using radiolabeled nanoparticles. we show that such agents can increase the tumor to blood ratio of radioactivity by more than 20-fold compared to nanoparticles alone. Moreover. vascular-active agents dramatically improved the therapeutic effect of nanoparticles containing radioactive isotopes or chemotherapeutic agents.

We describe a genetic selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which was used to isolate a mutant strain defective in p53-mediated transcriptional activation. The defect was partially corrected by overexpression of a yeast gene named PAK1 (p53 activating kinase). which localizes to the left arm of chromosome IX. PAK1 is predicted to encode an 810-aa protein with regions of strong similarity to previously described Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases. PAK1 sequences upstream of the coding region are characteristic of those regulating genes involved in cell cycle control. Expression of PAK1 was associated with an increased specific activity of p53 in DNA-binding assays accompanied by a corresponding increase in transactivation. Thus. PAK1 is the prototype for a class of genes that can regulate the activity of p53 in vivo. and the …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC,31,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/13/6062.short,1648266442465580872,/scholar?cites=1648266442465580872,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/92/13/6062.full.pdf,0,0,0

Previous studies have shown that active genes are associated with the nuclear matrix. We wished to know whether loops in general were solely organized by active genes. We therefore examined a locus of the Drosophila X-chromosome comprising 163.000 bp of continuous DNA sequences and devoid of known active genes. Of the 52 EcoRI restriction fragments comprising this region. we found 5 anchored fragments which non-randomly organized this region into 4 DNA loops. Each of the 5 anchored fragments contained a transcribed sequence.

Nevertheless. only in the past 25 years has there been definitive evidence that cancer is a genetic disease. A current view is that cancers arise through a multistage process in which inherited and somatic mutations of cellular genes and clonal selection of variant progeny with the most robust and aggressive growth properties play major contributing roles. Two classes of genes—proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes—are targets for the mutations. The vast majority of the mutations that contribute to the development and behavior of cancer cells are somatic (ie. arising during tumor development) and present only in the neoplastic cells of the patient.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Physiological activation of PI3Kα is brought about by the release of the inhibition by p85 when the nSH2 binds the phosphorylated tyrosine of activated receptors or their substrates. Oncogenic mutations of PI3Kα result in a constitutively activated enzyme that triggers downstream pathways that increase tumor aggressiveness and survival. Structural information suggests that some mutations also activate the enzyme by releasing p85 inhibition. Other mutations work by different mechanisms. For example. the most common mutation. His1047Arg. causes a conformational change that increases membrane association resulting in greater accessibility to the substrate. an integral membrane component. These effects are examples of the subtle structural changes that result in increased activity.

Sjöblom et al.. Research Article. 13 Oct. 2006. p. 268). they also put into stark reality the challenges facing the Human Cancer Genome Project (HCGP). One wonders about the merits of such high-cost. low-efficiency. and ultimately descriptive-type “brute force” studies. Although previously unknown mutated genes were unearthed. the functional consequences of most of these and their actual role in tumorigenesis are unknown. and even with that knowledge we are a long way from identifying new therapeutic targets. Screening to identify potentially important genes in nonhematopoietic malignancies is now possible because of recent advances in transposon-based. unbiased. forward mutagenesis screens with potential for tissue-specific mutagenesis in mice (1. 2). The advantage of such a system is that researchers can identify mutations that initiate. cooperate. and maintain a tumor by observing the development and progression of tumors in mice. Mouse models of human cancer are traditionally generated to contain known genetic changes identified in human cancers. Recent studies have demonstrated the power of the reverse. using abnormalities detected in cancer mouse models to study previously unknown. syntenic. genetic lesions and their significance in human cancers (3. 4).

However. some intronic repeat mutations have also been suggested to associate with MSI tumorigenesis. indicating the need for additional analyses on noncoding repeats. Here we have analyzed an intronic T9 repeat of semenogelin I (SEMG1) and report mutation frequencies of 51% (75 of 146) and 62% (8 of 13) in MMR-deficient primary colorectal cancers and cell lines. respectively.

There has been some evidence that CCK2R alterations play a role in cancers. but the functional significance of these alterations for tumorigenesis is unknown. We have identified six mutations in CCK2R among a panel of 140 colorectal cancers and 44 gastric cancers. We show that these mutations increase receptor activity. activate multiple downstream signaling pathways. increase cell migration. and promote angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that somatic mutations in CCK2R may promote tumorigenesis through deregulated receptor activity and highlight the importance of evaluating CCK2R inhibitors to block both the normal and mutant forms of the receptor.

There is increasing evidence that the malignant phenotype is associated with an imbalance of growth factors within the local microenvironment of tissues. Oncogenic events promoting neoplastic progression could involve either an excess of positive growth factors or a deficiency of negative ones such as TGFβ. Whether altered levels of TGFβ are directly implicated in processes of carcinogenesis remains unresolved. but local endogenous levels of TGFβ can be manipulated pharmacologically. This may be of relevance to the mode of action of some agents with proven therapeutic efficacy.

A Wiley Company,Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis has been the guiding principle in our search for tumor suppressor genes in colorectal cancer over the past 15 years. To identify genetic regions that contained tumor suppressor genes. we delineated common areas of chromosomal deletion. In 1988. we had identified a minimal region of deletion on chromosome arm 17p that was lost in 75% of colorectal cancers. and contained the TP53 gene. Initially. we believed that TP53 was unlikely to be the culprit on this chromosome. based on published knowledge that TP53 could function as an oncogene. the opposite of a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore. we found that TP53 was expressed at high levels in most colorectal tumors. and there were no signs of gross genetic rearrangements or aberrant-sized transcripts that would have indicated inactivating mutations.

Preventing hyperinflammation is key to avoiding these outcomes.

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of COVID-19 is characterized by the development of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). and interleukin (IL)-6 levels are predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Targeting hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 may be critical for reducing mortality.   Catecholamines enhance inflammatory injury by augmenting the production of IL-6 and other cytokines through a self-amplifying feed-forward loop in immune cells that requires alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) signaling. Prophylactic inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with the α1-AR antagonist prazosin reduced catecholamines and cytokine responses in mice. and resulted in markedly increased survival following various hyper-inflammatory stimuli. These findings offer a rationale for studying α1-AR antagonists in the prophylaxis of patients with COVID-19-CSS and ARDS.   As high infection rates threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity during this pandemic. preventative approaches that ameliorate COVID-19 severity and reduce excessive mortality are desperately needed. We hypothesize that treatment with prazosin of individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 could reduce catecholamine surges. secondary cytokine dysregulation. and mortality.

10088754,Optimal ratio of degenerate primer pairs improves specificity and sensitivity of PCR,2002,Xinhai Yang and James E Marchand,32,BioTechniques,5,1002-1006,Future Science Ltd,PCR utilizing degenerate primers is a powerful tool to search for new sequences related to a known gene family or to amplify simultaneously several members of a gene family. Despite the power of the technique. it is often limited by a lack of specificity and sensitivity. Since degenerate primers are a mixture of several to thousands of related sequences. they inevitably yield nonspecific products in addition to the specific one. This problem becomes more serious when the available PCR template is in low abundance. To increase sensitivity. nested PCR is often used. and protocols using as many as three rounds of degenerate primer PCR have been described (3. 4). In many circumstances. these additional sets of degenerate primers may not be available because of the constraints of primer design. In this case. optimization of degenerate primer PCR may be the only choice.

The practicality of these two approaches has been greatly enhanced by the realization of an optical amplifier based on Erbium-doped fiber where excited Er atoms act to amplify pulses of light at wavelengths around 1.5 micrometers.

It appears that the combination of distances and bit rates attainable are on the order of 100 terabit-kilometers per second. More exciting uses of multiple wavelengths are also in store.

10088763,Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector cloning of the MYCN amplified domain in neuroblastomas.,1991,SS Schneider and BA Zehnbauer and B Vogelstein and GM Brodeur,366,Progress in clinical and biological research,,71-76,,About 25% of human neuroblastomas have amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene. and this feature is associated with advanced stages of disease and rapid tumor progression. Estimates of the size of the amplicon range from 300 to 3.000 kb. with MYCN at or near the center. It has been determined previously that there is considerable conservation of the amplified sequences among different neuroblastomas. and very few rearrangements have been found. We decided to clone the entire amplified domain in YACs to assess the size. structure and organization of the amplified sequences in neuroblastomas and to identify novel or junctional sequences at the ends of an amplicon in double minutes (dmins) or in the germline. A YAC library was constructed from the SMS-KAN cell line. which contains dmins and has about 150 copies of MYCN. About 5.000 clones from this library were screened with MYCN as well as other probes from the amplified domain. To date. 16 YACs have been identified. with a median size of 240 kb (range 50-460 kb). These YAC clones can be arranged in a contiguous. linear map of greater than or equal to 1 megabase. Our data suggest that most neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification also amplify a region that is a megabase or more in size. making this the largest amplified domain cloned to date. The very large size suggests that there are other genes near MYCN whose expression is important in mediating the aggressive phenotype associated with MYCN amplification. or. alternatively. that the nearest origin of replication may be a considerable distance from MYCN.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC,6,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2068181,4382760054722366624,/scholar?cites=4382760054722366624,,,0,0,0

Genome-wide sequencing data has enabled modern phylogenomic methods to accurately dissect subclones and their phylogenies from noisy and impure bulk tumor samples at unprecedented depth4–7. However. existing methods are not designed to infer metastatic seeding patterns. We have developed a tool. called Treeomics. that utilizes Bayesian inference and Integer Linear Programming to reconstruct the phylogeny of metastases. Treeomics allowed us to infer comprehensive seeding patterns for pancreatic8. ovarian9. and prostate cancers10.11. Moreover.

10088788,14-3-3σ arrests the cell cycle,2004,Heiko Hermeking and Bert Vogelstein and Kenneth W Kinzler,,,,,,Exposure of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to ionizing radia tion results in a growth arrest. with cells blocked in both the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The G1 block has been shown to be due to the p53-mediated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21'''''''P'. but the basis for the G2 arrest is unknown. Through a quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in CRC cell lines. we have discovered that 14-3-3O is strongly induced by Y-irradiation and other DNA-damaging agents. The induc tion of 14-3-3O is mediated by a p53-responsive element located 1.815 kb upstream of its transcription start Site.

10088789,Disease detection by digital protein truncation assays,2003,C Traverso and Kenneth Kinzler and Bert Vogelstein,,,,,,Genetic diseases can be diagnosed by detection of mutations in causative genes. Protein truncation assays can be used to detect gene products of truncation-type mutations. However. the sensitivity of the assays is often insufficient to detect mutations present in a sample of DNA at a low frequency. Sensitivity can be increased by dividing samples so that the signal generated by a mutant allele comprises a larger fraction of the total alleles than prior to dividing. Thus a previously undetectable signal generated by the mutant allele can become detectable in the assay. Such increased sensitivity permits detection at early stages and in samples having high levels of other alleles.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC,4,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20030165940A1/en,13152997223645766306,/scholar?cites=13152997223645766306,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/77/b2/8b/0adf45d3b31ad0/US20030165940A1.pdf,0,0,0

Previous studies of G-6-PD isozyme expression in rare females doubly heterozygous for WAS and G-6-PD found one of two X chromosomes to be preferentially active in T cells and platelets compared to their fibroblasts. Presumably this is due to selection against cells in which the X chromosome with the WAS allele is active. We have used a new strategy that distinguishes the active and inactive X chromosomes for the detection of WAS carriers. Genomic ONA is analyzed by Southern blot to detect heterozygosity for X chromosome restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) at the PGK or HGPRT loci.

It can be shown that these supercoiled loops of DNA are mobile. as they appear to be reeled through the matrix during DNA replication. Using nuclease digestion. one can progressively cleave DNA from the loops. thereby isolating residual DNA that is close to the nuclear matrix anchorage sites.

10088809,Tumor suppressor genes,2016,David Cosgrove and Ben Ho Park and Bert Vogelstein,,Holland‐Frei Cancer Medicine,,1-20,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Cancer is a genetic disease. Mutations and other alterations in growth promoting genes (oncogenes) and tumor suppressor genes can accumulate during the lifetime of a normal cell resulting in cancer. Unlike oncogenes. tumor suppressor genes generally require biallelic inactivation in order to demonstrate a cancerous phenotype. Importantly. the discovery of heritable tumor suppressor gene mutations that lead to familial forms of cancer has revealed great insight into tumor suppressor function. This has clinical screening implications for individuals with a family history of cancer and has led to newer therapies to target cancer cells with loss of specific tumor suppressors.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:JoHZYnTS1h4C,3,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119000822.hfcm005,2502486694452066986,/scholar?cites=2502486694452066986,,,0,0,0

The vast majority of these mutations result in the loss of the carboxyl terminus of the protein. To further elucidate the function of APC. we searched for cellular proteins that associate with its carboxyl terminus. One million human cDNA clones were screened with the use of the interaction trap two-hybrid system. and 67 clones were found to have a phenotype suggestive of an Al'('-interact ing protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that 48 of these clones were derived from a single novel gene named EB1. The association of APC and I Iti proteins was confirmed with in vitro binding assays. mAbs against RBI were then produced and used to demonstrate the association of APC and EB1 in vivo. The EB1 gene was predicted to encode a 268-amino acid protein without significant homology to proteins with known function. However. searches of nucleotide databases did identify evidence for at least two related human genes and a yeast homologue.

We first evaluated 570 urine samples from patients at risk for BC (microscopic hematuria or dysuria). UroSEEK was positive in 83% of patients that developed BC. but in only 7% of patients who did not develop BC. Combined with cytology. 95% of patients that developed BC were positive.

However. the sensitivity of the assays is often insufficient to detect mutations present in a sample of DNA at a low frequency. Sensitivity can be increased by dividing samples so that the signal generated by a mutant allele comprises a larger fraction of the total alleles than prior to dividing.

Preventing hyperinflammation is key to avoiding progression to severe stages of COVID-19. We have previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (​ α 1​-AR) antagonists can prevent cytokine storm syndrome and resulting death in mice. Here. we present a retrospective study of outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress (n= 13.125) or pneumonia (n= 108.956). Patients with acute respiratory distress who were taking​ α 1​-AR antagonists for other conditions had a 35% reduced risk of requiring ventilation. and a 56% reduced risk of ventilation and death. compared to non-users (adjusted OR= 0.41. 95% CI 0.17-0.81. p= 0.01). By contrast. no significant effect was observed for beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonists. These results support studying​ α 1​-AR antagonists for preventing ARDS and reducing mortality in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. as well as highlight the need for prospective trials of​ α 1​-AR antagonists to assess their efficacy in preventing cytokine storm syndrome and death in COVID-19.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:zDhyt2jClVkC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maximilian_Konig/publication/340965229_Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor_antagonists_prevent_acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_and_death_implications_for_Coronavirus_disease_2019/links/5ea7c4b4299bf11256159ada/Alpha-1-adrenergic-receptor-antagonists-prevent-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-and-death-implications-for-Coronavirus-disease-2019.pdf,7084418205493367237,/scholar?cites=7084418205493367237,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maximilian_Konig/publication/340965229_Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor_antagonists_prevent_acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome_and_death_implications_for_Coronavirus_disease_2019/links/5ea7c4b4299bf11256159ada/Alpha-1-adrenergic-receptor-antagonists-prevent-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-and-death-implications-for-Coronavirus-disease-2019.pdf,0,0,0

Many tumors exhibit oncogene-dependent addiction to glutamine. PIK3CA. which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α. is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. However. whether PIK3CA mutations reprogram cancer metabolism is an important unaddressed question. Here we show that oncogenic PIK3CA mutations reprogram glutamine metabolism by up-regulating glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. thereby rendering them addicted to glutamine.

Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med,,3823,,Results: In vitro phantom studies (Fig. 1b) revealed that different MW dextrans and glucose share a similar CEST contrast pattern. eg resonant at~ 1 ppm when B1= 3.6 μT was used. Similar to glucose. dextrans also exhibit a highly B1-dependent CEST pattern (Fig. 1c). with signal increasing at higher B1 for the fast exchanging OH protons. The apparent shift of the curve to higher frequency is due to broadening of the direct saturation and not a real effect. Fig. 1d shows that~ 5% CEST contrast can be generated per 3 mM glucose unit concentration. which. for example. corresponds to~ 0.3 μM dextran for a MW of 200 kD. As a first in vivo demonstration. we injected two dextrans (9.5 and 70 kD. 4 and 14 nm in radius respectively) to mice bearing CT26 tumors to assess the differential permeability of the tumor to particles of different sizes. Because low MW dextran will be quickly cleared from plasma and tumor according to the literature4. we injected the low MW dextran first (Fig. 2a). followed by the high MW dextran after a sufficiently long interval (eg> 40 min). This allowed detection of the pharmacokinetics of both dextrans in the same tumor within a single MRI session. Fig. 2b shows the CEST contrast maps at different time points before and after injection. To better show the CEST enhancement. we also display∆ MTRasym at different time points in specific tumor and kidney regions (Figs. 2c & 2d). The results clearly show a differential vascular permeability of the studied tumor to dextrans of different sizes. with 10 kD dextran (~ 4 nm) penetrating deeply into the tumor while 70 kD dextran (~ 14 nm) only accumulates in the tumor periphery.

Dying tumor cells release mutant gene fragments into the circulation. in principle providing exquisitely specific markers to detect the presence of neoplasia and to monitor therapeutic responses. However. the number of such mutant gene fragments is small compared to the number of normal circulating DNA fragments. making it difficult to detect and quantify them with sufficient sensitivity for meaningful clinical use. Methods: We used an extraordinarily sensitive new approach termed BEAMing (Beads. Emulsions. Amplification. and Magnetics). to quantify the amount of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma. In a prospective study. we studied 162 samples collected longitudinally from 18 patients undergoing surgical therapy for primary or metastatic colorectal cancer.

Mutations present in one allele are often masked by the wild-type sequence of the other allele. Individual alleles can be isolated from every chromosome within somatic cell hybrids generated from a single fusion.

To achive this goal. it is essential to develop methods that are sufficiently specific and sensitive to detect these mutations in a high background of wild-type DNA. We recently described an approach. called BEAMing that allows a one-to-one conversion of a population of DNA fragments into a population of beads each containing thousands of copies derived from one of the fragments. Because millions of beads can be generated in a single test tube and analyzed by standard flow cytometry. this technique has the capacity to quanitify mutant and wild type sequences. The capacity to enumerate such mutations is therefore not limited by the beads themselves. but instead by the finite number of fragments present in the clinical samples and the error …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:In6cVmBjs0IC,1,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/66/8_Supplement/1347.1.short,13557076467165970228,/scholar?cites=13557076467165970228,,,0,0,0

10088911,CDK4 is a target of c-MYC,2002,Bert Vogelstein and Kenneth Kinzler and Heiko Hermeking,,,,,,The prototypic oncogene c-MYC encodes a transcription factor. which can drive proliferation by promoting cell cycle re-entry. However. the mechanisms through which c-MYC achieves these effects have been unclear. Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). we have identified the cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene as a transcriptional target of c-MYC. c-MYC induced a rapid increase in CDK4 mRNA levels through four highly conserved c-Myc binding sites (MBS) within the CDK4 promoter. Cell cycle progression is delayed in c-MYC-deficient RAT1 cells. and this delay was associated with a defect in CDK4 induction. Ectopic expression of CDK4 in these cells partially alleviated the growth defect. Thus. CDK4 provides a direct link between the oncogenic effects of c-MYC and cell cycle regulation.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:HKviVsUxM5wC,1,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20020111289A1/en,9359913392601556648,/scholar?cites=9359913392601556648,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1e/f3/01/bf4a214970f5b7/US20020111289A1.pdf,0,0,0

Theoretically. the proteins encoded by these genes provide excellent tools for achieving tumor cell-specific expression. An approach to achieving specific expression of a desired protein in tumor cells is based on the selective expression of such oncoproteins. In outline. an endogenous cellular oncoprotein binds to exogenously introduced gene products. resulting in transcriptional activation of a desired gene. This approach is generally applicable to other diseases in which a particular protein is selectively expressed in disease-affected cells as compared to non-affected cells.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:Azgs6IHzeyYC,1,https://patents.google.com/patent/US6054570A/en,7987747299168705852,/scholar?cites=7987747299168705852,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8a/89/e5/ff5da2910a6f16/US6054570.pdf,0,0,0

Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification. This system should expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses for a variety of purposes.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:N4u4nq0IxgcC,1,https://media.addgene.org/data/67/06/16299594-af64-11e0-90fe-003048dd6500.pdf,347412408652195961,/scholar?cites=347412408652195961,,https://media.addgene.org/data/67/06/16299594-af64-11e0-90fe-003048dd6500.pdf,0,0,0

Different mutational processes induce different types of DNA mutations. providing 'mutational signatures' that have led to key insights into cancer etiology. The most widely used signatures for assessing genomic data are based on unsupervised patterns that are then retrospectively correlated with certain features of cancer. We show here that supervised machine-learning techniques can identify signatures. called SuperSigs. that are more predictive than those currently available. Surprisingly. we found that aging yields different SuperSigs in different tissues. and the same is true for environmental exposures. We were able to discover SuperSigs associated with obesity. the most important lifestyle factor contributing to cancer in Western populations.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:QSG1pgF8pGAC,0,https://elifesciences.org/articles/61082,,,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/61082,0,0,0

To assess aneuploidy. we employed RealSeqS. a technique that uses a single primer pair to interrogate ∼350.000 genome-spanning regions and identify specific chromosome arm alterations.

However. the current stage-based treatment approach lacks precision and has quite a modest survival impact. A powerful prognostic marker could revolutionize adjuvant therapy by (i) better defining the recurrence risk of individual patients and allowing delivery of a more personalized treatment approach and (ii) enriching studies of new therapies with high-risk patients. substantially reducing the size and cost of adjuvant therapy trials. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising noninvasive biomarker. with the ability to detect minimal residual disease following curative intent treatment in early-stage colorectal cancer.

First. there is a fundamental difference between postoperative ctDNA and conventional prognostic markers. 2 The presence of ctDNA indicates that the administered therapy (be it surgery. chemotherapy. radiotherapy. or immunotherapy) has not eradicated all cancer cells. For patients in whom the primary tumor was removed by surgical resection. the continuous presence of ctDNA means that millions of actively dividing cancer cells are present at occult metastatic sites within the body.Second. conventional prognostic markers represent group probabilities—patients within certain clinically defined groups. for example. a specific T and N category. have a certain probability of recurrence and propensity …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:dYRx7efp7U0C,0,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2763396,,,,,0,0,0

Targeting infected cells using TCR-mimic antibodies to peptide-MHC (pMHC) would provide a specific. high-affinity platform for immune system activation and monitoring antigen processing. However. antibodies to pMHC are notoriously difficult to isolate. Using a phage display platform. we panned for phage expressing variable fragments against immunodominant HIV pMHC complexes. These Fab fragments were cloned into a bispecific antibody (bsAb) backbone. such that one Fab fragment is specific for an HIV pMHC and the other fragment binds to CD3.

These tumors often contain a chromosomal abnormality involving a pericentromeric fusion of chromosomes 1 and 19. resulting in losses of the entire short arm of the former and the long arm of the latter. To identify the molecular genetic basis for this alteration. we performed exomic sequencing of seven anaplastic oligodendrogliomas with chromosome 1p and 19q losses. Among other changes. we found that that CIC (homolog of the Drosophila gene capicua) on chromosome 19q was somatically mutated in six of the seven cases and that FUBP1 (far upstream element (FUSE) binding protein) on chromosome 1p was somatically mutated in two of the seven cases.

Each DNA molecule in a collection of such molecules is converted into a single particle to which thousands of copies of DNA identical in sequence to the original are bound. This population of beads then corresponds to a one-to-one representation of the starting DNA molecules. Variation within the original population of DNA molecules can then be simply assessed by counting fluorescently-labeled particles via flow cytometry Millions of individual DNA molecules can be assessed in this fashion with standard laboratory equipment.

As a result there is intense interest in targeting p53 for cancer therapy. Intracellular p53 is inaccessible to therapeutic antibodies that bind cell surface proteins. However. intracellular proteins including p53 are degraded into peptides that are presented on cell surface in association with HLA class I molecules. Thus p53 peptide-HLA (p53-HLA) complexes can be antibody targets. Methods: Using phage display we identified a novel anti-p53-HLA single chain variable fragment (scFv) clone-43 that recognizes a wild-type p53 10-mer epitope bound to HLA-A*2402. By coupling our clone-43 scFv with an anti-CD3 scFv. we generated a single chain diabody (scDb) designed to activate T-cells against p53-expressing target cells.

Genome-wide sequencing data has enabled modern phylogenomic methods to accurately dissect subclones and their phylogenies from noisy and impure bulk tumor samples at unprecedented depth. However. existing methods are not designed to infer metastatic seeding patterns. We have developed a tool. called Treeomics. that utilizes Bayesian inference and Integer Linear Programming to reconstruct the phylogeny of metastases. Treeomics allowed us to infer comprehensive seeding patterns for pancreatic. ovarian. and prostate cancers. Moreover. Treeomics correctly disambiguated true seeding patterns from sequencing artifacts; 7% of variants were misclassified by conventional statistical methods. These artifacts can skew phylogenies by creating illusory tumor heterogeneity among distinct samples. Last. we performed in silico benchmarking on simulated tumor phylogenies across a wide range of sample purities (30-90%) and sequencing depths (50-800x) to demonstrate the high accuracy of Treeomics compared to existing methods.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:ON9TkA72AHEC,0,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/32094204,,,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/32094204/048157.full.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Adverse side effects are the primary cause of early cessation of chemotherapy as well as high failure rates of new entities during clinical trials. This has led to intense research into various tumor-selective delivery modalities. We present here two novel strategies by which we reformulate promising cancer drug candidates and dramatically lower their toxic side effects. The first strategy involved development of a generalizable method for efficiently loading poorly soluble. non-ionizible organic molecules into stealth liposomes using a pH gradient.

We show that the incidence of many cancers is strongly correlated (0.80; P < 1.8 × 10-6) with the lifetime number of divisions of the normal stem cells maintaining that tissue9s homeostasis. These results suggest that only ∼35% of the variation in cancer incidence among tissues is attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions. Moreover. we derive an approach to assess the evidence for environmental and inherited factors that contribute to a given cancer type vs. other cancer types.The slope of the correlation noted above suggests that the number of driver gene mutations required to develop cancer must be smaller than what was previously estimated.

A newly determined p110α/niSH2 crystal structure is the first to reveal the nSH2 domain in complex with wild-type p110α. allowing investigation of the mechanisms of nSH2 regulation. Key interactions between the nSH2 domain and the activation loop suggest a mechanism by which the kinase domain is kept in an inactive conformation until activation by phosphopeptide binding. Key differences in nSH2 domain binding to p110α were identified …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:SpPTWFSNUtQC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/74/19_Supplement/LB-326.short,,,,,0,0,0

Protein truncation assays can be used to detect gene products of truncation-type mutations. However. the sensitivity of the assays is often insufficient to detect mutations present in a sample of DNA at a low frequency. Sensitivity can be increased by dividing samples so that the signal generated by a mutant allele comprises a larger fraction of the total alleles than prior to dividing. Thus a previously undetectable signal generated by the mutant allele can become detectable in the assay.

The challenge now is to exploit this wealth information to reduce cancer deaths. Most current efforts towards this goal are focused on curing patients with advanced disease through “personalized” medicine approaches. However. the barriers to curing such patients are now being recognized. in part through the insights gained from cancer genome sequencing. Alternative strategies to reduce cancer deaths are therefore essential to achieving this goal.

September 21. in Plenary Session 8.African American (AA) and Puerto Rican (PR) men have a higher oral (OSCC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) burden than White men in the United States (US). but the biological basis for these differences are poorly understood. Overall Five-Year relative survival rates for patients diagnosed with oral cavity cancer increased from 53% in 1975 to 63% in 2005 across all races in the US. an increase that parallels a decline in smoking among males during the same period of time. However. the disparity in overall survival rates between Whites and African American patients has remained. practically unchanged from 1975 (19%) to 2005 (18%). The survival disparity difference in HNSCC among AA may be due. among other factors. to a higher prevalence of genetic alterations.To gain an initial …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:vVJNg6_NJEsC,0,https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/20/10_Supplement/PR3.short,,,,https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/20/10_Supplement/PR3,0,0,0

Methods: To explore the genetic basis of PanNETs. we determined the exomic sequences of ten non-familial PanNETs and then screened the most commonly mutated genes in 58 additional PanNETs. Results: We found frequently mutated genes implicated in chromatin remodeling: 44% of the tumors had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN-1. which encodes menin. a component of a histone methyltransferase complex; and 43% had mutations in genes encoding either of the two subunits of a transcription/chromatin remodeling complex consisting of DAXX (death-domain associated protein) and ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked).

While acquired chromosomal aberrations have been demonstrated to influence CLL biology and clinical behavior. it remains unclear what single gene defects other than p53 or ATM mutations contribute to or cause the CLL phenotype. In particular. recurrent gene mutations that are increasingly found in other hematological malignancies have not yet been identified in CLL. Further. the discovery of stereotypical immunoglobulin receptor genes in CLL has been advanced in support of the involvement of autoantigenes in the pathogenesis of CLL and thus a pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic gene mutation may possibly not exist in CLL.Given that kinase genes are often the targets for recurrent gene mutations and given the prospect for identification of drugable targets. we have analyzed 515 kinase genes in a discovery …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:gV6rEsy15s0C,0,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/116/21/2410/131949,,,,,0,0,0

This distinction can be critical for understanding the relationship between known transcripts (sense) and the complementary antisense transcripts that may regulate them. Here we describe a technique that can be used to (i) identify the DNA strand of origin for any particular RNA transcript and (ii) quantify the number of sense and antisense transcripts from expressed genes at a global level. We examined five different human cell types and in each case found evidence for antisense transcripts in 2900 to 6400 human genes. The distribution of antisense transcripts was distinct from that of sense transcripts. was non-random across the genome. and differed among cell types.

In the past three years. it has become possible to determine the sequence of nearly all the 21.000 protein-encoding genes in the human genome. The results of such sequencing in 68 tumors of the breast. colon. pancreas. or brain have led to new insights about the nature and diversity of the genetic alterations responsible for initiation and progression of tumors. The pathogenesis of solid tumors can best be understood as the cumulative result of alterations in approximately a dozen pathways that each regulate the balance between cell birth and cell death.

TP53 has been estimated to be altered by point mutation in roughly half of all human cancers. In normal cells. the p53 protein is a major node in the network controlling the response to stress with one of its major functions is the activation of a transcriptional response to such stresses that determine whether cells arrest and repair the damage or undergo apoptosis. In the absence of TP53. both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are compromised. presumably allowing these cancer cells to proliferate under situations wherein normal cells would die. In light of its extraordinarily high mutation rate across many different tumor types. TP53 provides a uniquely attractive target for drug development. However. like any tumor suppressor gene.

The hFAST-1 protein has the ability to bind to human Smad2 and activate an activin response element (ARE). The hFAST-1-dependent activation of ARE is dependent on endogenous Smad4 and stimulation of the TGF-β receptor. The hFAST-1 protein binds to a novel DNA motif. TGT (G/T)(T/G) ATT. which is present within the ARE. This motif is important for the activation of genes responsive to ligands of the TGF-β family.

At the heart of the controversy are the complicated moral and legal issues surrounding the source of these stem cells. since those that are most valuable to scientists can only be obtained from human embryos. Yet stem cells may offer unprecedented opportunities for developing new therapies for many of the most debilitating medical conditions--including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. spinal cord injuries. stroke. heart disease. and diabetes.The ethical and legal concerns regarding the use of cells from human embryos cannot be ignored.

10089133,Human fast-1 protein,2001,Shibin Zhou and Leigh Zawel and Bert Vogelstein and Kenneth W Kinzler,,,,,,hFAST-1 is a human forkhead activin signal transducer gene. The hFAST-1 protein has the ability to bind to human Smad2 and activate an activin response element (ARE). The hFAST-1-dependent activation of ARE is dependent on endogenous Smad4 and stimulation of the TGF-β receptor. The hFAST-1 protein binds to a novel DNA motif. TGT (G/T)(T/G) ATT. which is present within the ARE. This motif is important for the activation of genes responsive to ligands of the TGF-β family.

We report an EMC with a new translocation. t (9; 15)(q22; q21). and a third type of TEC-containing fusion gene. The chimeric transcript encodes a protein in which the first 108 amino acids of the NH2 terminus of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein TCF12 is linked to the entire TEC protein. The translocation separates the NH2-terminal domain of TCF12 from the bHLH domain as well as from a potential leucine zipper domain located immediately downstream of the breakpoint. These results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal transactivation domains of EWS or TAF2N are not essential for the oncogenic properties of fusion proteins in EMC. and that EWS or TAF2N may be replaced by a similar …,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:rqnDXT1GswoC,0,https://www.nature.com/articles/ng0401supp_87d,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ng0401supp_56a.pdf?origin=ppub,0,0,0

We have studied the N-myc amplified domain from a representative neuroblastoma cell line SMS-KAN. and compared the map of the amplicon in this cell line to that seen in normal DNA. The SMS-KAN cell line DNA was cloned into yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). and clones were identified by screening the YAC library with amplified DNA probes that had been obtained previously (Molec. Cell. Biol. 8: 522-530. 1988). In addition. YAC clones corresponding to the normal N-myc locus on chromosome 2 were obtained by screening two normal human YAC libraries with these probes. and the restriction maps of both sets of overlapping YACs were compared.

10089192,Characterization of DCC. a Candidate Tumor Suppressor Gene which is Altered,1991,KR Cho and ER Fearon and B Vogelstein,82,The Status of Differentiation Therapy of Cancer,,99,Raven Press (ID),Tumorigenesis is thought to be a multistep process in which genetic alterations accumulate to bring about the neoplastic phenotype. Colorectal tumors provide an excellent system in which to study the molecular events which underlie the initiation and progression of human cancer. We have proposed a model for the genetic basis of colorectal neoplasia that includes several salient features (1). First. colorectal tumors appear to arise as a result of the mutational activation of oncogenes coupled with mutational inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Second. mutations in at least four or five genes are required for formation of a malignant tumor. Third. although the genetic alterations often occur according to a preferred sequence. the total accumulation of changes rather than their chronological order of appearance. is responsible for determining the tumor's biologic properties. Fourth. in some cases. mutant tumor suppressor genes may exert a phenotypic effect even when present in the heterozygous state.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:lDOOmgye57wC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5064559119307479135&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

These extracts are also mitogenic for human. murine and porcine lymphocytes. Studies with T-enriched and B-enriched murine lymphocyte populations showed that the mitogenic response is a property of T lymphocytes.Seeds were collected from the fruits of A. cornmunis plants grown at Ile-lfe. Nigeria. Ground defatted seeds were extracted with 0. IS M-NaCI. and haemagglutination studies performed as described previously (Animashaun. 1983). The extracts agglutinated human groups A. B and 0 erythrocytes. and murine erythrocytes with a titre of 215. Porcine. ovine and bat erythrocytes were also agglutinated. Agglutination was inhibited by 50% by 1.5 mM-methyl-aD-galactopyranoside or 6.25 mM-melibiose. but methyl-jhgalactopyranoside. glucose. lactose. raffinose. fucose and galactosamine HCI were not inhibitory.

Colorectal tumors provide an excellent system in which to search for and study the genetic alterations involved in the development of a common human neoplasm. Abundant clinical and histopathological data suggest that most. if not all. malignant colo-rectal tumors (carcinomas) arise from preexisting benign tumors (adenomas)(Sugarbaker et al.. 1985). Tumors of various stages of development. from very small adenomas to large metastatic carcinomas. can be obtained for study. unlike the situation in most other common human tumor types.

10089231,Enrichment and Expansion with Nanoscale Artificial Antigen Presenting Cells for Adoptive Immunotherapy,,Andrew Skora and Yen Ling Chiu and Mathias Oelke and Kenneth Kinzler and Shibin Zhou and Bert Vogelstein and Jonathan P Schneck,,,,,,Adoptive immunotherapy (AIT) can mediate durable regression of cancer. but widespread adoption of AIT is limited by the cost and complexity of generating tumorspecific T cells. Here we develop an Enrichment þ Expansion strategy using paramagnetic. nanoscale artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) to rapidly expand tumor-specific T cells from rare naïve precursors and predicted neo-epitope responses. Nano-aAPC are capable of enriching rare tumor-specific T cells in a magnetic column and subsequently activating them to induce proliferation. Enrichment þ Expansion resulted in greater than 1000-fold expansion of both mouse and human tumor-specific T cells in 1 week. with nano-aAPC based enrichment conferring a proliferation advantage during both in vitro culture and after adoptive transfer in vivo. Robust T cell responses were seen not only for shared tumor antigens. but also for computationally predicted neo-epitopes. Streamlining the rapid generation of large numbers of tumor-specific T cells in a cost-effective fashion through Enrichment þ Expansion can be a powerful tool for immunotherapy.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:oH8HCDhqVGsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9420919578680525826&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Here. we attempted to determine how early somatic L1 insertions occurred during the development of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Using L1-targeted resequencing (L1-seq). we studied different stages of four colorectal cancers arising from colonic polyps. seven pancreatic carcinomas. as well as seven gastric cancers. Surprisingly. we found somatic L1 insertions not only in all cancer types and metastases. but also in colonic adenomas. well-known cancer precursors. Some insertions were also present in low quantities in normal GI tissues. occasionally caught in the act of being clonally fixed in the adjacent tumors. Insertions in adenomas and cancers numbered in the hundreds and many were present in multiple tumor sections implying clonal distribution.

10089234,1. RECENT RESEARCH ADVANCES Genetic instability as an underlying mechanism of cancer,,Bert Vogelstein and Ken Kinzler and Christoph Lengauer and Michael Kastan and Ian Tomlinson and Sandy Markowitz and Carol Greider and Ronald DePinho,,,,,,A fundamental principle underlying the formation of cancer is the sequential acquisition of alterations in specific genes. These alterations lead to genetic instability that fuel the growth of cancer cells. A fraction of cancers exhibit a form of genetic instability called microsatellite instability (MIN). which is often characterized by mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Loss of MMR functions renders tumor cells susceptible to the acquisition of somatic mutations throughout the genome. A more common form of genetic instability is chromosomal instability (CIN). which is usually manifested as aneuploidy. Mounting evidence suggests that the spindle assembly checkpoint in mitosis is the point of failure in CIN. Thus. defects in genes involved in mitotic spindle checkpoint. centrosome duplication. recombination. DNA repair or damage response have often been associated with the formation of aneuploidy.

The lanthanum complex KP772 induces DNA strand breaks without altering the secondary structure of DNA. For the complexes KP1255 and KP776 neither induction of DNA strand breaks nor alterations of the secondary structure of DNA could be detected.

This approach. named bacteriolytic therapy. has found renewed interest through the availability of genetic engineering of various bacteria. 1 For example. Clostridium novyi-NT. the bacterium explored here is currently being tested in a FDA approved phase I clinical trials of colorectal cancer. In experimental models. after a single intravenous administration of C. novyi-NT spores. the bacterium generates a robust and predictable response consisting of germination and proliferation within the tumor in 12-24 hours. followed by an immune responses to eradicate tumor cells in the well oxygenated regions. 2 A non-invasive imaging approach that could monitor this treatment response would be of immense value for translating bacteriolytic therapy into the clinic. We hypothesized that bacteria should be detectable through their high protein content using Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI. 3. 4 which has been used to detect intracellular mobile proteins using the so-called amide proton transfer (APT) signals at 3.5 ppm from water protons5 These signals are higher in tumor cells. which have been extensively studied for their CEST signal. 8 To test whether we can detect bacteria though their proteins. we investigated the CEST properties of C. novyi-NT in vitro. followed by in vivo exam of whether tumor infection could be measured by CEST MRI.,True,O3FVg9AAAAAJ:pRWBApOjXDcC,0,https://cds.ismrm.org/protected/11MProceedings/files/661.pdf,,,,https://cds.ismrm.org/protected/11MProceedings/files/661.pdf,0,0,0

The tree has its basis in a concatenation of 31 orthologs occurring in 191 species with sequenced genomes. It revealed interdomain discrepancies in taxonomic classification. Systematic detection and subsequent exclusion of products of horizontal gene transfer increased phylogenetic resolution. allowing us to confirm accepted relationships and resolve disputed and preliminary classifications. For example. we place the phylum Acidobacteria as a sister group of δ-Proteobacteria. support a Gram-positive origin of Bacteria. and suggest a thermophilic last universal common ancestor.,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:yTLRzDEmwhEC,1543,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/311/5765/1283.abstract,3281912461019256005,/scholar?cites=3281912461019256005,,https://pure.aber.ac.uk/portal/files/5102642/Post_print.pdf,0,0,0

Disordered regions in proteins often contain short linear peptide motifs (e.g.. SH3 ligands and targeting signals) that are important for protein function. We present here DisEMBL. a computational tool for prediction of disordered/unstructured regions within a protein sequence. As no clear definition of disorder exists. we have developed parameters based on several alternative definitions and introduced a new one based on the concept of “hot loops.” i.e.. coils with high temperature factors. Avoiding potentially disordered segments in protein expression constructs can increase expression. foldability. and stability of the expressed protein.

Their function is mediated by the Argonaute proteins (AGOs). which colocalize to P-bodies with mRNA degradation enzymes.

We show that depletion of GW182 leads to changes in mRNA expression profiles strikingly similar to those observed in cells depleted of the essential Drosophila miRNA effector AGO1. indicating that GW182 functions in the miRNA pathway. When GW182 is bound to a reporter transcript. it silences its expression. bypassing the requirement for AGO1. Silencing by GW182 is effected by changes in protein expression and mRNA stability.

10089304,STRING: a web-server to retrieve and display the repeatedly occurring neighbourhood of a gene,2000,Berend Snel and Gerrit Lehmann and Peer Bork and Martijn A Huynen,28,Nucleic acids research,18,3442-3444,Oxford University Press,The repeated occurrence of genes in each other’s neighbourhood on genomes has been shown to indicate a functional association between the proteins they encode. Here we introduce STRING (search tool for recurring instances of neighbouring genes). a tool to retrieve and display the genes a query gene repeatedly occurs with in clusters on the genome. The tool performs iterative searches and visualises the results in their genomic context. By finding the genomically associated genes for a query. it delineates a set of potentially functionally associated genes. The usefulness of STRING is illustrated with an example that suggests a functional context for an RNA methylase with unknown specificity.

Here we show how the human gut microbiome impacts the serum metabolome and associates with insulin resistance in 277 non-diabetic Danish individuals. The serum metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals is characterized by increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). which correlate with a gut microbiome that has an enriched biosynthetic potential for BCAAs and is deprived of genes encoding bacterial inward transporters for these amino acids. Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus are identified as the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs and insulin resistance. and in mice we demonstrate that P. copri can induce insulin resistance. aggravate glucose intolerance and augment circulating levels of BCAAs.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Based on pattern searches and systematic database screening. almost 650 different ankyrin‐like (ANK) repeats from nearly all phyla have been identified; more than 150 of them are reported here for the first time. Their presence in functionally diverse proteins such as enzymes. toxins. and transcription factors strongly suggests domain shuffling. but their occurrence in prokaryotes and yeast excludes exon shuffling. The spreading mechanism remains unknown. but in at least three cases horizontal gene transfer appears to be involved. ANK repeats occur in at least four consecutive copies. The terminal repeats are more variable in sequence. One feature of the internal repeats is a predicted central hydrophobic α‐helix. which is likely to interact with other repeats. The functions of the ankyrin‐like repeats are compatible with a role in protein‐protein interactions. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss.

We discovered that most complexes consist of both periodically and constitutively expressed subunits. which suggests that the former control complex activity by a mechanism of just-in-time assembly.

Although TAP directly interacts with CTE-bearing RNAs. the mode of interaction of TAP/Mex67p with cellular mRNAs is different from that with the CTE RNA and is likely to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. Here we show that Mex67p directly interacts with Yra1p. an essential yeast hnRNP-like protein. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved as Yra1p also interacts with TAP.

We identified 19.724 regions of which 95% ± 3% are estimated to evolve neutrally and thus are likely to encode pseudogenes. Half of these have no detectable truncation in their pseudocoding regions and therefore are not identifiable by methods that require the presence of truncations to prove nonfunctionality. A comparative analysis with the mouse genome showed that 70% of these pseudogenes have a retrotranspositional origin (processed). and the rest arose by segmental duplication (nonprocessed). Although the spread of both types of pseudogenes correlates with chromosome size. nonprocessed pseudogenes appear to be enriched in regions with high gene density.

The nodes of these networks are usually proteins (specifically enzymes in metabolic networks). whereas the links (or edges) are their interactions with other molecules. These networks are made up of protein–protein interactions or enzyme–enzyme interactions through shared metabolites in the case of metabolic networks.

However. PCR-based methods exhibit multiple technical shortcomings that may bias our understanding of the fungal kingdom. This study was initiated to quantify potential biases in fungal community ecology by comparing the relative performance of amplicon-free shotgun metagenomics and amplicons of nine primer pairs over seven nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions often used in metabarcoding analyses. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcodes ITS1 and ITS2 provided greater taxonomic and functional resolution and richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity threshold compared to barcodes located within the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) genes. All barcode-primer pair combinations provided consistent results in ranking taxonomic richness and recovering the importance of floristic variables in driving fungal community composition in soils of Papua New Guinea.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae data in particular have been subjected to a wide range of bioinformatics analysis methods. aimed at identifying the correct and complete set of periodically expressed genes. Results: Here. we provide the first thorough benchmark of such methods. surprisingly revealing that most new and more mathematically advanced methods actually perform worse than the analysis published with the original microarray data sets. We show that this loss of accuracy specifically affects methods that only model the shape of the expression profile without taking into account the magnitude of regulation.

As gastrointestinal dysfunction often precedes or parallels motor symptoms. the enteric system with its vast diversity of microorganisms may be involved in PD pathogenesis. Alterations in the enteric microbial taxonomic level of L-DOPA-naïve PD patients might also serve as a biomarker. We performed metagenomic shotgun analyses and compared the fecal microbiomes of 31 early stage. L-DOPA-naïve PD patients to 28 age-matched controls. We found increased Verrucomicrobiaceae (Akkermansia muciniphila) and unclassified Firmicutes. whereas Prevotellaceae (Prevotella copri) and Erysipelotrichaceae (Eubacterium biforme) were markedly lowered in PD samples. The observed differences could reliably separate PD from control with a ROC-AUC of 0.84. Functional analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in microbiota metabolism in PD involving the ẞ-glucuronate and tryptophan metabolism. While the abundances of prophages and plasmids did not differ between PD and controls. total virus abundance was decreased in PD participants.

Many repeats appear to possess high amino acid substitution rates and thus recognition of repeat homologues is highly problematic. Even if the presence of a certain repeat family is known. the exact locations and the number of repetitive units often cannot be determined using current methods.

PD is a multifactorial syndrome that. in many cases. is not inherited1. Nevertheless. Polymeropoulos et al. 2 recently found mutations in the gene that encodessynuclein. a protein present in presynaptic vesicles. in autosomal dominant PD. In addition. Leroy and co-workers3 have identified mutations in another gene that has a ubiquitin-like domain in familial PD. Recently. Kitada and co-workers4 reported a gene defect that causes Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP). a hereditary form of PD.

So far no global analysis has attempted to explore those connections in the light of the large phenotypic variability seen in nature. Here. we use an unsupervised. systematic approach for associating genes and phenotypic characteristics that combines literature mining with comparative genome analysis. We first mine the MEDLINE literature database for terms that reflect phenotypic similarities of species. Subsequently we predict the likely genomic determinants: genes specifically present in the respective genomes. In a global analysis involving 92 prokaryotic genomes we retrieve 323 clusters containing a total of 2.700 significant gene–phenotype associations. Some clusters contain mostly known relationships. such as genes involved in motility or plant degradation. often with additional hypothetical proteins associated with those phenotypes. Other clusters comprise unexpected associations; for example. a group of terms related to food and spoilage is linked to genes predicted to be involved in bacterial food poisoning. Among the clusters. we observe an enrichment of pathogenicity-related associations. suggesting that the approach reveals many novel genes likely to play a role in infectious diseases.,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,177,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030134,9313030377997317547,/scholar?cites=9313030377997317547,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030134,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,Alternative splicing is a critical post‐transcriptional event leading to an increase in the transcriptome diversity. Recent bioinformatics studies revealed a high frequency of alternative splicing. Although the extent of AS conservation among mammals is still being discussed. it has been argued that major forms of alternatively spliced transcripts are much better conserved than minor forms.1 It suggests that alternative splicing plays a major role in genome evolution allowing new exons to evolve with less constraint.

Evolution of tumors. including those with MSI. is a continuous process of mutation and selection favoring neoplastic growth. Mutations in microsatellite-bearing genes that promote tumor cell growth in general (Real Common Target genes) are assumed to be the driving force during MSI carcinogenesis. Thus. microsatellite mutations in these genes should occur more frequently than mutations in microsatellite genes without contribution to malignancy (ByStander genes).

To deduce important ecological indicators such as environmental adaptation. molecular trait dispersal. diversity variation and primary production from the gene pool of an ecosystem. we integrated 25 ocean metagenomes with geographical. meteorological and geophysicochemical data. We find that climatic factors (temperature. sunlight) are the major determinants of the biomolecular repertoire of each sample and the main limiting factor on functional trait dispersal (absence of biogeographic provincialism). Molecular functional richness and diversity show a distinct latitudinal gradient peaking at 20°N and correlate with primary production.

However. the biochemical function of frataxin has remained obscure. hampering attempts at therapeutic intervention. To predict functional interactions of frataxin with other proteins we investigated whether its gene specifically co-occurs with any other genes in sequenced genomes. In 56 available genomes we identified two genes with identical phylogenetic distributions to the frataxin/cyaY gene: hscA and hscB/JAC1. These genes have not only emerged in the same evolutionary lineage as the frataxin gene. they have also been lost at least twice with it. and they have been horizontally transferred with it in the evolution of the mitochondria.

A decade of linkage and physical mapping studies have culminated in the identification of the Friedreich's ataxia gene. The presence of homologues in purple bacterial genomes. but not in other bacteria. allows us to infer a mitochondrial location for frataxin (Friedreich's ataxia protein) on the basis of bacterial phylogeny. Frataxin possesses a non-globular N-terminus domain providing a candidate mitochondrial targeting peptide.

We developed metagenomic read simulators with platform-specific (Sanger. pyrosequencing. Illumina) base-error models. and simulated metagenomes of differing community complexities. We first evaluated the effect of rigorous quality control on Illumina data. Although quality filtering removed a large proportion of the data. it greatly improved the accuracy and contig lengths of resulting assemblies. We then compared the quality-trimmed Illumina assemblies to those from Sanger and pyrosequencing. For the simple community (10 genomes) all sequencing technologies assembled a similar amount and accurately represented the expected functional composition. For the more complex community (100 genomes) Illumina produced the best assemblies and more correctly resembled the expected functional composition. For the most complex community (400 genomes) there was very little assembly of reads from any sequencing technology. However. due to the longer read length the Sanger reads still represented the overall functional composition reasonably well. We further examined the effect of scaffolding of contigs using paired-end Illumina reads. It dramatically increased contig lengths of the simple community and yielded minor improvements to the more complex communities.

Recent studies show that recruitment of single enzymes from different pathways could be the driving force for pathway evolution. Other mechanisms of evolution. such as pathway duplication. enzyme specialization. de novo invention of pathways or retro-evolution of pathways. appear to be less abundant. Twenty percent of enzyme superfamilies are quite variable. not only in changing reaction chemistry or metabolite type but in changing both at the same time. These variable superfamilies account for nearly half of all known reactions. The most frequently occurring metabolites provide a helping hand for such changes because they can be accommodated by many enzyme superfamilies.

10089500,Quantification of insect genome divergence,2007,Evgeny M Zdobnov and Peer Bork,23,,1,16-20,Elsevier Current Trends,The recent sequencing of twelve insect genomes has enabled us to quantify their divergence using synteny conservation and sequence identity of single-copy orthologs. Protein identity correlates well with synteny and is about three times more conserved. an observation consistent with comparisons among vertebrates. The observed distribution of the lengths of synteny blocks follows a power law and differs from the expectations of the currently accepted random breakage model.

However. screening new drug combinations exhaustively is impractical considering all possible combinations between drugs. Here. we present a novel computational approach to predict drug combinations by integrating molecular and pharmacological data. Specifically. drugs are represented by a set of their properties. such as their targets or indications. By integrating several of these features. we show that feature patterns enriched in approved drug combinations are not only predictive for new drug combinations but also provide insights into mechanisms underlying combinatorial therapy. Further analysis confirmed that among our top ranked predictions of effective combinations. 69% are supported by literature. while the others represent novel potential drug combinations.

10089504,LotuS: an efficient and user-friendly OTU processing pipeline,2014,Falk Hildebrand and Raul Tadeo and Anita Yvonne Voigt and Peer Bork and Jeroen Raes,2,Microbiome,1,1-7,BioMed Central,16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicon sequencing is frequently used to analyse the structure of bacterial communities from oceans to the human microbiota. However. computational power is still a major bottleneck in the analysis of continuously enlarging metagenomic data sets. Analysis is further complicated by the technical complexity of current bioinformatics tools. Here we present the less operational taxonomic units scripts (LotuS). a fast and user-friendly open-source tool to calculate denoised. chimera-checked. operational taxonomic units (OTUs). These are the basis to generate taxonomic abundance tables and phylogenetic trees from multiplexed. next-generation sequencing data (454. illumina MiSeq and HiSeq). LotuS is outstanding in its execution speed. as it can process 16S rDNA data up to two orders of magnitude faster than other existing pipelines. This is partly due to an included stand-alone fast simultaneous demultiplexer and quality filter C++ program. simple demultiplexer (sdm). which comes packaged with LotuS. Additionally. we sequenced two MiSeq runs with the intent to validate future pipelines by sequencing 40 technical replicates; these are made available in this work. We show that LotuS analyses microbial 16S data with comparable or even better results than existing pipelines. requiring a fraction of the execution time and providing state-of-the-art denoising and phylogenetic reconstruction.

To find potential targets for drugs active against pathogenic bacteria. we have searched all completely sequenced genomes of pathogenic bacteria for genes relevant for iron transport. We identified a protein domain that appears in variable copy number in bacterial genes that are usually in the vicinity of a putative Fe3+ siderophore transporter. Accordingly. we have denoted this domain NEAT for 'near transporter'. Most of the bacterial species containing this domain are pathogenic. Sequence features indicate that the domain is anchored to the extracellular side of the membrane. The domain seems to be under high selective pressure for rapid independent duplications that are typical of sequences involved in signaling and binding. The NEAT domain might be functionally related to iron transport.

Here we show that TSG101. a gene subjected to somatic mutations in breast cancer. contains an amino terminal domain that is a homologue of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (UBCs) and not. as previously proposed. DNA-binding domains. As the UBC active site residue is replaced in the TSG101 sequence in a similar manner to several other members of the UBC family. we propose a role for TSG101 in regulating the ubiquitination of short-lived gene products.,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,121,https://europepmc.org/article/med/9253709,17141249663713750304,/scholar?cites=17141249663713750304,,,0,0,0

In its unusual architecture. the F2 3′ UTR contains an upstream sequence element (USE) that compensates for weak activities of the non‐canonical cleavage site and the downstream U‐rich element. Here. we address the mechanism of USE function. We show that the F2 USE contains a highly conserved nonameric core sequence. which promotes 3′ end formation in a position‐ and sequence‐dependent manner. We identify proteins that specifically interact with the USE. and demonstrate their function as trans‐acting factors that promote 3′ end formation. Interestingly. these include the splicing factors U2AF35. U2AF65 and hnRNPI.

Although many mitochondrial proteins have been identified. understanding their functional interrelationships has been a challenge. Here we construct a comprehensive network of the mitochondrial system. We integrated genome-wide datasets to generate an accurate and inclusive mitochondrial parts list. Together with benchmarked measures of protein interactions. a network of mitochondria was constructed in their cellular context. including extra-mitochondrial proteins. This network also integrates data from different organisms to expand the known mitochondrial biology beyond the information in the existing databases. Our network brings together annotated and predicted functions into a single framework. This enabled. for the entire system. a survey of mutant phenotypes. gene regulation. evolution. and disease susceptibility. Furthermore. we experimentally validated the localization of several candidate proteins and derived novel functional contexts for hundreds of uncharacterized proteins.

Upon carbon source limitation during sporulation. the number of haploid spores formed per cell is reduced. We show that precise spore number control (SNC) fulfills two functions. SNC maximizes the production of spores (1–4) that are formed by a single cell. This is regulated by the concentration of three structural meiotic SPB components. which is dependent on available amounts of carbon source. Using experiments and computer simulation. we show that the molecular mechanism relies on a self-organizing system. which is able to generate particular patterns (different numbers of spores) in dependency on one single stimulus (gradually increasing amounts of SPB constituents).

However. the role of most of these RNAs remains unknown. and there is an ongoing discussion as to what extent these transcripts are the result of transcriptional noise. We show. by comparative transcriptomics of 20 bacterial species and one chloroplast. that the number of asRNAs is exponentially dependent on the genomic AT content and that expression of asRNA at low levels exerts little impact in terms of energy consumption. A transcription model simulating mRNA and asRNA production indicates that the asRNA regulatory effect is only observed above certain expression thresholds. substantially higher than physiological transcript levels.

The functional impact of resulting mutations depends on their genomic localization. Alterations within coding mononucleotide repeat tracts (MNRs) can lead to protein truncation and formation of neopeptides. whereas alterations within untranslated MNRs can alter transcription level or transcript stability. These mutations may provide selective advantage or disadvantage to affected cells.

However. protein complexes. the basic functional modules of a cell. have been so far mostly considered as static entities with well-defined structures. The co-expression of their members has not been systematically charted at the protein level. We used measurements of protein abundance across 11 cell types and five temporal states to analyze the co-expression and the compositional variations of 182 well-characterized protein complexes. We show that although the abundance of protein complex members is generally co-regulated. a considerable fraction of all investigated protein complexes is subject to stoichiometric changes. Compositional variation is most frequently seen in complexes involved in chromatin regulation and cellular transport. and often involves paralog switching as a mechanism for the regulation of complex stoichiometry. We demonstrate that compositional signatures of variable protein complexes have discriminative power beyond individual cell states and can distinguish cancer cells from healthy ones. Our work demonstrates that many protein complexes contain variable members that cause distinct stoichometries and functionally fine-tune complexes spatiotemporally. Only a fraction of these compositional variations is mediated by changes in transcription and other mechanisms regulating protein abundance contribute to determine protein complex stoichiometries.

A priori. they are thus less likely to be essential. Although this was indeed observed in yeast. mouse singletons and duplicates were reported to be equally often essential.

At a given phyletic gene age. duplicates are always less likely to be essential compared with singletons.

Indeed it has been proposed to have occurred in only a few genes and implies a rare. probably not advantageous event in which an ortholog displaces the original gene and has to function in a foreign context (orthologous gene displacement. OGD). Here. we have utilised an automatic method to identify HGT based on a conservative statistical approach capable of robustly assigning both donors and acceptors. Applied to 40 universally single copy genes we found that as many as 68 HGTs (implying OGDs) have occurred in these genes with a rate of 1.7 per family since the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). We examined a number of factors that have been claimed to be fundamental to HGT in general and tested their validity in the subset of universally distributed single copy genes. We found that differing functional constraints impact rates of OGD and the more evolutionarily distant the donor and acceptor. the less likely an OGD is to occur. Furthermore. species with larger genomes are more likely to be subjected to OGD.

10089628,Large gene overlaps in prokaryotic genomes: result of functional constraints or mispredictions?,2008,Albert Pallejà and Eoghan D Harrington and Peer Bork,9,BMC genomics,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Across the fully sequenced microbial genomes there are thousands of examples of overlapping genes. Many of these are only a few nucleotides long and are thought to function by permitting the coordinated regulation of gene expression. However. there should also be selective pressure against long overlaps. as the existence of overlapping reading frames increases the risk of deleterious mutations. Here we examine the longest overlaps and assess whether they are the product of special functional constraints or of erroneous annotation. We analysed the genes that overlap by 60 bps or more among 338 fully-sequenced prokaryotic genomes. The likely functional significance of an overlap was determined by comparing each of the genes to its respective orthologs. If a gene showed a significantly different length from its orthologs it was considered unlikely to be functional and therefore the result of an error either in sequencing or gene prediction. Focusing on 715 co-directional overlaps longer than 60 bps. we classified the erroneous ones into five categories: i) 5'-end extension of the downstream gene due to either a mispredicted start codon or a frameshift at 5'-end of the gene (409 overlaps). ii) fragmentation of a gene caused by a frameshift (163). iii) 3'-end extension of the upstream gene due to either a frameshift at 3'-end of a gene or point mutation at the stop codon (68). iv) Redundant gene predictions (4). v) 5' & 3'-end extension which is a combination of i) and iii) (71). We also studied 75 divergent overlaps that could be classified as misannotations of group i).

The argument is based on the observation that gene phylogenies are rarely consistent with one another because. among others. of lateral gene transfer (LGT). Creating phylogenies from sequence data in which an organism is described exactly as the sum of its genes is not. however. the only approach (2). Rather than creating phylogenies based on sequence identity for separate genes. this alternative creates a distance-based phylogeny at the genome level by comparing the fraction of genes shared between genomes (2). The resulting phylogeny (Fig. 1) of completely sequenced genomes (for an overview. see http://www. tigr. org/tdb/tdb. html) is remarkably similar to the phylogenies that are based on 16S ribosomal RNA (3). Not only is the trichotomy between Eukarya.

This method does not resolve the major branchings of the Bacteria. but neither do the phylogenies based on sequences that do not show LGT resolve this part of Bacterial phylogeny with a high degree of confidence.

10089647,A trefoil domain in the major rabbit zona pellucida protein.,1993,Peer Bork,2,Protein science: a publication of the Protein Society,4,669,Wiley-Blackwell,Many extracellular proteins consist of various domains (modules) that often have defined binding functions (Bork. 1992). One of these modules is the so-called “trefoil” or P-domain (Thim. 1989; Tomasetto et al.. 1990). which has a characteristic pattern of six conserved cysteines in a trefoil-like arrangement (Thim. 1989; Carr. 1992). This module has been described in several proteins (summarized in Fig. 1A) that have diverse biological activities. and it has been found in up to six copies per protein (Hauser & Hoffmann. 1992).

The tool uses as input nucleotide sequence alignments to reference genomes in standard SAM/BAM format. performs SNV calling for individual samples and across the whole data set. and generates various statistics for individual species including allele frequencies and nucleotide diversity per sample as well as distances and fixation indices across samples. Using published data from 676 metagenomic samples of different sites in the oral cavity. we show that the results of metaSNV are comparable to those of MIDAS. an alternative implementation for metagenomic SNV analysis. while data processing is faster and has a smaller storage footprint. Moreover. we implement a set of distance measures that allow the comparison of genomic variation across metagenomic samples and delineate sample-specific variants to enable the tracking of specific strain populations over time.

Expression of bacterial tssRNAs requires factors other than the standard RNA polymerase holoenzyme. We have found that the RNA polymerase is halted at tssRNA positions in vivo. which may indicate that a pausing mechanism exists to prevent transcription in the absence of genes.

The functional coverage of protein sequences can be investigated using computational methods. especially given the massive amount of data being generated by large-scale environmental sequencing (metagenomics). In completely sequenced genomes. the fraction of proteins to which at least some functional features can be assigned has recently risen to as much as ∼85%.

The numerous examples of the mechanisms and functional implications of these events are scattered throughout the scientific literature. Thus. it is crucial to have a tool that can automatically extract the relevant facts and collect them in a knowledge base that can aid the interpretation of data from high-throughput methods. We have developed and applied a composite text-mining method for extracting information on transcript diversity from the entire MEDLINE database in order to create a database of genes with alternative transcripts. It contains information on tissue specificity. number of isoforms. causative mechanisms. functional implications. and experimental methods used for detection. We have mined this resource to identify 959 instances of tissue-specific splicing. Our results in combination with those from EST-based methods suggest that alternative splicing is the preferred mechanism for generating transcript diversity in the nervous system. We provide new annotations for 1.860 genes with the potential for generating transcript diversity. We assign the MeSH term “alternative splicing” to 1.536 additional abstracts in the MEDLINE database and suggest new MeSH terms for other events.

With Chaetomium thermophilum. Thielavia terrestris and Thielavia heterothallica three genome sequences of thermophilic eukaryotes have been published. Studying the genomes and proteomes of these thermophilic fungi. we found common strategies of thermal adaptation across the different kingdoms of Life. including amino acid biases and a reduced genome size. A phylogenetics-guided comparison of thermophilic proteomes with those of other. mesophilic Sordariomycetes revealed consistent amino acid substitutions associated to thermophily that were also present in an independent lineage of thermophilic fungi. The most consistent pattern is the substitution of lysine by arginine. which we could find in almost all lineages but has not been extensively used in protein stability engineering. By exploiting mutational paths towards the thermophiles. we could predict particular amino acid residues in individual proteins that contribute to thermostability and validated some of them experimentally. By determining the three-dimensional structure of an exemplar protein from C. thermophilum (Arx1). we could also characterise the molecular consequences of some of these mutations.

Methodology/Principal Findings We have estimated frequencies of type I PKS (PKS I) – a PKS subgroup – in natural environments by using Hidden-Markov-Models of eight domains to screen predicted proteins from six metagenomic shotgun data sets. As the complex PKS I have similarities to other multi-domain enzymes (like those for the fatty acid biosynthesis) we increased the reliability and resolution of the dataset by maximum-likelihood trees. The combined information of these trees was then used to discriminate true PKS I domains from evolutionary related but functionally different ones. We were able to identify numerous novel PKS I proteins. the highest density of which was found in Minnesota farm soil with 136 proteins out of 183.536 predicted genes. We also applied the protocol to UniRef database to improve the annotation of proteins with so far unknown function and identified some new instances of horizontal gene transfer.

Ltd,Ever since the 1950s. when research and engineering in the USA and. to a lesser extent. in the UK. started to expand dramatically. English has been the lingua franca of the scientific community (Garfield. 1998). As a consequence. many scientists all over the world are now obliged to describe their research and discuss their results in a language that is not their mother tongue. This clearly affects the communication of science in the worldwide academic community. because the way a researcher writes in English depends largely on his or her familiarity with the language. For the sake of communicating science. the scientific community has to allow certain unavoidable differences in style. provided they are within the bounds of English grammar. But a scientist is not expected to be either a professional writer or a translator. Furthermore. there is no standard scientific English against which to compare a text. so it is …,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC,39,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/sj.embor.embor833,2533485525564540270,/scholar?cites=2533485525564540270,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/sj.embor.embor833,0,0,0

A substantial part of cellular resources is spent on making nucleotides. We thus expect preferential use of cheaper nucleotides especially in transcribed sequences. which are often amplified thousand-fold compared with genomic sequences. To test this hypothesis. we derive a mutation-selection-drift equilibrium model for nucleotide skews (strand-specific usage of ‘A’versus ‘T’and ‘G’versus ‘C’). which explains nucleotide skews across 1.550 prokaryotic genomes as a consequence of selection on efficient resource usage. Transcription-related selection generally favours the cheaper nucleotides ‘U’and ‘C’at synonymous sites. However. the information encoded in mRNA is further amplified through translation. Due to unexpected trade-offs in the codon table. cheaper nucleotides encode on average energetically more expensive amino acids. These trade-offs …,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:ybfzIt2tCtgC,38,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11334,12532521523985942599,/scholar?cites=12532521523985942599,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11334,0,0,0

However. the relationship between social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform. and therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five observation hives. in which all workers were matched in age and observed the behaviour of marked bees in each colony over 4 days.

Here we study the extent of gene duplicates that might compensate genes causing monogenic diseases. We provide evidence for pervasive functional redundancy of human monogenic disease genes (MDs) by duplicates by manifesting 1) genes involved in human genetic disorders are enriched in duplicates and 2) duplicated disease genes tend to have higher functional similarities with their closest paralogs in contrast to duplicated non-disease genes of similar age. We propose that functional compensation by duplication of genes masks the phenotypic effects of deleterious mutations and reduces the probability of purging the defective genes from the human population; this functional compensation could be further enhanced by higher purification selection between disease genes and their duplicates as well as their orthologous counterpart compared to non-disease genes. However. due to the intrinsic expression stochasticity among individuals. the deleterious mutations could still be present as genetic diseases in some subpopulations where the duplicate copies are expressed at low abundances. Consequently the defective genes are linked to genetic disorders while they continue propagating within the population. Our results provide insight into the molecular basis underlying the spreading of duplicated disease genes.,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:N4u4nq0IxgcC,37,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073,13117023362377215519,/scholar?cites=13117023362377215519,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003073,0,0,0

The method is fully automatic. does not require prealigned sequences. is insensitive to redundancy in the training set. and works surprisingly well even with small learning sets. Because it uses unsupervised neural networks. it is able to extract patterns that are not present in all of the unaligned sequences of the learning set. The identification of these patterns in sequence databases is sensitive and efficient.The procedure comprises three main training stages. In the first stage. one SOM is trained to extract common features from the set of unaligned learning sequences.

Inc.,High‐throughput studies of microbial communities suggest that Archaea are a widespread component of microbial diversity in various ecosystems. However. proper quantification of archaeal diversity and community ecology remains limited. as sequence coverage of Archaea is usually low owing to the inability of available prokaryotic primers to efficiently amplify archaeal compared to bacterial rRNA genes. To improve identification and quantification of Archaea. we designed and validated the utility of several primer pairs to efficiently amplify archaeal 16S rRNA genes based on up‐to‐date reference genes.

The results suggest that phosphorylation sites on globular. as distinct from disordered. parts of the proteome frequently function as switches. which might be one of the ancient roles for kinase phosphorylation.,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:jKT558fuBk8C,26,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005462,17726062876785698202,/scholar?cites=17726062876785698202,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005462,0,0,0

For continuous cell functioning. EGFR plasma membrane levels are                    maintained by transporting newly synthesized EGFRs to the cell surface. The                    regulation of this process is largely unknown. In this study. we find that EGF                    stimulation specifically increases the transport efficiency of newly synthesized                    EGFRs from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This coincides with                    an up-regulation of the inner coat protein complex II (COPII) components SEC23B.                    SEC24B. and SEC24D. which we show to be specifically required for EGFR                    transport.

Here we report a comparative analysis of overlaps between genes coding for well-annotated proteins in five metazoan genomes (human. mouse. zebrafish. fruit fly and worm). For all analyzed species the observed number of overlapping genes is always lower than expected assuming functional neutrality. suggesting that gene overlap is negatively selected. The comparison to the random distribution also shows that retained overlaps do not exhibit random features: antiparallel overlaps are significantly enriched. while overlaps lying on the same strand and those involving coding sequences are highly underrepresented. We confirm that overlap is mostly species-specific and provide evidence that it frequently originates through the acquisition of terminal. non …,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C,26,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-9-174,11971814010427398172,/scholar?cites=11971814010427398172,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-9-174,0,0,0

Here. we present proteome-wide atlases of age-associated alterations in human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPCs) and five other cell populations that constitute the bone marrow niche. For each. the abundance of a large fraction of the~ 12.000 proteins identified is assessed in 59 human subjects from different ages. As the HPCs become older. pathways in central carbon metabolism exhibit features reminiscent of the Warburg effect. where glycolytic intermediates are rerouted towards anabolism. Simultaneously. altered abundance of early regulators of HPC differentiation reveals a reduced functionality and a bias towards myeloid differentiation. Ageing causes alterations in the bone marrow niche too. and diminishes the functionality of the pathways involved in HPC …,True,M6Etr6oAAAAJ:ZOYfmFL0FrgC,25,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06353-4,2543666351690439915,/scholar?cites=2543666351690439915,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06353-4,0,0,0
