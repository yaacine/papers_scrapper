117474,TNFα and the TNF receptor superfamily: Structure‐function relationship (s),2000,Haitham T Idriss and James H Naismith,50,,3,184-195,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNFα). is an inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages/monocytes during acute inflammation and is responsible for a diverse range of signalling events within cells. leading to necrosis or apoptosis. The protein is also important for resistance to infection and cancers. TNFα exerts many of its effects by binding. as a trimer. to either a 55 kDa cell membrane receptor termed TNFR‐1 or a 75 kDa cell membrane receptor termed TNFR‐2. Both these receptors belong to the so‐called TNF receptor superfamily. The superfamily includes FAS. CD40. CD27. and RANK. The defining trait of these receptors is an extra cellular domain comprised of two to six repeats of cysteine rich motifs. Additionally. a number of structurally related “decoy receptors” exist that act to sequester TNF molecules. thereby rescuing cells from apoptosis. The crystal structures of TNFα.

117476,An efficient one-step site-directed deletion. insertion. single and multiple-site plasmid mutagenesis protocol,2008,Huanting Liu and James H Naismith,8,BMC biotechnology,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Mutagenesis plays an essential role in molecular biology and biochemistry. It has also been used in enzymology and protein science to generate proteins which are more tractable for biophysical techniques. The ability to quickly and specifically mutate a residue(s) in protein is important for mechanistic and functional studies. Although many site-directed mutagenesis methods have been developed. a simple. quick and multi-applicable method is still desirable. We have developed a site-directed plasmid mutagenesis protocol that preserved the simple one step procedure of the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis but enhanced its efficiency and extended its capability for multi-site mutagenesis. This modified protocol used a new primer design that promoted primer-template annealing by eliminating primer dimerization and also permitted the newly synthesized DNA to be used as the template in subsequent amplification cycles. These two factors we believe are the main reasons for the enhanced amplification efficiency and for its applications in multi-site mutagenesis. Our modified protocol significantly increased the efficiency of single mutation and also allowed facile large single insertions. deletions/truncations and multiple mutations in a single experiment. an option incompatible with the standard QuikChange™. Furthermore the new protocol required significantly less parental DNA which facilitated the DpnI digestion after the PCR amplification and enhanced the overall efficiency and reliability. Using our protocol. we generated single site. multiple single-site mutations and a combined insertion/deletion mutations.

We found that RNF4 bound ubiquitin-charged UbcH5a tightly but free UbcH5a weakly. To provide insight into the mechanism of RING-mediated ubiquitylation. we docked the UbcH5~ ubiquitin thioester onto the RNF4 RING structure. This revealed that with E2 bound to one monomer of RNF4. the thioester-linked ubiquitin could reach across the dimer to engage the other monomer. In this model. the'Ile44 hydrophobic patch'of ubiquitin is predicted to engage a conserved tyrosine located at the dimer interface of the RING. and mutation of these residues blocked ubiquitylation activity. Thus. dimeric RING ligases are not simply inert scaffolds that bring substrate and E2-loaded ubiquitin into close proximity.

To establish the proteolytic mechanism. we determined structures of catalytically inactive SENP1 bound to SUMO-1–modified RanGAP1 and to unprocessed SUMO-1. In each case. the scissile peptide bond is kinked at a right angle to the C-terminal tail of SUMO-1 and has the cis configuration of the amide nitrogens. SENP1 preferentially processes SUMO-1 over SUMO-2. but binding thermodynamics of full-length SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 to SENP1 and K m values for processing are very similar.

Although NEDD8 and ubiquitin are highly related in sequence and structure. their attachment to a protein leads to different biological effects. It is therefore critical that NEDP1 discriminates between NEDD8 and ubiquitin. and this requires remarkable precision in molecular recognition. To determine the basis of this specificity. we have determined the crystal structure of NEDP1 in isolation and in a transition state complex with NEDD8. This reveals that NEDP1 is a cysteine protease of the Ulp family.

To determine the amount of useful information about TCR repertoire function encoded within αβ pairings. we analyzed paired TCR sequences from nearly 100.000 unique CD4+ and CD8+ T cells captured using two different high-throughput. single-cell sequencing approaches. Our results demonstrate little overlap in the healthy CD4+ and CD8+ repertoires. with shared TCR sequences possessing significantly shorter CDR3 sequences corresponding to higher generation probabilities. We further utilized tools from information theory and machine learning to show that while α and β chains are only weakly associated with lineage. αβ pairings appear to synergistically drive TCR- MHC interactions. Vαβ gene pairings were found to be the TCR feature most informative of T cell lineage. supporting the existence of germline-encoded paired αβ TCR-MHC interaction motifs. Finally. annotating our TCR pairs using a database of sequences with known antigen specificities. we demonstrate that up to a third of paired TCR chains recognized different antigens and suggest that αβ pairing is useful for the accurate inference of repertoire functionality.

However. the initial events that link antigen recognition to T cell signal transduction remain unclear. Here we show. via fluorescence-based experiments and structural analyses. that MHC-restricted antigen recognition by the αβ TCR results in a specific conformational change confined to the A-B loop within the α chain of the constant domain (Cα). The apparent affinity constant of this A-B loop movement mirrored that of αβ TCR-pMHC ligation and was observed in two αβ TCRs with distinct pMHC specificities. The Ag-induced A-B loop conformational change could be inhibited by fixing the juxtapositioning of the constant domains and was shown to be reversible upon pMHC disassociation.

117656,Changes in the zein composition of protein bodies during maize endosperm development.,1989,Craig R Lending and Brian A Larkins,1,The Plant Cell,10,1011-1023,American Society of Plant Biologists,Zeins. the seed storage proteins of maize. are synthesized during endosperm development by membrane-bound polyribosomes and transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. where they assemble into protein bodies. To better understand the distribution of the various zeins throughout the endosperm. and within protein bodies. we used immunolocalization techniques with light and electron microscopy to study endosperm tissue at 14 days and 18 days after pollination. Protein bodies increase in size with distance from the aleurone layer of the developing endosperm; this reflects a process of cell maturation. The protein bodies within the subaleurone cell layer are the smallest and contain little or no alpha-zein; beta-zein and gamma-zein are distributed throughout these small protein bodies.

This process is common in plants and animals. especially in tissues with high metabolic activity. and it generally occurs in cells that are terminally differentiated. In plants. endoreduplication is well documented in the endosperm and cotyledons of developing seeds. but it also occurs in many tissues throughout the plant. It is thought that endoreduplication provides a mechanism to increase the level of gene expression. but the function of this process has not been thoroughly investigated. Numerous observations have been made of endoreduplication. or at least extra cycles of S‐phase. as a consequence of mutations in genes controlling several aspects of cell cycle regulation.

For most grass crop species (ie cereals). the value of the crop is largely determined by the endosperm. both in quantitative and qualitative terms.The endosperm is the result of the fertilization of two polar nuclei in the central cell of the embryo sac by one sperm cell nucleus. which generates a triploid (3n. 3C) nucleus. whereas the diploid (2n. 2C) embryo originates from fertilization of the egg cell by the second sperm cell nucleus. The main function of the endosperm is to provide nutrients to the developing and. later. germinating embryo.

Given the potential benefits of widespread use of QPM. research to better understand the genetic and biochemical mechanisms responsible for its altered kernel texture and protein quality is important. Recent investigations into the improved protein quality of the opaque2 mutant and the genetic mechanisms that can suppress its starchy kernel phenotype provide new insights to support the continued improvement of QPM.

117665,Efficient procedure for extracting maize and sorghum kernel proteins reveals higher prolamin contents than the conventional method.,1995,BR Hamaker and AA Mohamed and JE Habben and CP Huang and BA Larkins,,Cereal chemistry,,,,A new method to separate maize proteins into zein (prolamin) and nonzein classes was used to quantitatively measure the prolamins (zein and kafirin) and nonprolamins in five maize and sorghum genotypes. Some 90-95% of protein was extracted using a pH 10 buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Ethanol or t-butanol was added to the maize and sorghum extracts at 70 or 60%. respectively. to precipitate nonprolamin proteins; those remaining in solution were prolamins. The amount of protein in these fractions was compared to that obtained with the conventional Landry-Moureaux method which uses aqueous alcohol plus 0.6% 2-mercaptoethanol as the extraction solvent. Using this new method. zein contents of 50-60% of total protein were found for maize whole grain flours. with 62-74% zein endosperm alone. Kafirin contents were 68-73% in sorghum whole grain flours. and 77-82% in sorghum endosperm. Prolamin nonprolamin fractions were judged to be pure based on SDS-PAGE. Zein contents determined by the new method were between 5-12% higher than those obtained by the conventional procedure; kafirin contents 12-22% higher.

117677,The prolamins of maize,1999,Craig E Coleman and Brian A Larkins,,,,109-139,Springer. Dordrecht,Prolamins are the principal seed storage proteins of cereals. These proteins are soluble in alcohol and function in storage of nitrogen and amino acids for the germinating seedling (Osborne. 1908; Osborne and Mendel. 1914). Maize prolamins are called zeins. and they form accretions or protein bodies within the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of endosperm cells. Zeins are structurally distinct from the prolamins of the more distantly related cereals. wheat. barley. oats and rice (see chapters 3. 4 and 5). but they are very similar to the prolamins of the other panacoid cereals. e.g. sorghum. millet and Coix (see chapter 7).,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,159,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-4431-5_6,15634291684236110575,/scholar?cites=15634291684236110575,,,0,0,0

Although the role of endoreduplication is unclear. it is thought to provide a mechanism that increases cell size and enhances gene expression. To investigate this process. we reduced endoreduplication in transgenic maize endosperm by ectopically expressing a gene encoding a dominant negative mutant form of cyclin-dependent kinase A.

The mutation is semidominant and is associated with small. irregularly shaped protein bodies. elevated levels of a 70-kDa chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum. and a novel 24-kDa polypeptide in the zein fraction. The 24-kDa polypeptide is a precursor of a 22-kDa α-zein protein that is not properly processed. The defect is due to an alanine-to-valine substitution at the C-terminal position of the signal peptide. which causes the protein to be anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum.

In Arabidopsis. comprehensive knockout collections were generated by amplifying and sequencing genomic DNA flanking insertion mutants. These Flanking Sequence Tags (FSTs) map each mutant to a specific locus within the genome. In maize. FSTs have been generated using DNA transposons. Transposable elements can generate unstable insertions that are difficult to analyze for simple knockout phenotypes. Transposons can also generate somatic insertions that fail to segregate in subsequent generations. Transposon insertion sites from 106 UniformMu FSTs were tested for inheritance by locus-specific PCR. We confirmed 89% of the FSTs to be germinal transposon insertions. We found no evidence for somatic insertions within the 11% of insertion sites that were not confirmed. Instead. this subset of insertion sites had errors in locus-specific primer design due to incomplete or low-quality genomic sequences. The locus-specific PCR assays identified a knockout of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that co-segregates with a seed mutant phenotype. The mutant phenotype linked to this knockout generates novel hypotheses about the role for the plastid-localized oxidative pentose phosphate pathway during grain-fill.

Etiolated seedling (490) and membrane-free polysomal endosperm cDNA clones (576) were evaluated for their transcription levels by hybridizing with a probe prepared from total mRNA and categorized as corresponding to abundantly or rarely expressed mRNAs and as either constitutive or tissue-specific. A total of 313 clones from the two libraries were submitted to ‘single-pass’ sequencing from the presumed 5′ end of the mRNA and the nucleotide sequence compared with the GenBank database. About 61% of the clones showed no significant similarities within GenBank. 14% of the clones exhibited a high degree of similarity. while the remaining 25% exhibited a lesser degree of …,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,114,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00040691.pdf,4796491780991527949,/scholar?cites=4796491780991527949,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris_Baysdorfer/publication/15387176_Partial_sequencing_and_mapping_of_clones_from_two_maize_cDNA_libraries/links/577aba7308ae213761c9c269/Partial-sequencing-and-mapping-of-clones-from-two-maize-cDNA-libraries.pdf,0,0,0
117696,Seed storage proteins: characterization and biosynthesis,1981,BRIAN A LARKINS,,,,449-489,Academic Press,This chapter discusses characterization and biosynthesis of seed storage protein. The storage proteins of seeds are an important group of plant proteins that provide nitrogen and amino acids in the germinating seedling. and constitute a major source of protein for human and livestock consumption. The large quantities of these proteins make the study of their synthesis particularly attractive as a model for the regulation of genetic expression. On the average. cereal seeds contain 10% protein. while legume seeds contain approximately 30% protein. The major storage proteins of most cereals are alcohol-soluble prolamines. but they are salt-soluble globulins in legumes. There are differences in protein structure and amino acid composition associated with the different solubility properties of these proteins. The prolamines of most cereals contain very little lysine and tryptophan. while the storage …,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,114,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126754063500177,17910344903024385920,/scholar?cites=17910344903024385920,,,0,0,0

Lysine codons and lysine- and tryptophan-encoding oligonucleotides were introduced at several positions into a 19-kilodalton zein complementary DNA by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. A 450-base pair open reading frame from a simian virus 40 (SV40) coat protein was also engineered into the zein coding region. Messenger RNAs for the modified zeins were synthesized in vitro with an SP6 RNA polymerase system and injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The modifications did not affect the translation. signal peptide cleavage. or stability of the zeins. The ability of the modified zeins to assemble into structures similar to maize protein bodies was assayed by two criteria: assembly into membrane-bound vesicles resistant to exogenously added protease. and ability to self-aggregate into dense …,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,113,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/240/4852/662.abstract,4053171423729492119,/scholar?cites=4053171423729492119,,,0,0,0

We report the cloning of Fl1. which encodes a novel zein protein body membrane protein with three predicted transmembrane domains and a C-terminal plant-specific domain of unknown function (DUF593). In wild-type endosperm. the FL1 protein accumulates at a high level during the period of zein synthesis and protein body development and declines to a low level at kernel maturity. Immunogold labeling showed that FL1 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum surrounding the protein body. Zein protein bodies in fl1 mutants are of normal size. shape. and abundance. However. mutant protein bodies ectopically accumulate 22-kD α-zeins in the γ-zein–rich periphery and center of the core. rather than their normal discrete location in a ring at outer edge of the core.

Clones from the library that were of sufficient size to be full-length or near full-length copies of zein mRNA were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and cross-hybridization analysis. Based on these comparisons we found three classes of zein sequences corresponding to proteins of Mr 22.000. five corresponding to proteins of Mr 19.000. and a single one corresponding to a protein of Mr 15.000. Representative clones from these nine groups were used as probes to measure levels of the corresponding mRNAs in developing endosperms. It was found that these groups represent varying amounts of transcripts that range from 2 to 20% of the total endosperm mRNA population. For the Mr 19.000 and Mr 22.000 zein clones there is a correlation between the …,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,108,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817362579,7769159018118221864,/scholar?cites=7769159018118221864,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817362579/pdf?md5=1050bc08d063f6283e454bbedd1e0616&pid=1-s2.0-S0021925817362579-main.pdf,0,0,0

In older interphase cells actively forming starch grains and protein bodies. the protein bodies are enmeshed in EF-1[alpha] and actin and are found juxtaposed with a multidirectional array of microtubules. Actin and EF-1[alpha] appear to exist in a complex. because we observed that the two are colocalized. and treatment with cytochalasin D resulted in the redistribution of EF-1[alpa]. These data suggest that EF-1[alpha] and actin are associated in maize endosperm cells and may help to explain the basis of the correlation we found between the concentration of EF-1[alpha] and lysine content. The data also support the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton plays a role in storage protein deposition …,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,107,http://www.plantcell.org/content/8/11/2003.short,9180447347178929815,/scholar?cites=9180447347178929815,,http://www.plantcell.org/content/plantcell/8/11/2003.full.pdf,0,0,0

The opaque2 mutation in maize doubles the lysine content in the endosperm. but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We show that elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is overexpressed in opaque2 endosperm compared with its normal counterpart and that there is a highly significant correlation between EF-1 alpha concentration and the total lysine content of the endosperm. This relationship is also true for two other cereals. sorghum and barley. It appears that genetic selection for genotypes with a high concentration of EF-1 alpha can significantly improve the nutritional quality of maize and other cereals.,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,105,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/19/8640.short,2029416540007617697,/scholar?cites=2029416540007617697,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/92/19/8640.full.pdf,0,0,0

Genetic analysis of F2 segregating seeds from crosses of opaque2 by modified opaque2 genotypes indicated that the modifiers are complex traits that act codominantly. We developed two different segregating F2 populations and mapped the modifier loci by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. A relationship was found between formation of vitreous endosperm and the locus encoding the gamma-zein storage protein. which maps near the centromere of chromosome 7. Endosperm modification was consistently associated with the presence of two rather than one gamma-zein gene at this locus. A second modifier locus was mapped near the telomere of chromosome 7L.,True,ZSbWYQQAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,105,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00290352,16214582639613482537,/scholar?cites=16214582639613482537,,,0,0,0
