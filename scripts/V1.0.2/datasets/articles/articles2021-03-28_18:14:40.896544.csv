1263328,Large eddy simulation of a two-phase reacting swirl flow inside a cement cyclone,2014,Hrvoje Mikulčić and Milan Vujanović and Neven Duić,75,Energy,,89-96,Pergamon,This work presents a numerical study of the highly swirled gas–solid flow inside a cement cyclone. The computational fluid dynamics – CFD simulation for continuum fluid flow and heat exchange was used for the investigation. The Eulearian–Lagrangian approach was used to describe the two-phase flow. and the large eddy simulation – LES method was used for correctly obtaining the turbulent fluctuations of the gas phase. A model describing the reaction of the solid phase. e.g. the calcination process. has been developed and implemented within the commercial finite volume CFD code FIRE. Due to the fact that the calcination process has a direct influence on the overall energy efficiency of the cement production. it is of great importance to have a certain degree of limestone degradation at the cyclone's outlet.

Residual swirling flow in the tangentially-fired furnace caused flue gas velocity deviations at furnace exit. leading to flow field unevenness in the SCR (selective catalytic reduction) system and poor denitrification efficiency. Numerical simulations on the velocity field in the SCR system were carried out to determine the optimal flow deflector arrangement to improve flow field uniformity of SCR system.

The exchange bias is accompanied by a large vertical shift in magnetization. These effects are only observed when V 2 O 3 is grown on top of Ni 80 Fe 20 permalloy. The magnitude of the vertical shift is as large as 60% of the total magnetization. which has never been reported in any system. X-ray diffraction studies show that the growth conditions promote the formation of a ferrimagnetic Fe 3 O 4 interlayer. The change in the easy magnetization axis of Fe 3 O 4 across the Verwey transition at 120 K is correlated with the appearance of exchange bias and vertical shift in magnetization. Both phenomena disappear above 120 K. indicating a direct relationship between the magnetic signature of the Verwey transition and the exchange bias.,True,lu4wKLoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,28,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.134447,14422633445634830647,/scholar?cites=14422633445634830647,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4255,0,0,0

A spectral absorptance of ≥99% was attained simultaneously at multiple LWIR wavelengths. with a bandwidth of 2 μm where the absorptance is ≥90%. This remarkable behavior is attributed to the strong mixing of coupling modes between the two resonators and the ground plane in the presence of a lossy dielectric. in which single layer structures do not exhibit.

To do this. three separate cases including replace of low pressure. high pressure and both low and high pressure feed water heaters with new heat exchangers and a gas turbine have been suggested. Energy and exergy efficiencies have been used as objective functions. and cycle-tempo flow sheet software has been used to simulate the cycle of power plant. According to the obtained results. the maximum exergy efficiency has been achieved in replacement all feed water heaters with two heat recovery heat exchangers. In this case. gas turbine model westinghouse-401 is the best option; in which net energy and exergy efficiencies increase from 33.42% and 32.58% in simple cycle to 38.39% and 37.2% in repowered cycle. respectively.

1263455,Sustainable urban metabolism,2013,Paulo Ferrão and John E Fernández,,,,,MIT press,A unified framework for analyzing urban sustainability in terms of cities' inflows and outflows of matter and energy. Urbanization and globalization have shaped the last hundred years. These two dominant trends are mutually reinforcing: globalization links countries through the networked communications of urban hubs. The urban population now generates more than eighty percent of global GDP. Cities account for enormous flows of energy and materials—inflows of goods and services and outflows of waste. Thus urban environmental management critically affects global sustainability. In this book. Paulo Ferrão and John Fernández offer a metabolic perspective on urban sustainability. viewing the city as a metabolism. in terms of its exchanges of matter and energy. Their book provides a roadmap to the strategies and tools needed for a scientifically based framework for analyzing and promoting the sustainability of urban systems. Using the concept of urban metabolism as a unifying framework. Ferrão and Fernandez describe a systems-oriented approach that establishes useful linkages among environmental. economic. social. and technical infrastructure issues. These linkages lead to an integrated information-intensive platform that enables ecologically informed urban planning.

Taking Boston as an illustrative Northeast U.S. city. we developed a novel method to estimate sub-urban. food-borne carbon and land footprints using multiregion-input-output modeling and nutritional surveys. Computer simulations utilizing primary data explored UF’s ability to reduce these footprints using select farming technologies. building on previous city-scale UF assessments which have hitherto been dependent on proxy data for UF.

1263468,Towards urban resource flow estimates in data scarce environments: The case of African cities,2015,Paul Currie and Ethan Lay-Sleeper and John E Fernández and Jenny Kim and Josephine Kaviti Musango,,,,,Scientific Research Publishing,Data sourcing challenges in African nations have led many African urban infrastructure developments to be implemented with minimal scientific backing to support their success. In some cases this may directly impact a city’s ability to reach service delivery. economic growth and human development goals. let alone the city’s ability to protect ecosystem services upon which it relies. As an attempt to fill this gap. this paper describes an exploratory process used to determine city-level demographic. economic and resource flow data for African nations. The approach makes use of scaling and clustering techniques to form acceptable and utilizable representations of selected African cities. Variables that may serve as the strongest predictors for resource consumption intensity in African nations and cities were explored. in particular. the aspects of the Koppen Climate Zones. estimates of average urban income and GDP. and the influence of urban primacy.

One important use of the mechanical properties of natural fibers is tensile reinforcing and volume filler within the matrix of a composite material; cementitious. polymeric. earthen or otherwise. While natural fibers offer a widely available and in expensive source of mechanically useful cellulose. the full extent of the potential for architectural applications has not been adequately investigated. This paper presents the laboratory results of an optimised flax fiber reinforced concrete (FFRC). The mechanical results are intended as a demonstration of the use of natural fiber reinforced concretes (NFRCs) for buildings in developing regions with access to significant sources of cellulose fibers and small-scale industrial capacity to process them. Generally. the inclusion of natural fibers within a concrete matrix is intended to augment the energy absorption of the cured concrete. Specifically. an optimal ratio mix and fiber length of flax fibers in concrete was sought in obtaining the highest possible ultimate strength. toughness and crack management from the various samples. Results from mechanical laboratory testing yielded positive conclusions regarding the increased strength and toughness of the natural fiber-reinforced concrete. While strength was shown to increase with the inclusion of particular fiber lengths and decrease with others. results from the optimised formulation indicated the potential to substantially increase the flexural toughness of the concrete composite.

Despite the urban origin of global food demands. cities supply little of their own food. and are susceptible to disruptions across the global supply chain. One possible mitigation strategy to these issues is increasing food production in and around cities using urban agriculture (UA).Through a literature review. we found claims surrounding UA as a way to attenuate a cornucopia of environmental burdens due to urban food needs. but that their veracity remains inconclusive. A comprehensive analysis of the environmental performance of dominant UA forms is therefore needed.

It highlights the advantages of operating the cooling processes based on an optimal strategy. A multi-component model is developed for the entire cooling process network. The model is used to formulate and solve a multi-period optimal chiller loading problem. posed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. The results showed that an average energy savings of 8.57% could be achieved using optimal chiller loading as compared to the historical energy consumption data from the plant. The scope of the optimization problem was expanded by including a chilled water thermal storage in the cooling system.

The hybrid plant is modeled using Simulink and employs systems-level automation. Feedback control regulates net power. collector temperature. and turbine firing temperature. A base-case plant is presented. and plant design is systematically modified to improve solar energy utilization. A novel recycling configuration enables robust control of collector temperature and net power during times of high solar activity. Recycling allows for improved solar energy utilization and a yearly solar fraction over 30%. while maintaining power control. During significant solar activity. excessive collector temperature and power setpoint mismatch are still observed with the proposed recycling configuration. A storage bypass is integrated with recycling. to lower storage charging rate. This operation results in diverting only a fraction of air flow to storage. which lowers the storage charging rate and improves solar energy utilization. Recycling with a storage bypass can handle larger solar inputs and a solar fraction over 70% occurs when following a drastic peaking power load.

The bulk of these costs relate to the firms’ acquisition of very expensive backup capacity to cushion them against the even larger losses arising from frequent and long power fluctuations. Small-scale operators are more heavily affected by the infrastructure failures as they are unable to finance the cost of backup power necessary to mitigate the impact of frequent outages. The smallscale operators that could afford to back up their operations have to spend a significant proportion of their investment outlay on this. The study advocates for institutional reforms of the power supply sector in Nigeria.,True,IpliPz0AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,210,https://www.africaportal.org/publications/analysis-of-the-cost-of-infrastructure-failures-in-a-developing-economy-the-case-of-the-electricity-sector-in-nigeria/,8821890029408909585,/scholar?cites=8821890029408909585,,,https://www.africaportal.org/documents/5651/RP148.pdf,0,0,0

Utilizing the data obtained from a 1998 nationwide survey. the paper details the various costs from power outages and examines the response of manufacturers to the infrastructure problem. The findings of the study confirm that the cost of electricity failures on the Nigerian manufacturing sector is quite high. Firms incur huge costs on the provision of expensive back-up to minimise the expected outage costs. The average costs of this back-up are on the average 3 times the cost of publicly supplied electricity. The marginal cost estimates also indicate that the cost of kWh of unserved electricity in Nigeria is very high. Small-scale firms bear the greater proportion of the cost of the power failure.

Section 1.2. 2)–energy security–is a high priority of every nation. Energy security concerns are a key driving force of energy policy. These concerns relate to the robustness (sufficiency of resources. reliability of infrastructure. and stable and affordable prices); sovereignty (protection from potential threats from external agents); and resilience (the ability to withstand diverse disruptions) of energy systems. Our analysis of energy security issues in over 130 countries shows that the absolute majority of them are vulnerable from at least one of these three perspectives. For most industrial countries. energy insecurity means import dependency and aging infrastructure. while many emerging economies have additional vulnerabilities such as insufficient capacity. high energy intensity. and rapid demand growth. In many low-income countries. multiple vulnerabilities overlap. making them especially insecure.Oil and its products lack easily available substitutes in the transport sector. where they provide at least 90% of energy in almost all countries. Furthermore. the global demand for transport fuels is steadily rising. especially rapidly in Asian emerging economies. Disruptions of oil supplies may thus result in catastrophic effects on such vital functions of modern states as food production. medical care. and internal security. At the same time. the global production capacity of conventional oil is widely perceived as limited.

Oil contributed over US $391.6 billion to government revenue between 1970 and 2005. This accounted for 77.1 per cent of total government revenue over the period. Out of this amount. US $118.4 billion or 30.2 per cent was earned between 1999 and 2005. Similarly. the Nigerian economy has earned over US $593.6 billion from oil exports. representing 96.3 per cent of total foreign exchange earned between 1970 and 2005. Out of this amount. US $153.1 billion or 25.8 per cent was earned between 1999 and 2005. The country is currently experiencing its longest boom ever. Oil booms have increased the consumption levels of both the government and the ordinary citizens. albeit. these levels have not been sustained nor translated into a permanent increase in the standard of living of Nigerians. The history of oil in Nigeria has been characterized by almost an equal measure of progress and retardation. blessings and curse. hope and hopelessness. wealth and poverty and inability to translate the good luck of oil to build an efficient modern society.

The study uses firm-level panel data for the three years from 1988 to 1990. a period of considerable liberalization in the country. The data cover 382 manufacturing firms. The study shows that in general. the productivity level of Nigerian manufacturing is very low. This reflects in part an outcome of years of industrialization strategy that stressed factor accumulation rather than the efficiency with which factors are utilized. The findings from the study show that sectors with a high component of local raw materials generally performed better than those depending on imported inputs. The study also shows that foreign ownership has an important bearing on firm performance and foreign-owned firms generate positive spillover effects on the other firms in the industry. Moreover. the findings support the current trade liberalization effort of the government as we found that the policy of trade liberalization and the lowering of average tariff rates open up the economy to foreign investment. the promotion of manufactured exports impinges positively on total factor productivity in the Nigerian manufacturing sector. However. the government needs to exercise some caution with the pace of import liberalization. as import growth rate was found to have a negative impact on productivity.

Previous studies have been limited by static and partial equilibrium analysis. We use a Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium Model to analyze this issue. The more favorably affected sectors are capital intensive; therefore. capital income improves over time while land and labor income reduce. This has positive implications for urban households and negative implications for rural households due to the dependence of the latter on mostly land and labor income. As a result. urban poverty decreases in the short and long run while rural poverty increases in both periods. Policies to improve the agricultural sector will thus have to be implemented before or concurrently with trade liberalization in order for it to have a pro-poor effect. In this way. the rural areas which obtain most of their income from this sector will respond more positively to trade liberalization.,True,IpliPz0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,27,https://ideas.repec.org/p/lvl/mpiacr/2007-16.html,9454036548962370357,/scholar?cites=9454036548962370357,,,,0,0,0

Nigeria continues to experience sporadic domestic oil supply shortages. These oil shortages manifest in regular queues at fuel stations that are often empty and in thriving parallel markets that sprout all over the country. The shortages have resulted in huge economic and non-economic costs to the economy. This study investigates the causes of the shortages and provides quantitative estimates of the economic costs to the Nigerian economy using a survey and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The findings from this study show very clearly that oil sector supply shocks are costly both directly and indirectly. Oil supply shocks result in lower real GDP. higher average prices and greater balance of payment deficits. Other macroeconomic variables such as private consumption. investment. government revenue and employment also decline. In addition. the distributional impact of the quantitative energy supply shocks is higher for poor households than rich households. We also find that the sectoral impacts are mixed. often depending on the oil intensity of the sector. Finally. our survey results show that many economic agents on the demand side are willing to pay higher prices if that will guarantee a stable oil supply.

Recently. however. a considerable body of knowledge has accumulated on the importance of trade policy to the productivity process. To be sure. there are two divergent perspectives. One view posits that trade liberalization will stifle industrial productivity by opening up the economy to superior foreign products. compelling infant industries to close up. The other. and more pervasive. holds that outward-oriented trade policy will engender overall industrial efficiency in the economy by exposing local firms to competition and thereby improve the allocation of resources across sectors.

It adopts a non-parametric approach to the measurement of total factor productivity (TFP). It then specifies a regression model linking the estimated TFP growth with changes in energy use. The objective is to examine the impact of energy-pricing policy on efficiency in the manufacturing sector. The paper established that energy consumption still plays a critical role in productivity growth in the Nigerian manufacturing sector. However. the recent price reforms in the energy sector can only achieve meaningful results if accompanied by technological reforms in the manufacturing sector. The industrial sector is still dominated by old energy-inefficient technology. However. there are prospects for enhancing energy efficiency in the long run. When prices are allowed to signal the real cost of an input. producers would not only become efficient in energy use. but would also be able to select appropriate input combinations that minimised their costs of production. Long-term investment would also be committed to energy-saving equipment.

The government has realized. though belatedly. the illusion of oil wealth and that the best legacy that can be derived from oil is to use the ample financial resources it provides to restructure the economy and enhance its productivity growth. This is because productivity growth is the ultimate determinant of welfare in the long run. The late realization of this important linkage between productivity growth and welfare may have been responsible for what can be regarded as policy errors of the past. Public policy focus had over-concentrated on capital accumulation to the neglect of technical change and technical efficiency. This has undermined the contributions of the manufacturing sector and increased the pro-cyclical role of oil in the Nigerian economy.However. in examining the policies that impact on the productivity trend in Nigeria. it is important to know that. while some policies have a direct impact on productivity. others have an indirect impact.

1263557,Trade liberalization. market structure and productivity in Nigeria,1999,Adeola F Adenikinju and Louis N Chete,41,The Nigerian Journal of Economic and Social Studies,3,385-403,,The sharply contrasting growth performance between the East African economies that followed the relatively neutral export oriented trade policy. and the Latin American countries that opted for import substitution policies has provoked considerable academic interest about the role of trade liberalization in the growth process. This paper explores quantitative relationships between trade liberalization. market structures. and productivity over the period of trade liberalization in Nigeria (since 1986). Overall. the authors' findings support the current trade liberalization efforts of the government. They found that this policy fosters total factor productivity in the Nigerian manufacturing sector; however. there is a need to slow down the pace of import liberalization as the import growth rate was found to have a negative impact on productivity. While this may simply be a short-term phenomenon. it could also imply that the pace of import liberalization has proceeded too fast for domestic firms.

The increase on aviation traffic had consequences in terms of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local pollutant emissions (e.g. carbon monoxide – CO. hydrocarbons – HC. nitrogen oxides – NOx).

Providing information about expected emissions on 4 alternative routes can influence route choice of drivers. encouraging some to take more eco-friendly 5 routes. During off peak hours. when substantial capacity is available. the eco-friendly route is likely 6 to be non-changing. However. during peak periods. with limited additional capacity. the eco-7 friendliness of various routes may change. depending on traffic congestion.

A detailed analysis of storage capacity of slit pores has been performed as a function of the pore size. gas pressure (up to 100 bars) and temperature of adsorption (77 and 298 K). The H2–slit wall interaction has been modeled assuming energies of adsorption ranging from 4.5 kJ/mol (pure graphene surface) to 15 kJ/mol (hypothetical chemically modified graphene). The quantum nature of H2 has been incorporated in the calculations using the Feynman–Hibbs approach.

However. the heat of hydrogen adsorption in such materials is relatively low. in the range of about 4–8 kJ/mol. which limits the total amount of hydrogen adsorbed at P=100 bar to ∼2 wt % at room temperature and ∼8 wt % at 77 K. To improve the sorption characteristics the adsorbing surfaces must be modified either by substitution of some atoms in the all-carbon skeleton by other elements. or by doping/intercalation with other species.

These represent extra charges that in turn produce a more widely distributed current density that falls off rather slowly with distance and then drops rapidly as a result of screening by particles beyond the depletion region. We have solved numerically the self consistent Schrodinger equation in the Hartree approximation for ideal samples with small widths and sharp boundaries. and combined these results with the Wiener-Hopf technique to obtain an accurate picture of the situation for macroscopically wide samples.

We show that the presence of boron modifies the symmetry of the energy landscape. It is due to both the larger boron size (with respect to carbon) and its stronger interaction with hydrogen molecules. The changes of energy surface are not confined to the neighborhood of substituted sites but extend over several graphene carbon sites. making the surface more heterogeneous.

Although mercaptans adsorb preferentially relative to methane. the process remains reversible. provided non-oxidizing conditions are maintained. A mercaptan/methane ratio of the order of 200 ppm in the adsorbed phase is sufficient for the gas phase to have a mercaptan concentration above the human threshold for detection.

Recent theoretical structures. including occupation of nonspinel positions. are used as starting point for energy minimization. allowing for relaxation of the cell shape and the ionic positions. A comparison of simulated diffraction patterns of the present and recent theoretical and experimental structural models is presented.

Due to different kinds of interactions. different time scales appear: a long time scale associated with the dipolar interaction and a short time scale associated with the Zeeman interaction. We found that the total magnetization is not conserved; furthermore. for the non-dissipative case it is a fluctuating function of time. with a strong dependence on the strength of the dipolar term. In the dissipative case there is a transient time before the total magnetization reaches its constant value.

Experimentally. changes in the interface are evaluated by generating specific mutations at one or more points of the protein structure. Here. such an evaluation is performed by means of steered molecular dynamics and use of a dimeric model of tryptophan repressor and in-silico mutants as a test case. Analysis of four particular cases shows that. in principle. it is possible to distinguish between wild-type and mutant forms by examination of the total energy and force–extension profiles. In particular. detailed atomic level structural analysis indicates that specific mutations at the interface of the dimeric model (positions 19 and 39) alter interactions that appear in the wild-type form of tryptophan repressor. reducing the energy and force required to separate both subunits.,True,Sw5YNjUAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,13,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00249-013-0918-9.pdf,104148884496382139,/scholar?cites=104148884496382139,,,http://www.gnm.cl/gonzalo/uploads/Investigacion/EJB_GMino_2013.pdf,0,0,0

However. one of the biggest drawbacks to renewable energy generation. particularly wind-generated electricity is that it is an intermittent and a variable source of power. Even at the “best” sites wind varies dramatically from hour to hour and minute to minute. This leads to two main problems:1) When the wind drops below a lower limit or goes above a higher limit the turbine can shut down and electricity is not produced.2) Energy is not stored when there is an excess of electricity generated on site.Because of these problems wind power has a very low capacity credit and backup power is needed to handle the large fluctuation of production.This paper introduces the current energy system in Ireland and the targets that Irish operators are to achieve in the next decade.

Converting fuel directly into energy this way negates the need for the additional “combustion” to “heat” to “mechanical work” process required by conventional engines that also inherently have limited efficiency. High temperature fuel cell stacks can be designed to be thermally self sufficient while excess heat can be used to drive Stirling cycles or turbines.

1263682,At What Cost Can Renewable Hydrogen Offset Fossil Fuel Use in Ireland’s Gas Network?,2020,Tubagus Aryandi Gunawan and Alessandro Singlitico and Paul Blount and James Burchill and James G Carton and Rory FD Monaghan,13,Energies,7,1798,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The results of a techno-economic model of distributed wind-hydrogen systems (WHS) located at each existing wind farm on the island of Ireland are presented in this paper. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis from wind energy and backed up by grid electricity. compressed before temporarily stored. then transported to the nearest injection location on the natural gas network. The model employs a novel correlation-based approach to select an optimum electrolyser capacity that generates a minimum levelised cost of hydrogen production (LCOH) for each WHS. Three scenarios of electrolyser operation are studied:(1) curtailed wind.(2) available wind. and (3) full capacity operations. Additionally. two sets of input parameters are used:(1) current and (2) future techno-economic parameters. Additionally. two electricity prices are considered:(1) low and (2) high prices. A closest facility algorithm in a geographic information system (GIS) package identifies the shortest routes from each WHS to its nearest injection point. By using current parameters. results show that small wind farms are not suitable to run electrolysers under available wind operation. They must be run at full capacity to achieve sufficiently low LCOH. At full capacity. the future average LCOH is 6–8€/kg with total hydrogen production capacity of 49 kilotonnes per year. or equivalent to nearly 3% of Irish natural gas consumption. This potential will increase significantly due to the projected expansion of installed wind capacity in Ireland from 5 GW in 2020 to 10 GW in 2030.

1263685,Towards technoeconomic evaluation of renewable hydrogen production from wind curtailment and injection into the Irish gas network,2019,TA Gunawan and A Singlitico and Paul Blount and James G Carton and Rory FD Monaghan,,Proceedings of ECOS,,,,This paper presents the results of techno-economic modelling of hydrogen production from otherwise wasted wind energy in the Republic of Ireland (ROI). and its transportation to the natural gas network. for injection. The model includes the production of hydrogen by electrolysis powered by curtailed and constrained (wind curtailment) wind energy at every wind farm in the ROI. compression to 300 bar. and transportation by tube trailer to the nearest potential injection point to the natural gas grid. This system is referred to as a wind-hydrogen system (WHS). The model does not currently include the costs of converting the hydrogen to methane or injecting the hydrogen/methane into the grid. The WHS model selects an optimum electrolyser size for each wind farm that minimises levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from that farm. Compressors and storage tanks for each wind farm are scaled to the farm’s electrolyser. Central to the WHS model is a correlation that relates optimum electrolyser size to each wind farm’s power capacity (CP). annual capacity factor (CF) and percentage wind curtailment (% CW). This correlation was developed from hourly CW time series data for 75 wind farms in the ROI. Capital. operating and other costs were obtained from literature. Results show that not all wind farms in ROI are suitable for WHS. as indicated by high LCOH at farms of capacity< 1 MW.

1263687,Is Natural Gas “Essential for Ireland’s Future Energy Security”?,2018,Barry McMullin and Paul Price and James Carton and Kevin Anderson,,,,1-21,,It is widely recognised that the current Irish energy system carries a significant security-of-supply risk. due to heavy reliance on natural gas. with very constrained diversity and capacity of import supply routes. This risk may become even more severe in the years immediately ahead as the only significant indigenous natural gas source (the Corrib gas field) is depleted and the other (even higher carbon intensity) fossil energy sources (coal. oil and peat) are progressively removed from the Irish energy mix. In July 2018. the Irish Academy of Engineering (IAE) published a major report assessing this evolving natural gas security-of-supply risk. entitled “Natural Gas—Essential for Ireland’s Future Energy Security”(IAE 2018). The report argued that substantial continued reliance on natural gas in the overall Irish energy system is unavoidable up to at least 2040. On this basis. it recommended a number of major strategic interventions designed to manage the consequently deepening security-of-supply risk. ie. measures attempting to assure continued access to natural gas.In this response to that report 1. we present an independent peer evaluation of the basis for these recommendations. We base our analysis on the presumption that Ireland is committed to good faith action consistent with its ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement (UNFCCC 2015): specifically to play its equitable and commensurate part in holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C.

We also incorporate Agro-ecological Zones (AEZs) for each of the land using sectors in line with Lee et al.(2005). The GTAP-E model with biofuels and AEZs offers a useful framework for analyzing the growing importance of biofuels for global changes in crop production. utilization. commodity prices. factor use. trade. land use change etc. We begin by validating the model over the 2001-2006 period. We focus on six main drivers of the biofuel boom: the hike in crude oil prices. replacement of MTBE by ethanol as a gasoline additive in the US. and subsidies for ethanol and biodiesel in the US and EU. Using this historical simulation. we calibrate the key elasticities of energy substitution between biofuels and petroleum products in each region. With these parameter settings in place. the model does a reasonably good job of predicting the share of feedstock in biofuels and related sectors in accordance with the historical evidence between 2001 and 2006 in the three major biofuel producing regions: US. EU. and Brazil. The results from the historical simulation reveal an increased production of feedstock with the replacement of acreage under other agricultural crops.

1263693,Contract farming in tomato: An economic analysis,2002,BK Dileep and RK Grover and KN Rai,57,Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics,2,197-210,,The globalisation of Indian agriculture in recent years has resulted in the need for the production of export-oriented quality products having competitive advantage. To fulfill the commitment of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). the recent dismantling of the system of quantitative restrictions (QRs) on imports by the. Union Government has provoked new challenges to the Indian farmers to compete in the world market. The horticulture sector provides a sound platform for establishment of agro-processing industries to help enhance exports by allowing diversification and value addition of agricultural produce. The fruits and vegetable farming for processing is not only employment intensive. but also enhances the gross as well as net returns of the farmers. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is the world's largest vegetable crop after potato and sweet potato. but it tops the list of canned vegetables. It is most popular in India also because of its high nutritive value. higher production and wide ecological amplitude. As it has greater form utility. the scope for tomato in the processing industry is quite large. Since heavy arrivals in the peak season result in low price for perishable commodities like tomato leading to distress sales. processing through contract farming system gives a guarantee of minimum price to the producers who do not have to bear the price risk. It is also beneficial to the processing units because supply of raw material of desired quality or variety is assured at predetermined price.

Wageningen: Wageningen Academic Publishers,,61-75,,This chapter evaluates the impact of the recent biofuels boom on world food markets. We begin with an analysis of the origins of the bio-fuel boom–from a US perspective. We conclude by predicting a slowing ofthe ethanol boom in the US. as production satiates the high-value demand for ethanol as an additive so that future growth hinges of its ability to substitute for petroleum products on an energy equivalent basis. This transition is reflected in the elimination of the price premium for ethanol. the price ofwhich has dropped sharply recently. This. combined with higher corn prices. has served to curtail most plans for new ethanol capacity–at least for the present.Our prospective analysis of the impacts of the biofuels boom on food markets focuses on the 2006-2010 time period. during which existing investments in the US. and new mandates in the EU are expected to substantially increase the share of agricultural products (eg corn in the US. oilseeds in the EU and sugar in Brazil) utilised by the biofuels sector. In the US. this share could double from 2006 levels. while the share of oilseeds going to biodiesel in the EU could triple. We expect such expansion to lead to a doubling of US corn and EU oilseed prices. from 2006 levels. thereby sharply reducing exports. while boosting imports. In the EU. the majority of the new demand for oilseeds due to biodiesel expansion is met by imports. with EU oilseed import volume rising by more than $4 billion.,True,aSnplUgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,77,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RG8oP1eBh-AC&oi=fnd&pg=PA61&dq=info:lhXbLpOHFBAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=iA7VjKuUFy&sig=cGsJBExJzjdEbqv6IEcIdnkA5Zk,1158700070357112214,/scholar?cites=1158700070357112214,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48971166/LEI_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1263696,Land-Use Changes and CO2 Emissions Due to US Corn Ethanol Production,2013,Wallace E Tyner and Farzad Taheripour,,,,539-554,Academic Press,There is considerable debate about the global extent of land-use change that would be associated with US production of corn ethanol up to the 15 billion gallons implied by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. This article reviews the processes associated with each of the ways in which such production of corn ethanol could impact land-use changes. and then uses the estimated land-use changes to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with corn ethanol production. The GHG emissions also are a result of land conversion from forest and pasture to cropland.,True,aSnplUgAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,10,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16900609747338872075&hl=en&oi=scholarr,16900609747338872075,/scholar?cites=16900609747338872075,,,,0,0,0
1263697,Global impact of biofuels on agriculture. trade. and environment: A computable general equilibrium analysis,2010,Dileep K Birur,,,,,,This dissertation provides a modeling framework for analyzing the linkages between biofuels. agriculture. international trade. and the environmental consequences in terms of land-use change and greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. This study incorporates three types of first generation biofuels (grain ethanol. sugarcane ethanol. and vegetable oil based biodiesel) as energy sources into the GTAP data base and into the production and consumption structures of the GTAP-Energy model. To account for the heterogeneity of land within each region. the disaggregated land endowment is classified into 18 Agro-ecological Zones (AEZs) for each of the land using sectors. The model is validated over the 2001-2006 period with a focus on six main drivers of the biofuel boom: the hike in crude oil prices. replacement of MTBE by ethanol as a gasoline additive in the US. and subsidies for ethanol and biodiesel in the US and EU. Using this historical simulation. the key elasticities of energy substitution between biofuels and petroleum products in each region are calibrated. With these parameter settings in place. the model named as “GTAP-BIO” is used for projecting the biofuel economy for 2006. Based on this 2006 baseline. several experiments on biofuel policies are analyzed. An experiment on implementation of US and EU biofuel mandates revealed that large scale production of biofuels by 2015 calls for large increase in cropland to grow feedstock crops. which comes at the expense of accessible forest and pasturelands. An important criticism of the indirect land use change (iLUC) estimates to date is that they have not accounted for the presence of …,True,aSnplUgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,10,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3413773/,12641298492942587982,/scholar?cites=12641298492942587982,,,,0,0,0

Though both of these approaches have unique strengths. they also suffer from many limitations due to complexity of addressing all the relevant aspects of biofuels. In this paper we have exploited the strengths of both PE and GE approaches for analyzing the economic and environmental implications of the US policies on corn-ethanol and biodiesel production. In this study. we utilize the Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model (FASOMGHG: Adams et al. 1996. 2005; Beach et al. 2009). a non-linear programming. PE model for the United States. We also use the GTAP-BIO model (Birur et al. 2008). a multiregion. multi-sector CGE model for global-scale assessment of biofuels policies. Following Britz and Hertel (2009). we link the GTAP-BIO model through a static. quadratic restricted revenue function obtained from perturbing crop prices from the FASOMGHG model. With this linkage we implement the US Corn ethanol and biodiesel scenarios in the GTAP-BIO model and obtain the FASOMGHG-consistent. global land use changes.

1263700,Impact of large-scale biofuels production on cropland-pasture and idle lands,2010,Dileep Birur and Thomas Hertel and Wally Tyner,,,,,,An important criticism of the indirect land use change (ILUC) estimates of biofuels to date is that they have not accounted for the presence of marginal lands such as cropland-pasture and idle-lands. This paper offers a novel framework for analyzing the impact of biofuels production on these marginal lands. The methodology includes the steps involved in identifying and incorporating marginal land data such as area under cropland-pasture and idle lands such as US Federal Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) enrolled land into the database. computing the associated land-rents which imply productivity of land. and specifying the marginal lands in the land supply function in a computable general equilibrium model. Two policy scenarios are examined in this study: 1) implementing US and EU biofuel mandates for 2015 and 2) implementing the corn-ethanol only mandate by 2015 in the US These policy experiments also look at the potential implications of releasing or fixing the CRP land enrollment by the USDA on global land-use and land-cover changes. The results revealed that though accessibility of these marginal lands dampens large shifts in cropping patterns. the ILUC emissions measured in terms of grams of CO¬ 2 equivalent per MJ of biofuel produced. were significantly affected mainly due to increase in deforestation when the cropland-pasture is used for cultivation of crops. Future research to more accurately characterize the productivity of these marginal lands will be needed.,True,aSnplUgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,5,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=3385,5349014737861786767,/scholar?cites=5349014737861786767,,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/4987.pdf,0,0,0

The US has emerged as the leading producer of biofuels and is aiming for achieving a target of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022 under its updated renewable fuels standard (RFS2) policy. In this paper. we study the longer-term global implications of large-scale renewable fuels production in the US We utilize the GTAP v7. 1 data base and introduce a detailed breakdown of agricultural crops. first and second generation biofuels and by-products. We update this fully disaggregated data base to reflect the 2010 global economy. based on secondary data for the sectors and regions included. We adapt the Applied Dynamic Analysis of Global Economy (ADAGE) model developed by Ross (2009) into a recursive dynamic framework and introduce agriculture. biofuels. and land use linkages. We construct a dynamic baseline from 2010 through 2050 in five-year time steps. The dynamics in the model comes from growth in GDP. population. capital accumulation. labor productivity. growth in natural resource stocks. and technological changes in the energy intensive and agricultural sectors. We implement a representative RFS2 policy scenario in the US for 2025. using two alternative approaches:(i) RFS permits approach–which assumes biofuels and petroleum fuels are perfect substitutes after adjusting for energy content. and (ii) Target share of biofuels in transportation fuels approach–which treats biofuels and petroleum fuels as imperfect substitutes.

China projected to be the source of nearly half of the world oil demand growth till 2035 (IEA. 2014). With its policy initiatives on renewable energy for transportation. China is currently the third largest producer of biofuels in the world next only to Brazil and the United States. The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of China’s biofuels production on (i) food supply and food prices.(ii) land use change and water needs. and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions. To accomplish these objectives. we use a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model called GDyn-E-BIO model with explicit first and second generation biofuels sectors. Using these results on AEZ level change in cropping pattern from the CGE model. we follow Chapagain and Hoekstra (2011) approach to estimate the water footprint (WF) of biofuels production. We further distinguish the sources of water footprint as the green (rainwater). blue (surface and groundwater). and grey (freshwater pollution) water footprints.

1263707,Analysis of global economic and environmental impacts of a substantial increase in bioenergy production,2008,Wallace E Tyner and Thomas W Hertel and Farzad Taheripour and Dileep K Birur,,,,,Department of Agricultural Economics. Purdue University. West Lafayette,With the growing concerns on energy security and climate change. biofuels have witnessed rapid increase in production in rich countries particularly in the United States and the European Union. Massive subsidies offered by these countries. have resulted in large-scale implementation of biofuels programs which have profound global economic. environmental. and social consequences. Current studies do not provide much insight into how alternative bioenergy production scenarios could change global agricultural production nor the incomes of affected groups both within and across nations. The increasing importance of biofuels and lack of comprehensive studies on global impacts have opened up several research avenues. Since biofuels are produced mainly from agricultural sources. their effect is largely felt in agricultural markets and land-use. with repercussions for international trade. As the World Bank reports. nearly 70 percent of the world’s poor live in rural areas in developing countries and derive their primary livelihood from agriculture. Higher biofuel feedstock prices can help the farmers who grow them. but an increase in food prices can hurt the poor as they spend a large share of their budget on food. Keeping these issues in view. this project aims to develop a realistic assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of regional and global policies designed to stimulate biofuels production and use. This project will be completed over a three-year period.

1263709,Economic and environmental assessment of expanded bioenergy production in china,2015,Yongxia Cai and Robert Beach and Dileep Birur,,,,,,As the second largest oil consumer and the largest oil importer in the world. China’s oil consumption and oil imports are expected to continue to rise with the rapid growth of China’s economy. especially with the exponential growth in private car ownership. By 2030. 75 percent of China's oil consumption will be imported (IEA. 2008). This heavy reliance on imported oil raises concerns about national energy security. while the large increase in fossil fuel consumption conflicts with domestic and international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Recognizing these concerns. China has developed policies to promote the use of bioenergy to enhance energy security and to lower air pollution and GHG emissions since 2000. However. due to concerns that increased grain ethanol production was increasing food prices and leading to greater food insecurity. China has moved to restrict the use of grains as bioenergy feedstocks. Instead. they are promoting the use of non-grains that grow on marginal and abandoned lands. such as cassava. sweet potato. sweet sorghum. sugarcane and sugar beets as bioenergy feedstocks. In addition. second generation bioenergy from woody biomass is in the conceptual stage. but is expected to grow rapidly due to abundant biomass resources and supportive governmental policies. With a production of 0.70 billion gallons of ethanol in 2013. China is currently the fourth largest producer of ethanol in the world behind only the United States. Brazil and Europe.

Most of the growth in demand for food is expected to come from the developing countries. The rural-urban divide in terms of food security. among the poor households. in these countries is often found to be considerable. India is a key global player. as a leading emerging economy. with a strong impact it had on the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) latest negotiations. in the food security context. Until 2013. India followed a welfare based approach of distributing food grains to its low income group at an issue price which is much lower than its market price or procurement price. Then. the Government of India passed the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA. also called the Right to Food Act due to its rights based approach). The NFSA entails providing subsidized food grains to nearly 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population. There is a disconnect in the literature between two sets of hypotheses–household-type-level differences in food security to be addressed by policies such as NFSA and the distortions arising from it. In this study. we attempt to bridge this gap by examining the economy wide and household level implications of India’s NFSA within the context of global food security challenges.

The US Congress has established a renewable fuel standard 2 (RFS2) rule that mandates annual combined production of 36 billion gallons (bg) biofuels by 2022 (USEPA. 2010). Large scale production of biofuels results in far-reaching intended and unintended consequences on the economy and environment.

Due to the limitations of the traditional thermal approaches. several novel technologies are being developed. One promising approach in this field. which has received little attention to date. is plasma technology. Its advantages include mild operating conditions. easy upscaling. and gas activation by energetic electrons instead of heat. This allows thermodynamically difficult reactions. such as CO2 splitting and the dry reformation of methane. to occur with reasonable energy cost. In this review. after exploring the traditional thermal approaches. we have provided a brief overview of the fierce competition between various novel approaches in a quest to find the most effective and efficient CO2 conversion technology.

Among those resources. fossil fuels have contributed to a fast and unprecedented development in human society. However. this has come with a great cost. as burning fossil fuels leads to the emission of large amounts of the greenhouse gas CO2. Owing to the fact that these anthropogenic CO2 emissions outpace the natural carbon cycle. the atmospheric CO2 concentrations have been increasing from 280 ppm since the beginning of the industrial revolution to 400 ppm in 2014.[1] With a high certainty it is this increase that leads to the current adverse global environmental climate changes.[1] Utilization of this waste (ie. CO2) and converting it into a new feedstock (eg. raw materials for the chemical industry and fuels) not only complies with the framework of sustainable/green chemistry [2. 3] but also fits within the “cradle-tocradle” concept.[4] By generating useful products out of CO2 we create the possibility to effectively close the carbon loop.An interesting co-reactant to pursue this is water. It is not only the most ubiquitous and cheapest hydrogen source. compared to CH4 and H2. but in addition. converting CO2 in combination with H2O to produce value-added products by using renewable energy would successfully mimic the natural photosynthetic process.[5] Indeed. the successful development of artificial photosynthesis technology is no longer a fairy tale.

Most of them either rely on high temperatures or generate highly reactive O species. which can lead to the undesirable formation of NOx and N2O when the CO2 feeds contain N2. Here. we show that. for plasma-based CO2 conversion. adding a hydrogen source. as a chemical oxygen scavenger. can suppress their formation. in situ. This allows the use of low-cost N2 containing (industrial and direct air capture) feeds. rather than expensive purified CO2. To demonstrate this. we add CH4 to a dielectric barrier discharge plasma used for converting impure CO2. We find that when adding a stoichiometric amount of CH4. 82% less NO2 and 51% less NO are formed. An even higher reduction (96 and 63%) can be obtained when doubling this amount.

The application of biasing in subsequent discharges of each type resulted in excitation or suppression of the MHD activity. The results show that the dominant modes are m= 2. n= 1 and m= 3. n= 1 for excitation and partial suppression. respectively.

Sykes et al.. Nucl. Fusion 32. 694 (1992)]. are consistent with those found in conventional aspect ratio tokamaks. In particular the highest β achieved (∼40%) is consistent with an ideal magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) Troyon type limit. the upper limit on density is well described by the Greenwald density (πa2n̄e/Ip∼1) and the normalized current (Ip/aBt) is limited such that q95≳2. Stability calculations indicate scope for increasing both normalized β and normalized current beyond the values so far achieved. although wall stabilization is generally needed for low-n modes.

Dynamic simulations have been carried out with IDA ICE 4 on a typical narrow office building with perimeter cell rooms. The results from the parametric study reveal that the most important design features for energy saving are demand-controlled ventilation as well as limited glazing on the façade. Further energy-saving features are efficient lighting and office equipment which strongly reduce user-related electricity and cooling energy. Together. the simulation results suggest that about 48% energy can be saved compared to a new office building built according to the Swedish building …,True,LRyJi4wAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,32,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2251-6832-3-19,10332333726466008531,/scholar?cites=10332333726466008531,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2251-6832-3-19,0,0,0

The review showed that the thermal resistance of shading devices has been studied extensively although work on the thermal resistance of devices attached to double and triple pane windows remains to be done. Average and normal incidence optical properties have been determined for most shading devices but solar angle dependent values still need to be measured. No standard measurement procedures have been reported.Studies of the impact of shading on annual energy use have demonstrated that shading devices reduce the cooling demand in buildings while increasing the heating loads due to loss of beneficial solar gains. Optimal shading strategies are thus climate dependent: in heating-dominated countries. fixed devices with medium to high solar transmittance and high thermal resistance or systems that can be removed in the winter are more energy efficient. Shading strategies for daylit buildings where artificial lighting is replaced by natural light through installation of dimming systems need to be investigated further.,True,LRyJi4wAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,28,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.595.7355&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16416637214622200895,/scholar?cites=16416637214622200895,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.595.7355&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Various glazing-to-wall area ratios (GWAR) and orientations were studied. The energy performance was assessed through computer simulations with the program DEROB-LTH recently supplemented with improved algorithms for windows and exterior shading systems. The study showed that the most energyefficient glazing option was orientation-dependent: south and north orientations required higher solar transmittance or GWAR than east and west. assuming similar coefficients of performance (COP) for heating and cooling systems and equivalent thermal losses among all cases. The study also demonstrated that a removable awning coupled with clear glazing performed better in terms of annual energy use than all solar-protective glazing options tested. However. it was also demonstrated that the fixed awning resulted in higher annual energy use compared with solar-protective glazing for all orientations. This study generally shows that glazing and shading strategies should be flexible in cold climates and allow the use of solar gains during the heating season while limiting those gains during the cooling season.

This study presents a model of thermal interactions between a human body and the interior environment of an automobile. The model is based on the heat balance equation for human body. combined with empirical equations defining the sweat rate and mean skin temperature.

Ltd.,In this study. a theoretical approach is proposed for the prediction of time and temperature during the heat charge and discharge in the latent heat storage of phase changed materials (PCM). By the use of the average values of the mean specific heat capacities for the phase‐changed materials. analytical solutions are obtained and compared with the available experimental data in the literature. It is shown that decreasing the entry temperature of the working fluid from −4 to −15°C has a very dominant and strong effect on the PCM solidification time. The effect of the working fluid flow rate and the material of PCM capsules on the time for complete solidification and total charging is also investigated.

Now it is revered as a national treasure. and Americans have launched the largest environmental project in history to try to save it. The Swamp is the stunning story of the destruction and possible resurrection of the Everglades. the saga of man's abuse of nature in southern Florida and his unprecedented efforts to make amends. Michael Grunwald. a prize-winning national reporter for The Washington Post. takes readers on a riveting journey from the Ice Ages to the present. illuminating the natural. social and political history of one of America's most beguiling but least understood patches of land. The Everglades was America's last frontier. a wild country long after the West was won. Grunwald chronicles how a series of visionaries tried to drain and"" reclaim"" it. and how Mother Nature refused to bend to their will; in the most harrowing tale. a 1928 hurricane drowned 2.500 people in the Everglades. But the Army Corps of Engineers finally tamed the beast with levees and canals. converting half the Everglades into sprawling suburbs and sugar plantations. And though the southern Everglades was preserved as a national park. it soon deteriorated into an ecological mess. The River of Grass stopped flowing. and 90 percent of its wading birds vanished. Now America wants its swamp back. Grunwald shows how a new breed of visionaries transformed Everglades politics. producing the $8 billion rescue plan.

Further. quantum chemistry calculations at CBS-QB3 level of theory are applied to determine bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and thereby suggest the initial reactions of the ignition process for all of these fuels. Using the calculated BDEs. it is found that the ignition characteristics are similar among furans and among tetrahydrofurans. but strongly differ between these molecular classes. It is shown that the ignition behavior of aromatic furans is determined by the ring structure. which correlates with a negligible side chain influence.

In the present work. a conservative analytical estimate of the effects of radiation heat loss is derived and validated against detailed numerical simulations. A solver with a graphical interface is provided in the Supplemental material to allow implementation of these analytical results.

The underlying concept investigates whether adding sizeable power capacities of renewable energy sources (RES) options could decrease the overall costs and contribute to a more sustainable. indigenous electricity generation at the same time. Often. island states rely on fossil fuels which. apart from dependence on foreign resources. also includes an additional. significant transport cost. This is an extra motive to study the extent in which island states represent primary locations for RES technologies. For the aims of the present study an optimization model has been developed and following numerous runs the obtained results show that installing PV and battery capacities can delay-reduce the huge investments in fossil options in early periods. Thus. investment on RES can have a positive. long-term effect on the overall energy mix. This prompt development can happen without adding new subsidies but there is a need to address the existing socio-economic barriers with intelligent design of financing and economic instruments and capacity building as discussed in the conclusions.

Traction control includes antilock braking systems (ABS) and antislip regulation systems (ASR). During braking. wheelslip is controlled with ABS. while wheelslip during acceleration is controlled by an ASR. Since the friction between a vehicle's tyre and the road surface is a function of wheelslip. there is an optimum wheelslip value at which the best road holding performance can be achieved. This optimum wheelslip value will however change with differing road surfaces and vehicle speeds. Optimising the wheelslip values has several advantages: both vehicle stopping and acceleration distances can be optimised. vehicle handling during in-turn braking and acceleration is optimised and tyre wear is reduced.

It changed from an analytical tool for technology evaluation. which depends heavily on quantitative and qualitative modelling methodologies. into a strategic planning tool for policy-making concerning acceptable new technologies. which depends on participative policy problem analysis. The goal of technology assessment today is to generate policy options for solutions of organisational and societal problems. which at the operational level. utilise new technologies that are publicly acceptable; that is. viable policy options. Energy technology assessment for sustainability is inherently a complex and dynamic process that requires a holistic and transdisciplinary approach. In the South Africa context. specifically. there is no formal and coherent approach to energy technology assessment from a sustainability perspective. Without a formal comprehensive or well integrated technology assessment approach to evaluate the sustainability of any technology. the policy-makers. technology designers. and decision-makers are faced with difficulty in terms of making reasoned decisions about the appropriate technology options. This study developed a framework that incorporates a technology assessment approach. namely. system dynamics. within the broader scope of technology development for sustainability.

This herniation increases in size (according to La Place's law) owing to the unidirectional pinchcock effect of the mucosal folds of the duct and the pressure of the overlying extensor retinaculum until the distending pressure inside the ganglion equals the overlying tissue pressure. Wrist gangliography. retrograde wrist arthrography. histology and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to prove this conclusively. Bearing the pathogenesis in mind. the best clinical results were obtained by excision of the ganglion with 0.5 cm2 of dorsal scapholunate ligament and closure of the dorsal capsule with a 3/0 Vicryl purse-string suture. Non-surgical sclerotherapy led to severe inflammation and sepsis and a recurrence rate of 45%.

A modified version of the three-technology system is investigated. and some initial system dynamics results are reported illustrating the progression from asymptotic to cyclic behaviour. Technology is considered in this research as a result of innovation. a rate-dependent process that may include several non-linearities due to interaction with the environment and social context. Using bibliometrics as a research data source is an interesting way to trace technology growth patterns very effectively. In this research. the existence of cyclic behaviour in two real life technologies is illustrated using bibliometrics.

1264022,A strategy for electrical load management in the South African mining industry,2003,Ian Gordon Boake,,,,,,It is every person’s social responsibility to ensure that electrical energy is used as efficiently as possible. This is as a result of the considerable fossil fuels that are currently required to generate electricity. These fuels are available in limited supply on Earth and result in air pollution when consumed in the electrical energy generation process. Moreover. as scarcity increases. not just in fuel reserves. but also in electricity infrastructure such as servitudes. generation capacity etc. the costs of electricity also rises. This then brings about an opportunity to reduce input costs if the electrical energy is utilized as efficiently as possible. This can however only be done by the application of a suitable strategy.This thesis develops an electrical load management (ELM) strategy which may be effective in reducing input costs. by reducing electrical energy costs.

Furthermore. these graphene layers are shown to completely cease wear despite the severe sliding conditions including high contact pressures (≈0.5 GPa) observed typically in macroscale wear tests.

A field approach is used. based on the numerical solution of a modified version of the thin-wire electric field integral equation in the frequency domain. Time profiles of interesting electromagnetic quantities are computed by using a discrete fast Fourier transform algorithm. The model takes into account coupling effects among aerial parts and ground electrodes in order to correctly estimate the quantities which can determine electromagnetic hazard inside the LPS; transient touch and step voltages can be easily evaluated also taking into account the human body presence on the soil surface. To this purpose. a crucial point is the accurate evaluation of the current distribution among the earthed branches of the LPS and this needs to correctly consider mutual electromagnetic interference among the aerial parts and …,True,mYNblDoAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,123,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1076015/,9345873727410086076,/scholar?cites=9345873727410086076,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46428569/A_simulation_model_for_electromagnetic_t20160612-12356-1h9e6zp.pdf,0,0,0

Optimal design is traditionally carried out by means of minimum capital and management cost formulations and does not typically consider optimized operation. In this paper. the optimized multiobjective management is explicitly considered into the design formulation. The quality of each design solution is indeed defined by the evaluation of operational costs and capital costs. Besides. the assessment of the operational costs term is deduced by means of the solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. Each design solution is evaluated using the outcomes of a multiobjective optimization run: a Pareto hyper-surface in the n-dimensional space of the operational objectives.

In particular. what appears from the study is that the superposition of energy transactions in a microgrid creates a variation of the power losses in all the branches of the microgrid. Traditional power losses allocation in distribution systems takes into account only generators while. in this paper. a real-time attribution of power losses to each transaction involving one generator and one load node is done by defining some suitable indices. Besides. the presence of P-V nodes increases the level of reactive flows and provides a more complex technical perspective. For this reason. reactive power generation for voltage support at P-V nodes poses a further problem of reactive power flow exchange. which is worth of investigation in future works in order to define a possible way of remuneration.

Based on finite difference time domain numerical scheme. this model ascribes the electrical breakdown in the soil to the process of discharge in the air. In fact. as soon as the local electric field overcomes the electrical strength. the air in the voids trapped among soil particles is ionized. and the current is conducted by ionized plasma paths locally grow. The dimension of these ionized air channels are strictly dependent upon the local temperature.

The control system is based on fuzzy rules and does not use forecasts since it repairs the past history according to the real time data on the electrical energy cost. renewable energy production and load. When the system detects a worsening of performances. the fuzzy logic rule-based control system self-adapts its membership functions using an economic indicator. The common use. in the relevant literature. of forecasted values in such systems can lead to large errors and economic losses. Moreover the speed of calculation guaranteed by the fuzzy control system allows the execution of new calculations even with high frequency.

In particular. an application devoted to optimal energy dispatch of Distributed Energy Resources including ideal storage devices is here considered. Electrical energy storage systems. such as any other component that must meet an integral capacity constraint in optimal dispatch problems. have to show the same energy level at the beginning and at the end of the considered timeframe for operation. The use of zero-integral functions. such as sinusoidal functions. for the synthesis of the charge and discharge course of batteries is thus consequential. The issue is common to many other engineering problems. such as any dispatch problem where resources must be allocated within a given amount in a considered timeframe.

1264150,Modelling fireside corrosion of heat exchangers in co-fired pulverised fuel power systems,2010,NJ Simms and AT Fry,,,,,,As a result of concerns about the effects of CO{sub 2} emissions on the global environment. there is increasing pressure to reduce such emissions from power generation systems. The use of biomass co-firing with coal in conventional pulverised fuel power stations has provided the most immediate route to introduce a class of fuel that is regarded as both sustainable and carbon neutral. In the future it is anticipated that increased levels of biomass will need to be used in such systems to achieve the desired CO{sub 2} emission targets. However there are concerns over the risk of fireside corrosion damage to the various heat exchangers and boiler walls used in such systems. Future pulverised fuel power systems will need to be designed to cope with the effects of using a wide range of coal-biomass mixes. However. such systems will also need to use much higher heat exchanger operating temperatures to increase their conversion efficiencies and counter the effects of the CO{sub 2} capture technologies that will need to be used in them. Higher operating temperatures will also increase the risk of fireside corrosion damage to the critical heat exchangers. This paper reports work that has been carried out to develop quantitative corrosion models for heat exchangers in pulverised fuel power systems. These developments have been particularly targeted at producing models that enable the evaluation of the effects of using different coal-biomass mixtures and of increasing heat exchanger operating conditions. Models have been produced that have been targeted at operating conditions and materials used in (a) superheaters/reheaters and (b …,True,tEFNk00AAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C,9,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21588269,8618341658560406771,/scholar?cites=8618341658560406771,,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/21588269,0,0,0

This opens the possibility for applications of multiferroic composites to advanced magnetic. electric and motion sensors. When the magneto-electric effect is magnetically induced. the simultaneously application of a dc and ac magnetic fields is required. The magneto-electric coupling is strongly dependent on both ac/dc applied fields. the measurement geometry and the material properties.

The cause and type of solid particle erosion varies across different industries and locations in plant. for instance the particles could be volcanic ash in aero-engines. fly ash in boilers. exfoliated scale in steam turbines or mineral matter in oil excavation. In all cases the performance of materials can be improved through better surface engineering and coatings. but the development of these is restricted due to lack of generic models. well controlled and instrumented tests and international standards. A framework is required therefore that can be applied to these different situations to characterise the high temperature erosion performance of new materials and coatings and thereby accelerate their development and design. To achieve this. a step change in the test methods and control of high temperature solid particle erosion is required. However. limitations in current measurement capability within this form of test prevent the advancement.A new European initiative. METROSION. on the development of high temperature solid particle erosion testing has a primary aim to develop this metrological framework.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique is one of the most popular methods for measuring residual stress [1]. used routinely in quality control and materials characterisation for validating models and design.The VAMAS TWA20 Project 3 activity on the “Measurement of Residual Stresses by X-ray Diffraction” was initiated by NPL in 2005 to examine various aspects of the XRD test procedure in support of work aimed at developing an international standard in this area. The purpose of this project was to examine and reduce some of the sources of scatter and uncertainty in the measurement of residual stress by X-ray diffraction on metallic materials. through an international inter-comparison and validation exercise. One of the major issues the inter-comparison highlighted was the problem associated with measuring residual stresses in austenitic stainless steel.

The simple premise is that corruption nearly always creates winners and losers who may take countervailing actions (CA) to reduce or eliminate their losses. The incentives to engage in CA depend on two sets of factors: global and specific. Global factors. such as human rights. property rights. political rights. capital. property rights. education. income levels and income distribution have across-the-board effects on the ability to engage in CA; variations in levels of corruption across countries and over time can be explained in terms of these factors. Specific factors. such as the type of corruption. number of losers. the size of their losses. and visibility of losses to losers. may vary across government agencies within the same country and. therefore. can explain different levels of corruption across these agencies.,True,Dfy691wAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,236,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2589159,15969934003921147948,/scholar?cites=15969934003921147948,,,,0,0,0
1264158,Governments and markets in economic development strategies: Lessons from Korea. Taiwan. and Japan,1989,Mohammad Shahid Alam and Shahid M Alam,,,,,Praeger Pub Text,Many social scientists have explored the economic success of Korea. Taiwan. and Japan. each of which has experienced dramatic economic growth over a relatively short period of time. M. Shahid Alam presents a controversial thesis by emphasizing the interventionist character of the export-oriented approach to the success of these three countries. Concern with the rapid development of comparative advantage in the industries they have promoted has. he believes. distinguished these three economies. This concern has led to both market and non-market interventions with the trade regime. capital markets. market structures. etc. The book explores how Taiwan and Korea changed from import substitution to the export-oriented approach with significant success. The point is made that export-oriented economies make more demands on the government. so that success in different countries cannot be assured. The book begins with an examination of export-oriented economies and the reasons for their success. Three separate chapters follow detailing the structure. choice and implementation of economic policies in South Korea. Taiwan. and Japan. Finally. the book assesses export-oriented strategies and their application to other countries.

1264176,The economy as an energy system,2005,Shahid Alam,,Boston: Northeastern University,,,,The standard neoclassical construct of the economy is one of the simplest yet devised by economists. Indeed. it cannot fail to impress by its tenacious adherence to the principle of Occam’s razor. Three variables define the neoclassical approach to the economy: capital. labor and goods. In this economy. production in each period begins with given amounts of capital and labor. and terminates in the production of final goods. Capital has its origins in prior periods: it is simply a portion of the economy’s output carried forward from previous periods. The neoclassical economists say nothing about how labor is produced or reproduced. It enters their economy as a gift of nature. Every economics undergraduate learns that capital and labor are ‘factors’ of production; in some formulations. they are described as ‘means’ of production. This means that the services of these two factors contribute to the production of goods and …,True,Dfy691wAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,10,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3899161287121070328&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3899161287121070328,/scholar?cites=3899161287121070328,,,,0,0,0

Critics argue that the high prices charged in the private sector limits the use of health care among the poorest. consequently reducing access and equity in the use of health care. Supporters argue that increased private sector participation might improve access and equity by bringing in much needed resources for health care and by allowing governments to increase focus on underserved populations. However. little empirical exists for or against either side of this debate.  Methodology/Principal Findings We examine the association between private sector participation and self-reported measures of utilization and equity in deliveries and treatment of childhood respiratory disease using regression analysis. across a sample of nationally-representative Demographic and Health Surveys from 34 SSA economies. We also examine the correlation between private sector participation and key background factors (socioeconomic development. business environment and governance) and use multivariate regression to control for potential confounders. Private sector participation is positively associated with greater overall access and reduced disparities between rich and poor as well as urban and rural populations. The positive association between private sector participation and improved health system performance is robust to controlling for confounders including per capita income and maternal education.

Six major themes. however. animated much of the discussion: the relevance of the current legal framework for countering piracy; the economic burden imposed by piracy; the opportunities for international collaboration that have been afforded by the joint maritime patrols off the Horn of Africa; the question of using private security contractors to protect shipping transiting dangerous waters; the extent to which industry talks with a"" single voice"" in terms of addressing maritime security; and means of confronting the unique nature of piracy off the Horn of Africa.",True,7T6wEmkAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,24,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Axp6bQaO0UkC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=info:topDG_YoyeMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ZIHFvrgpcU&sig=KoXsrcW3JamO74u-_lFPklwGeWI,16413695354412960438,/scholar?cites=16413695354412960438,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA506085.pdf,0,0,0
1264197,Firm-level perspectives on public sector engagement with private healthcare providers: survey evidence from Ghana and Kenya,2011,Neeraj Sood and Nicholas Burger and Joanne Yoong and Dan Kopf and Connor Spreng,6,PLoS One,11,e27194,Public Library of Science,Background Health systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are in urgent need of improvement. The private health sector is a major provider of care in the region and it will remain a significant actor in the future. Any efforts by SSA governments to improve health systems performance therefore has to account for the private health sector. Regional and international actors increasingly recognize importance of effectively engaging with the private health sector. and initiatives to improve engagement are underway in several countries. However. there is little systematic analysis of private health providers' view and experience with engagement.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we surveyed private health facilities in Kenya and Ghana to understand the extent to which and how governments interact and engage with these facilities. The results suggest that government engagement with private health facilities is quite limited. The primary focus of this engagement is “command-and-control” type regulations to improve the quality of care. There is little attention paid to building the capacity of health care businesses through either technical or financial assistance. The vast majority of these facilities also receive no government assistance in meeting public health and social goals. Finally. government engagement with private pharmacies is often neglected and clinics receive a disproportionate share of government assistance.   Conclusions/Significance Overall. our findings suggest that there may be considerable untapped potential for greater engagement with private health facilities—particularly pharmacies. Improving engagement will likely help …,True,7T6wEmkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,21,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027194,7892550075313626376,/scholar?cites=7892550075313626376,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027194,0,0,0
1264198,Economic evaluation of coastal land loss in Louisiana,2015,Stephen Barnes and Craig Bond and Nicholas Burger and Kate Anania and Aaron Strong and Sarah Weilant and Stephanie Virgets,,,,,LSU,Louisiana has experienced a rapid loss of land of approximately 1.880 square miles over the past eighty years. Projections suggest that in a future without action. the next fifty years could result in the loss of 1.750 additional square miles of land area. As land loss continues a large portion of the natural and man-made capital stocks of coastal Louisiana will be at greater risk of damage. either from land loss or from the associated loss of storm protection services. To help quantify the economic consequences of land loss in coastal Louisiana both locally and nationally. the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana (CPRA) asked a team of researchers from Louisiana State University and the RAND Corporation to provide an empirical understanding of the economic damages caused by land loss in a future without action.

Levine,The issues of self-control. procrastination. and willpower have been the focus of a number of recent theoretical models. Yet there is very little clean data about behavior under financial incentives. particularly on tasks of significant duration. We therefore conducted three field experiments to investigate how people schedule and complete tasks. providing some of the first data in this area. In each of these studies. we also attempted a behavioral intervention designed to improve performance. We find clear evidence of procrastination and willpower depletion. as well as behavior suggestive of self-reputation considerations. In this respect. each of the behavioral models identifies important aspects of how people deal with tasks. yet none of the models correctly predicts behavior in all of our studies. The behavioral interventions we used led to outcomes that surprised us in all three studies. although these outcomes are largely consistent with the standard neo-classical model.

1264201,Climate change. migration. and adaptation in the MENA Region,2014,Quentin Wodon and Nicholas Burger and Audra Grant and Andrea Liverani,,,,,,Climate change is a major source of concern in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. and migration is often understood as one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions. including extreme weather events. Other coping and adaptation strategies include changing the household’s sources of livelihood. and selling assets or taking other emergency measures in cases of losses due to extreme weather events. Yet while there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration and other adaptation strategies worldwide. the evidence available for the MENA region remains limited. in part because of a lack of survey and other data. This chapter is based in large part on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria. Egypt. Morocco. Syria. and Yemen. Household surveys were implemented in two climate affected areas in each country. In addition. qualitative focus groups were also implemented in both urban and rural areas. Finally. complementary work was completed using existing data sources for Morocco and Yemen. The chapter provides a summary of some of the main findings from these various sources of data. focusing on household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events. migration. other household coping and adaptation strategies. and government and community responses. Overall. households do perceive important change in the climate. and many have been affected by extreme weather events with resulting losses in income. crops. livestock. or fish catchment.

1264203,Mitigating corruption in government security forces: the role of institutions. incentives. and personnel management in Mexico,2011,Beth J Asch and Nicholas Burger and Mary M Fu,,,,,RAND CORP ARLINGTON VA NATIONAL SECURITY RESEARCH DIV,Corruption has been and continues to be a significant challenge for Mexico. There is a widespread belief that many government institutions--perhaps none more than Mexicos police--suffer from corruption. bribery. and a lack of accountability. At more than 400.000 officers across federal. state. and local levels. the police in Mexico play a critical role in enforcing laws. safeguarding the public. and maintaining order. but corruption. favoritism. nepotism. and a lack of professionalism serve to undermine these functions. Moreover. a growing problem with drug cartel activities and narcotics trafficking serves to exacerbate corruption and undermines police accountability. even as the drug trade makes the need for effective law enforcement more acute. Drug trafficking--and the violence it engenders--has become so severe that the government has turned to the other major component of Mexicos security forces--the military--to provide law and order. Although the public perceives that the police forces are among the most corrupt of Mexican institutions. the military does not share this dubious distinction. Compared with the federal. state. and local police. the military is viewed as more trustworthy and less corrupt. Nevertheless. there are concerns that the increasingly close relationship between the police and military and the role the military is being asked to play in countering cartel activity will expand opportunities for corrupt behavior. Recent administrations. from the federal government to local municipalities. have attempted various types of police reforms. all in an effort to promote professionalism.

1264206,International Environmental Agreements: Theory Meets Experimental Evidence 1,2010,Nicholas E Burger and Charles D Kolstad,,,,,,This paper concerns one of the major problems of the 21 st century–managing global public goods. particularly environmental goods such as the global climate. The challenge is how to induce sovereign states to voluntarily reduce emissions rather than free-ride on the efforts of others. There is some theoretical literature on international environmental agreements (IEA); unfortunately. the main results of that literature are discouraging: cases where an agreement is most needed to solve the public goods problem are precisely the cases where agreements are likely to be weak. This paper begins with the standard theoretical model of an IEA and then proceeds to develop parallel laboratory experiments to test the theoretical predictions. One of the key results to emerge from this paper is that the main theoretical result—voluntary agreements tend to fail when they are most beneficial—is contradicted by experimental evidence.,True,7T6wEmkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,14,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.231.8053,80893609090212621,/scholar?cites=80893609090212621,,,,0,0,0

Our experimental results showed that the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the fast-pyrolytic char is about twice as high as that of the gasification char as well as that of a standard soil sample. The CEC values correlate well with the increase in the ratios of the oxygen atoms to the carbon atoms (O:C ratios) in the biochar materials.

Here we investigate the growth stages of the hBN single crystals and show that hBN crystals change their shape from triangular to truncated triangular and further to hexagonal depending on copper substrate distance from the precursor. We suggest that the observed hBN crystal shape variation is affected by the ratio of boron to nitrogen active species concentrations on the copper surface inside the CVD reactor. Strong temperature dependence reveals the activation energies for the hBN nucleation process of ∼5 eV and crystal growth of ∼3.5 eV.

Li. and Fe triple-promoted Rh catalysts for CO hydrogenation to ethanol. The use of GMC results in C2H5OH selectivity and formation rate comparable to nonporous SiO2 support along with a significant inhibition on the formation of undesired CH4 and light hydrocarbons at the expense of appreciable amounts of CO2 produced.

A possible approach toward reversing this trend and decreasing the atmospheric CO2 concentration is to remove the CO2 directly from air (direct air capture). Herein we report a simple aqueous guanidine sorbent that captures CO2 from ambient air and binds it as a crystalline carbonate salt by guanidinium hydrogen bonding. The resulting solid has very low aqueous solubility (Ksp=1.0(4)×10−8). which facilitates its separation from solution by filtration. The bound CO2 can be released by relatively mild heating of the crystals at 80–120 °C. which regenerates the guanidine sorbent quantitatively. Thus. this crystallization‐based approach to CO2 separation from air requires minimal energy and chemical input. and offers the prospect for low‐cost direct air capture technologies.,True,nRiTCpAAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,40,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201610916,8560935431340014701,/scholar?cites=8560935431340014701,,,https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1340454,0,0,0

In solution. excimer formation is highly dependent on the concentration of pyrene. When adsorbed on solid surfaces (i.e.. silica surfaces). pyrene has been shown to form ground-state pairs which lead to static excimer emission even at very low surface coverages as a result of a solvent pooling effect induced during solvent removal from the surface. Ground-state pairing on silica surfaces results from a π−π interaction between two adjacent pyrene molecules and can not be avoided even by slow evaporation of the solvent from the surface as the molecules diffuse toward one another during the process. One possible method to alleviate the pairing of pyrene molecules and hence the formation of excimer is to chemically attach pyrene molecules to the silica surface. Chemical attachment. however. does not allow effective control …,True,nRiTCpAAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,28,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp803217p,3783344328360768175,/scholar?cites=3783344328360768175,,,,0,0,0

To realize this potential. it is essential to develop methods that produce biochar with the characteristics needed for effective soil amendment. Biochar materials were produced from peanut hulls and pine wood with different pyrolysis conditions. then characterized by cation exchange (CEC) capacity assays. nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements. micro/nanostructural imaging. infrared spectra and elemental analyses. Under a standard assay condition of pH 8.5. the CEC values of the peanut hull-derived biochar materials. ranging from 6.22 to 66.56 cmol kg−1. are significantly higher than those of the southern yellow pine-derived biochar. which are near zero or negative. The biochar produced from peanut hulls with a steam activation process yielded the highest CEC value of 66.56 cmol kg−1. which is about 5 times higher than the cation exchange capacity (12.51 cmol kg−1) of a reference soil sample. Notably. biochar produced from peanut hulls with batch barrel retort pyrolysis also has a much higher CEC value (60.12 cmol kg−1) than that (12.45 cmol kg−1) from Eprida’s H2-producing continuous steam injection process. The CEC values were shown to correlate well with the ratios of oxygen atoms to carbon atoms (O:C ratios) in the biochar materials.

In a sudden and unexpected `dash for gas'. previously unused combined cycle gas turbine plant was adopted for all new large power stations. Gas turbine technology. politically and institutionally excluded from the industry before privatization. gained ascendancy due to the coincidence and interaction of ESI liberalization with lower fuel prices and greater availability. improved turbine performance. pollution abatement legislation. and the manifestation of institutional tensions accumulated under nationalization.An earlier paper found that the demise of established generation technology. particularly the British nuclear power programme. exposed the inadequacies of autonomistic and deterministic notions of technological change.

1264263,Energy 2050: making the transition to a secure low carbon energy system,2011,Jim Skea and Paul Ekins and Mark Winskel,,,,,Routledge,The United Kingdom is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least eighty per cent by 2050. a target that will only be achieved by transforming the way that energy is supplied and used. At the same time there are anxieties about the security of energy provision in terms of European dependency on natural gas and the reliability of electricity supply. This book explores in detail those factors which could help or hinder the attainment of the UK's climate change targets. and how these factors interact with the parallel objective of maintaining a robust and secure energy system. The book is the result of a major national energy research effort by the UK Energy Research Centre. which includes some of the UK's leading energy experts. The results and recommendations are essential reading for policymakers. professionals. researchers. and anyone concerned with achieving large-scale reductions in carbon emissions. both from the UK and internationally. Energy 2050 begins by exploring the evolution of the UK energy system over recent decades: the trends. technologies and environmental impacts related to energy use. and the structures and institutions of governance that have influenced this evolution. It then moves on to changes in energy policy to emphasise decarbonization and resilience. and introduce the approach to scenarios and modelling used in the rest of the book.

Whilst emissions have fallen significantly since 1990. further reductions will be increasingly difficult to achieve. The government has agreed carbon budgets to the late 2020s that are consistent with the long-term 80% target.

The Rise of Accelerated Energy Innovation and its Implications for Sustainable Innovation Studies: A UK Perspective,2014,Mark Winskel and Jonathan Radcliffe,,Science & Technology Studies,,,,‘Accelerated energy innovation’has become a prominent aspect of energy policy-making in response to more urgent drivers for change. This paper charts the rise of accelerated energy innovation in the UK. and considers its possible implications for sustainable innovation studies and research-policy exchange. As manifest in the UK. accelerated energy innovation has a number of distinctive features: an emphasis on relatively short term dynamics (years rather than decades). a focus on cost reduction and deployment support for large scale technologies. and a central role for the private sector and public-private partnerships. We argue that because it is predominantly regime-led and continuity-based. accelerated energy innovation presents a challenge to niche-led. more disruptive theories of sustainable innovation (Transitions Studies and Technological Innovation Systems theory). We conclude that sustainable innovation studies–while maintaining its critical and reflexive stance–should more fully reflect the multiform dynamics of energy systems under urgency. across a broad spectrum of continuity-based and niche-led changes.,True,wH9jZ14AAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,30,http://sciencetechnologystudies.journal.fi/article/view/55332,4738889629245531475,/scholar?cites=4738889629245531475,,,https://sciencetechnologystudies.journal.fi/article/download/55332/18164,0,0,0

1264280,Multi-level governance and energy policy: renewable energy in Scotland,2007,Mark Winskel,,People centred eco-design: consumer adoption of low and zero carbon products and systems,,182,,Recent policy studies research has introduced a number of concepts to analyse the widely observed trend toward the fragmentation of national government powers. Among other themes (see Joseph Murphy’s introductory chapter for a fuller account). contributions here have included the ‘hollowing out of the state’(Rhodes. 1999). the shift from ‘government to governance’(Pierre and Peters. 2000). and the emergence of ‘multi-level governance’(Bache and Flinders. 2004a; Lyall and Tait. 2004. 2005). The latter is particularly relevant for the concern here with the impact of devolution on policy making. As Bache and Flinders (2004b) point out. multi-level governance (MLG) attempts to capture both ‘horizontal’and ‘vertical’dimensions of the dispersal of state powers. Horizontally. this refers to distributed responsibilities between national government departments. statutory bodies and other non-government groups. 1 Vertically. this spans international. national. regional and local policy makers. Bache and Flinders go on to note that the term has particular resonance in contemporary UK politics following the devolving of powers to executives and parliaments in Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland at the end of the 1990s. and that this process of quasi-federalism marked a significant departure from the highly centralized Westminster model. At the same time.

However. WSR typically involves challenging research elements (radical disciplinary scope. integrative knowledge production and transdisciplinary design). which are seen by some as intellectually and institutionally flawed. Drawing on the interdisciplinary studies literature. this paper considers WSR strategy and practice in the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) over its first two phases (2004–14) and compares UKERC to other similar UK-based initiatives. WSR strategy and practice face a number of tensions: integration versus diversity. stability versus flexibility and independence versus engagement.

The purpose of this chapter is to examine the current state ofthe UK energy system. and key underlying trends. in some detail. The chapter starts with a very long-term perspective on energy demand. It then looks at patterns of final energy demand. that is the energy used by households. business. the public sector and in transport. It covers fuels. sectors and the uses to which energy is put. The chapter then moves on to look at primary energy demand. which reflects the nation’s total use of energy taking account of conversion losses in power stations and refineries. and losses in transmission and distribution.,True,wH9jZ14AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,16,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FtndDC8Y2M4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA11&dq=info:SSKkIiNn_E4J:scholar.google.com&ots=JSMa7pBZd4&sig=TzV4eJbaGLq93tNjUqMSv0rteJM,5691537429692162633,/scholar?cites=5691537429692162633,,,,0,0,0

Such deliberate transformative change is. however. without precedent. Sustainable Urban Energy Policy debates the major public issue of developing a sustainable. clean and affordable energy system by adopting a distinctive focus on heating in cities. In this way. the book constructs an original account of clean energy policy. politics and provision. grounded in new empirical data derived from case studies of urban and multi-level governance of sustainable heat and energy saving in the UK and Europe. Offering an original conceptual framework. this study builds on socio-technical studies. economic and urban sociology. human geography. applied economics and policy studies in order to understand energy governance and systemic change in energy provisions.

The technologies covered here include a number oflarge scale renewables (wind power. marine energy. solar PV and bio-energy) and also nuclear power. carbon capture and storage and hydrogen fuel cells. Most of these are electricity generation technologies; as discussed in Chapter 5. the electricity sector may have an increasingly important role in the UK’s future energy system. The analysis suggests that accelerated development could open up more affordable and more diverse decarbonization pathways over the longer term. with currently emerging technologies assuming a significant role in the future energy supply mix. This implies that. in mapping out desirable decarbonization strategies for the UK. it is important to take accelerated development potential into account.Realizing the benefits of accelerated development will require raised and sustained efforts on low carbon technology innovation–investment which promises significant return in the longer term.

As expected. blending PANI with PET (polyester) reduces conductivity. More unexpectedly. blending with PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) and PVC can increase conductivity. especially at lower temperatures; this increase is ascribed to lessening of insulating barriers around PANI particles in these blends. The temperature dependence of conductivity in the PANI blends is surprisingly similar to that seen in polyacetylene; it is well described in both types of material by a series combination of quasi-ID metallic resistivity and tunnelling (between small metallic islands for the blends and lightly-doped polyacetylene. and between extended metallic regions in highly-conducting polyacetylene).

In this report. a “two-step” growth process is adopted to achieve single-crystalline GaAs NWs. where an initial high-temperature nucleation process is employed to ensure the formation of high Ga supersaturated Au7Ga3 and Au2Ga alloy seeds. instead of the low Ga supersaturated Au7Ga2 seeds observed in the conventional “single-step” growth. These two-step NWs are long (>60 μm) and thick (>80 nm) with the minimal defect concentrations and uniform growth orientations. Importantly. these NWs exhibit p-type conductivity as compared to the single-step grown n-type NWs for the same diameter range.

Bull,14,971-973,,To date. due to the excellent electrochemical inertness. superb electrical conductivity and good mechanical stability in both aqueous and nonaqueous solutions. platinum (Pt) has been widely employed as counter electrode material in three-electrode setups to perform electroanalytical chemistry. However. recent reports have revealed that the use of Pt based counter electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). without using any ionexchange membrane to separate the working electrode from the counter electrode. would influence the experimental results substantially owing to the electrochemical dissolution-deposition process of Pt. A controversial issue has therefore arisen regarding whether or not Pt should be continued to be utilized as the counter electrode material for HER.In fact. before the upsurge of research in electrocatalysis. the dissolution of Pt has been widely investigated in the fuel cell research since the dissolution not only detaches Pt from the electrode surface but also deteriorates significantly the overall cell performance during electrochemical processes. As early in 1988. Ota and his colleagues [1] have systematically studied the weight loss of Pt anode in H2SO4 aqueous solution by spectrophotometric method. It was found that there is an accelerated Pt corrosion under cyclic voltammetry scan caused by the reduction of oxide layer. which could facilitate the corrosion of Pt. The electrochemically corroded Pt constituents are then considered to get redeposited back onto the cathode. For revealing this complete Pt dissolution mechanism. enormous research efforts have been made to evaluate the characteristics of these …,True,2muFJukAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,38,https://hocityu.com/publications_files/SciBull_2017_Pt%20Counter%20Electrode%20for%20HER.pdf,17478830819649940095,/scholar?cites=17478830819649940095,,,https://hocityu.com/publications_files/SciBull_2017_Pt%20Counter%20Electrode%20for%20HER.pdf,0,0,0

These correction terms. also referred to as “modifiers”. correspond to the difference between predicted and measured constraint values and are updated at each steady-state iteration. thereby allowing the RTO to iteratively meet the optimal operating conditions of an SOFC stack despite significant plant-model mismatch.

This new book uses a framework of political ecology and environmental history to explore the"" Green Revolution's"" emergence during the 20th century in the United States. Mexico. India. and Britain. It argues that the national security planning efforts of each nation were the most important forces promoting the development and spread of the"" Green Revolution""; when viewed in the larger scheme. this period can be seen as the latest chapter in the long history of wheat use among humans. which dates back to the neolithic revolution. Efforts to reform agriculture and mitigate some of the harsh environmental and social consequences of the"" Green Revolution"" have generally been insensitive to the deeply embedded nature of high yielding agriculture in human ecology and political affairs.

Expert knowledge is generated amid the conflicts of a society and in turn supplies fuel to fire yet further change and new clashes. This essay on economic entomology is a case study on how cultural events and forces affected the creation of scientific and technical knowledge. The time period emphasized is 1945 to 1980. My initial premises for selecting relevant data for the story were ultimately not of much use. Virtually all debates about insect control since 1945 have been centered around the environmental and health hazards associated with insecticides. My first but inadequate conclusion was that the center of interest lay between those who defended the chemicals and those who advocated the use of nonchemical control methods. With this formulation of the problem. I was drawn to an analysis of how the chemical manufacturers had managed to dominate and even corrupt the work of entomological scientists. farmers. members of Congress. and regulators in the USDA and EPA.

Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. however. interact with existing and new nuclear power plants. and these installations must contend with dilemmas between adaptation and mitigation.

What is of interest is how humans deal with pests. especially through the use of pesticides. The uses of pesticides seldom attracted major government attention or regulation before 1900. In contrast. by the late 1900s pesticides are major sources of political and policy conflict in many countries. In fact. the proposition of pesticide reduction. the major theme of this book. is partly a response to the frustration of devising appropriate regulatory programs for pesticides. Reduction of pesticide use. however. inevitably affects the mastery of nature and land-use control which lie at the heart of cultural identity. Efforts to reduce pesticide use will benefit from a better understanding of the history of pest control and pesticides.

Such materials as pyrethrum and rotenone have long been known. but their uses suffered a decline following the discovery of inorganic and organic molecules with lower costs. greater toxicities. and more durability to effects such as weathering. Now chemists working in conjunction with pest control scientists have opened a whole panoply of new materials for experimentation and possible use including insect growth regulators. receptors. and feeding agents; microbial insecticides; and plant growth regulators such as plant hormones. secondary plant products. and allelopathic agents. Chemists have even synthesized pyrethroids so that we can choose between natural and synthetic versions of this naturally occurring pesticide.To what do we attribute the surge of interest in naturally occurring pesticides? Part of the story undoubtedly lies in the efforts to exploit commercially the many discoveries made by plant and insect physiologists about the chemical control of plant and animal habits. Such efforts would have occurred to a certain extent no matter what. but the magnitude of the enthusiasm for these substances is far higher than can be explained by mere hopes for commercial success. Pest control. particularly insect control. has been in a state of crisis since the mid-1950s.

Futhermore. both groups realize that insecticides can be self-defeating when used under certain conditions: target pests can become genetically resistant to the compounds and beneficial insects are killed. which causes the target pest or a previously innocuous insect to regain or reach the high numbers of pest-status. A wide range of alternative pest-control technologies were being developed even before Silent Spring was wntten. and work continues on them today.

The use of 15 MPa coolant supply pressure tend to suppress notching during machining thus improving tool life. while the use of higher coolant supply pressure of 20.3 MPa did not show improvement in tool life due probably to accelerated notch wear caused by water jet impingement erosion.

The production system consists of four main group operations: neutralizer. bleacher. filter. and deodorizer. The performance of the plant was evaluated by considering energy and exergy losses of each unit operation of the production process. The energy intensity for processing 100 tonnes of palm kennel oil into edible oil was estimated as 487.04 MJ/tonne with electrical energy accounting for 4.65%. thermal energy. 95.23% and manual energy. 0.12%. The most energy intensive group operation was the deodorizer accounting for 56.26% of the net energy input. The calculated exergy efficiency of the plant is 38.6% with a total exergy loss of 29.919 MJ. Consequently. the exergy analysis revealed that the deodorizer is the most inefficient group operation accounting for 52.41% of the losses in the production processes. Furthermore. a critical look at the different component of the plant revealed that the boilers are the most inefficient units accounting for 69.7% of the overall losses.

In this study. an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed for the analysis and prediction of tool wear parameters when machining Ti-6Al-4V alloy with conventional flow and high-pressure coolant flow. up to 203 bar. Machining trials were conducted at different cutting conditions for both rough and finish turning operations with uncoated carbide (K10 grade) and double TiAIN/TiN. PVD coated carbide (K10 substrate) inserts. The cutting parameters (cutting speed. feed rate. depth of cut. coolant pressure. and tool type) and the process parameters (cutting forces. feed force. machined surface roughness. and circularity) were used as input data set to train the three-layered feed-forward. back-propagation artificial neural networks. The networks were trained to predict tool life and wear rate separately.

Hence. approximate loading functions such as Cosine. Boussinesq. Eye-bar. Polynomial. Hertzian etc.. have been developed by different researchers. In this paper. analysis of different loading functions—Cosine (CLF). Boussinesq (BLF) and Eye-bar (ELF) at deferent inflation pressure of 0.3. 0.15 and 0 MPa at specified radial load of 4750N is carried out on a selected aluminium with ISO designation (6JX14H2; ET 42). The 3-D computer model of the wheel is generated and discretised into 3785 hexahedral elements and analysed with Creo Elements/Pro 5.0. Loading angle of 90 degree symmetric with the point of contact of the wheel with the ground is used for ELF. while 30 degrees contact angle is employed for both CLF and BLF. Von Mises stress is used as a basis for comparison of the different loading functions investigated with the experimental data obtained by Sherwood et al while the displacement values (as obtained from the FEM tool) are used as a basis for comparison of the different loading functions. as displacement is not covered by Sherwood et al. Results show that at 0.3MPa inflation pressure. the maximum stress value of CLF approaches the Sherwood value of about 14 MPa and that the CLF function values coincide with Sherwood values at three points along the curve. with values of about 13.8 MPa. 13 MPa and 6.4 MPa at about 0 degree. 15 degree and 20 degree respectively.

Turning experiments were conducted at different cutting conditions on a M300 Harrison lathe using Sandvic Coromant uncoated carbide inserts with ISO designations SNMA 120406 using full factorial design. Cutting speed (v). feed rate (f). depth of cut (d). spindle power (W). and length of cut (l) were the input parameters to both the machining experiments as well as the ANN prediction model while the flank wear (VB) and nose wear (NC) were the output variables. Nine different structures of multi-layer perceptron neural networks with feed-forward and back-propagation learning algorithms were designed using the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. An optimal ANN architecture of 5-12-4-2 with the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm and a learning rate of 0.1 was obtained using Taguchi method of experimental design. The results of ANN prediction show that the model generalized well with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 3.6% and 4.7% for flank and nose wear. respectively. With the optimized ANN architecture. parametric study was conducted to relate the effect of each turning parameters on the tool wear.

University College London,The genesis of the ‘impact agenda’ in the UK can be traced back to the Thatcher government. which required all public expenditure to be scrutinised. to demonstrate ‘value for money’ and to show ‘efficiency. effectiveness. and economy’. A 1993 white paper. “Realising our potential”. detailed this stance with reference to higher education more specifically. although prior work evaluating the impact of higher education on the economy exists (McNicoll 1993). Within universities in the UK. the impact agenda has taken the form of evaluation of academic practice and output. The latest round of the Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014). which assesses the quality of research generated by UK Higher Education Institutions included a section for academics to provide evidence of their impact on policy. industry or practice. These are referred to as ‘impact case studies’. and consist of a description of the research. and of the process through which this led to impact beyond academia.

In this article. we aim to quantify the current and historic capacity for African knowledge production to support the green economy in Africa. and identify important topical gaps. With a focus on topics relating to Governing Inclusive Green Growth in Africa (GIGGA). our research mapped how much Africa-focused research is being produced. from where and which African countries have higher or lower supply; and the topical focus of the research. mapping it against the African GIGGA policy discourses visible in government strategies. To do this we undertook a systematic review using a two-stage process. mapping the literature for GIGGA. This resulted in 960 verified citations. Content analysis of core metadata and article abstracts enabled mapping of the research focus. The analysis revealed a significant role for South Africa as both the pre-eminent producer of GIGGA literature as well as the geographic focus of GIGGA research. with Nigeria.

An attempt is made to clarify the meaning of neglect dyslexia. and to show that it is perhaps only isolable in cases of right neglect. Theories and evidence are examined. An experiment is presented in which 12 male right-handed normals made judgements about the midpoints of words and phrases. half palindromic half not. under three separate conditions. replicating a protocol used by Werth & P oppel (1987). The three conditions comprised a control where the actual stimulus was marked. a right anchor condition where the subject had to imagine where the midpoint would be if the stimulus ended at the anchor point. and similar condition with a left anchor point marking the start of the stimulus. Signi cant midpoint biases were found for stimulus type (ie palindromic vs. non-palindromic). condition (ie control. right or left anchor) and type interaction. and condition-length (ie short. medium or long) interactions.

Annex G–Governance,2014,ACG Cooper and A Park,,,,1-16,,This annex gives an overview of a range of mainly longitudinal studies that are currently carried out and their governance arrangements. The aim of this section is to try and infer from the structural arrangements in place for each of these studies. what is it that helps the study to endure? This is particularly pertinent for the UK Energy Lab as for it to provide maximum benefit it needs to continue for many years (at least 5). and to do that it needs effective governance arrangements. This annex is necessarily brief being one element of the wider feasibility study and should be seen as a starting point for further development and exploration of governance arrangements. We recommend further analysis of governance arrangements based on one or two studies explored here to ensure the final approach makes the best use of available UK experience in this domain. The key elements that the governance needs to achieve are: - Ensure funders’ interests are effectively represented so they feel ownership over the study. and therefore have an interest in continued investment. - Ensure the outputs of the study meet not just the funders needs in terms of relevant data provision but is able to add value to the wider sector’s research activities - Help the survey to navigate future uncertain funding scenarios. so the structure needs to enable the survey to be relatively flexible and adaptable to changing conditions - Ensure the quality and (relative) independence of the survey so that its foundations of influence – high quality. relevant data – are protected from (or are able to effectively balance the need to address) short-term interests that might undermine the wider …,True,mFLnRVcAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14673051583144188039&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1264491,Visual neglect needs more than attention,2001,Adam Cooper,12,NeuroReport,7,A47,LWW,Left visual neglect has been described as a purely attentional phenomenon. since it can be ameliorated by leftwards visual cuing. In contrast. evidence exists suggesting false proprioception of trunk orientation plays a role: left neglect can be mitigated by stimulating left neck muscles (neck-proprioceptive stimulation) or by injecting cold water into the left ear (caloric-vestibular stimulation). both of which result in an illusory leftwards twist of the trunk.However. left neck-proprioceptive and caloric-vestibular stimulation also provide spatial cues which alone may help to overcome neglect. This is the issue investigated by Rorden et al. Using a sensitive test of visual attention (lateralised temporal order onset detection). they stimulated the neck muscles of healthy observers. and compared their responses to a shoulder muscle stimulation baseline. No cuing effects were evident. though strong illusions of a change in trunk …,True,mFLnRVcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Fulltext/2001/05250/Visual_neglect_needs_more_than_attention.3.aspx,,,,,,0,0,0

1264493,Evaluating energy efficiency policy: experimental trials are the right answer to the wrong policy question,,Adam CG Cooper,,,,,,Vine et al.'s (2014) call for more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in government-funded energy efficiency policy evaluation practice is understandable but flawed. I agree with Vine et al that there is a serious gap in the knowledge landscape around evaluation of energy policy. but reject their claim that the absence of RCTs and other experimental design studies are the priority issue. Such a claim demonstrates a misunderstanding of the knowledge priorities for policy evaluation (the ‘policy epistemology’) and fails to recognise the epistemic mismatch between policy knowledge demands and those supplied by RCT designs. It also misses profound epistemic questions dogging the energy efficiency sector that are more important to solve if policy is to steer societies towards ever more effective use of energy resources. I argue that RCTs do have important features that need to be retained and deployed more widely in the drive to improve government-funded evaluation of energy efficiency policy. Further. large scale observational designs–longitudinal surveys that support quasi-experimental designs–should be a priority and with it a focus on generating the right kinds of socio-technical data for advancing effective energy efficiency policy.,True,mFLnRVcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8880070254530768178&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

Although many colloidal nanomaterials have been developed into optical sensors to detect biomolecules in vitro. their application in vivo as implantable sensors is hindered by potential migration or clearance from the implantation site. One potential solution is incorporating colloidal nanosensors in hydrogel scaffold prior to implantation. However. direct contact between the nanosensors and hydrogel matrix has the potential to disrupt sensor performance.

Feed-in tariff (FIT) programmes have been used successfully in many countries to make RETs more economically feasible. Unfortunately. the large capital costs of RETs can result both in the slow uptake of FIT programmes and incomplete capture of deployment potential.

The aluminium hat was custom designed and made from Al-3003 O and is formed using a custom steel alloy SPIF tool and vertical computer numeric control (CNC) mill. The second scenario (S2) involved doubling the feed rate and step down increment of the first scenario (S1). as well as using an eco-benign lubricant. The cost and energy used for the SPIF process without labour were found to be $4.48 and 4580 kJ (1.27 kWh) for S1 and $4.10 and 1420 kJ (0.39 kWh) for S2. respectively. The respective direct electrical energy required for making the hat was only 16% and 27% of the total required process energy for S1 and S2.

1264525,A study of energy. carbon dioxide emissions and economics in machining: milling and single point incremental forming,2011,Kadra Branker,,,,,,A simple model that includes energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the economics of machining is proposed. which has been published in the highly respected and cited journal. Annals of CIRP (International Academy for Production Engineering). This is a timely analysis in current government discussions on a proposed carbon tax or a carbon cap and trade regime and greater energy efficiency.  The new cost model is based on life cycle analysis methodology for the initial part production. An illustrative example is given showing that the cheapest electrical grid should not be chosen. if it also has the highest CO2 emissions. Accurate pricing is important. because the more expensive product was highly dependent on the carbon price. A comprehensive review of machining economic models is covered. However. there is a dearth of actual machining data in the literature. This work includes studies in milling and single point incremental forming (SPIF) which can be used by other manufacturing engineers in their machining economic model development. The first milling study involved simple straight cuts. In general. as feed rate (FD) increased (increasing the material removal rate. MRR). the energy consumed decreased as process time decreased. In contrast. as spindle speed (N) increased. energy consumed increased. since more power is drawn by the motor. without a process time reduction.

A major factor in this slow growth has been the relative lack of finance. including both traditional loans as well as less traditional forms of finance such as subordinated loans. convertible debentures and equity investment. Rural counties typically have bank loan-to-deposit ratios 30 percent below metropolitan counties. “Capital Flight” is a term denoting the serious disinvestment problem in rural America.

Programs. such as feed-in-tariffs (FITs) implemented in many countries for on-grid PV. provide economic incentives for investment. On the other hand. off-grid PV systems reduce energy poverty and increase both entrepreneurial productivity and return in rural isolated areas. Despite these social and economic justifications. there is still limited access to capital and appropriate financing mechanisms for the upfront cost. resulting in the slow uptake of solar PV under government programs. especially for poorer individuals. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending networks represent an abundant untapped financial resource for accelerating the deployment of PV technology. This paper considers an innovative P2P lending framework for A) financing solar PV on-grid under a FIT program and B) off-grid for a small business. whilst distributing both the environmental and economic advantages throughout the entire population.

1264533,Application of Nano‐Structured Ceramics to Gas Turbine Components–Material and Fabrication Process Selection,2009,Kadra Branker and Louis Liao,,Inquiry@ Queen's Undergraduate Research Conference Proceedings,,,,The ever increasing demand on the aerospace industry to improve efficiency has pushed the evolution of turbine technology. A fundamental approach to improve the efficiency of the turbine is to increase the operational temperature. Nano‐structured materials present a possible means of achieving higher operating temperatures in turbines over the limits of current materials (nickel based superalloys). Superalloys have a fairly short rupture life as the strength drops off quickly in operation at high temperature for long periods of time. leading to the failure of the component. Ceramics are able to operate at much higher temperatures than metals; however. existing fabrication techniques had not been able to make dense conventional ceramics with the desired long term properties. Nanostructured materials (grain size< 100 nm) have been observed to exhibit unique and often superior properties as compared with their conventional grain size counterparts. New innovation in nanostructured ceramics and sintering techniques provide insight into solving the problem of using ceramics in turbine components. In this presentation. the benefits of nanostructured materials. their mechanical properties and their high temperature performance will be discussed. The fracture strength of microstructured and nanostructured high temperature resistant ceramics will be found to evaluate the best candidate for this application. Through available research. we will demonstrate the superior properties of our chosen two‐phase nanostructured Silicon Carbide‐Silicon Nitride (SiC‐Si3N4) Ceramic. which is manufactured using Spark Plasma Sintering.,True,cKF_mTQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/inquiryatqueens/article/view/7497,,,,,,0,0,0
1264534,Inquiry into Extending the Life of Valve Rocker Arms in High Performance and Large Capacity Engine,2008,Kadra Branker,,Inquiry@ Queen's Undergraduate Research Conference Proceedings,,,,Valve rocker arms in an engine aid in the timing of the valves. The valves control the air intake and gas exhaust from the cylinder chamber in the engine which affect the efficiency of the engine. Although the rockers are small and fairly inexpensive compared to other parts in the engine the disruption in the timing of the valves can have catastrophic consequences once they fail. Rockers experience considerable cyclic forces due to the repeated tapping on the valves. increasing with the revolutions of the engine. As a result rocker arms exhibit fatigue failure which is amplified by residual stresses that are induced during manufacture. The manufacturing methods employed in making the rockers influence material properties along with the chosen materials which require specific methods of preparation. Proposed solutions include better alloying using powder metallurgy and the use of other materials in the design. such as ceramics. to improve their resilience and strength. The types of testing methods to determine the best solution and other possible areas of consideration. when solving the problem. will also be acknowledged. This presentation will illustrate how inquiry based learning can be used to solve the problem.

1264535,Exploring CHP systems as a Conservation Measure in the context of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Policy,,Kadra Branker and P Eng and Mehdi Hosseini and Allan Dicion,,,,,,The benefits of combined heat and power (CHP) systems to simultaneously provide heat and electricity have long been known in many jurisdictions. Depending on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity (EI) of the local electricity grid. CHP systems can either increase or decrease GHG emissions. As the world refocuses on GHG reduction policies. it is important to understand the environmental impacts of CHP projects and how their benefits can still be considered in low grid GHG EI locations as part of conservation programs. In Ontario. a cap and trade system commenced in January 2017. where CHP projects are incented as a conservation measure and have gained popularity with many industrial facilities to improve their energy efficiency and energy security. Therefore. there will be a need for either altering the engineering design of CHP projects to reduce their stack emissions. or for a change in the conservation program design to mitigate the impacts of the emissions while maintaining viable project economics.This paper provides an overview of technical and non-technical options to be considered for an energy conservation program for CHP projects. The advantage and disadvantages of each option are discussed from the perspective of the facilities where a CHP system is installed. and also that of the program designers. Additionally. a case study is used to demonstrate the potential cost impacts of implementing each of the proposed options in order to maintain the cost effectiveness of the CHP projects.,True,cKF_mTQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2017/data/polopoly_fs/1.3687860.1501159042!/fileserver/file/790257/filename/0036_0053_000061.pdf,,,,,https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2017/data/polopoly_fs/1.3687860.1501159042!/fileserver/file/790257/filename/0036_0053_000061.pdf,0,0,0

We investigate the potential of energy storage technologies to reduce renewable curtailment and CO 2 emissions in California and Texas under varying emissions taxes. We show that without energy storage. adding 60 GW of renewables to California achieves 72% CO 2 reductions (relative to a zero-renewables case) with close to one third of renewables being curtailed. Some energy storage technologies. on the other hand. allow 90% CO 2 reductions from the same renewable penetrations with as little as 9% renewable curtailment. In Texas. the same renewable-deployment level leads to 54% emissions reductions with close to 3% renewable curtailment.

This study determines the minimum cost configuration of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). wind turbines. and natural gas reciprocating engines in an off-grid model. A life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to determine the system configuration needed to achieve a variety of CO2-eq emissions targets. The relationship between total system costs and life cycle emissions are used to optimize the generation mixes to achieve emissions targets at the least cost and determine when VRFBs are preferable over wind curtailment.

This study examines four hypothetical wind and transmission projects in the United States to quantify the reduction in curtailment under various energy storage configurations and determine the cost targets that energy storage must achieve to become a viable solution for use with remote wind. The delivered cost of wind is determined using a power purchase agreement approach and six AC transmission voltage classes are considered. The findings show that curtailment reduction can be achieved with energy storage costs as high as $780/kW with ten hours of storage capacity. a value that is 50–85% lower than current cost estimates for redox and sodium sulfur batteries.

We describe an experimental set up specially designed for the investigation of drying kinetics. of heat transfer coefficient evolution. and of the mechanical torque necessary for stirring. This device was applied to municipal sewage sludge. Preliminary experiments were performed to investigate the influence of ageing of sludge on the drying kinetics. It appears that ageing does have no effect except for the first two days. The influences of the wall temperature. the stirrer speed. the dryer load and the location of the stirrer against the heated wall were studied.

The experimental device maintains isothermal conditions. The temperatures of treatment are: 380. 450 and 550°C. Three phases are obtained after pyrolysis: solid. liquid and gas and their composition is studied in relation to the temperature of the thermal treatment. The solid phase (char)—approximately 40% weight of the initial sample (steel free) mostly constituted of carbon. also contains the main mineral matter initially present in the used tyre. The char produced is brittle and has a high burning power which makes it suitable for burning when mixed with coal dust in coal burning power plants.

The process is shown to have significant potential advantage in terms of capital costs (by factors of several times) and comparable operating costs. Three potential variants of the process have been simulated and costed in terms of both capital and operating requirements for a commercial scale of operation. The differences are in the energy recovery systems. which include a simple condensation of the evaporated water and two different heat pump configurations. Simple condensation provides the simplest process. but the energy efficiency gain of an open heat pump offset this. making it economically somewhat more attractive.

The vehicle then rolls along the line to perform an inspection. Special attention is given to the vehicle's onboard vision system. which consists of a monocular camera and LiDAR used together to compute the pose of the vehicle relative to the power line.

The entire cycle for producing energy was considered. not just part. The most important conclusion drawn is that the risk to human health from nonconventional sources can be as high as. or even higher than. that of conventional sources. This result is produced only when the risk per unit energy is considered. rather than the risk per solar panel or windmill. The risk from nonconventional energy sources derives from the large amount of material and labor needed. along with their backup and storage requirements. Risk evaluation is a relatively new discipline. and therefore the results presented here can be considered only a beginning.

1264696,Slaying the NIMBY dragon,1998,Herbert Inhaber,,,,,Transaction Publishers,"A mob scene erupted in April 1990 in the sleepy hamlet of Caneada. a small town on the northern edge of the Allegheny Mountains. In addition to riots and numerous arrests. six senior citizens. handcuffed to a heavy chain. formed a human barricade across the steel bridge spanning the Genesee River. Their purpose was to prevent the siting commission of a low-level radioactive waste dump from getting across the bridge. In the past few decades. finding sites for undesirable facilities. such as prisons and garbage landfills. has become ever more difficult. The difficulty lies not in tracking down technically suitable sites. but in the so-called NIMBY syndrome. People might agree that a facility is desperately needed just as long as it is Not In My Backyard. The unfortunate results of this proverbial game of hot potato are ever-mounting social and economic costs. State and local governments will continue to spend small fortunes finding sites to facilities that everyone desires hi principle but nobody seems to want on their block. In"" Slaying the NIMBY Dragon."" Herbert Inhaber draws on the experience of many NIMBY cases. He discusses new approaches to overcoming NIMBY. such as. the reverse Dutch auction. Reverse. because undesirable objects are being auctioned.

The authors document the dramatic disparities in the distributions of income and wealth and describe the problems these cause. Their solution. thealternative distribution system. is quite simple: tax inheritance rather than estates. Individuals could inherit up to $1 million tax free. Each succeeding million would be taxed at progressively higher rates. This plan. they argue. would force an estate to be distributed among more people and would cuase beneficiaries to use inheritances morevigorously and creatively.'The authors do an excellent job of making obscure economic data understandable.

1264707,Why energy conservation fails,1997,Herbert Inhaber,,,,,Greenwood Publishing Group,Energy efficiency and energy conservation are often thought to be the same. They are not. according to Herbert Inhaber. Only when less total energy is consumed by all users will energy actually be saved. Energy efficiency schemes do not accomplish this goal of conservation: when one person or nation conserves energy. there is just more of it for others to use elsewhere. This is the first book to answer. comprehensively and objectively. the question: Do government energy conservation programs hinder or help the nation? Says Inhaber. the fact that billions of dollars have been spent on energy conservation programs. without giving a searching look at what has been accomplished. is a national scandal. Clear. concise. and with numerous useful graphs and tables. this book is an important first step toward making us all aware of what energy conservation actually is--and is not--and how it can and should be implemented. This work includes chapters on how conservation is applied in the electric utility world. whether waste truly exists. the economic aspect of conservation. its relation to Marxism. and past examples of conservation failures. Inhaber reviews many of the points that were first made by Stanley Jevons. the father of modern quantitative economics. who stated more than 130 years ago that increased efficiency often produces greater overall energy use. not less. Inhaber concludes that a remedy claimed to cure all ills will cure none. The faith placed in conservation as a solution to a mountain of problems is. in large part. misplaced.

1264708,How to solve the problem of siting nuclear waste,1990,Herbert Inhaber,62,Transactions of the American Nuclear Society,,61-62,,[en] Over the past decades. attempts to site new low-level and high-level radioactive wastes (LLRW and HLRW) have been almost universally frustrated. The twin goals of finding a volunteer site and. at the same time. retaining environmental and safety standards and specifications can be achieved by using a reverse Dutch auction (RDA). This apparently is the only extant system that allows these two aims to be achieved simultaneously. The RDA adds an economic dimension to the already existent risk factors. At the same time. it is not a bribe. since any payments made will be public. A bribe is performed in secret and to attain an illegal purpose. The RDA has neither feature. In a standard (or English) auction. the price rises. and these are multiple bids. In a Dutch auction. the price drops. and there is only one bid. Since an RDA deals with a facility generally regarded as undesirable. its price rises. but there is still only one bid. The RDA would work as follows. A list of environmental criteria would be circulated to all counties at the start of the process. In this discussion. it is assumed that a state is attempting to site LLRW. but the principle is also applicable to interstate compacts or HLRW. These criteria should remain fixed. Past siting proposals have often seen the alteration-or attempted alteration-of criteria in mid-stream. leading to loss of confidence in the system's scientific credibility.

Avec les progrès de l'électronique de puissance. liés à l'apparition de composants interrupteurs rapides. et le développement des technologies numériques de commande. câblées ou programmées. il est possible à présent. de choisir une structure de commande beaucoup plus évoluée. Ainsi. la commande vectorielle à flux rotorique orienté d'une machine à induction peut maintenant mettre en évidence des principes de contrôle du couple permettant d'obtenir des performances équivalentes à celles de la machine à courant continu.

By six arguments not widely recognized in the climate policy arena. we argue that unrealistic technology optimism exists in current climate change mitigation assessments. and. consequently. world energy and climate policy. The overarching theme of the arguments is that incomplete knowledge of indirect effects. and neglect of interactions between parts of physical and social sub-systems. systematically leads to overly optimistic assessments.

Sweden and Finland,2018,Cristina-Maria Iordan and Xiangping Hu and Anders Arvesen and Pekka Kauppi and Francesco Cherubini,13,Carbon balance and management,1,1-16,BioMed Central,Forests and forest products can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation by stabilizing and even potentially decreasing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Harvested wood products (HWP) represent a common widespread and cost-efficient opportunity for negative emissions. After harvest. a significant fraction of the wood remains stored in HWPs for a period that can vary from some months to many decades. whereas atmospheric carbon (C) is immediately sequestered by vegetation re-growth. This temporal mismatch between oxidation of HWPs and C uptake by vegetation generates a net sink that lasts over time. The role of temporary carbon storage in forest products has been analysed and debated in the scientific literature. but detailed bottom-up studies mapping the fate of harvested materials and quantifying the associated emission profiles at national scales are rare. In this work. we quantify the net CO2 emissions and the temporary carbon storage in forest products in Norway. Sweden and Finland for the period 1960–2015. and investigate their correlation. We use a Chi square probability distribution to model the oxidation rate of C over time in HWPs. taking into consideration specific half-lives of each category of products. We model the forest regrowth and estimate the time-distributed C removal. We also integrate the specific HWP flows with an emission inventory database to quantify the associated life-cycle emissions of fossil CO2. CH4 and N2O.

1264844,Understanding the environmental implications of energy transitions. A case study for wind power,2013,Anders Arvesen,,,,,,A fundamental change in the ways in which we provide energy to run our economies. an energy transition. is needed to mitigate climate change. Wind power is an important part of future global energy supply in most energy scenarios. This thesis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the environmental implications of energy transitions. primarily by examining the case of wind power. This involves new investigations of both potential negative impacts of wind power and the positive role of the technology in emission reduction. as well as a critical review of past research. Three papers on wind power are presented: a comprehensive literature review of life cycle assessments (LCA) of wind power. a scenario-based LCA of large-scale adoption of wind power. and an LCA of an offshore wind farm. A hybrid LCA methodology is employed in the scenario-based LCA and LCA of an offshore wind farm. Another paper is presented which is not concerned with wind power in particular. but takes the form of an evaluation of limitations of climate change mitigation literature. It helps to achieve the aim stated above by bringing together knowledge of indirect effects of mitigation measures. and by elucidating how these effects may influence the viability of proposed mitigation strategies.

1264845,Deep decarbonisation towards 1.5° C-2° C stabilisation,2016,Gunnar Luderer and Elmar Kriegler,,,,,Potsdam Institut für Klimafolgenforschung,Limiting global mean warming to well below 2°C or even 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels requires a major transformation of the energy system. The ADVANCE project has analysed this mitigation challenge in detail. from the implications of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions  INDCs) to decarbonisation bottlenecks in energy end-use sectors. taking into account both technological as well as behavioural emission reduction measures. Our key fndings are: The implementation of the Paris Agreement initiates a low-carbon transition for major emitting countries but an intensifcation of global effort is still required in order to limit global warming well below 2°C. In 2030. the implementation of the INDCs is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 10% of pre-Paris Reference emission levels. However. the global emissions gap relative to cost-optimal reduction pathways remains at 14 [4-25]1 GtCO2eq for the 2°C target and 25 [13-30] GtCO2eq for the 1.5°C target. The decarbonisation of the power sector accounts for more than half the CO2 reductions achieved by the INDCs in 2030. It also holds the greatest potential for further near-term eductions which would put the world on track for 1.5-2°C stabilisation. In 2030. the INDCs are expected to generate an increase in the share of zero carbon power supply by 5% [1-12%] relative to pre-existing trends. achieving a total share of 48% [40-66%]. Optimal 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios feature 57% [50-90%] and 73% [57-93%] zero carbon power supply respectively. In contrast. the INDCs have little effect on near-term emissions from non-electric end-use. even though progress in abating emissions …,True,9LqymcoAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,5,https://elib.dlr.de/121344/,2932354821356747655,/scholar?cites=2932354821356747655,,,https://elib.dlr.de/121344/1/ADVANCE-Synthesis-Report_05.pdf,0,0,0

1264847,Utslipp av klimagasser fra flytrafikk,2007,Anders Arvesen and Edgar Hertwich,,,,9,Program for industriell økologi (IndEcol). NTNU,Klimagassutslipp fra internasjonal luftfart er ikke inkludert i SSBs klimaregnskap og er holdt utenfor Kyotoprotokollen. Utslippene av CO2 fra flytrafikk øker raskt. både i et nasjonalt og globalt perspektiv. Når både innenlands og utenlands trafikk tas med i beregningene. ble utslippene forbundet med nordmenns flyreiser fordoblet i perioden fra 1992 til 2005. Flyreiser utgjorde i 2005 omtrent 7. 5% av Norges totale CO2-utslipp. Samtidig er det et faktum at flyutslipp bidrar mer til menneskeskapt global oppvarming enn utslippene av CO2 alene tilsier. I dette notatet justeres CO2-utslippene for også å ta hensyn til tileggsvirkninger. og det fås da at utslipp fra fly utgjorde 10. 1% av Norges totale utslipp av klimagasser i 2005. Justeringen er usikker. men anslaget på 10. 1% antas å være et konservativt anslag. Ferie og helgeturer er den typen reiser som forårsaker mest utslipp (41. 7% av totale utslipp). etterfulgt av yrkesreiser (29. 3%). De som foretar flest flyreiser er menn. personer med høy utdanning og inntekt. administrative ledere og personer med akademiske yrker og personer som bor i større byer. Tre scenarier for utslipp fra flytrafikk fram mot 2020 gir alle betydelige økninger i utslippene. I scenariet for middels vekst er utslippene i 2020 totalt 13. 8 millioner tonn (Mtonn) CO2-ekvivalenter. det vil si 7. 8 Mtonn høyere enn i 2005. når tilleggsvirkninger på grunn av høyde tas hensyn til. Økningen på 7. 8 Mtonn tilsvarer 11 millioner tur-retur reiser Oslo–Paris. En slik utslippsøkning vil spise opp en betydelig del av utslippsreduksjonene som regjeringen legger opp til i sin klimamelding fra 2007.,True,9LqymcoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,http://www.flyglarm.se/Rapport_NTNU.pdf,18292319254225378712,/scholar?cites=18292319254225378712,,,http://www.flyglarm.se/Rapport_NTNU.pdf,0,0,0

Some of these contaminants are persistent and bioaccumulative. becoming a great concern as they are released into the environment. Despite the abundance of wastewater treatment technologies. the adsorption method overall has proven to be an excellent way to treat wastewater from multiple industry sources. Because of its significant benefits. ie. easy availability. handling. and higher efficiency with a low cost relative to other treatments. adsorption is opted as the best method to be used. However. biosorption using naturally found seaweeds has been proven to have promising results in removing pollutants. such as dyes from textile. paper. and the printing industry. nitrogen. and phosphorous and phenolic compounds. as well as heavy metals from various sources. Due to its ecofriendly nature together with the availability and inexpensiveness of raw materials. biosorption via seaweed has become an alternative to the existing technologies in removing these pollutants from wastewater effectively. In this article. the use of low-cost adsorbent (seaweed) for the removal of pollutants from wastewater has been reviewed.

Malaysia has been known as one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of palm oil products. Every year. the number of palm oil mills increases rapidly. thus increasing the capacity of fresh fruit bunch waste or effluent discharge. Based on the data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board in 2012. Malaysia produced 99.85 million tons of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) per year. However. about 5–5.7 tons of water was required in order to sterilize the palm fruit bunches and clarify the extracted oil to produce 1 ton of crude palm oil resulting in 50% of the water turning into palm oil mill effluent (POME). POME is one of the major environmental pollutants in Malaysia. The characteristics of POME and its behavior. if discharged directly. in water are described in this chapter. The suspended solid and nutrient content in POME could be able to support the growth of algae. This chapter aims to demonstrate that POME could be used as a main source for algae production. and this effluent is one of the main environmental problems in the tropical region especially in Malaysia.,True,9vMipXcAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,25,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jS6RDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA13&dq=info:DKJBZLsRpQEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=i7AMMlS-qv&sig=6X1pXAhQ-LbcVo7i1-ekHx5ABAM,118520461733765644,/scholar?cites=118520461733765644,,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/palm-oil/palm-oil-mill-effluent-as-an-environmental-pollutant,0,0,0

The impacts of H2O2: Fe 2+ ratio. Fe 2+ concentration. pH and process reaction time were studied closely. The results showed that the highest and lowest predicted chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency were 78.9% and 9.3%. respectively. The overall prediction error using the developed ANN model was within− 0.625%. The derived model was adequate in predicting responses (R 2= 0.9896 and prediction R 2= 0.6954). The initial pH. H2O2: Fe 2+ ratio and Fe 2+ concentrations had positive effects. whereas coagulation pH had no direct effect on COD removal. Optimized conditions under specified constraints were obtained at pH= 3. Fe 2+ concentration= 781.25 mg/L. reaction time= 28.04 min and H2O2: Fe 2+ ratio= 2. Under these optimized conditions. 100% COD removal was predicted.

In particular. they were used (i) to complete performance diagrams for unavailable experimental data; (ii) to assess the influence of ambient parameters on performance; and (iii) to analyze and predict emissions of pollutants in the exhausts.The experimental data used to feed the ANNs were acquired from a manufacturer’s test bed. Though large. the data set did not cover the whole working range of the turbine; ANNs and an artificial neural fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) were therefore applied to fill information gaps. The results of this investigation were also used for sensitivity analysis of the machine’s behavior in different ambient conditions.ANNs can effectively evaluate both MGT performance and emissions in real installations in any climate. the worst R2 in the validation set being 0.9962.,True,61KaTjcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,63,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890410003699,820362527849933063,/scholar?cites=820362527849933063,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45026276/Application_of_artificial_neural_network20160423-6547-3ror3s.pdf,0,0,0

Although a lot of interest is dedicated to large scale systems (up to 300 tons per day). a small-scale Liquid Air Energy Storage can be used as energy storage as part of a microgrid and/or an energy distribution network. However. when scaling down the size of the system. the round trip efficiency decreases due to the low performance of the liquefaction process. In this paper a preliminary study on the optimal configuration for a microgrid scale liquefaction cycle (10 tons per 12 h) for a Liquid Air Energy Storage application is proposed in order to minimize the specific consumption.

Nonetheless. with India’s population of about 1.4 billion people. the grid supplies just under 900 kilowatt hours (kWh) of generation per capita (FY 2018). which is one-third of the world average and 14 times less than average U.S. consumption. In addition to low average consumption. approximately 32 million homes still lack an electricity connection as of April 2018.6 The Indian government has ambitious plans to connect all homes to electricity by 2019.,True,Vt6rBZ0AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,11,https://www.think-asia.org/handle/11540/8880,13646753479060686072,/scholar?cites=13646753479060686072,,,https://www.think-asia.org/bitstream/handle/11540/8880/India-Renewable-Power-v10.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1264996,Indian railways and coal: An unsustainable interdependency,2018,Puneet Kamboj and Rahul Tongia,,,,,Brookings India,The majority of India’s coal reserves are concentrated in the eastern parts of India. while consumption of coal is scattered all across the country. Because of this uneven geographical distribution in coal supply and demand. transportation of coal plays an important role in the ecosystem. In FY 2017. the total raw coal supplied3 in India was 842 million tonnes (MT) (Ministry of Coal. 2017). of which 533 MT (Railway Board. 2018) was transported through railways. The volume of coal carried by Indian Railways (IR) was 48 per cent of its total freight in tonnes. and accounted for 45 per cent of its total freight revenue. Coal users and the railways would both collapse without the other. More than volumes and financials. the relationship between coal and railways runs deep at an institutional level. A senior railways officer is deputed to Coal India Limited (CIL) for coordination. and CIL members work closely with the traffic division of railways. The process is relatively plan-oriented and schedules for traffic are projected a year ahead or even further. There are limited market-oriented mechanisms for allocation of transportation capacity – all end-users can ask for railways haulage as available. Any short-term shock to the system like heavy regional rains. low hydropower output. or diminished RE output during the windy season can cause an imbalance beyond the buffer capacity of the system. More importantly. even buffers. e.g.. the minimum stockpiles of coal that all power plants are expected to maintain. are often not enough.,True,Vt6rBZ0AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,11,https://www.think-asia.org/handle/11540/8571,12362209694849894909,/scholar?cites=12362209694849894909,,,https://www.think-asia.org/bitstream/handle/11540/8571/Railways-and-coal.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1264998,Coal in India: Adjusting to transition,2019,Rahul Tongia and Samantha Gross,,,,,Brookings India,Coal is the source of half of commercial primary energy in India. However. non-commercial biomass is still an important energy source. making up roughly one-quarter of total primary energy. The power sector uses the majority of India’s coal (Figure 1) and coal dominates supply in the sector. in both capacity and generation terms (Figure 2 and Figure 3). India primarily uses domestic coal. but also imports roughly 200 million tons of coal annually. including coking coal used in steel plants. Power plants are designed to operate on coal of a specific quality—small deviations may lower efficiency while larger differences may not allow operations. Many plants in coastal areas far from coal mines are designed to run on imported coal. Imports are also blended with domestic coal to improve the average heat value—Indian coal generally has a high ash content and low heat value.,True,Vt6rBZ0AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,9,https://think-asia.org/handle/11540/9782,10048972885888732887,/scholar?cites=10048972885888732887,,,https://think-asia.org/bitstream/handle/11540/9782/Tongia_and_Gross_2019_Coal_In_India_Adjusting_To_Transition.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This hypothesis perceives governments as revenue-maximizing entities which seek to exploit the citizenry through excessive rates of taxation. The degree of exploitation depends on the number of competing governments and citizen. mobility. Ceteris paribus. the Leviathan hypothesis predicts an inverse relationship between public sector size and fiscal decentralization as measured by the number of competing governmental jurisdictions. Wallace Oates identifies three alternatives to the Leviathan hypothesis. The first is that there is no systematic relationship between the size of the public sector and fiscal decentralization.

For example. regression based models of religious giving. typically utilizing data on congregations and congregational contributions. lend considerable support to the observation that Catholics contribute less in amount and as a share of income than do Protestants. A number of possible explanations for this difference can be offered. Two often cited reasons are: (1) a lower estimated marginal propensity to give out of income for Catholics than for Protestants and (2) the more formalized structure of the giving process found in Protestant denominations.

Shell. Mobil. and Texaco. according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). It is tempting to conclude that this increase can be attributed to the many advances in seismic and drilling technologies that have occurred over the same period. However. such a conclusion may be premature given that much of the increase in the success rate occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s. well before the major advancements in seismic technology. The conclusion may also be premature in that it ignores the relationship between price and the success rate. Increases in the price may positively (negatively) affect the success rate. Given this. and the decline in price over the past decade. one would expect the success rate to have declined (increased) in the absence of technological change. This paper develops an econometric model that attempts to disentangle and quantify the effects of the major factors hypothesized to affect the offshore exploratory success rate.

1265017,Do Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Reﬂect Economic Fundamentals? Evidence from the California ISO,2014,Kevin Forbes and Ernest Zampelli,35,Energy Journal,3,129-144,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper hypothesizes that if day-ahead markets for electricity are efficient. then the day-ahead prices will reflect the processed information and expectations of all market participants regarding the next day's electricity load and thus the prices may be useful in actually predicting the next day's load. We test this hypothesis using data for the PG&E aggregation area in the California ISO. The results provide evidence of a positive and significant relationship between the hourly day-ahead electricity price (relative to the natural gas price) and the subsequent actual hourly load. The reported relationship is sufficiently robust to produce a forecast based on the day-ahead hourly price relative to the price of natural gas. some binary variables. and a number of estimated ARMA disturbances that is considerably more accurate than the ISO's day-ahead forecast.

1265018,An anatomy of space weather's electricity market impact: Case of the PJM power grid and the performance of its 500 kV transformers,2010,Kevin F Forbes and OC St. Cyr,8,Space Weather,9,,,The PJM Interconnection is a regional electricity transmission organization which as of 30 April 2004 coordinated the dispatch of electricity over 320.000 km of transmission lines. The backbone of PJM's transmission system is a series of 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines and transformers. PJM operates both hourly real‐time and day‐ahead markets for energy. The differences between PJM's real‐time and day‐ahead prices reflect unexpected operating conditions. Using ground‐based magnetometer data as a proxy for geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). we present evidence that the differences between PJM's real‐time and day‐ahead prices are statistically related with the GIC proxy. Extra high voltage energy losses and a measure of real‐time congestion costs are also shown to be statistically related with the GIC proxy.

It is tempting to conclude that this increase can be attributed to the many advances in seismic and drilling technology that have occurred over the same period. However. such a conclusion may be premature. While the average success rate for the industry is substantially higher. the success rate for a group of large technologically progressive producers including Exxon Mobil. Shell. Chevron. and Texaco was only marginally higher in 1998 than in 1978. Building on the work of Forbes and Zampelli (2000) that examined the impact of technology on the offshore success rate. this paper develops an econometric model that attempts to disentangle and quantify the effects of the major factors hypothesized to affect the onshore exploratory success rate.

Another key instrument is the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS). which caps the overall level of emissions and then permits trade among the emitters.Using data from Ireland. this paper examines the effects of wind energy and the EU ETS on carbon emissions from electricity generation. We estimate a time-series econometric model of CO2 emissions for each half hour over the period 1 January 2015 through 17 April 2018. Results indicate that increases in the carbon allowance price significantly reduce carbon emissions when errors in load assessments and wind energy forecasts are equal to zero.

One of the cheaper and more important sources of natural gas supply is accounted for by reserve appreciation. ie. reserve growth. in known fields. Based on an extensively applied methodology developed by Arrington (1960). the increase in proved ultimate recovery is presumed to increase at a diminishing rate with the age of the field. In this paper. a single equation model of natural gas reserve growth in the Gulf of Mexico is developed and estimated. The results strongly suggest that the annual growth rate in the reserves of a field is significantly affected by initial discovery size. price. water depth. and unobserved field-specific effects.

The analysis is meant to provide further insight on MILD regime boundaries and to identify the effect of hot products speciation. As the mass fraction of hot products in the reactants mixture increases. autoignition occurs earlier. Species profiles show that the products/reactants mixture approximately equilibrates to a new state over a quick transient well before the main autoignition event. but as dilution becomes very high. this equilibration transient becomes more prominent and eventually merges with the primary ignition event.

Using single and two-shot CH-PLIF. Watson et al.[2] observed local discontinuities in the flame front of a turbulent. lifted CH4/air flame. Similar local discontinuities were observed by Hult et al.[1] in a round. unpiloted. turbulent jet flame operated close to blow-off. Such discontinuities are frequently associated with large-scale flow structures and have been interpreted as being representative of local flame extinction [1-3]. It is well established [6] that strain resulting from vortex-flame interactions is often sufficiently large to induce local extinction of the reaction zone. In the case of burner-attached turbulent jet-flames. such flame front discontinuities are invariably associated with local extinction. However. in the case of lifted flames a variety of mechanisms including downstream flame propagation. local extinction and out-of-plane motion may give rise to such discontinuities.,True,7tTHfjcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,38,https://elib.dlr.de/57157/1/Boxx2009CF_brief_comm_manuscript.pdf,3659473654687785765,/scholar?cites=3659473654687785765,,,https://elib.dlr.de/57157/1/Boxx2009CF_brief_comm_manuscript.pdf,0,0,0

The insightful book contributes to developing the architecture for a post-2012 global climate agreement and. in doing so. seeks and proposes new approaches to climate change mitigation by linking it to the international trade system. The author suggests the adoption of a bottom-up approach to climate change negotiations by using the evolution of multilateral trade agreements as a model for reaching a global climate treaty. He discusses the innovative approach of inserting climate goals within regional trade agreements. given their proliferation–especially bilateral–in the international trading system.

This book. which deals with the institutional framework of EC trade law. and with special emphasis on services trade. examines the law and practice of EC external trade relations from a policy. economic. and legal angle. with a European Union (EU) constitutional dimension. The major point of analysis is to find ways to ensure the unitary character of EC external trade relations in areas of shared competence between EU Member States and EU institutions. as well as to understand the management of the EC's external trade relations. The book begins with an analysis of the evolution of the EC common commercial policy. through which the author examines the checks and balances at the micro. meso. and macro levels. The problem of the EU in its external relations and the legal complexity of mixed agreements are then analyzed. This unique legal phenomenon is tackled from an intra-EC perspective as well as from its external dimension. where its various implications for third parties are taken into account. The major EU institutions are examined: the Commission as the negotiator of international trade agreements. the EU Council and the European Parliament for the conclusion and ratification of agreements. and the European Court of Justice in relation to judicial enforcement.

Highly crystalline cubic shape C70 crystals (FC) were grown at a liquid–liquid interface formed between tert-butyl alcohol and C70 solution in mesitylene. HFCs were then prepared by washing with isopropanol of the FC at 25 °C. The growth directions and diameters of C70 nanorods could be controlled by varying washing conditions. HFCs perform as an excellent sensing system for vapor-phase aromatic solvents due to their easy diffusion through the mesoporous architecture and strong π–π interactions with the sp2 carbon-rich pore walls.

In this experimental study. dripping behaviors during the flame spread over horizontal and vertical polyethylene (PE) insulated wires were investigated without external airflow. Two different wire dimensions – core/wire diameter of 3.5/8.0 and 5.5/9.0 mm – and three different PE insulations were tested.

Therefore. understanding the ignition dynamics of coal dust deposits in oxygen-enriched environment is essential for the prevention of fire and dust explosion. In this work. both hot-oven and hot-plate tests were conducted to study the self-ignition behaviour of coal dusts in O2/CO2 ambient with O2 mole fraction from 21% to 50%. Three coal dusts: Indonesian Sebuku coal. Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and South African coal were tested with different sizes. Experimental results revealed that the self-ignition risk increased significantly with the increasing O2 mole fraction: reducing both the critical ignition temperature (10 °C in hot-oven test and 40 °C in hot-plate test) and the ignition delay time. Comparatively. the inhibiting effect of CO2 was found to be small for self-ignition.

Carbon-rich soils are reactive porous materials. prone to smouldering combustion if the inert and moisture contents are low enough. An example of soil combustion happens in peatlands. where smouldering wildfires are common in both boreal and tropical regions. This work focuses on understanding soil ignition by self-heating. which is due to spontaneous exothermic reactions in the presence of oxygen under certain thermal conditions. We investigate the effect of soil inorganic content by creating under controlled conditions soil samples with inorganic content (IC) ranging from 3% to 86% of dry weight: we use sand as a surrogate of inorganic matter and peat as a surrogate of organic matter.

Correlations between the flame length and the fuel mass-loss rate have revealed a delayed transition to turbulence for flames residing on the underside of fuel samples. and an earlier transition to turbulence for flames on the topside of these samples. compared to traditional vertical wall flames. As the fuel inclination increases. the relationship between the flame length and fuel mass-loss rate ranges between a recent theoretical prediction for a laminar wall plume dominated by diffusion and the traditional prediction for a turbulent wall plume dominated by convective mixing. The buoyancy-induced flow field. characterized by the flame tilt angle is shown to correspond to previously-found modifications of heat-flux profiles ahead of the flame front. which control flame spread. and the heat flux to the burning surface of the fuel. which controls fuel mass-loss rates.

However. the current grid paradigm of load-following supplies is unable to utilize these sources without impractical deployments of backup generation and gridscale energy storage. Thus. it will be crucial to have energy agile loads: electric loads that can dynamically adapt their energy consumption. Data centers are prime candidates for becoming energy agile because they are large energy consumers and often have workloads that can be shaped to vary their power consumption. In this paper we present an energy agile cluster that is power proportional (uses power proportional to its workload) and exposes slack (the ability to temporarily delay or degrade service to reduce power consumption). We describe a prototype cluster that consumes 60% less energy on typical workloads by being power proportional. Then. using month-long traces from a 9572 node computing cluster and a California wind farm. we show how a grid-aware scheduler can use workload slack to reduces dependence on non-renewable energy sources to 40% of its original level.

Here we use multipollutant (NO2. SO2) satellite observations from 2005 to 2017 to quantify gas flaring activity in Mexico's offshore production cluster. which produces ~50–70% of the country's oil and is among the world's largest oil fields. We estimate annual flared gas volume ranging from 5.5 to 20 × 109 m3 over the Mexican offshore corresponding to >40% associated gas production. which is significantly larger than for instance offshore United States where reportedly <3% of associated gas is flared. The 13‐year record of satellite‐derived gas flaring indicates a drastic increase until 2008 and a decline afterward. While the increased flaring is associated with efforts to enhance oil production. the post‐2008 decline is linked to an expanding capacity of associated gas utilization. providing a …,True,fjtrFuIAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,17,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL081145,9117287911245988295,/scholar?cites=9117287911245988295,,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2018GL081145,0,0,0

Free organic radicals are present in petroleum asphaltenes but their molecular nature is poorly known owing to the multiplicity of their molecular structures which causes the appearance of a single unresolved EPR signal with a linewidth of 4–6 Gauss. In spite of the poorly resolved signals the microwave power dependence of EPR line intersities gives some insights into the nature of the aromatic rings condensation. More aromatic asphaltenes show higher saturation power of the EPR lines: this fact has been explained by a spin exchange mechanism between π-π electronic clouds of adjacent molecules. supported also by some XRD evidences.

Using light-induced EPR (LEPR). we observed the generation of charge-separated states in the blend upon visible light excitation. and we detected the formation of the PCBM excited triplet state by using time-resolved EPR (TREPR) with microsecond time resolution. From spectral simulation of the TREPR spectrum we were able to identify a double pathway for the PCBM triplet generation: the normal intersystem crossing from PCBM excited singlet state (either directly produced by light absorption or populated by singlet–singlet energy transfer from the polymer) and a generation pathway via polaron pairs recombination.

This acidity. related to the presence of naphthenic acids (NAs). is considered responsible for a number of drawbacks in refinery. such as corrosion of pipelines and devices. The understanding of the corrosion activity of NAs is complex because of their wide distribution of physical properties and the simultaneous presence in the oil of other species contributing to corrosion (e.g.. H2S). In this work. the distribution of NAs was determined by a combination of infrared (IR) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) techniques in crude oils before and after corrosivity tests.
