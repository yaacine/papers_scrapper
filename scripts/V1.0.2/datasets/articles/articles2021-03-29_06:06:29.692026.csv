Mesoporosity provides the desired highly accessible surfaces but many applications also demand long-range electronic connectivity and structural coherence 6. A mesoporous single-crystal (MSC) semiconductor can meet both criteria. Here we demonstrate a general synthetic method of growing semiconductor MSCs of anatase TiO 2 based on seeded nucleation and growth inside a mesoporous template immersed in a dilute reaction solution. We show that both isolated MSCs and ensembles incorporated into films have substantially higher conductivities and electron mobilities than does nanocrystalline TiO 2.

1265722,Taming the sun: innovations to harness solar energy and power the planet,2018,Varun Sivaram,,,,,MIT Press,How solar could spark a clean-energy transition through transformative innovation—creative financing. revolutionary technologies. and flexible energy systems. Solar energy. once a niche application for a limited market. has become the cheapest and fastest-growing power source on earth. What's more. its potential is nearly limitless—every hour the sun beams down more energy than the world uses in a year. But in Taming the Sun. energy expert Varun Sivaram warns that the world is not yet equipped to harness erratic sunshine to meet most of its energy needs. And if solar's current surge peters out. prospects for replacing fossil fuels and averting catastrophic climate change will dim. Innovation can brighten those prospects. Sivaram explains. drawing on firsthand experience and original research spanning science. business. and government. Financial innovation is already enticing deep-pocketed investors to fund solar projects around the world. from the sunniest deserts to the poorest villages. Technological innovation could replace today's solar panels with coatings as cheap as paint and employ artificial photosynthesis to store intermittent sunshine as convenient fuels. And systemic innovation could add flexibility to the world's power grids and other energy systems so they can dependably channel the sun's unreliable energy. Unleashing all this innovation will require visionary public policy: funding researchers developing next-generation solar technologies. refashioning energy systems and economic markets. and putting together a diverse clean energy portfolio.

In this work. we investigate the charge transport properties of TiO2 MSCs after annealing them within a confining template at temperatures from 500 to 850 °C. We observe that higher anneal temperatures do not change the crystal phase. as in nanocrystalline TiO2. but do influence the MSC absorption spectrum in a manner consistent with the signature of increased oxygen-vacancy defects.

We demonstrate that the collection efficiency extracted by measuring transient decay rates at short circuit deviates considerably from the true value as ηc decreases. This discrepancy arises from two sources of error: first. transient voltage decay rates are especially sensitive to perturbation size near short circuit. and second. the decay rates are influenced by transient equilibration between trapped and free charge during the measurement. Only if the collection efficiency is high (>90%) do the true and measured values coincide well. This finding finally elucidates the disparity between steady-state and transient measurements of the collection efficiency; the former is more accurate for devices with a low ηc. and the latter for devices with a high ηc.

1265743,The Next Generation of Federal Clean Electricity Tax Credits,2019,Varun Sivaram and Noah Kaufman,,Center on Global Energy Policy,,,,1. Tailor tax incentives to critical applications. Decarbonizing the power sector will require commercializing an array of technologies to perform a range of functions. most notably to provide enhanced flexibility to the power system to accommodate the rise of cheap but intermittent renewable energy. Such functions likely include capturing and storing carbon emissions; generating power that is both clean and dispatchable; transmitting electricity over long distances; storing energy for long durations; and orchestrating an increasingly complex electricity system. Policy makers can harness market competition to support the most promising technologies for each different function by designing tax incentive schemes tailored for each application.,True,Q3pE8GgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,5,https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/file-uploads/NextGenTaxCredits_CGEP_Commentary_Final.pdf,15817602737873138627,/scholar?cites=15817602737873138627,,,https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/file-uploads/NextGenTaxCredits_CGEP_Commentary_Final.pdf,0,0,0

The results of experiments carried out with pellets and mixtures of wood chips and sawdust are presented and compared with earlier experiments with different wood fuels. Increase in particle density and size was found out to widen the range of possible airflow rates. and transfer the maximum rate of ignition front propagation toward fuel lean conditions. Increase in the average sphericity of particles decreases the porosity of the bed. Mixing of small and large particles seems to be advantageous for combustion so that small particles change the optimum airflow rate to fuel rich conditions and large particles widen the usable range of airflow rates.

A small fraction of this growth has occurred offshore. but as the best wind resources become developed onshore. there is increasing interest in the development of offshore winds. Like any form of power production. offshore wind energy has both positive and negative impacts. The potential negative impacts have stimulated a great deal of opposition to the first offshore wind power proposals in the U.S. and have delayed the development of the first offshore wind farm in the U.S. Here we discuss the costs and benefits of offshore wind relative to onshore wind power and conventional electricity production.

In the US. offshore wind is expected to commence development between 2015-2020 and will occur primarily in federal waters administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). In order to protect the public interest. BOEMRE is required to ensure that adequate financial assurance exists for wind farm decommissioning in the case the operator defaults or is unable to perform according to the terms of the lease instrument. Consequently. BOEMRE requires information on the expected costs of offshore wind decommissioning. In this report we develop estimates of offshore wind installation and decommissioning costs using a bottom-up engineering based approach and compare with total capital cost and installation cost estimates generated through a reference class approach. We find that installation costs are typically 5 to 15% of overall capital costs and that decommissioning costs are roughly half of installation costs. or roughly 100.000 to 160.000$/MW.

Emitters are taxed at a fixed price on carbon emissions and the government uses the tax revenue to buy carbon offsets on existing emissions markets. Unlike a traditional carbon tax. regulated firms may also produce carbon credits which may be sold to the government. Thus. the government bears the compliance cost risk rather than an individual firm and has control over the number of offsets purchased and the effective emission reduction.

Modern gas turbines are designed to operate at turbine inlet temperatures in excess of 1600 C. placing high thermal loads on blade components. Without adequate cooling. the lifetime of components may be shortened due to thermal stresses. oxidation and spalling. and creep. Hitherto. combustor liner cooling and dilution air ensured that the temperature profile of the flow exiting the combustor was parabolic in nature. requiring that the internal cooling of blades be augmented by film cooling schemes for the blade aerofoil surfaces.

Due to the high variability in solar energy availability. these energy storage devices are subject to transient heat loads during charging that can affect the storage efficiency. Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the stability characteristics of a lab-scale thermocline tank subject to a flow disturbance during charging under different operating temperatures. The charging process was first simulated at a constant Reynolds number for three different Atwood numbers; a stably stratified fluid layer develops inside the storage tank in all cases. A flow disturbance was then introduced at the inlet of the stratified thermocline tank by inserting colder fluid for a short period of time. The disturbance interacts with the thermocline and causes oscillations and mixing.

1265833,Viscous linear stability of axisymmetric low-density jets: Parameters influencing absolute instability,2010,V Srinivasan and MP Hallberg and PJ Strykowski,22,Physics of Fluids,2,024103,AIP,Viscous linear stability calculations are presented for model low-density axisymmetric jet flows. Absolute growth transitions for the jet column mode are mapped out in a parametric space including velocity ratio. density ratio. Reynolds number. momentum thickness. and subtle differences between velocity and density profiles. Strictly speaking. the profiles used in most jet stability studies to date are only applicable to unity Prandtl numbers and zero pressure gradient flows—the present work relaxes this requirement. Results reveal how subtle differences between the velocity and density profiles generally used in jet stability theory can dramatically alter the absolute growth rate of the jet column mode in these low-density flows. The results suggest heating/cooling or mass diffusion at the outer nozzle surface can suppress absolute instability and potentially global instability in low-density jets.,True,-DxKn-8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,18,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3306671,10788541177046458694,/scholar?cites=10788541177046458694,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Strykowski/publication/252433161_Viscous_linear_stability_of_axisymmetric_low-density_jets_Parameters_influencing_absolute_instability/links/542955880cf2e4ce940c9f29/Viscous-linear-stability-of-axisymmetric-low-density-jets-Parameters-influencing-absolute-instability.pdf,0,0,0

Large spatial gradients in the heat transfer coefficient may lead to lateral conduction within the heater foil. causing non-uniformity in the actual convective flux into the fluid. yielding errors in the calculated Nusselt numbers.

A conventional steam Rankine cycle operates under vacuum pressures in the condenser which manifests in considerably high volumetric flow rates at the expander exhaust. This calls for large equipment size and makes the power block expensive. This paper presents the idea of substituting the conventional power block by a high temperature (~ 350 C) and equally efficient organic Rankine cycle (ORC) which works on a mixture of pentane and RC-318 (70% and 30% on a molar basis). A comparison is made on a one-to-one basis with identical operating conditions for a given solar field equipment.

The results show the circulation current is induced through the electrical joints at both ends of the conductor and electrical contact among the strands in the conductor. The current imbalance is produced as a result of the superimposition of the circulation and transport currents and becomes larger as the ramping rate increases. It was also found that the large current induced in the strands during a pulse charge cannot sufficiently be reduced at normal generation because of the induced voltage on these strands. The current flowing in the normal-state strands becomes larger for faster ramping. In addition. the effect of the non-uniform current distribution on the stability was experimentally investigated.

Therefore. it is very important to analyze the current distribution in a superconductor and find out methods to obtain a homogeneous current distribution in the conductor. We apply a magnetic flux conservation in a loop contoured by electric center lines of filaments in two arbitrary strands located on adjacent layers in a coaxial multilayer superconductor. and then analyze the current distribution in the conductor. A generalized formula governing the current distribution can be described as explicit functions of the superconductor construction parameters. such as twist pitch. twist direction and radius of each layer.

The coil was successfully charged up to about 30 A and down to zero at the designed magnetic-field ramp rate for the SMES. Alternating current (AC) losses in the coil were measured by an enthalpy method. The results were analyzed and compared with the test results from a short sample. The measured hysteresis loss is in good agreement with that estimated from the short sample results. It was found that the coupling loss of the coil could be described as consisting of two components with different coupling time constants. One has a short time constant of about 220 ms. which is in agreement with the test result of a short conductor.

The mechanisms designed to coordinate planning. investments. and operations in the electric power sector were designed with minimal participation from either the demand side of the market or distributed energy resources (DERs) connected at distribution voltages. The emergence of DERs is now animating consumers and massively expanding the number of potential investors and participants in the provision of electricity services. We highlight how price signals-the primary mechanism for coordinating investments and operations at the transmission level-do not adequately coordinate investments in and operations of DERs with network infrastructure. We discuss the role of the distribution system operator in creating cost-reflective prices. and argue that the price signals governing transactions at the distribution level must increasingly internalize the cost of network externalities. revealing the marginal cost or benefit of an actor's decisions. Price signals considered include contractual relationships. organized procurement processes. market signals. and regulated retail tariffs.

1265895,Carbon pricing under political constraints,2017,Jesse D Jenkins and Valerie J Karplus,,The political economy of clean energy transitions,,39-59,Oxford University Press,For decades. the economically efficient prescription for the severe consequences of global climate change has been clear: establish a price on emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) that internalizes the far-reaching external costs of climate change in market transactions (eg. Nordhaus 1992; Stavins 1997; Stern 2007). In sharp contrast to this prescription. a diverse patchwork of climate policy measures has proliferated. and where CO2 pricing policies do exist. the prices established typically fall far short of the levels necessary to fully internalize the estimated marginal social cost of climate damages.The failure of governments to establish a pricing (or equivalent marketbased) approach to climate change mitigation—or to adequately price carbon when they succeed in doing so—can be largely attributed to a variety of persistent political economy challenges. In particular. climate change mitigation is a global collective action challenge (Olson 1984). demanding coordination among many disparate stakeholders (eg. nations. emitting industries. individual consumers). Meanwhile. the benefits of climate mitigation are uncertain. unevenly distributed. and accrue primarily to future generations (IPCC 2014). while the costs of climate mitigation are born immediately. with acute distributional impacts for particular constituencies (Burtraw et al. 2002; Bovenberg. Goulder. and Gurney 2005; Rausch and Karplus 2014). Climate mitigation thus has all the hallmarks of an intergenerational principal agent problem (Eisenhardt 1989). with private costs of mitigation out of proportion to the private benefits for many actors.

1265896,Restructuring Revisited: Competition and Coordination in Electricity Distribution Systems,2018,Scott P Burger and Jesse D Jenkins and Carlos Batlle and Ignacio J Pérez-Arriaga,2018,CEEPR Working Paper Series,007,,,This paper addresses the implications of the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs) for industry structure in the electric power sector. Regulations on industry structures dictate which actors can perform which roles in the power sector and play a key role in enabling or preventing efficient power sector planning. investment. and operation. However. the structures in place today were designed in an era characterized by centralized resources. unidirectional power flows. and relatively price inelastic demand. In light of the decentralization of the power sector. regulators and policy makers must carefully reconsider how industry structure at the distribution level affects system planning. coordination. and operation. as well as competition. market development. and cost efficiency. To address this critical issue. we analyze the economic characteristics of the actors necessary for efficient and reliable distribution system planning. investment. and operation: distribution network owners and operators. DER owners. aggregators and retailers. and data managers. We translate the foundational theories in industrial organization and the lessons learned during the previous wave of power system restructuring to the modern context in order to analyze the implications of these characteristics on the potential for competition in the roles of DER ownership and aggregation. This analysis provides deep insight into questions such as whether or not monopoly distribution utilities should be allowed to own distributed resources. We then analyze how the mechanisms for coordinating vertically and horizontally disaggregated actors need to be updated. focusing on …,True,iCJvalsAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,7,https://repositorio.comillas.edu/xmlui/handle/11531/27387,3775044109308444625,/scholar?cites=3775044109308444625,,,https://repositorio.comillas.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11531/27387/IIT-18-033A.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The effect is to allow Pt@ Pd to be deposited homogeneously on the ATO surface with high dispersion and narrow particle size distribution. The Pt@ Pd core–shell catalyst was prepared using the polyol method and shows a dramatic improvement towards ORR activity and durability.The durability and the high cost of cathode catalysts are key issues which hinder the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). One of the most common types of PEMFC are highly porous carbon black supported nanosized Pt catalysts.[1] Pt sintering and dissolution. and carbon corrosion are the main factors which can affect the fuel cell’s performance.[2] Pt particles intimately attached to carbon can also accelerate the carbon corrosion rate. which leads to a significant loss of the fuel cell performance. especially on the cathode side. as it operates at highest potential.[3] Conductive oxide materials that can tolerate a strong acidic and oxidative environment have been considered as alternative substrate material to carbon. ATO nanopowder is one of these candidates. owing to its excellent electrical conductivity property. and has been used in various applications including conducting coating and as a transparent solar battery electrode.[4] ATO displays high stability in acid and peroxide environments at temperatures up to 2008C.[5] The commercially available ATO nanoparticles used in our experiments have an average particle size less than 50 nm and a specific surface area of 47 m2 gÀ1.[6],True,3rFOG04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinod_Kumar_P/publication/275413948_Determining_the_Effect_of_Plasma_Pre-Treatment_on_Antimony_Tin_Oxide_to_Support_PtPd_and_the_Oxygen_Reduction_Reaction_Activity/links/5a69b32c0f7e9b01f3eda790/Determining-the-Effect-of-Plasma-Pre-Treatment-on-Antimony-Tin-Oxide-to-Support-PtPd-and-the-Oxygen-Reduction-Reaction-Activity.pdf,10002507520890514804,/scholar?cites=10002507520890514804,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vinod_Kumar_P/publication/275413948_Determining_the_Effect_of_Plasma_Pre-Treatment_on_Antimony_Tin_Oxide_to_Support_PtPd_and_the_Oxygen_Reduction_Reaction_Activity/links/5a69b32c0f7e9b01f3eda790/Determining-the-Effect-of-Plasma-Pre-Treatment-on-Antimony-Tin-Oxide-to-Support-PtPd-and-the-Oxygen-Reduction-Reaction-Activity.pdf,0,0,0

These variations come from the experimental procedure (averaging of points detected from a surface) and not from the instabilities in the LiDAR detection with rain. The detected LiDAR intensity and the sampled points attenuate with the increasing of rain intensity. Drop size distribution is assumed constant along the study area. The highest decrease in the number of points appears for pavement. However. the intensity returned from pavement is not specially influenced by rain. The rest of the materials show similar trend in the intensity …,True,FhTAzooAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,55,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224116305577,6772281646894848748,/scholar?cites=6772281646894848748,,,,0,0,0

The workflow developed in this paper allows the automatic registration of two different sensors with completely different characteristics. including fields of view. spatial resolution and spatial position. As a result of the workflow. thermographic and geometric data are combined in a thermographic 3D-model and its projection as an orthothermogram. where thermal defects can be visually detected and precisely located. and heat losses can be quantified given the availability of surface measurements.

Given that a fast and active dimensional analysis of constructive components is essential for construction monitoring. this paper is particularly focused on the detection and segmentation of columns in building interiors from incomplete point clouds acquired with a Terrestrial Laser Scanner. The methodology addresses two types of columns: round cross-section and rectangular cross-section. Considering columns as vertical elements. the global strategy for segmentation involves the rasterization of a point cloud onto the XY plane and the implementation of a model-driven approach based on the Hough Transform. The methodology is tested in two real case studies. and experiments are carried out under different levels of data completeness. The results show the robustness of the methodology to the presence of clutter and partial occlusion. typical in building indoors. even though false positives can be obtained if other elements with the same shape and size as columns are present in the raster.

Especially. strong subcooling for droplet sizes below 20 μm was observed. In this second part. an interpretation of the experimental data based on theory of subcooling and nucleation in emulsions is presented and discussed.It is shown that many different effects can play a role in the nucleation of PCM emulsions. Both deactivation and creation of nucleation sites have to be expected when dividing a PCM volume into small droplets.

The only working fluid in the system is water. which is used as refrigerant and working fluid. The operational behaviour of such a system has been investigated by a small test rig. The investigation shows that the cooling water temperature as well as the cold water temperature has a strong influence on the coefficient of performance of a steam jet ejector chiller. The coefficient of performance reaches high values in part load and at good re-cooling conditions. so that the mean efficiency is clearly higher than the nominal efficiency of the system.

Stack ventilation by itself cannot create enough air flow to achieve good indoor air quality for building occupants under hot and humid climatic conditions. The low performance of stack ventilation in hot and humid climate is due to the low temperature differences between indoor and outdoor temperature of a building. On the other hand. the wind-induced ventilation method performance is independent of low temperature difference. Therefore. it has potential use to improve the indoor air quality for buildings in the hot and humid climate. This paper examines the wind-induced natural ventilation tower performs under hot and humid climate.

There are mainly two methods for inducing natural ventilation; namely stack ventilation and wind-induced ventilation. Due to the relatively lower difference between the indoor and outdoor temperature in hot and humid conditions. stack ventilation method alone is rendered insufficient to create desirable air flow between outdoor and indoor building environment to achieve comfort and indoor air quality for the building occupant. Hence. wind-induced ventilation method can be used to achieve the desired air flow rates and improve the indoor air quality for the building. This study revealed that at external wind speed of 0.1 m/s. the aerodynamic inverted airfoil roof geometry on the wind-induced natural ventilation tower is able to generate extraction air flow rate of 10.000 m3/h with average of 57 ACH to provide comfort and indoor air quality to the internal building environment in hot and humid climatic conditions.,True,Q5_DQZMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,12,http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2011/Montreux/COMICICBIO/COMICICBIO-20.pdf,5699384342150929334,/scholar?cites=5699384342150929334,,,http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2011/Montreux/COMICICBIO/COMICICBIO-20.pdf,0,0,0

As 2011 statistics shows. almost largest Foreign Direct Investment figures in Malaysia are dedicated to energy sector. Also. Malaysia has launched a new Renewable Energy mechanism under the name Feed in Tariff. Feed in Tariff is a new incentive for energy producers which can affect Malaysian Foreign Direct Investment largely. This paper utilises an archival research on current Malaysian Foreign Direct Investment in contrast with solar part of Feed in Tariff policy. The paper discusses the Malaysia’s Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff scheme in solar energy and its effects on absorbing the Foreign Direct Investment of the country. Investors in Malaysia and policy makers in the other countries especially in Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) can use this experience and trace the effects of Feed in Tariff on Foreign Direct Investment in Malaysia.,True,Q5_DQZMAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,9,http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2012/Zlin/ENAGROBIO/ENAGROBIO-21.pdf,5382412291974423168,/scholar?cites=5382412291974423168,,,http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2012/Zlin/ENAGROBIO/ENAGROBIO-21.pdf,0,0,0

These people spend a long time commuting from the suburb to the work place located in the core of the city. They face many problems. such as air and noise pollution. and traffic congestion every day. All of these issues happen because of the lack of attention to sustainable development elements and smart growth. Hence. this research introduces a financial model that enables the low-income people to live near their work stations. It discusses the implementation of Smart Growth principles. which can help urban managements to improve the urban quality for the residents. By making new extra value with the introduction of new aspects for density and estimating the saving of Smart Growth can provide the opportunity to shift from low-income housing to affordable quality housing. The main case study for this research is the Gasing Indah project. which includes a mixed development on the border between Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya in Malaysia. This case study makes a feasibility study on different regulations on both sides of the above border for a unique project. It means that. this project is a unique one with two different governmental restrictions and prices.

In such cases. there is much uncertainty regarding the effect of solar penetration on electricity prices to consumers and on the reduction of electricity demand from the grid. The penetration of solar in the residential sector – which in some cases accounts for about 40% of the country's total electricity demand – may have a tremendous impact on incumbent utilities and the industry as a whole.

1266044,Simulation for assessing the liberalization of biofuels,2015,Carlos J Franco and Sebastian Zapata and Isaac Dyner,41,,,298-307,Pergamon,Global biofuel consumption has been growing in recent years as different countries worldwide have been exploring alternatives and complements to gasoline and diesel fuel for transport. This is due to a hike in oil prices and their increasing volatility as well as both a high dependence of the transport sector on oil and also because. arguably. the supply chain of biofuels emits less CO2 than that of fossil fuels.Biofuels have been available around the world for a while. with the aid of some government support. Brazil pioneered this renewable solution for transport. from the early 1930s. as the country had little access to local fuels. while oil and other alternatives became more expensive. Biofuels are currently widely considered as part of the solution to affordable fuels for transport.

However. it is difficult to predict the actual production profiles of wind and solar energy as they depend heavily on variable meteorological features of solar radiation and wind speed. In an ideal system. wind and solar electricity are both injected in a fast reacting grid instantaneously matching supply and demand. In such a system wind and solar electricity production profiles should complement each other as much as possible in order to minimise the need of storage and additional capacity.

This assessment of European PHS potential focuses on linking two existing reservoirs to form a PHS system. the reservoirs must have adequate difference in elevation (head) and be close enough so that they can be reasonably linked. The results show that the theoretical potential energy storage is significant as it reaches 54 TWh when a maximum distance of 20 km between the existing reservoirs is considered. When constraints are applied. e.g. discounting populated areas. protected natural areas or transport infrastructure. the so-called maximum realisable potential is halved to 29 TWh.

Pumped hydropower remains the only mature and widely-adopted utility-scale energy storage technology. However. the selection and development of new pumped hydropower sites is heavily influenced by physical constraints such as terrain. as well as non-physical considerations such as the proximity of proposed reservoirs to settlements or environmentally or culturally sensitive sites. Hence. transforming existing reservoirs to pumped hydropower schemes is often considerably easier than developing completely new schemes.

EUR, Scientific and technical research series",,,,The European energy and climate policies have as one of their targets a 20% final energy from renewable origin by 2020. This target entails an even higher penetration of renewable energy in the electricity mix. possibly between 35 and 40%. and a high component of it will be nondispatchable1 renewables such as wind and solar energy. Moreover. the European Union's (EU) 2050 decarbonisation objectives. with a target of 80-95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. will require even higher shares of renewables in the electricity mix.Electricity systems need to be flexible in order to guarantee at every moment the equilibrium between generation and consumption. To achieve a high penetration of wind and solar energy. one way to introduce this flexibility is through pumped hydropower storage (PHS). currently representing almost 99% of current worldwide electricity storage capacity. PHS behaves as load when pumping and as generation when it supplies electricity to the system. and can change between both in minutes.

Usage varies across EU Member States. but six countries still rely on coal to meet at least 20% of their energy demand. The role of coal is. however. decreasing. as part of the ongoing transformation of the energy system. The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has led to an increasing share for renewables; and coal power generation is actively discouraged with stringent post-2020 emission requirements. high CO2 emission allowance prices. and likely restrictions on coal eligibility for future capacity remuneration mechanisms. Frequently overlooked. however. are the potential negative impacts of the ongoing shrinkage of the coal sector on employment and the economy in regions hosting hard coal and lignite mining activities and coal-fired power plants.

Heidelberg,Classical ontologies are not suitable to represent imprecise nor uncertain pieces of information. Fuzzy Description Logics were born to manage the former type of knowledge. but they require an appropriate fuzzy language to be agreed and an important number of available resources to be adapted. This paper faces these problems by presenting a reasoning preserving procedure to obtain a crisp representation for a fuzzy extension of the logic  which uses Gödel implication in the semantics of fuzzy concept and role subsumption. This reduction allows crisp representation languages as well as currently available reasoners to be reused.

Serrano and Jesús García and José Manuel Molina and Galina Rogova,21,Information Fusion,,173-186,,Harbor surveillance is a critical and challenging part of maritime security procedures. Building a surveillance picture to support decision makers in detection of potential threats requires the integration of data and information coming from heterogeneous sources. Context plays a key role in achieving this task by providing expectations. constraints and additional information for inference about the items of interest. This paper proposes a fusion system for context-based situation and threat assessment with application to harbor surveillance. The architecture of the system is organized in two levels. The lowest level uses an ontological model to formally represent input data and to classify harbor objects and basic situations by deductive reasoning according to the harbor regulations. The higher level applies Belief-based Argumentation to evaluate the threat posed by suspicious vessels.

1266109,The relationship between perfect and imperfect information in a two-action risk-sensitive problem,2008,J Eric Bickel,5,Decision Analysis,3,116-128,INFORMS,The ability to value information is a central feature of decision analysis and one of its most interesting areas of application. Unfortunately. general assertions regarding the drivers of information value or its properties have been difficult to formulate or have been disproved by counterexample. In this paper. we investigate the value of imperfect information relative to perfect information (RVOI).

Has this improvement translated into improved decision making? Our results suggest that the answer to the first question in an unequivocal “yes.” but that the answer to the second is qualified “no.” How could this be?Uncertainty quantification is not an end unto itself; removing or even reducing uncertainty is not the goal. Rather. the objective is to make a good decision. which in many cases requires the assessment of the relevant uncertainties. The oil and gas industry seems to have lost sight of this goal in its good-faith effort to provide decision makers with a richer understanding of the possible outcomes flowing from major decisions.

The films were deposited on the flat bottom of a hemispherical prism. and the STM light emissions from the tip–sample gap into the vacuum (tip-side emission) and into the prism (prism-side emission) were measured. The prism-side emission was much stronger than the tip-side emission for the bare Au film. Theoretical analysis revealed that this enhancement of emission intensity is caused by the fact that surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) localized at the Au surface become radiative on the prism side. This geometry was applied to the investigations of STM light emission from the Au film covered with an alkanethiol SAM.

A fabricated laboratory scale digester was used to generate biogas from the locally available waste obtained from poultry farms and domestic kitchens. Two laboratory-scale digesters were prepared to digest the solid wastes with and without silica gel respectively. The operating temperatures of the digesters were maintained within 26 C-31 C. The water displacement method was used to investigate the volume of the produced gas. It was found that the production rate of biogas was increased while using silica gel as catalyst. The total gas production was found to be 7921 ml/kg of waste without silica gel whereas it was 10545 ml/kg with a maximum production rate of 1206 ml/kg in a day with silica gel as a catalyst and it was 33.12% higher than before. Finally. by using a k-type thermocouple. the flame temperature of the gas was measured as 619 C.

The subsequent emergence of such a timber building system in Sweden is analysed in the context of the existing concrete-based construction system. The characteristics of the construction industry and its path dependency over the past century hamper the development of a timber building system. However. government policies and funding. the wood industry's interest in an enhanced market for value-added wood products. and involvement of the wood research community has helped develop such a construction system.

However. with increasing conflicting interests in forests and forestry. the success of such a strategy depends on the public acceptance. In this paper. the results of a mail survey show that although a majority of the general public in Sweden supports measures to increase forest growth. they oppose the use of intensive forestry practices such as the cultivation of exotic tree species. clones. and forest fertilization. The acceptance of such practices is mainly influenced by the perceptions of their environmental consequences.

1266222,Diffusion of innovative domestic heating systems and multi-storey wood-framed buildings in Sweden,2007,Krushna Mahapatra,,,,,,The diffusion of innovations that promote sustainable use of forest resources and energy efficiency is important for reducing greenhouse gas emission and dependency on oil. In this thesis the ‘systems of innovation’(SI) approach is used to analyse the diffusion of multi-storey wood-framed buildings and wood pellet heating systems in Sweden. The diffusion of an innovative heating system (IHS) is influenced by the diffusion of other types of IHSs. making it complex to analyse the diffusion of all these systems simultaneously using the SI approach. Hence. an ‘adopter-centric’approach was used. as homeowners make the decision to adopt an IHS. which affects the rate of adoption of that system. The SI analyses showed that several sources of path dependency. resulting from the establishment and growth of the concrete-based construction system over the past 100 years. hinder the expansion of a wood-based multi-storey construction system. However. development of the wood construction system was possible due to government policies and funding. the wood industry’s interest in expanding the market for value-added wood products. and the involvement of the wood research community. The growth of the pellet market was supported by national energy policy. the abundance of raw material and broad dissemination of district heating systems. However. a lack of co-ordination between the pellet and equipment suppliers in the early phase of market development. high annual operating cost. lack of information. dissatisfaction among early adopters and technology lock-in contributed to its relatively slow growth.

The background to this project is that most of these houses are more than 30 years old and have a need to be renovated. which provides opportunities for implementation of energy-efficiency measures.Energy-related renovation of existing buildings has huge potential for cost-effective energy savings. Residential buildings are responsible for 70% of the energy use of buildings in the Nordic countries. Singlefamily houses are responsible for more than 50% of this.

Thiol-terminated chiral scaffold molecules containing a porphyrin chromophore were self-assembled on gold surfaces to form a monolayer. Incorporation of the SAM-coated gold into an electrochemical cell and illumination with visible light generated a cathodic photocurrent. When using circularly polarized light. the photocurrent displayed an asymmetry (different magnitude of photocurrent for right versus left polarization) that changed with the molecular chirality (left- or right-handedness of the scaffold).

These polysilane hydrides were found to enable lower growth temperatures in solution than any other silane reactants used to date. Cyclohexasilane enabled the lowest growth temperature of 200 °C. using a single-step solution–liquid–solid (SLS) reaction from tin (Sn) seeds. The potential for nanorod growth is determined by the reactivity of the silane. Cyclohexasilane is the most reactive of the polysilane hydrides studied here. requiring the lowest energy for dehydrogenation. The formation of silylene by cycolhexasilane also facilitates chemisorption onto the Sn surface during nanorod growth.

Si nanowires can exhibit relatively stable performance for many cycles of charging; however. conductive carbon must often be added to the electrode layer to improve the rate capability due to the relatively low electrical conductivity of Si. The added carbon lowers the capacity of the electrode. Here. we show that the rate capability of Si in LIBs can be substantially enhanced by incorporating tin (Sn) into Si nanowires. The solubility of Sn in Si is very low (0.015 at%); yet. Sn used as a seed for supercritical fluid–liquid–solid (SFLS) growth can be trapped in Si nanowires with relatively high concentration (10 at%).

Trisilane (Si3H8) and Sn(HMDS)2 are decomposed in supercritical toluene at 450 °C. Sn(HMDS)2 creates Sn nanoparticles that seed Si nanowire growth by the supercritical fluid–liquid–solid (SFLS) mechanism. The Si : Sn ratio in the reaction determines the growth of amorphous Si shell. No amorphous shell forms at relatively low Si : Sn ratios of 20 : 1. whereas higher Si : Sn ratio of 40 : 1 leads to significant amorphous shell.

The formation of pores in Ge nanowires undergoing delithiation has been observed before in in situ TEM experiments. but there has been no indication that a critical diameter exists below which pores do not form. Pore formation occurs as a result of fast lithium diffusion compared to vacancy migration.

1266280,Silicon and germanium nanostructures: synthesis and in situ TEM study,2015,Xiaotang Lu,,,,,,A variety of chemical routes exist for a wide range of nanomaterials with tunable size. shape. composition and surface chemistry. Of these materials. silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) nanomaterials have been some of the most challenging to synthesize. Solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth of Si was studied using tin (Sn) as the seeding metal. Si nanorods with narrow diameters can be grown by the decomposition of trisilane in hot squalane in the presence of Sn nanocrystals. Photoluminescence could be obtained from the Si nanorods by thermal hydrosilylation passivation. This colloidal synthesis could be further simplified to a single-step reaction procedure by the in situ formation of Sn seed particles. In addition to trisilane as a Si source. isotetrasilane. neopentasilane and cyclohexasilane were studied for Si nanorod growth: all three reactants enabled nanorod formation at lower growth temperatures. A monophenylsilane (MPS) enhanced growth was discovered for supercritical fluid-liquid-solid (SFLS) growth of Ge nanowires that enables the Ge conversion of ~100%. A variety of metalorganic compounds were studied for replacing pre-synthesized metal nanoparticles to induce Ge nanowire growth.
