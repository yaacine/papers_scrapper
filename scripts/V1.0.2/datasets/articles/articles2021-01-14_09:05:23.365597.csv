44641,Targeting the DNA repair defect in BRCA mutant cells as a therapeutic strategy,2005,Hannah Farmer and Nuala McCabe and Christopher J Lord and Andrew NJ Tutt and Damian A Johnson and Tobias B Richardson and Manuela Santarosa and Krystyna J Dillon and Ian Hickson and Charlotte Knights and Niall MB Martin and Stephen P Jackson and Graeme CM Smith and Alan Ashworth,434,Nature,7035,917-921,Nature Publishing Group,BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination 1. and mutations in these genes predispose to breast and other cancers 2. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair. a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks 3. We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity. resulting in chromosomal instability. cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage. and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5261,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03445,5115644684342347050,/scholar?cites=5115644684342347050,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Hickson/publication/7907060_Targeting_the_DNA_repair_defect_in_BRCA_mutant_cells_as_a_therapeutic_strategy/links/0fcfd50abe504e36a3000000.pdf,0
44642,The DNA-damage response in human biology and disease,2009,Stephen P Jackson and Jiri Bartek,461,Nature,7267,1071-1078,Nature Publishing Group,The prime objective for every life form is to deliver its genetic material. intact and unchanged. to the next generation. This must be achieved despite constant assaults by endogenous and environmental agents on the DNA. To counter this threat. life has evolved several systems to detect DNA damage. signal its presence and mediate its repair. Such responses. which have an impact on a wide range of cellular events. are biologically significant because they prevent diverse human diseases.

Cells respond to DNA damage by activating a complex DNA-damage-response pathway that includes cell-cycle arrest. the transcriptional and post-transcriptional activation of a subset of genes including those associated with DNA repair. and. under some circumstances. the triggering of programmed cell death. An inability to respond properly to. or to repair. DNA damage leads to genetic instability. which in turn may enhance the rate of cancer development. Indeed. it is becoming increasingly clear that deficiencies in DNA-damage signaling and repair pathways are fundamental to the etiology of most. if not all. human cancers.

This exhaustion of proliferative potential. called senescence. can be triggered when telomeres—the ends of linear chromosomes—cannot fulfil their normal protective functions. Here we show that senescent human fibroblasts display molecular markers characteristic of cells bearing DNA double-strand breaks. These markers include nuclear foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX and their co-localization with DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint factors such as 53BP1. MDC1 and NBS1. We also show that senescent cells contain activated forms of the DNA damage checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2.

44645,Sensing and repairing DNA double-strand breaks,2002,Stephen P Jackson,23,Carcinogenesis,5,687-696,Oxford University Press,The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the principle cytotoxic lesion for ionizing radiation and radio-mimetic chemicals but can also be caused by mechanical stress on chromosomes or when a replicative DNA polymerase encounters a DNA single-strand break or other type of DNA lesion. DSBs also occur as intermediates in various biological events. such as V(D)J recombination in developing lymphoid cells. Inaccurate repair or lack of repair of a DSB can lead to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have tumourigenic potential. In other instances. DSBs can be sufficient to induce apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs. eukaryotic cells have evolved complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these lesions. signal their presence and bring about their repair.

CHK2. NBS1. and BRCA1. Mutation of ATM occurs in the human autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia. which is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and a failure of cells to arrest the cell cycle after the induction of DNA double-strand breaks. It has thus been proposed that ATM inhibition would cause cellular radio- and chemosensitization.

Loss of H2AX causes radiosensitivity. genome instability. and DNA double-strand-break repair defects. yet the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain obscure.

44655,Regulation of p53 in response to DNA damage,1999,Nicholas D Lakin and Stephen P Jackson,18,Oncogene,53,7644-7655,Nature Publishing Group,Activation of p53 can occur in response to a number of cellular stresses. including DNA damage. hypoxia and nucleotide deprivation. Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53. including those generated by ionising radiation (IR). radio-mimetic drugs. ultraviolet light (UV) and chemicals such as methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Under normal conditions. p53 levels are maintained at a low state by virtue of the extremely short-half life of the polypeptide. In addition to this. p53 normally exists in an largely inactive state that is relatively inefficient at binding to DNA and activating transcription. Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage is associated with a rapid increase in its levels and with an increased ability of p53 to bind DNA and mediate transcriptional activation.

Thus. cells must be equipped with mechanisms to surpass this natural obstacle. DNA damage induces histone H2AX phosphorylation by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase like kinases ATM. ATR and DNA-PKcs. H2AX phosphorylation contributes to DNA double-strand break repair but the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. In this review. we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how cells use the epigenetic mark of H2AX phosphorylation to dynamically link the DNA-damage-response machinery to broken chromosomes. In addition. we highlight potential regulatory mechanisms of H2AX phosphorylation and speculate about a central functional role of this post-translational histone modification at the interface of DNA repair. chromatin-structure modulation and cell-cycle checkpoint activation.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,487,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568786406000309,17540096793895639462,/scholar?cites=17540096793895639462,,,0

Both pathways have been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. but no equivalent NHEJ system has been identified in prokaryotes.

We have taken advantage of this interaction to devise a purification procedure for the ""GC-box"" binding transcription factor Sp1. Crude nuclear extracts are first subjected to wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography and then subjected to sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. The Sp1 protein purified by this procedure is at least 95% pure. and the overall recovery is greater than 80%. In addition to yielding larger quantities of Sp1 than conventional schemes. the new purification procedure is also simpler and more rapid. We show that wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography can also be used to purify the glycosylated forms of the CCAAT-binding transcription factor.

Archaebacteria constitute a kingdom of organisms distinct from eukaryotes and eubacteria. Archaebacterial gene regulatory sequences often map to TATA box-like motifs. Here it is shown that the archaebacterium Pyrococcus woesei expresses a protein with structural and functional similarity to eukaryotic TBP molecules.

Despite intense investigations. our knowledge of these pathways has been technically limited by our inability to detect the main repair factors at DSBs in cells.

However. the regulatory mechanisms that couple chromatin sensing to DNA-damage signalling in mammalian cells are not well understood.

It interacts with several proteins involved in DNA damage repair and checkpoint signalling. and is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and during mitosis. Upon treatment of cultured human cells with DNA damaging agents. MDC1/NFBD1 translocates to sites of DNA lesions. where it collaborates with other proteins and with phosphorylated histone H2AX to mediate the accumulation of checkpoint and repair factors into nuclear foci. Down-regulation of MDC1/NFBD1 expression levels by small interfering RNA (siRNA) renders cells hyper-sensitive to DNA damaging agents and leads to defects in cell cycle checkpoint activation and apoptosis.

Repair of DSB in eukaryotic cells can occur via a homologous recombination pathway involving RAD51 and RAD52. or via a non-homologous double-strand endjoining pathway (NHEJ). a form of DSB repair [1]. Although both pathways are present in all eukaryotes. in yeast. repair of DSB is primarily achieved by homologous recombination. whereas NHEJ repair is the predominant mechanism in vertebrates [1]. The NHEJ pathway in higher eukaryotes is dependent on a multiprotein complex. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)[1] which consists of a DNA-binding component. a heterodimer of two proteins. Ku70 and Ku80. and a catalytic subunit. DNA-PKcs. The main function of the Ku70/80 component of DNA-PK. is the primary recognition of DSB. Ku displays high affinity in vitro for a variety of DNA ends including blunt ends. 5P and 3P overhangs. and DNA hairpins which occur as intermediates in V (D) J chain recombination [2]. In mammalian cells. the Ku heterodimer recruits the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. which is dependent on association with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer bound to DNA. for its protein kinase activity. When localised on damaged DNA by its Ku heterodimer targeting subunit. DNA-PK is an active protein kinase. preferentially phosphorylating proteins bound on the DNA.

Genetically. it constitutes a heterogeneous condition. with several loci mapped (SCKL1-5) but only three disease genes identified: the ATR. CENPJ. and CEP152 genes that control cellular responses to DNA damage. We previously mapped a Seckel syndrome locus to chromosome 18p11.31-q11.2 (SCKL2). Here. we report two mutations in the CtIP (RBBP8) gene within this locus that result in expression of C-terminally truncated forms of CtIP. We propose that these mutations are the molecular cause of the disease observed in the previously described SCKL2 family and in an additional unrelated family diagnosed with a similar form of congenital microcephaly termed Jawad syndrome. While an exonic frameshift mutation was found in the Jawad family. the SCKL2 family carries a splicing mutation that yields a dominant-negative form of CtIP. Further characterization of cell lines derived from the SCKL2 family revealed defective DNA damage induced formation of single-stranded DNA. a critical co-factor for ATR activation. Accordingly. SCKL2 cells present a lowered apoptopic threshold and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Notably. over-expression of a comparable truncated CtIP variant in non-Seckel cells recapitulates SCKL2 cellular phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. This work thus identifies CtIP as a disease gene for Seckel and Jawad syndromes and defines a new type of genetic disease mechanism in which a dominant negative mutation yields a recessively inherited disorder.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,128,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002310,151413091395571351,/scholar?cites=151413091395571351,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002310,0

44785,Regulating transcription factor activity by phosphorylation,1992,Stephen P Jackson,2,,4,104-108,Elsevier Current Trends,The ability to regulate gene expression differentially in response to changes in the environment is of vital importance during cell growth and differentiation. In many instances. alterations in patterns of gene expression are triggered by agents such as growth factors interacting with receptors on the cell surface (Fig. 1). This stimulus is then transduced into the cytoplasm. where intracellular signalling systems are activated. The usual end point of such pathways is the activation or inactivation of a key molecule that regulates transcription 1. resulting in specific changes in gene transcription (Box 1). The observation that changes in gene expression can occur in the absence of protein synthesis indicates that they are often brought about by post-translational modification of transcription factors 3.Although transcription factors can be modified by reactions other than phosphorylation. such as glycosylation 4. a number of lines …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,126,https://www.cell.com/trends/cell-biology/pdf/0962-8924(92)90014-E.pdf,18102723061417843115,/scholar?cites=18102723061417843115,,,0

44804,Structure-specific DNA endonuclease Mus81/Eme1 generates DNA damage caused by Chk1 inactivation,2011,Josep V Forment and Melanie Blasius and Ilaria Guerini and Stephen P Jackson,6,PloS one,8,e23517,Public Library of Science,The DNA-damage checkpoint kinase Chk1 is essential in higher eukaryotes due to its role in maintaining genome stability in proliferating cells. CHK1 gene deletion is embryonically lethal. and Chk1 inhibition in replicating cells causes cell-cycle defects that eventually lead to perturbed replication and replication-fork collapse. thus generating endogenous DNA damage. What is the cause of replication-fork collapse when Chk1 is inactivated. however. remains poorly understood. Here. we show that generation of DNA double-strand breaks at replication forks when Chk1 activity is compromised relies on the DNA endonuclease complex Mus81/Eme1. Importantly. we show that Mus81/Eme1-dependent DNA damage—rather than a global increase in replication-fork stalling—is the cause of incomplete replication in Chk1-deficient cells. Consequently. Mus81/Eme1 depletion alleviates the S-phase progression defects associated with Chk1 deficiency. thereby increasing cell survival. Chk1-mediated protection of replication forks from Mus81/Eme1 even under otherwise unchallenged conditions is therefore vital to prevent uncontrolled fork collapse and ensure proper S-phase progression in human cells.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,106,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023517,11517660235316876632,/scholar?cites=11517660235316876632,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023517,0

RecQ helicases. including yeast Sgs1 and human BLM. safeguard genome integrity through their functions in DNA recombination. Sgs1 prevents the accumulation of Rad51-dependent sister chromatid junctions at damaged replication forks. and its functionality seems to be regulated by Ubc9- and Mms21-dependent sumoylation. We show that mutations in Smc5-6 and Esc2 also lead to an accumulation of recombinogenic structures at damaged replication forks. Because Smc5-6 is sumoylated in an Mms21-dependent manner. this finding suggests that Smc5-6 may be a crucial target of Mms21 implicated in this process.

In particular. much of our work has focused on DNA DSBs (double-strand breaks) that are generated by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals. and which can also arise when the DNA replication apparatus encounters other DNA lesions. In the present review. we describe some of our recent work. as well as the work of other laboratories. that has identified new chromatin proteins that mediate DSB responses …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,85,https://portlandpress.com/biochemsoctrans/article-abstract/40/2/370/64893,14090618536917419562,/scholar?cites=14090618536917419562,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1012.7694&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Ltd,Reverse transcription of retroviral RNA into linear double‐stranded DNA and its integration into the host cell genome are essential steps in the retroviral life cycle. The nonhomologous end‐joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway has been implicated in protecting cells from retrovirus‐induced apoptosis caused by strand breaks in host cell DNA or unintegrated linear viral DNA. In eukaryotes. both the NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR) pathways play important roles in repairing DNA double‐strand breaks. Here we show that the HR repair protein RAD52 modulates the outcome of recombinant HIV‐l vector infection by markedly reducing the efficiency of productive integration events. Increased retroviral integration is the first major phenotype described for a RAD52 deficiency in mammalian cells. Mutations in other HR proteins (XRCC2.

The addition and removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins from factors has recently been demonstrated as a key mechanism to modulate DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. It is thus. timely to evaluate the potential for ubiquitin pathway enzymes as DDR drug targets for therapeutic intervention.

Florigen moves through the phloem to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) where it induces flowering. In Arabidopsis. the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein acts as a component of this phloem-mobile signal. However whether the transportable FT mRNA also contributes to systemic florigen signalling remains to be elucidated. Using non-conventional approaches that exploit virus-induced RNA silencing and meristem exclusion of virus infection. we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis FT mRNA. independent of the FT protein. can move into the SAM.

Symp,,91-104.1999,,The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear protein serine/threonine kinase that must bind to DNA double-strand breaks to be active. We and others have shown that it is a multiprotein complex comprising an approx. 465 kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKs) and a DNA-binding component. Ku. Notably. cells defective in DNA-PK are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. Thus X-ray-sensitive hamster xrs-6 cells are mutated in Ku. and rodent V3 cells and cells of the severe combined immune-deficient (Scid) mouse lack a functional DNA-PK. Cloning of the DNA-PK. cDNA revealed that it falls into the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase family of proteins. However. biochemical assays indicate that DNA-PK contains no intrinsic lipid kinase activity. but is instead a serine/threonine kinase. We have also found that DNA-PK activity can be inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294. 002. Consistent with its proposed role in genome surveillance and the detection of DNA damage. DNA-PK. is most similar to a subset of proteins involved in cell-cycle checkpoint control and signalling of DNA damage. Furthermore. the recent cloning of the gene mutated in ataxiatelangiectasia (AT) patients. named ATM (AT mutated). has revealed that the product of this gene is also a PI 3-kinase family member and is related to DNA-PK.. Although much is known about the clinical symptoms and cellular phenotypes that arise from disruption of the AT gene. little is known about the biochemical action of ATM in response to DNA damage.

Interestingly. several members of the family also have key roles in recombination--the best examples being provided by DNA-PK. which is essential for V (D) J recombination. Major goals for future research will be to determine precisely how DNA-PK and its relatives function at the molecular level and to identify and characterize other components of the DNA repair and DNA damage signalling pathways.

Here. we describe a Cas9 D10A-based screening approach that combines an All-in-One Cas9 D10A nickase vector with fluorescence-activated cell sorting enrichment followed by high-throughput genotypic and phenotypic clonal screening strategies to generate isogenic knockouts and knock-ins highly efficiently. with minimal off-target effects. We validated this approach by targeting genes for the DNA-damage response (DDR) proteins MDC1. 53BP1.

We have used cells of two radioresistant human tumor cell lines. one that shows increased sensitivity to low radiation doses (T98G) and one that does not (U373). to investigate the DNA damage response at low doses in detail and to establish whether there is a discontinuous dose response or threshold in activation of any important mediators of this response.

Here. we report the cloning of a Sulfolobus shibatae gene that encodes a protein (transcription factor TFB) with striking homology to the eukaryotic basal transcription factor TFIIB. We show by primer extension analysis that transcription of the S. shibatae TFB gene initiates 27 bp downstream from a consensus A-box element. Significantly. S. shibatae TFB contains an N-terminal putative metal-binding region and two imperfect direct repeats--structural features that are well …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC,59,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/13/6077.short,15621762115437184004,/scholar?cites=15621762115437184004,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/92/13/6077.full.pdf,0

Ewing’s sarcoma cells are acutely hypersensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and this is being evaluated in clinical trials. although the mechanism of hypersensitivity has not been directly addressed. PARP inhibitors have efficacy in tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations. which confer deficiency in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). This drives dependence on PARP1/2 due to their function in DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair. PARP inhibitors are also cytotoxic through inhibiting PARP1/2 auto-PARylation. blocking PARP1/2 release from substrate DNA. Here. we show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity in Ewing’s sarcoma cells is not through an apparent defect in DNA repair by HR. but through hypersensitivity to trapped PARP1-DNA complexes. This drives accumulation of DNA damage during replication. ultimately leading to apoptosis. We also show that the activity of PARP inhibitors is potentiated by temozolomide in Ewing’s sarcoma cells and is associated with enhanced trapping of PARP1-DNA complexes. Furthermore. through mining of large-scale drug sensitivity datasets. we identify a subset of glioma. neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines as hypersensitive to the combination of temozolomide and PARP inhibition. potentially identifying new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

In short days (SDs) levels of CO expression are normally low during the light period. and this results in delayed flowering compared with long days (LDs) when CO expression rises to high levels before the end of the light period. We identified a novel flowering time gene called DAY NEUTRAL FLOWERING (DNF) that acts in the same flowering pathway as CO. DNF is a membrane-bound E3 ligase that represses CO expression and plays an important role in maintaining low levels of CO expression in SDs.

We show that the NEXT subunit RBM7 is phosphorylated upon DNA damage by the MAPKAPK2 kinase and establish that this mediates 14-3-3 binding and decreases PROMPT binding. These findings and our observation that cells lacking RBM7 display DNA damage hypersensitivity link PROMPT turnover to the DNA damage response.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC,47,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/28/18/1977.short,6615089483426894873,/scholar?cites=6615089483426894873,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/28/18/1977.full.pdf,0

The mouse homologue. mMDC1. retains the key motifs identified in the humanprotein and in response to ionizing radiation forms foci that colocalize with the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and factors such as ?H2AX and 53BP1. In addition. mMDC1 is associatedwith DNA damage sites generated during meiotic recombination as well as the X and Ychromosomes during the late stages of meiotic prophase I. Finally. whereas MDC1 shows strongcolocalization with the MRN complex in response to DNA damage it does not colocalize with theMRN complex on replicating chromatin. These data suggest that mMDC1 is a marker for bothexogenously and endogenously generated DNA double-stranded breaks and that …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,36,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cc.4.1.1354,11962388311321403869,/scholar?cites=11962388311321403869,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/cc.4.1.1354,0

These are TBP. the TATA-box-binding protein and TFB. the archaeal homologue of TFIIB. Thus. the archaeal and eucaryal transcription machineries are fundamentally related. In both RNAP II and archaeal transcription systems. direct contacts between TFB/TFIIB and the RNAP have been demonstrated to mediate recruitment of the polymerase to the promoter. However the subunit(s) directly contacted by these factors has not been identified. Using systematic yeast two-hybrid and biochemical analyses we have identified an interaction between the N-terminal domain of TFB and an evolutionarily conserved subunit of the RNA polymerase. RpoK. Intriguingly. homologues of RpoK are found in all three nuclear RNA polymerases (Rpb6) and also in the bacterial RNA polymerase (ω-subunit).,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC,36,https://www.jbc.org/content/276/50/46693.short,8569900547196214441,/scholar?cites=8569900547196214441,,https://www.jbc.org/content/276/50/46693.full.pdf,0

Selecting and validating appropriate reference genes for normalising target gene expression should be the first step in any expression study to avoid inaccurate results.In this study. ten candidate genes were tested for their suitability for use as reference genes in diurnal and developmental timecourse experiments in lettuce.

In addition. the efficacy of many chemotherapeutic strategies is dictated by the status of the DDR. Ubiquitin-specific protease 28 (USP28) was reported to govern the stability of multiple factors that are critical for diverse aspects of the DDR. Here. we examined the effects of USP28 depletion on the DDR in cells and in vivo. We found that USP28 is recruited to double-strand breaks in a manner that requires the tandem BRCT domains of the DDR protein 53BP1.

Central to these events is the sequential activation of a cascade of proteinases known as caspases. The final activated effector caspases of this cascade digest a number of cellular proteins. in some cases increasing their enzymatic activity. in others destroying their function. Of the proteins shown to be targets for caspase-mediated proteolysis. a surprisingly large proportion are proteins involved in the signalling or repair of DNA damage. Here we investigate whether BLM. the product of the gene mutated in Bloom’s syndrome. a human autosomal disease characterised by cancer predisposition and sunlight sensitivity. is cleaved during apoptosis.

One of the most common ways of altering gene expression is by modulating the rate of transcriptional initiation. Typically. an environmental signal such as a hormone reaches the cell surface and triggers a series of intracellular signal transduction events that result ultimately in either activation or inactivation of a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor within the nucleus. In many cases. the change in transcription factor activity is achieved via phosphorylation [1. 2].

For example. much headway has been made in our appreciation of the origin recognition complex (ORC). which plays a crucial role in initiating semi-conservative DNA replication.

44977,Ubiquitin regulates dissociation of DNA repair factors from chromatin,2015,Petra Beli and Stephen P Jackson,6,Oncotarget,17,14727,Impact Journals. LLC,Involvement of the ubiquitin system in DNA repair and DNA damage signaling has been extensively studied during the last decade. Dynamic modification of proteins with ubiquitin after DNA damage has been shown to play important roles in virtually all DNA repair pathways [1]. In this regard. protein ubiquitylation has most frequently been associated with the recruitment of DNA repair factors–many containing ubiquitin-binding domains–to DNA lesions and/or flanking chromatin. A prominent example of this is monoubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA by the ubiquitin ligase RAD18 that leads to recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases and ensuing translesion DNA synthesis. In addition. ubiquitylation of histone variant H2AX after DNA damage by the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 promotes the repair and signaling of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and leads to recruitment of downstream repair …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC,5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558107/,8061950990733669473,/scholar?cites=8061950990733669473,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558107/,0

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious DNA lesions. and if left unrepaired or repaired incorrectly. a single DSB can trigger genome instability or even cell death [1]. Therefore. any DSB has to be recognized and repaired by processes encompassed within the DNA damage response (DDR). Notably. while the ends of mammalian linear chromosomes naturally resemble DSBs. their structure and association with the so-called “Shelterin” complex normally makes them invisible to the DDR [2]. As soon as a DSB is formed. it is sensed and directly bound by the Ku70-Ku80 and/or MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 protein complexes. which recruit and activate the DDR kinases DNA-PKcs and ATM. respectively.

44981,DAY NEUTRAL FLOWERING does not act through GIGANTEA and FKF1 to regulate CONSTANS expression and flowering time,2010,Karl Morris and Stephen P Jackson,5,Plant signaling & behavior,9,1105-1107,Taylor & Francis,  The regulation of CONSTANS (CO) gene expression and protein levels is the critical factor in determining a plant’s response to photoperiod. flowering is induced when high levels of CO protein are present in the light. The regulation of CO transcription is mediated in part by GIGANTEA (GI). FKF1 and the CYCLING DOF FACTORS (CDFs) and factors affecting the levels of these proteins will also affect CO expression. The DAY NEUTRAL FLOWERING (DNF) protein is an E3 ligase involved in repressing CO expression in the early part of the day. In this article we present evidence to support the argument that DNF is not acting through the GI/FKF1/CDF regulatory mechanism to repress CO expression. but that it acts on another transcriptional activator of CO.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C,4,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/psb.5.9.12416,277276503521553583,/scholar?cites=277276503521553583,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/psb.5.9.12416,0

These studies. however. were mostly executed with cell lines and mice using single or multiple acute doses of radiation. Hence. relatively little is known about how continuous exposure to low dose ionising radiation affects normal cells and organisms. even though our cells are constantly exposed to low levels of radiation. We addressed this issue by examining the consequences of exposing human primary cells to continuous ionising γ-radiation delivered at 6–20 mGy/h. Although these dose rates are estimated to inflict fewer than a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) per hour per cell. they still caused dose-dependent reductions in cell proliferation and increased cellular senescence. We concomitantly observed histone protein levels to reduce by up to 40%. which in contrast …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC,3,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59163-4,15956215264430192663,/scholar?cites=15956215264430192663,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59163-4,0

Here. by using CRISPR-Cas9 engineered human cell lines. we identify a hitherto unknown. H2AX-independent. function of MDC1 mediated by its PST-repeat region. We show that the PST-repeat region directly interacts with chromatin via the nucleosome acidic patch and mediates DNA damage-independent association of MDC1 with chromatin.

First. it was shown that telomere shortening. which is a major contributor to telomere uncapping. is stress-dependent to a significant degree. Second. the signalling pathway connecting telomere uncapping and replicative senescence appears to be the same as the one that is activated by DNA damage: uncapped telomeres activate signalling cascades involving the protein kinases ATM. ATR and. possibly. DNA-PK. Furthermore. phosphorylation of histone H2A. X facilitates the formation of DNA damage foci around uncapped telomeres. and this in turn activates downstream kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and. eventually. p53. It appears that this signalling pathway has to be maintained in order to keep cells in a senescent state. Thus. cellular senescence can be regarded as a permanently maintained DNA damage response state. This suggests that antibodies against DNA damage foci components might be useful markers for senescent cells in vivo.© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

45004,Mutagenic mechanisms of cancer-associated DNA polymerase ε alleles,2020,Mareike Herzog and Elisa Alonso-Perez and Israel Salguero and Jonas Warringer and David J Adams and Stephen Jackson and Fabio Puddu,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,A single amino acid residue change in the exonuclease domain of human DNA polymerase ε. P286R. is associated with the development of colorectal cancers. and has been shown to impart a mutagenic phenotype. Perhaps unexpectedly. the corresponding Pol ε allele in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pol2-P301R). was found to drive greater mutagenesis than exonuclease-deficient Pol ε (pol2-4). a phenotype sometimes termed ultra-mutagenesis. By studying the impact on mutation frequency. type. replication-strand bias. and sequence context. we show that ultra-mutagenesis is commonly observed in cells carrying a range of cancer-associated Pol ε exonuclease domain alleles. Similarities between mutations generated by these alleles and those generated in pol2-4 cells indicate a shared mechanism of mutagenesis that yields a mutation pattern similar to cancer Signature 14. Comparison of POL2 ultra-mutator with pol2-M644G. a mutant in the polymerase domain decreasing Pol ε fidelity. revealed unexpected analogies in the sequence context and strand bias of mutations. Analysis of mutational patterns unique to exonuclease domain mutant cells suggests that backtracking of the polymerase. when the mismatched primer end cannot be accommodated in the proofreading domain. results in the observed increase in insertions and T>A mutations in specific sequence contexts.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.270124v1.abstract,13365691040078704361,/scholar?cites=13365691040078704361,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/04/2020.09.04.270124.full.pdf,0

Materials and Methods: We linked surgeon. radiologist. pathologist. tissue biobank. and laboratory scientist in order to sample localized regions of elevated density breast tissue from age-matched post-menopausal women. We used this workflow to characterize the relationship between mammographic density. collagen organization and abundance. local micro-mechanical stiffness and protein expression.Results: In normal breast tissue. mammographic density correlates with collagen birefringence and therefore organisation (by Picrosirius red staining/polarised light microscopy) and local stiffness (by atomic force microscopy). Increased stiffness in high mammographic density breasts is associated with remodelling of collagen fibrils into large diameter periductal stiff fibres. rather than the fibrotic deposition of additional collagen. Proteomic analysis revealed that high mammographic density is associated with increased expression of proteins that are involved with extracellular matrix remodelling. and which might contribute to development of cancer. The architectural remodelling of fibrillar collagens. rather than collagen fibrosis. is a key molecular driver of raised mammographic density. In turn. this organisation of collagen fibrils into collagen fibres increases the local mechanical stiffness of breast stroma.Conclusion: Remodelling. and hence stiffening. of breast stromal collagen …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC,1,https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(16)61553-8/abstract,3711845567517184553,/scholar?cites=3711845567517184553,,,0

The relationship between decreased platelet serotonin and the number of serotonin transport channels in the platelet membrane was explored indirectly by measuring the number of the closely associated imipramine binding sites. Imipramine binding parameters were determined in 12 patients suffering from either essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia rubra vera and in 10 healthy controls. The maximal number of imipramine binding sites (Bmax) was increased in both patient groups. significantly so in those suffering from essential thrombocythaemia. This increase contrasts with a decrease in binding in other conditions known to be associated with decreased platelet serotonin. This study thus demonstrates a discrepancy in terms of reduced platelet serotonin content and increased imipramine binding on platelets from patients suffering from essential thrombocythaemia.

Massive genome sequencing has allowed extraction of specific features of many mutational landscapes but it remains difficult to retrospectively determine the mechanistic origin(s). selective forces and trajectories of transient or persistent mutations and genome rearrangements. Here. we conducted the prospective reciprocal approach to inactivate 13 single or multiple evolutionary-conserved genes involved in distinct genome maintenance processes and characterize de novo mutations in 274 diploid S. cerevisiae mutation accumulation lines. This approach revealed the diversity. complexity and ultimate uniqueness of mutational landscapes. differently composed of base substitutions. small InDels. structural variants and/or ploidy variations. Several landscapes parallel the repertoire of mutational signatures in human cancers while others are either novel or composites of sub-signatures resulting from distinct DNA damage lesions.

The conserved protein CCDC61/VFL3 is involved in this process. but its exact role is unclear. Here. we show that CCDC61 is a paralog of SAS6.

Furthermore. we show that CCDC61 binds microtubules and that residues involved in CCDC61 microtubule binding are important for ciliary function in Chlamydomonas.

45022,Chronic irradiation of human cells reduces histone levels and deregulates gene expression,2020,Stephen Jackson and Donna Lowe and Mareike Herzog and Thorsten Mosler and Howard Cohen and Sarah Felton and Petra Beli and Ken Raj and Yaron Galanty,,,,,Nature Publishing Group,Over the past decades. there have been huge advances in understanding cellular responses to ionising radiation (IR) and DNA damage. These studies. however. were mostly executed with cell lines and mice using single or multiple acute doses of radiation. Hence. relatively little is known about how continuous exposure to low dose ionising radiation affects normal cells and organisms. even though our cells are constantly exposed to low levels of radiation. We addressed this issue by examining the consequences of exposing human primary cells to continuous ionising γ-radiation delivered at 6-20 mGy/h. Although these dose rates are estimated to inflict fewer than a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) per hour per cell. they still caused dose-dependent reductions in cell proliferation and increased cellular senescence. We concomitantly observed histone protein levels to reduce by up to 40%. which in contrast to previous observations. was not mainly due to protein degradation but instead correlated with reduced histone gene expression. Histone reductions were accompanied by enlarged nuclear size paralleled by an increase in global transcription. including that of pro-inflammatory genes. Thus. chronic irradiation. even at low dose-rates. can induce cell senescence and alter gene expression via a hitherto uncharacterised epigenetic route. These features of chronic radiation represent a new aspect of radiation biology.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/301759,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/301759/s41598-020-59163-4.pdf?sequence=5,0
45023,PALB2 chromatin recruitment restores homologous recombination in BRCA1 deficient cells depleted of 53BP1,2020,Stephen Jackson and Rimma Belotserkovskaya and Elisenda Raga-Gil and Nicola Lawrence and Richard Butler and Gillian McFadden and Marcus Wilson,,,,,Springer Nature,Loss of functional BRCA1 protein leads to defects in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) and renders cells hypersensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors used to treat BRCA1/2-deficient cancers. However. upon chronic treatment of BRCA1-mutant cells with PARP inhibitors. resistant clones can arise via several mechanisms. including loss of 53BP1 or its downstream co-factors. Defects in the 53BP1 axis partially restore the ability of a BRCA1-deficient cell to form RAD51 filaments at resected DSBs in a PALB2- and BRCA2-dependent manner. and thereby repair DSBs by HR. Exactly how loss of 53BP1 rescues RAD51 loading in BRCA1-deficient cells is not mechanistically understood. Our findings support a model whereby depleting 53BP1 in BRCA1-null cells restores PALB2 accrual at DSBs in a manner dependent on an interaction between PALB2’s Chromatin Associated Motif and the nucleosome acidic patch region. which in 53BP1-expressing cells is bound by 53BP1’s ubiquitin-directed recruitment domain.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/301095,,,,,0

Transgenic or virus-based expression of monomer KSK. in either stably transformed or virus-infected Nicotinana benthamiana plants. failed to show RMG fluorescence. However. incorporating tandem repeats of KSK into recombinant viral RNAs. enabled qualitative and quantitative detection. both in vitro and ex vivo (ex planta). of KSK-specific green fluorescence. though RMG was less obvious in vivo (in planta). These findings demonstrate Spinach-based RNA visualization has the potential for ex vivo and in vivo monitoring RNAs in plant cells.",True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.24.310607v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/25/2020.09.24.310607.full.pdf,0

In spite of these success. it has been estimated that as many as 90% of SNPs identified in GWAS studies map to non-coding regions. complicating the mechanistic interpretation of the results. It is thought that these non-coding SNPs fall into regulatory regions and influence the expression of a gene or genes. The study of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provides a method for understanding the link between genetic variants and altered gene expression. and could potentially provide new insights connecting GWAS results to molecular mechanisms. To illustrate how eQTLs can be found and verified. we generated transcriptomic information from various tumor samples using Applied Biosystems’ Clariom D microarrays.

However. the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here. we identified a DICERLIKE2 (DCL2)-dependent mechanism for systemic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing. also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). in Nicotiana benthamiana. Using a suite of transgenic DCL RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter. we demonstrated that N. benthamiana DCL1. DCL2. DCL3. and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22. 24. and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of DCL2 expression reduced the spread of gene silencing. while suppression of DCL3 or DCL4 expression enhanced systemic PTGS. In contrast to DCL4 RNAi lines. DCL2-DCL4 double-RNAi lines developed systemic PTGS similar to that observed in DCL2 RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that DCL2 was required in the scion to respond to the signal. but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated DCL genetic pathway in which DCL2 plays an essential role in systemic PTGS in N. benthamiana. while both DCL4 and DCL3 attenuate systemic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21. 22. and 24 nt siRNAs in systemic PTGS.RNA silencing is a cellular gene regulatory mechanism that is …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02534590/document,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02534590/document,0

Autosomal dominant mutations in MAPT cause inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD). but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Using human stem cell models of FTD due to MAPT mutations. we find that tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalises to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in cortical neurons. recapitulating a key early event in FTD. Mislocalised tau in the cell body leads to abnormal microtubule dynamics in FTD-MAPT neurons that grossly deform the nuclear membrane. resulting in defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. Neurons in the post-mortem human FTD-MAPT cortex have a high incidence of nuclear deformation. indicating that tau-mediated nuclear membrane dysfunction is an important pathogenic process in FTD. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport in FTD point to important commonalities in the pathogenic mechanisms of both tau-mediated dementias and ALS-FTD due to TDP-43 and C9orf72 mutations.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/328187v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/05/22/328187.full.pdf,0

Here. we identify the piggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) gene as an enzymatically active human DNA transposase expressed in the majority of rhabdoid tumors. a lethal childhood cancer. Using assembly-based whole-genome DNA sequencing. we observed previously unknown somatic genomic rearrangements in primary human rhabdoid tumors. These rearrangements were characterized by deletions and inversions involving PGBD5-specific signal (PSS) sequences at their breakpoints. with some recurrently targeting tumor suppressor genes. leading to their inactivation. PGBD5 was found to be physically associated with human genomic PSS sequences that were also sufficient to mediate PGBD5-induced DNA rearrangements in rhabdoid tumor cells. We found that ectopic expression of PGBD5 in primary immortalized human cells was sufficient to promote penetrant cell transformation in vitro and in immunodeficient mice in vivo. This activity required specific catalytic residues in the PGBD5 transposase domain. as well as end-joining DNA repair. and induced distinct structural rearrangements. involving PSS-associated breakpoints. similar to those found in primary human rhabdoid tumors. This defines PGBD5 as an oncogenic mutator and provides a plausible mechanism for site-specific DNA rearrangements in childhood and adult solid tumors.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/111138v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/02/23/111138.full.pdf,0

These alterations could also predict prognosis. sensitivity or resistance to specific therapies and has been in the focus of personalized cancer therapy/precision oncology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a valuable solution for high-throughput applications. however. the workflow and the data analysis can be complex. lengthy (often> 40 hours) and cumbersome. Moreover. NGS is not a costeffective approach when only a limited number of targets need to be screened. Finally. NGS results often require a reliable and sensitive confirmatory method. There is clearly a need for a robust. fast. simple and affordable screening and/or confirmatory method for detecting low level somatic variants.

Translational safety assessment could improve the probability of success for new drugs through a critical evaluation of safety decision making.  In this analysis. the shared CNS safety data of 141 small molecules from six pharmaceutical companies derived from rodent neurofunctional assessments was investigated to identify the concordance between nonclinical assessments and phase I First In Human (FIH) outcomes.  The data indicate that. in the context of the data collection parameters in this analysis. the rodent neurofunctional assessment did not detect or predict the most commonly observed subjective CNS AE’s in the FIH study. which were headache. nausea. dizziness. fatigue and/or somnolence and pain.  Furthermore. the presence of any finding in the same nonclinical assessment does not predict the likelihood of whether compounds will produce any of these CNS AE’s during the FIH study. This analysis indicates that the findings from the rodent neurofunctional assessment cannot be used to predict the presence of commonly observed spontaneously reported subjective CNS AE’s in FIH studies.  However. it should be emphasized that these CNS AE’s with the highest prevalence in FIH studies are often not responsible for delaying or stopping further progression of candidate drugs.  Additional CNS AE’s that might be considered ‘showstoppers’ occurred at an incidence rate in our clinical dataset which was too low to enable meaningful statistical …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:IaI1MmNe2tcC,0,http://oak.novartis.com/24472/,,,,,0

45056,School of Life Sciences. University of Warwick. Coventry. West Midlands. UK,2015,Tiziana Sgamma and Stephen Jackson,,Applied Plant Genomics and Biotechnology,72,115,Woodhead Publishing,Plants are sessile organisms that have developed the ability to perceive. anticipate and respond to environmental changes to maximize their ability to survive and reproduce. One of the most important aims in the life of any plant is to flower and reproduce. Plants regulate the timing of the onset of flowering to enable seed production and dispersal before environmental conditions become too adverse. For outbreeding species flowering is often synchronized with other individuals. or with insect or bird pollinators. to increase the chance of cross-pollination. Furthermore. if a plant flowers too early it might not be sufficiently well established and lack enough resources to support the production of flowers and seed. Timing is therefore the key to success and plants have developed a very elaborate network of interacting molecular pathways to control when flowering occurs. These pathways are influenced by predictable environmental cues such as diurnal and annual changes in light and temperature. and by unpredictable and internal factors such as nutrient levels. biotic and abiotic stresses. plant age and maturity. Plants modulate their development in response to these factors with short-term (eg diurnal) or long-term (eg seasonal) responses accordingly. The rate of the response is also dependent on the plant species. Generally plants are divided between annual plants that complete their development within 1 year. flowering just once at the end of their life-cycle. and biennials or perennial plants whose life cycles span two or more years. during which they can flower once (monocarpic) or several times (polycarpic).

Here. we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein acetyltransferase KAT5 (Tip60) increases in response to DNA damage in a manner that promotes KAT5 binding to the histone mark H3K9me3. This in turn triggers KAT5-mediated acetylation of the ATM kinase. promoting DNA-damage checkpoint activation and cell survival. We also establish that chromatin alterations per se can enhance KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and ATM-dependent signaling. and identify the proto-oncogene c-Abl as mediating this modification.

DNA double strand breaks are repaired by nonhomologous end joining. whereas in S and G2. they are also repaired by homologous recombination. The human CtIP protein controls double strand break (DSB) resection. an event that occurs effectively only in S/G2 and that promotes homologous recombination but not non-homologous end joining. Here. we mutate a highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) target motif in CtIP and reveal that mutating Thr-847 to Ala impairs resection. whereas mutating it to Glu to mimic constitutive phosphorylation does not. Moreover. we show that unlike cells expressing wild-type CtIP. cells expressing the Thr-to-Glu mutant resect DSBs even after CDK inhibition. Finally. we establish that Thr-847 mutations to either Ala or Glu affect DSB repair efficiency. cause hypersensitivity toward DSB-generating agents. and affect the frequency and nature of radiation-induced chromosomal rearrangements. These results suggest that CDKmediated control of resection in human cells operates by mechanisms similar to those recently established in yeast.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC,0,https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/84480,,,,https://idus.us.es/bitstream/handle/11441/84480/pub9558.pdf?sequence=1,0

HR is the most accurate DSB repair mechanism but is generally restricted to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. when DNA has been replicated and a sister chromatid is available as a repair template2-5. By contrast. NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle but assumes most importance in G1 (refs 4​. ​6). The choice between repair pathways is governed by cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs)2.3.5.7. with a major site of control being at the level of DSB resection. an event that is necessary for HR but not NHEJ. and which takes place most effectively in S and G2 (refs 2​. ​5). Here we establish that cell-cycle control of DSB resection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from the phosphorylation by CDK of an evolutionarily conserved motif in the Sae2 protein. We show that mutating Ser 267 of Sae2 to a non-phosphorylatable residue causes phenotypes comparable to those of a sae2Δ null mutant. including hypersensitivity to camptothecin. defective sporulation. reduced hairpin-induced recombination. severely impaired DNA-end processing and faulty assembly and disassembly of HR factors. Furthermore. a Sae2 mutation that mimics constitutive Ser 267 phosphorylation complements these phenotypes and overcomes the necessity of CDK activity for DSB resection. The Sae2 mutations also cause cell-cycle-stage specific hypersensitivity to DNA damage and affect the balance between HR and NHEJ.

DSBs can also directly inactivate key genes. lead to chromosomal translocations. or generate unstable chromosomal abnormalities [2]. which may ultimately lead to cancer development. DSBs are induced by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals but can also be generated during site-specific recombination events (for example. during V (D) J recombination in the immune system and meiotic recombination) and during DNA replication.Because the effects of DNA DSBs are potentially so serious. eukaryotes have elaborate systems to repair the damage rapidly or to stop DNA replication and cell division until the damage has been repaired (Fig. 1;[3]).

45082,GENES: STRUCTURE AND REGULATION-The role of transcription factor B in transcription initiation and promoter clearance in the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius,2000,Stephen D Bell and Stephen P Jackson,275,Journal of Biological Chemistry,17,12934-12940,Baltimore [etc.],Mechanisms of transcription initiation appear to be remarkably conserved between archaea and eucaryotes. For instance. there is homology between archaeal and eucaryotic basal transcription factors. Also. the archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP) resembles eucaryotic nuclear RNAPs in subunit composition and at the amino acid sequence level. Here. we examine the role of transcription factor B. the archaeal homologue of eucaryotic transcription factor IIB. in transcription initiation. We show that the N-terminal region of transcription factor B is required for RNAP recruitment. Furthermore. we reveal that mutation of a conserved residue immediately C-terminal of the N-terminal zinc ribbon motif abrogates transcription on certain promoters. Finally. we identify the promoter sequences responsive to this mutation and demonstrate that the effect of the mutation is to block a late stage in transcription initiation. following …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6486699555114130985&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Among the mechanistic scenarios underlying FA pathogenesis. the authors refer to a phenotypic feature of FA cells related to oxygen hypersensitivity. Unfortunately. the use of citations on this subject appears to be quite inappropriate. First. the authors attributed a ‘‘secondary’’role for oxygen sensitivity in FA cells2 which. however. may have been made oxygen-resistant after the immortalization procedure. In fact. the loss of O2 sensitivity in transformed cells has been recognized as a general phenomenon. not confined to FA cell lines. 3 A general statement was then made1 about the published results of studies which ‘‘have demonstrated overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased susceptibility to oxygen. as well as an increase in ROS-induced DNA …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC,0,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/93/3/1116/261139,,,,,0
