44641,Targeting the DNA repair defect in BRCA mutant cells as a therapeutic strategy,2005.0,Hannah Farmer and Nuala McCabe and Christopher J Lord and Andrew NJ Tutt and Damian A Johnson and Tobias B Richardson and Manuela Santarosa and Krystyna J Dillon and Ian Hickson and Charlotte Knights and Niall MB Martin and Stephen P Jackson and Graeme CM Smith and Alan Ashworth,434.0,Nature,7035,917-921,Nature Publishing Group,BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination 1. and mutations in these genes predispose to breast and other cancers 2. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an enzyme involved in base excision repair. a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks 3. We show here that BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction unexpectedly and profoundly sensitizes cells to the inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity. resulting in chromosomal instability. cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This seems to be because the inhibition of PARP leads to the persistence of DNA lesions normally repaired by homologous recombination. These results illustrate how different pathways cooperate to repair damage. and suggest that the targeted inhibition of particular DNA repair pathways may allow the design of specific and less toxic therapies for cancer.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5261,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03445,5115644684342347050,/scholar?cites=5115644684342347050,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Hickson/publication/7907060_Targeting_the_DNA_repair_defect_in_BRCA_mutant_cells_as_a_therapeutic_strategy/links/0fcfd50abe504e36a3000000.pdf,0,0,0

This must be achieved despite constant assaults by endogenous and environmental agents on the DNA. To counter this threat. life has evolved several systems to detect DNA damage. signal its presence and mediate its repair.

Cells respond to DNA damage by activating a complex DNA-damage-response pathway that includes cell-cycle arrest. the transcriptional and post-transcriptional activation of a subset of genes including those associated with DNA repair. and. under some circumstances. the triggering of programmed cell death. An inability to respond properly to. or to repair. DNA damage leads to genetic instability. which in turn may enhance the rate of cancer development. Indeed. it is becoming increasingly clear that deficiencies in DNA-damage signaling and repair pathways are fundamental to the etiology of most. if not all. human cancers.

44645,Sensing and repairing DNA double-strand breaks,2002.0,Stephen P Jackson,23.0,Carcinogenesis,5,687-696,Oxford University Press,The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the principle cytotoxic lesion for ionizing radiation and radio-mimetic chemicals but can also be caused by mechanical stress on chromosomes or when a replicative DNA polymerase encounters a DNA single-strand break or other type of DNA lesion. DSBs also occur as intermediates in various biological events. such as V(D)J recombination in developing lymphoid cells. Inaccurate repair or lack of repair of a DSB can lead to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have tumourigenic potential. In other instances. DSBs can be sufficient to induce apoptosis. Because of the threats posed by DSBs. eukaryotic cells have evolved complex and highly conserved systems to rapidly and efficiently detect these lesions. signal their presence and bring about their repair.

Mutation of ATM occurs in the human autosomal recessive disorder ataxia-telangiectasia. which is characterized by hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and a failure of cells to arrest the cell cycle after the induction of DNA double-strand breaks.

Several forms of DNA damage have been shown to activate p53. including those generated by ionising radiation (IR). radio-mimetic drugs. ultraviolet light (UV) and chemicals such as methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Under normal conditions. p53 levels are maintained at a low state by virtue of the extremely short-half life of the polypeptide. In addition to this. p53 normally exists in an largely inactive state that is relatively inefficient at binding to DNA and activating transcription. Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage is associated with a rapid increase in its levels and with an increased ability of p53 to bind DNA and mediate transcriptional activation.

Our results define ALC1 as a DNA damage–response protein whose role in this process is sustained by its association with known DNA repair factors and its rapid poly(ADP-ribose)–dependent recruitment to DNA damage sites. Furthermore. we show that depletion or overexpression of ALC1 results in sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.

Thus. cells must be equipped with mechanisms to surpass this natural obstacle. DNA damage induces histone H2AX phosphorylation by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase like kinases ATM. ATR and DNA-PKcs. H2AX phosphorylation contributes to DNA double-strand break repair but the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. In this review. we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how cells use the epigenetic mark of H2AX phosphorylation to dynamically link the DNA-damage-response machinery to broken chromosomes.

The key protein components of chromatin are histones. whose post‐translational modifications control diverse chromatin functions. Here. we report our findings from a large‐scale screen for DNA‐damage‐responsive histone modifications in human cells. We have identified specific phosphorylations and acetylations on histone H3 that decrease in response to DNA damage. Significantly. we find that DNA‐damage‐induced changes in H3S10p. H3S28p and H3.3S31p are a consequence of cell‐cycle re‐positioning rather than DNA damage per se. In contrast.

Ltd,We identified YDR499W as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frame with homology to several checkpoint proteins. including S.cerevisiae Rfc5p and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad26. Disruption of YDR499W (termed LCD1) results in lethality that is rescued by increasing cellular deoxyribonucleotide levels. Cells lacking LCD1 are very sensitive to a range of DNA‐damaging agents. including UV irradiation. and to the inhibition of DNA replication. LCD1 is necessary for the phosphorylation and activation of Rad53p in response to DNA damage or DNA replication blocks. and for Chk1p activation in response to DNA damage. LCD1 is also required for efficient DNA damage‐induced phosphorylation of Rad9p and for the association of Rad9p with the FHA2 domain of Rad53p after DNA damage.

Repair of DSB in eukaryotic cells can occur via a homologous recombination pathway involving RAD51 and RAD52. or via a non-homologous double-strand endjoining pathway (NHEJ). a form of DSB repair [1]. Although both pathways are present in all eukaryotes. in yeast. repair of DSB is primarily achieved by homologous recombination. whereas NHEJ repair is the predominant mechanism in vertebrates [1]. The NHEJ pathway in higher eukaryotes is dependent on a multiprotein complex. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)[1] which consists of a DNA-binding component. a heterodimer of two proteins. Ku70 and Ku80. and a catalytic subunit. DNA-PKcs. The main function of the Ku70/80 component of DNA-PK. is the primary recognition of DSB. Ku displays high affinity in vitro for a variety of DNA ends including blunt ends. 5P and 3P overhangs. and DNA hairpins which occur as intermediates in V (D) J chain recombination [2]. In mammalian cells. the Ku heterodimer recruits the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. which is dependent on association with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer bound to DNA. for its protein kinase activity.

Genetically. it constitutes a heterogeneous condition. with several loci mapped (SCKL1-5) but only three disease genes identified: the ATR. CENPJ. and CEP152 genes that control cellular responses to DNA damage. We previously mapped a Seckel syndrome locus to chromosome 18p11.31-q11.2 (SCKL2). Here. we report two mutations in the CtIP (RBBP8) gene within this locus that result in expression of C-terminally truncated forms of CtIP. We propose that these mutations are the molecular cause of the disease observed in the previously described SCKL2 family and in an additional unrelated family diagnosed with a similar form of congenital microcephaly termed Jawad syndrome. While an exonic frameshift mutation was found in the Jawad family. the SCKL2 family carries a splicing mutation that yields a dominant-negative form of CtIP. Further characterization of cell lines derived from the SCKL2 family revealed defective DNA damage induced formation of single-stranded DNA. a critical co-factor for ATR activation. Accordingly. SCKL2 cells present a lowered apoptopic threshold and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Notably. over-expression of a comparable truncated CtIP variant in non-Seckel cells recapitulates SCKL2 cellular phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. This work thus identifies CtIP as a disease gene for Seckel and Jawad syndromes and defines a new type of genetic disease mechanism in which a dominant negative mutation yields a recessively inherited disorder.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,128,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002310,151413091395571351,/scholar?cites=151413091395571351,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002310,0,0,0

In many instances. alterations in patterns of gene expression are triggered by agents such as growth factors interacting with receptors on the cell surface (Fig. 1). This stimulus is then transduced into the cytoplasm. where intracellular signalling systems are activated. The usual end point of such pathways is the activation or inactivation of a key molecule that regulates transcription 1. resulting in specific changes in gene transcription (Box 1).

CHK1 gene deletion is embryonically lethal. and Chk1 inhibition in replicating cells causes cell-cycle defects that eventually lead to perturbed replication and replication-fork collapse. thus generating endogenous DNA damage. What is the cause of replication-fork collapse when Chk1 is inactivated. however. remains poorly understood. Here. we show that generation of DNA double-strand breaks at replication forks when Chk1 activity is compromised relies on the DNA endonuclease complex Mus81/Eme1. Importantly. we show that Mus81/Eme1-dependent DNA damage—rather than a global increase in replication-fork stalling—is the cause of incomplete replication in Chk1-deficient cells. Consequently. Mus81/Eme1 depletion alleviates the S-phase progression defects associated with Chk1 deficiency. thereby increasing cell survival. Chk1-mediated protection of replication forks from Mus81/Eme1 even under otherwise unchallenged conditions is therefore vital to prevent uncontrolled fork collapse and ensure proper S-phase progression in human cells.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,106,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023517,11517660235316876632,/scholar?cites=11517660235316876632,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023517,0,0,0

A high level of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations amplified by treatment with DNA cross-linking agents is the hallmark of Fanconi anemia (FA). an inherited chromosomal instability syndrome associated with cancer proneness. Two of the eight FA genes have been cloned (FAA and FAC). but their function has not yet been defined. The lack of homology with known genes suggests the involvement of FA genes in a novel pathway specific to vertebrates. Using a DNA end-joining assay in cultured cells. we studied the processing of both blunt and cohesive-ended double strand breaks (DSB) in normal and FA cells.

Ltd,Reverse transcription of retroviral RNA into linear double‐stranded DNA and its integration into the host cell genome are essential steps in the retroviral life cycle. The nonhomologous end‐joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway has been implicated in protecting cells from retrovirus‐induced apoptosis caused by strand breaks in host cell DNA or unintegrated linear viral DNA. In eukaryotes. both the NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR) pathways play important roles in repairing DNA double‐strand breaks. Here we show that the HR repair protein RAD52 modulates the outcome of recombinant HIV‐l vector infection by markedly reducing the efficiency of productive integration events.

Using non-conventional approaches that exploit virus-induced RNA silencing and meristem exclusion of virus infection. we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis FT mRNA. independent of the FT protein. can move into the SAM.

Symp,,91-104.1999,,The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear protein serine/threonine kinase that must bind to DNA double-strand breaks to be active. We and others have shown that it is a multiprotein complex comprising an approx. 465 kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKs) and a DNA-binding component. Ku. Notably. cells defective in DNA-PK are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. Thus X-ray-sensitive hamster xrs-6 cells are mutated in Ku. and rodent V3 cells and cells of the severe combined immune-deficient (Scid) mouse lack a functional DNA-PK. Cloning of the DNA-PK. cDNA revealed that it falls into the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase family of proteins. However. biochemical assays indicate that DNA-PK contains no intrinsic lipid kinase activity. but is instead a serine/threonine kinase. We have also found that DNA-PK activity can be inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294. 002. Consistent with its proposed role in genome surveillance and the detection of DNA damage. DNA-PK. is most similar to a subset of proteins involved in cell-cycle checkpoint control and signalling of DNA damage. Furthermore. the recent cloning of the gene mutated in ataxiatelangiectasia (AT) patients. named ATM (AT mutated). has revealed that the product of this gene is also a PI 3-kinase family member and is related to DNA-PK..

A complex signalling cascade. termed the DNA damage response (DDR). is in place to deal with such DNA lesions and maintain genome stability. Recent work by us and others has found that the signalling cascade activated by DSBs in mitosis is truncated. displaying apical. but not downstream. components of the DDR. The E3 Ubiquitin ligases RNF8. RNF168 and BRCA1. along with the DDR mediator 53BP1. are not recruited to DSB sites in mitosis. and activation of downstream checkpoint kinases is also impaired.

Ltd,Ku is a conserved heterodimeric DNA‐binding protein that plays critical roles in DNA repair and telomere homeostasis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae. deletion of YKU70 or YKU80 results in an inability to grow at 37 C. This is suppressed by overexpression of several components of telomerase (EST1. EST2 and TLC1). We show that overexpression of EST2 or TLC1 in yku80 mutants does not restore efficient DNA repair. or restore normal telomere function. as measured by telomere length. single‐stranded G‐rich strand or transcriptional silencing. Instead. yku80 mutants activate a Rad53p‐dependent DNA‐damage checkpoint at 37 C and this is suppressed by overexpression of EST2 or TLC1. Indeed. deletion of genes required for Rad53p activation also suppresses the yku80 temperature sensitivity.

Ewing’s sarcoma cells are acutely hypersensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and this is being evaluated in clinical trials. although the mechanism of hypersensitivity has not been directly addressed. PARP inhibitors have efficacy in tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations. which confer deficiency in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR). This drives dependence on PARP1/2 due to their function in DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair. PARP inhibitors are also cytotoxic through inhibiting PARP1/2 auto-PARylation. blocking PARP1/2 release from substrate DNA. Here. we show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity in Ewing’s sarcoma cells is not through an apparent defect in DNA repair by HR. but through hypersensitivity to trapped PARP1-DNA complexes. This drives accumulation of DNA damage during replication. ultimately leading to apoptosis. We also show that the activity of PARP inhibitors is potentiated by temozolomide in Ewing’s sarcoma cells and is associated with enhanced trapping of PARP1-DNA complexes. Furthermore. through mining of large-scale drug sensitivity datasets. we identify a subset of glioma. neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines as hypersensitive to the combination of temozolomide and PARP inhibition. potentially identifying new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

Using human stem cell models of FTD due to MAPT mutations. we find that tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalizes to cell bodies and dendrites in cortical neurons. recapitulating a key early event in FTD. Mislocalized tau in the cell body leads to abnormal microtubule movements in FTD-MAPT neurons that grossly deform the nuclear membrane. This results in defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. which is corrected by microtubule depolymerization.

44977,Ubiquitin regulates dissociation of DNA repair factors from chromatin,2015.0,Petra Beli and Stephen P Jackson,6.0,Oncotarget,17,14727,Impact Journals. LLC,Involvement of the ubiquitin system in DNA repair and DNA damage signaling has been extensively studied during the last decade. Dynamic modification of proteins with ubiquitin after DNA damage has been shown to play important roles in virtually all DNA repair pathways [1]. In this regard. protein ubiquitylation has most frequently been associated with the recruitment of DNA repair factors–many containing ubiquitin-binding domains–to DNA lesions and/or flanking chromatin. A prominent example of this is monoubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA by the ubiquitin ligase RAD18 that leads to recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases and ensuing translesion DNA synthesis. In addition. ubiquitylation of histone variant H2AX after DNA damage by the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 promotes the repair and signaling of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and leads to recruitment of downstream repair …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC,5,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558107/,8061950990733669473,/scholar?cites=8061950990733669473,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4558107/,0,0,0

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most deleterious DNA lesions. and if left unrepaired or repaired incorrectly. a single DSB can trigger genome instability or even cell death [1]. Therefore. any DSB has to be recognized and repaired by processes encompassed within the DNA damage response (DDR). Notably. while the ends of mammalian linear chromosomes naturally resemble DSBs. their structure and association with the so-called “Shelterin” complex normally makes them invisible to the DDR [2]. As soon as a DSB is formed. it is sensed and directly bound by the Ku70-Ku80 and/or MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 protein complexes. which recruit and activate the DDR kinases DNA-PKcs and ATM. respectively.

The regulation of CO transcription is mediated in part by GIGANTEA (GI). FKF1 and the CYCLING DOF FACTORS (CDFs) and factors affecting the levels of these proteins will also affect CO expression. The DAY NEUTRAL FLOWERING (DNF) protein is an E3 ligase involved in repressing CO expression in the early part of the day.

These studies. however. were mostly executed with cell lines and mice using single or multiple acute doses of radiation. Hence. relatively little is known about how continuous exposure to low dose ionising radiation affects normal cells and organisms. even though our cells are constantly exposed to low levels of radiation. We addressed this issue by examining the consequences of exposing human primary cells to continuous ionising γ-radiation delivered at 6–20 mGy/h. Although these dose rates are estimated to inflict fewer than a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) per hour per cell. they still caused dose-dependent reductions in cell proliferation and increased cellular senescence.

When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur. H2AX is phosphorylated and then recruits MDC1. which in turn serves as a docking platform to promote the localization of other factors. including 53BP1. to DSB sites. Here. by using CRISPR-Cas9 engineered human cell lines. we identify a hitherto unknown. H2AX-independent. function of MDC1 mediated by its PST-repeat region. We show that the PST-repeat region directly interacts with chromatin via the nucleosome acidic patch and mediates DNA damage-independent association of MDC1 with chromatin. We find that this region is largely functionally dispensable when the canonical γH2AX-MDC1 pathway is operative but becomes critical for 53BP1 recruitment to DNA-damage sites and cell survival following DSB induction when H2AX is not available.

M115. 683227,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Results:.Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a chromatin-remodeling enzyme that has been reported to regulate DNA damage responses through its N-terminal region in a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase dependent manner. We have identified and determined the structure of a stable domain (CHD4-N) in this Nterminal region. The fold consists of a four α-helix bundle with structural similarity to the High Mobility Group (HMG) box. a domain that is well known as a DNA-binding module. We show that the CHD4-N domain binds with higher affinity to poly (ADP-ribose) than to DNA. We also show that the N-terminal region of CHD4. although not CHD4-N alone. is essential for full nucleosome remodeling activity and is important for localizing CHD4 to sites of DNA damage. Overall. these data build on our understanding of how CHD4/NuRD acts to regulate gene expression and participates in …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC,2,https://www.jbc.org/content/early/2015/11/12/jbc.M115.683227.short,8813895384278655879,/scholar?cites=8813895384278655879,,https://www.jbc.org/content/early/2015/11/12/jbc.M115.683227.full.pdf,0,0,0

First. it was shown that telomere shortening. which is a major contributor to telomere uncapping. is stress-dependent to a significant degree. Second. the signalling pathway connecting telomere uncapping and replicative senescence appears to be the same as the one that is activated by DNA damage: uncapped telomeres activate signalling cascades involving the protein kinases ATM. ATR and. possibly. DNA-PK. Furthermore. phosphorylation of histone H2A. X facilitates the formation of DNA damage foci around uncapped telomeres. and this in turn activates downstream kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and. eventually. p53. It appears that this signalling pathway has to be maintained in order to keep cells in a senescent state. Thus. cellular senescence can be regarded as a permanently maintained DNA damage response state. This suggests that antibodies against DNA damage foci components might be useful markers for senescent cells in vivo.© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

P286R. is associated with the development of colorectal cancers. and has been shown to impart a mutagenic phenotype. Perhaps unexpectedly. the corresponding Pol ε allele in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pol2-P301R). was found to drive greater mutagenesis than exonuclease-deficient Pol ε (pol2-4). a phenotype sometimes termed ultra-mutagenesis. By studying the impact on mutation frequency. type. replication-strand bias. and sequence context. we show that ultra-mutagenesis is commonly observed in cells carrying a range of cancer-associated Pol ε exonuclease domain alleles. Similarities between mutations generated by these alleles and those generated in pol2-4 cells indicate a shared mechanism of mutagenesis that yields a mutation pattern similar to cancer Signature 14. Comparison of POL2 ultra-mutator with pol2-M644G. a mutant in the polymerase domain decreasing Pol ε fidelity. revealed unexpected analogies in the sequence context and strand bias of mutations. Analysis of mutational patterns unique to exonuclease domain mutant cells suggests that backtracking of the polymerase. when the mismatched primer end cannot be accommodated in the proofreading domain. results in the observed increase in insertions and T>A mutations in specific sequence contexts.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.270124v1.abstract,13365691040078704361,/scholar?cites=13365691040078704361,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/04/2020.09.04.270124.full.pdf,0,0,0

Materials and Methods: We linked surgeon. radiologist. pathologist. tissue biobank. and laboratory scientist in order to sample localized regions of elevated density breast tissue from age-matched post-menopausal women. We used this workflow to characterize the relationship between mammographic density. collagen organization and abundance. local micro-mechanical stiffness and protein expression.Results: In normal breast tissue. mammographic density correlates with collagen birefringence and therefore organisation (by Picrosirius red staining/polarised light microscopy) and local stiffness (by atomic force microscopy). Increased stiffness in high mammographic density breasts is associated with remodelling of collagen fibrils into large diameter periductal stiff fibres. rather than the fibrotic deposition of additional collagen. Proteomic analysis revealed that high mammographic density is associated with increased expression of proteins that are involved with extracellular matrix remodelling. and which might contribute to development of cancer. The architectural remodelling of fibrillar collagens. rather than collagen fibrosis. is a key molecular driver of raised mammographic density. In turn. this organisation of collagen fibrils into collagen fibres increases the local mechanical stiffness of breast stroma.Conclusion: Remodelling. and hence stiffening. of breast stromal collagen …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC,1,https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(16)61553-8/abstract,3711845567517184553,/scholar?cites=3711845567517184553,,,0,0,0

The relationship between decreased platelet serotonin and the number of serotonin transport channels in the platelet membrane was explored indirectly by measuring the number of the closely associated imipramine binding sites. Imipramine binding parameters were determined in 12 patients suffering from either essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia rubra vera and in 10 healthy controls. The maximal number of imipramine binding sites (Bmax) was increased in both patient groups. significantly so in those suffering from essential thrombocythaemia. This increase contrasts with a decrease in binding in other conditions known to be associated with decreased platelet serotonin. This study thus demonstrates a discrepancy in terms of reduced platelet serotonin content and increased imipramine binding on platelets from patients suffering from essential thrombocythaemia. It is suggested that further investigation of the imipramine binding site in these disorders. in parallel with measures of platelet serotonin content and uptake. is warranted.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC,1,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1450337,7580098763824997512,/scholar?cites=7580098763824997512,,,0,0,0

Myocardial fibrosis predicts major adverse cardiovascular events and death. yet we are still missing the targeted therapies capable of halting and/or reversing its progression. Fundamentally it is a problem of disproportionate extracellular collagen accumulation that is part of normal myocardial ageing and accentuated in certain disease states. In this article we discuss the role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging biomarkers to track fibrosis and collate results from the most promising animal and human trials of anti-fibrotic therapies to date. We underscore the ever-growing role of CMR in determining the efficacy of such drugs and encourage future trialists to turn to CMR when designing their surrogate study endpoints.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40119-020-00199-y,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40119-020-00199-y,0,0,0

Massive genome sequencing has allowed extraction of specific features of many mutational landscapes but it remains difficult to retrospectively determine the mechanistic origin(s). selective forces and trajectories of transient or persistent mutations and genome rearrangements. Here. we conducted the prospective reciprocal approach to inactivate 13 single or multiple evolutionary-conserved genes involved in distinct genome maintenance processes and characterize de novo mutations in 274 diploid S. cerevisiae mutation accumulation lines. This approach revealed the diversity. complexity and ultimate uniqueness of mutational landscapes. differently composed of base substitutions. small InDels. structural variants and/or ploidy variations. Several landscapes parallel the repertoire of mutational signatures in human cancers while others are either novel or composites of sub-signatures resulting from distinct DNA damage lesions. Notably. the increase of base substitutions in the homologous recombination deficient Rad51 mutant. specifically dependent on the Pol  translesion polymerase. yields COSMIC Signature 3 observed in BRCA1/BRCA2-mutant breast cancer tumors. Furthermore. “mutome” analyses in highly polymorphic diploids and single-cell bottleneck lineages revealed a diverse spectrum of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) signatures characterized by interstitial and terminal chromosomal events resulting from inter-homolog mitotic crossovers.

Centriole symmetry can be broken by centriole-associated structures such as the striated fibres in Chlamydomonas that are important for ciliary function. The conserved protein CCDC61/VFL3 is involved in this process. but its exact role is unclear. Here. we show that CCDC61 is a paralog of SAS6. Crystal structures of CCDC61 demonstrate that it contains two homodimerization interfaces that are similar to those found in SAS6. but result in the formation of linear filaments rather than rings. Furthermore. we show that CCDC61 binds microtubules and that residues involved in CCDC61 microtubule binding are important for ciliary function in Chlamydomonas.

These studies. however. were mostly executed with cell lines and mice using single or multiple acute doses of radiation. Hence. relatively little is known about how continuous exposure to low dose ionising radiation affects normal cells and organisms. even though our cells are constantly exposed to low levels of radiation. We addressed this issue by examining the consequences of exposing human primary cells to continuous ionising γ-radiation delivered at 6-20 mGy/h. Although these dose rates are estimated to inflict fewer than a single DNA double-strand break (DSB) per hour per cell. they still caused dose-dependent reductions in cell proliferation and increased cellular senescence. We concomitantly observed histone protein levels to reduce by up to 40%. which in contrast to previous observations. was not mainly due to protein degradation but instead correlated with reduced histone gene expression. Histone reductions were accompanied by enlarged nuclear size paralleled by an increase in global transcription. including that of pro-inflammatory genes. Thus. chronic irradiation. even at low dose-rates. can induce cell senescence and alter gene expression via a hitherto uncharacterised epigenetic route. These features of chronic radiation represent a new aspect of radiation biology.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/301759,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/301759/s41598-020-59163-4.pdf?sequence=5,0,0,0

However. upon chronic treatment of BRCA1-mutant cells with PARP inhibitors. resistant clones can arise via several mechanisms. including loss of 53BP1 or its downstream co-factors. Defects in the 53BP1 axis partially restore the ability of a BRCA1-deficient cell to form RAD51 filaments at resected DSBs in a PALB2- and BRCA2-dependent manner. and thereby repair DSBs by HR. Exactly how loss of 53BP1 rescues RAD51 loading in BRCA1-deficient cells is not mechanistically understood. Our findings support a model whereby depleting 53BP1 in BRCA1-null cells restores PALB2 accrual at DSBs in a manner dependent on an interaction between PALB2’s Chromatin Associated Motif and the nucleosome acidic patch region. which in 53BP1-expressing cells is bound by 53BP1’s ubiquitin-directed recruitment domain.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/301095,,,,,0,0,0

We found that like bacterial. yeast and human cellular tRNAs. plant tRNAs such as tRNALys (K) can protect and/or stabilize the spinach RNA aptamer interaction with the fluorophore DFHBI enabling detectable levels of green fluorescence to be emitted. The tRNALys-spinach-tRNALys (KSK). once delivered into ""chloroplast-free"" onion epidermal cells can emit strong green fluorescence in the presence of DFHBI. Transgenic or virus-based expression of monomer KSK. in either stably transformed or virus-infected Nicotinana benthamiana plants. failed to show RMG fluorescence. However. incorporating tandem repeats of KSK into recombinant viral RNAs. enabled qualitative and quantitative detection. both in vitro and ex vivo (ex planta). of KSK-specific green fluorescence. though RMG was less obvious in vivo (in planta).

In spite of these success. it has been estimated that as many as 90% of SNPs identified in GWAS studies map to non-coding regions. complicating the mechanistic interpretation of the results. It is thought that these non-coding SNPs fall into regulatory regions and influence the expression of a gene or genes. The study of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provides a method for understanding the link between genetic variants and altered gene expression. and could potentially provide new insights connecting GWAS results to molecular mechanisms.

However. the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here. we identified a DICERLIKE2 (DCL2)-dependent mechanism for systemic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing. also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). in Nicotiana benthamiana. Using a suite of transgenic DCL RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter. we demonstrated that N. benthamiana DCL1. DCL2. DCL3. and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22. 24. and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of DCL2 expression reduced the spread of gene silencing. while suppression of DCL3 or DCL4 expression enhanced systemic PTGS. In contrast to DCL4 RNAi lines. DCL2-DCL4 double-RNAi lines developed systemic PTGS similar to that observed in DCL2 RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that DCL2 was required in the scion to respond to the signal. but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal.

45038,Abnormal microtubule dynamics disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport in tau-mediated frontotemporal dementia,2018.0,Francesco Paonessa and Lewis Evans and Ravi Solanki and Delphine Larrieu and Selina Wray and John Hardy and Stephen P Jackson and Frederick J Livesey,,BioRxiv,,328187,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) is central to the pathogenesis of many dementias. including Alzheimer’s disease. Autosomal dominant mutations in MAPT cause inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD). but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. Using human stem cell models of FTD due to MAPT mutations. we find that tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and mislocalises to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in cortical neurons. recapitulating a key early event in FTD. Mislocalised tau in the cell body leads to abnormal microtubule dynamics in FTD-MAPT neurons that grossly deform the nuclear membrane. resulting in defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. Neurons in the post-mortem human FTD-MAPT cortex have a high incidence of nuclear deformation. indicating that tau-mediated nuclear membrane dysfunction is an important pathogenic process in FTD. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport in FTD point to important commonalities in the pathogenic mechanisms of both tau-mediated dementias and ALS-FTD due to TDP-43 and C9orf72 mutations.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/328187v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/05/22/328187.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we identify the piggyBac transposable element derived 5 (PGBD5) gene as an enzymatically active human DNA transposase expressed in the majority of rhabdoid tumors. a lethal childhood cancer. Using assembly-based whole-genome DNA sequencing. we observed previously unknown somatic genomic rearrangements in primary human rhabdoid tumors. These rearrangements were characterized by deletions and inversions involving PGBD5-specific signal (PSS) sequences at their breakpoints. with some recurrently targeting tumor suppressor genes. leading to their inactivation. PGBD5 was found to be physically associated with human genomic PSS sequences that were also sufficient to mediate PGBD5-induced DNA rearrangements in rhabdoid tumor cells. We found that ectopic expression of PGBD5 in primary immortalized human cells was sufficient to promote penetrant cell transformation in vitro and in immunodeficient mice in vivo. This activity required specific catalytic residues in the PGBD5 transposase domain. as well as end-joining DNA repair. and induced distinct structural rearrangements. involving PSS-associated breakpoints. similar to those found in primary human rhabdoid tumors. This defines PGBD5 as an oncogenic mutator and provides a plausible mechanism for site-specific DNA rearrangements in childhood and adult solid tumors.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/111138v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/02/23/111138.full.pdf,0,0,0

These alterations could also predict prognosis. sensitivity or resistance to specific therapies and has been in the focus of personalized cancer therapy/precision oncology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a valuable solution for high-throughput applications. however. the workflow and the data analysis can be complex. lengthy (often> 40 hours) and cumbersome. Moreover. NGS is not a costeffective approach when only a limited number of targets need to be screened. Finally. NGS results often require a reliable and sensitive confirmatory method.

Translational safety assessment could improve the probability of success for new drugs through a critical evaluation of safety decision making.  In this analysis. the shared CNS safety data of 141 small molecules from six pharmaceutical companies derived from rodent neurofunctional assessments was investigated to identify the concordance between nonclinical assessments and phase I First In Human (FIH) outcomes.  The data indicate that. in the context of the data collection parameters in this analysis. the rodent neurofunctional assessment did not detect or predict the most commonly observed subjective CNS AE’s in the FIH study. which were headache. nausea. dizziness. fatigue and/or somnolence and pain.  Furthermore. the presence of any finding in the same nonclinical assessment does not predict the likelihood of whether compounds will produce any of these CNS AE’s during the FIH study. This analysis indicates that the findings from the rodent neurofunctional assessment cannot be used to predict the presence of commonly observed spontaneously reported subjective CNS AE’s in FIH studies.  However. it should be emphasized that these CNS AE’s with the highest prevalence in FIH studies are often not responsible for delaying or stopping further progression of candidate drugs.

45056,School of Life Sciences. University of Warwick. Coventry. West Midlands. UK,2015.0,Tiziana Sgamma and Stephen Jackson,,Applied Plant Genomics and Biotechnology,72,115,Woodhead Publishing,Plants are sessile organisms that have developed the ability to perceive. anticipate and respond to environmental changes to maximize their ability to survive and reproduce. One of the most important aims in the life of any plant is to flower and reproduce. Plants regulate the timing of the onset of flowering to enable seed production and dispersal before environmental conditions become too adverse. For outbreeding species flowering is often synchronized with other individuals. or with insect or bird pollinators. to increase the chance of cross-pollination. Furthermore. if a plant flowers too early it might not be sufficiently well established and lack enough resources to support the production of flowers and seed. Timing is therefore the key to success and plants have developed a very elaborate network of interacting molecular pathways to control when flowering occurs. These pathways are influenced by predictable environmental cues such as diurnal and annual changes in light and temperature. and by unpredictable and internal factors such as nutrient levels. biotic and abiotic stresses. plant age and maturity. Plants modulate their development in response to these factors with short-term (eg diurnal) or long-term (eg seasonal) responses accordingly. The rate of the response is also dependent on the plant species. Generally plants are divided between annual plants that complete their development within 1 year. flowering just once at the end of their life-cycle. and biennials or perennial plants whose life cycles span two or more years. during which they can flower once (monocarpic) or several times (polycarpic).

Here. we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein acetyltransferase KAT5 (Tip60) increases in response to DNA damage in a manner that promotes KAT5 binding to the histone mark H3K9me3. This in turn triggers KAT5-mediated acetylation of the ATM kinase. promoting DNA-damage checkpoint activation and cell survival. We also establish that chromatin alterations per se can enhance KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and ATM-dependent signaling. and identify the proto-oncogene c-Abl as mediating this modification. These findings define KAT5 as a key sensor for genomic and chromatin perturbations. and highlight a prime role for c-Abl in such events.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC,0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3859897/,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3859897/,0,0,0

DNA double strand breaks are repaired by nonhomologous end joining. whereas in S and G2. they are also repaired by homologous recombination. The human CtIP protein controls double strand break (DSB) resection. an event that occurs effectively only in S/G2 and that promotes homologous recombination but not non-homologous end joining. Here. we mutate a highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) target motif in CtIP and reveal that mutating Thr-847 to Ala impairs resection. whereas mutating it to Glu to mimic constitutive phosphorylation does not. Moreover. we show that unlike cells expressing wild-type CtIP. cells expressing the Thr-to-Glu mutant resect DSBs even after CDK inhibition. Finally. we establish that Thr-847 mutations to either Ala or Glu affect DSB repair efficiency. cause hypersensitivity toward DSB-generating agents. and affect the frequency and nature of radiation-induced chromosomal rearrangements. These results suggest that CDKmediated control of resection in human cells operates by mechanisms similar to those recently established in yeast.,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC,0,https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/84480,,,,https://idus.us.es/bitstream/handle/11441/84480/pub9558.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

45066,CDK targets Sae2 to control DNA-end resection and homologous recombination,2008.0,Pablo Huertas Sánchez and Felipe Cortés Ledesma and Alessandro A Sartori and Andrés Aguilera López and Stephen P Jackson,,"Nature, 455 (7213), 689-692.",,,Nature Publishing Group,DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two principal mechanisms: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR)1. HR is the most accurate DSB repair mechanism but is generally restricted to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. when DNA has been replicated and a sister chromatid is available as a repair template2-5. By contrast. NHEJ operates throughout the cell cycle but assumes most importance in G1 (refs 4​. ​6). The choice between repair pathways is governed by cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs)2.3.5.7. with a major site of control being at the level of DSB resection. an event that is necessary for HR but not NHEJ. and which takes place most effectively in S and G2 (refs 2​. ​5). Here we establish that cell-cycle control of DSB resection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results from the phosphorylation by CDK of an evolutionarily conserved motif in the Sae2 protein. We show that mutating Ser 267 of Sae2 to a non-phosphorylatable residue causes phenotypes comparable to those of a sae2Δ null mutant. including hypersensitivity to camptothecin. defective sporulation. reduced hairpin-induced recombination. severely impaired DNA-end processing and faulty assembly and disassembly of HR factors. Furthermore. a Sae2 mutation that mimics constitutive Ser 267 phosphorylation complements these phenotypes and overcomes the necessity of CDK activity for DSB resection. The Sae2 mutations also cause cell-cycle-stage specific hypersensitivity to DNA damage and affect the balance between HR and NHEJ. These findings therefore provide a mechanistic basis for cell-cycle control of DSB …,True,P7WYDHQAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC,0,https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/67617,,,,https://idus.us.es/bitstream/handle/11441/67617/pub13ukmss-2299.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

HRS also manifests as an inverse dose-rate effect when continuous exposures are given below 50 cGy h-1. Uncovering the mechanism for this increased radiosensitivity at lowered dose intensities. may lead to clinically useful applications for this process. The exaggerated HRS responses we have measured in enriched G2 populations imply involvement of processes specific to the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Therefore. ongoing aims of our work are to probe the role of ATM-mediated DNA damage recognition and activation of downstream G2 checkpoints in HRS. Material and methods: First. we have observed that in HRS-positive cell lines. negligible ATM serine1981 activity is present at less than 0.2 Gy. but increased with dose to> 0.5 Gy.

45079,Double-Strand Break Recognition and Its Repair by Nonhomologous End Joining,2003.0,Jane M Bradbury and Stephen P Jackson,,,,219-224,Academic Press,Many different agents can damage DNA. often with disastrous consequences. The most dangerous form of DNA damage is the double-strand break (DSB)—a single unrepaired DSB can induce a cell to undergo apoptosis [1]. DSBs can also directly inactivate key genes. lead to chromosomal translocations. or generate unstable chromosomal abnormalities [2]. which may ultimately lead to cancer development. DSBs are induced by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals but can also be generated during site-specific recombination events (for example. during V (D) J recombination in the immune system and meiotic recombination) and during DNA replication.Because the effects of DNA DSBs are potentially so serious. eukaryotes have elaborate systems to repair the damage rapidly or to stop DNA replication and cell division until the damage has been repaired (Fig. 1;[3]).

For instance. there is homology between archaeal and eucaryotic basal transcription factors. Also. the archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP) resembles eucaryotic nuclear RNAPs in subunit composition and at the amino acid sequence level. Here. we examine the role of transcription factor B. the archaeal homologue of eucaryotic transcription factor IIB. in transcription initiation. We show that the N-terminal region of transcription factor B is required for RNAP recruitment. Furthermore. we reveal that mutation of a conserved residue immediately C-terminal of the N-terminal zinc ribbon motif abrogates transcription on certain promoters.
