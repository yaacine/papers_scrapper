1162083,Small intestinal stem cell markers,2008,Robert K Montgomery and David T Breault,213,,1,52-58,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Stem cells hold great promise for regenerative medicine but remain elusive in many tissues. including the small intestine. where it is well accepted that the epithelium is maintained by intestinal stem cells located in the crypts. The lack of established markers to prospectively identify intestinal stem cells has necessitated the use of indirect analysis. e.g. long‐term label retention. which is based on the hypothesis that intestinal stem cells are slow‐cycling. Several intestinal stem cell markers have been proposed. including Musashi‐1. BMPR1α. phospho‐PTEN. DCAMKL1. Eph receptors and integrins. but their validity. using functional and/or lineage tracing assays. has yet to be confirmed. Recently.

Here. we show that PTEN. a negative regulator of the PI3K→AKT→mTORC1-signaling pathway. is an important regulator of dormant intestinal stem cells (d-ISCs). Acute nutrient deprivation leads to transient PTEN phosphorylation within d-ISCs and a corresponding increase in their number. This release of PTEN inhibition renders d-ISCs functionally poised to contribute to the regenerative response during re-feeding via cell-autonomous activation of the PI3K→AKT→mTORC1 pathway. Consistent with its role in mediating cell survival. PTEN is required for d-ISC maintenance at baseline. and intestines lacking PTEN have diminished regenerative capacity after irradiation.

The extracellular matrix receptor. integrin beta 1. induced focal adhesion formation and supported a force-dependent stiffening response. whereas nonadhesion receptors did not.

Tensegrity models that incorporate mechanically interdependent struts and strings that reorient globally in response to a localized stress mimicked this response.

The purpose of this commentary on tensegrity is to demonstrate how this relatively simple theory can explain much of the complexity of pattern and structure that is observed within the cytoskeleton (CSK) of living cells. A discussion of how tensegrity may be used for information processing. mechanochemical transduction and morphogenetic regulation can be found elsewhere (Ingber and Jamieson. 1985; Ingber and Folkman. 1989a. b; Ryan. 1989; Heidemann and Buxbaum. 1990; Pienta and Coffey. 1991; Hansen and Ingber. 1992; Ingber et al.. 1993).It is now well accepted that the CSK of eukaryotic cells exists as a complex interweaving meshwork of three major classes of filamentous biopolymers: actin-containing microfilaments (MFs). tubulin-containing microtubules (MTs). and intermediate filaments (IFs) containing vimentin. desmin. keratins or neurofilament proteins. Most biologists agree that actomyosin interactions within contractile MFs generate CSK tension and that all three filament systems provide some structural function. However. there is no model of CSK organization that can explain how these filament systems associate and integrate so as to form a continuous “solid” network that can change shape and move.

1162159,Directional freezing for the cryopreservation of adherent mammalian cells on a substrate,2018,Liat Bahari and Amir Bein and Victor Yashunsky and Ido Braslavsky,13,PLoS One,2,e0192265,Public Library of Science,Successfully cryopreserving cells adhered to a substrate would facilitate the growth of a vital confluent cell culture after thawing while dramatically shortening the post-thaw culturing time. Herein we propose a controlled slow cooling method combining initial directional freezing followed by gradual cooling down to -80°C for robust preservation of cell monolayers adherent to a substrate. Using computer controlled cryostages we examined the effect of cooling rates and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) concentration on cell survival and established an optimal cryopreservation protocol. Experimental results show the highest post-thawing viability for directional ice growth at a speed of 30 μm/sec (equivalent to freezing rate of 3.8°C/min). followed by gradual cooling of the sample with decreasing rate of 0.5°C/min. Efficient cryopreservation of three widely used epithelial cell lines: IEC-18. HeLa. and Caco-2. provides proof-of-concept support for this new freezing protocol applied to adherent cells. This method is highly reproducible. significantly increases the post-thaw cell viability and can be readily applied for cryopreservation of cellular cultures in microfluidic devices.,True,SfDKJ5gAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192265,9701990010504279598,/scholar?cites=9701990010504279598,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192265,0,0,0

Although the leukemogenic mechanism of HTLV-1 is not fully understood yet. the viral Tax protein is widely regarded as a key factor in this mechanism. Tax can modulate the synthesis or function of many regulatory factors which control a wide range of normal and oncogenic cellular processes and therefore. it acts as a potent oncoprotein. In the last few years. special attention has been attracted to Tax interference with the transactivation function of p53. a tumor-suppressor protein that is involved in regulation of the cell-cycle and apoptosis and in maintaining the cellular genome integrity. p53 is mutated in $60% of all human tumors.

Using a rat colon carcinogen model. we determined miRNAs-let-7d. miR-15b. miR-107. miR-191 and miR-324-5p were modulated by fish oil + pectin. We also demonstrated that BACE1 and PTEN are targets of miR-107 and miR-21. respectively.  To further elucidate the biological effects of diet and carcinogen on miRNAs. we integrated global miRNAs. total and polysomal gene expression datasets obtained from the above mentioned study and used four computational approaches. We demonstrated that polysomal profiling is tightly related to microRNA changes when compared with total mRNA profiling. In addition. diet and carcinogen exposure modulated a number of microRNAs and complementary gene expression analyses showed that oncogenic PTK2B. PDE4B. and TCF4 were suppressed by the chemoprotective diet at both the mRNA and protein levels.  To determine the function of select diet and colon carcinogen modulated miRNAs and to validate their targets. we carried out a series of loss and gain of function experiments along with luciferase reporter assays. We verified that PDE4B and TCF4 are direct targets of miR-26b and miR-203. respectively. PTK2B was determined to be an indirect target of miR-19b. In addition. microRNA physiological function was assessed by examining effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation.

Here. we show that PTEN. a negative regulator of the PI3K→AKT→mTORC1-signaling pathway. is an important regulator of dormant intestinal stem cells (d-ISCs). Acute nutrient deprivation leads to transient PTEN phosphorylation within d-ISCs and a corresponding increase in their number. This release of PTEN inhibition renders d-ISCs functionally poised to contribute to the regenerative response during re-feeding via cell-autonomous activation of the PI3K→AKT→mTORC1 pathway. Consistent with its role in mediating cell survival. PTEN is required for d-ISC maintenance at baseline. and intestines lacking PTEN have diminished regenerative capacity after irradiation.

Over 75% of solid tumors aberrantly express the transmembrane glycoprotein MUC1. More accurately. these tumors express the cleavage product. MUC1*. which we showed is the growth factor receptor form. The targeting head of our CAR T is a humanized antibody that binds an epitope on MUC1* that is not exposed on fulllength MUC1. Expression of MUC1*. but not full-length MUC1. increases as tumor stage increases and also as cancers acquire drug resistance. All previous therapies that targeted full-length MUC1 have failed. presumably because as cancers progress. cleavage of MUC1 extra cellular domain increases and the targeted portion is shed from the cell surface. More recent CAR T therapeutics. such as those using 5E5. target aberrant O-linked glycans. which only exist on full-length MUC1. This approach would only enrich for the tumorpromoting MUC1* form.We developed an anti-MUC1* CAR T therapeutic that does not affect normal cells expressing full-length MUC1 or stem-like cells that express a cleaved MUC1*-like form.

In recent years several methods have been developed for this purpose. using techniques from a variety of fields. A systematic comparison of the different methods is complicated by their widely varying data requirements. making benchmarking difficult. Also. because of the lack of detailed knowledge about most real networks. it is not easy to use experimental data for this purpose. This paper contains a comparison of four reverse‐engineering methods using data from a simulated network. The network is sufficiently realistic and complex to include many of the challenges that data from real networks pose. Our results indicate that the two methods based on genetic perturbations of the network outperform the other methods. including dynamic Bayesian networks and a partial correlation method. ,True,JjKJpygAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,52,https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1196/annals.1407.006,10873431160302202251,/scholar?cites=10873431160302202251,,,0,0,0

SHP is central to feedback repression of cholesterol 7α hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) expression by bile acids. which is critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Using CYP7A1 as a model system. we studied the molecular mechanisms of SHP repression at the level of native chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that mSin3A and a Swi/Snf complex containing Brm as a central ATPase were recruited to the promoter. This recruitment was associated with chromatin remodeling after bile acid treatment that was blunted by inhibition of the endogenous Swi/Snf function by dominant-negative ATPase mutants. Biochemical studies indicated that SHP was associated with the mSin3A-Swi/Snf complex by direct interaction with Brm and mSin3A through its repression domain.

To further delineate the mechanism of this inhibition. we have examined whether methylation of histones is also involved and whether a functional interplay between chromatin-modifying enzymes occurs. The histone methyltransferase G9a. but not SUV39. was colocalized with SHP in the nucleus and directly interacted with SHP in vitro. G9a. which was coimmunoprecipitated with hepatic SHP. methylated Lys-9 of histone 3 (H3K9) in vitro.

1162300,Initiation of Wnt signaling: control of Wnt coreceptor Lrp6 phosphorylation/activation via frizzled. dishevelled and axin functions,2008,Xin Zeng and He Huang and Keiko Tamai and Xinjun Zhang and Yuko Harada and Chika Yokota and Karla Almeida and Jianbo Wang and Brad Doble and Jim Woodgett and Anthony Wynshaw-Boris and Jen-Chieh Hsieh and Xi He,135,Development,2,367-375,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling has central roles in development and diseases. and is initiated by the action of the frizzled (Fz) receptor. its coreceptor LDL receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6). and the cytoplasmic dishevelled (Dvl) protein. The functional relationships among Fz. Lrp6 and Dvl have long been enigmatic. We demonstrated previously that Wnt-induced Lrp6 phosphorylation via glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3) initiates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Here we show that both Fz and Dvl functions are critical for Wnt-induced Lrp6 phosphorylation through Fz-Lrp6 interaction. We also show that axin. a key scaffolding protein in the Wnt pathway. is required for Lrp6 phosphorylation via its ability to recruit Gsk3. and inhibition of Gsk3 at the plasma membrane blocks Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our results suggest a model that upon Wnt-induced Fz-Lrp6 complex formation. Fz recruitment of Dvl in turn recruits the axin …,True,XYT3KvEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,529,https://dev.biologists.org/content/135/2/367.short,8168959743823563879,/scholar?cites=8168959743823563879,,https://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/135/2/367.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we report the simultaneous introduction and overexpression of genes encoding the rate-limiting upstream enzyme putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) and the downstream enzyme hyoscyamine 6 β-hydroxylase (H6H) of scopolamine biosynthesis in transgenic henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) hairy root cultures. Transgenic hairy root lines expressing both pmt and h6h produced significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of scopolamine compared with the wild-type and transgenic lines harboring a single gene (pmt or h6h). The best line (T3) produced 411 mg/liter scopolamine. which was over nine times more than that in the wild type (43 mg/liter) and more than twice the amount in the highest scopolamine-producing h6h single-gene transgenic line H11 (184 mg/liter). To our knowledge. this is the highest …,True,XYT3KvEAAAAJ:Ui_nyea79ooC,307,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/17/6786/,12669265967039813304,/scholar?cites=12669265967039813304,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/17/6786.full.pdf,0,0,0

The results showed that 35 strains grew well at acid condition (pH 3.0). Eleven strains were further screened out from 35 strains with high tolerance to the simulated gastric juice (pH 2.5. 3 h of incubation). While in simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0). only F6 (isolated from traditional dairy products in Inner Mongolia) could survive to a rate of 53.7%. Moreover. among 11 Lactobacillus strains. L. fermentum F6 showed good tolerance to bile salt. while L. fermentum IMAU60151. IMAU60083. IMAU20080 and IMAU60120 were poorly presented.
