1326756,A study on removal of rare earth elements from US coal byproducts by ion exchange,2016,Peter L Rozelle and Aditi B Khadilkar and Nuerxida Pulati and Nari Soundarrajan and Mark S Klima and Morgan M Mosser and Charles E Miller and Sarma V Pisupati,3,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions E,1,6-17,Springer US,Rare earth elements are known to occur in low concentrations in U.S. coals and coal byproducts. These low concentrations may make rare earth element recovery from these materials unattractive. using only physical separation techniques. However. given the significant production of rare earths through ion exchange extraction in China. two U.S. coal byproducts were examined for ion extraction. using ammonium sulfate. an ionic liquid. and a deep eutectic solvent as lixiviants. Extraction of rare earth elements in each case produced high recoveries of rare earth elements to the solution. This suggests that in at least the cases of the materials examined. U.S. coal byproducts may be technically suitable as REE ores.

Understanding. predicting and controlling this phenomenon are important to avoid operational problems. reduced efficiencies. reactor down-time and thereby monetary losses. Operating conditions. material properties and particle hydrodynamics can simultaneously affect the extent of agglomeration. This makes accurate prediction with mere experimentation difficult.Theoretical models to predict agglomeration based on particle collision dynamics have been evolving. They will enable easier predictions with quick estimates for any changes in parameters. In general. the models use certain criteria to determine the outcome of two-particle collisions. and a technique to estimate the kinetics of agglomerate growth.

1326761,Effect of heterogeneity in coal ash chemical composition on the onset of conditions favorable for agglomeration in fluid beds,2015,Aditi B Khadilkar and Peter L Rozelle and Sarma V Pisupati,8,Energies,11,12530-12545,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Ash agglomeration issues that arise due to the sticking of slag-wetted. colliding particles have been creating operational difficulties and monetary losses for the fluidized bed combustion (FBC) industry. Difficulties have been experienced in the detection of slag-liquid at the low operating temperatures in fluidized bed combustors (FBCs) and predicting the agglomeration behavior of fuel. This study aims to study the effect of heterogeneity in ash composition on the detection of slag-liquid in FBCs. It quantifies the slag-liquid amounts at the particle-level. under oxidizing environments. by dividing the bulk fuel into density classes. FactSage™ thermodynamic simulations of each of the particle classes. along with experimental validation of the trends with thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) and high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) were performed. The results obtained can be used to estimate the stickiness of particles in the development of ash agglomeration models based on particle collisions. The study of these particle classes shows that particle classes with specific minerals can form low temperature eutectics and lead to onset of slag-liquid formation at temperatures below those predicted by bulk analysis alone. Comparison of the differences in slag-liquid formation tendencies under reducing and oxidizing environments is also presented.

To support the use of diverse fuels including low rank coals and biomass. interactions of chemical components that lead to operational issues such as agglomeration need to be studied. Low rank coals and biomass are generally rich in alkali and alkaline earth metals and their role in the initiation of agglomeration is investigated in this work. A novel modeling methodology to quantify the contribution of these components to the initiation of agglomeration via the condensation of gaseous species was developed. This condensation modeling methodology complements thermodynamic simulations such as those using FactSage and agglomeration models used for high rank coals.

1326763,Development of a Fluidized-Bed Agglomeration Modeling Methodology to Include Particle-level Heterogeneities in Ash Chemistry and Granular Physics,2016,Aditi Bhushan Khadilkar,,,,,,The utility of fluidized bed reactors for combustion and gasification can be enhanced if operational issues such as agglomeration are mitigated. The monetary and efficiency losses could be avoided through a mechanistic understanding of the agglomeration process and prediction of operational conditions that promote agglomeration. Pilot-scale experimentation prior to operation for each specific condition can be cumbersome and expensive. So the development of a mathematical model would aid predictions. The heterogeneity in ash chemical composition. gaseous atmosphere and distributive granular physics properties affect agglomeration. As the particle size distribution changes with agglomeration. the hydrodynamics such as particle collision frequencies also change continuously. This progression makes it challenging to predict the particle growth kinetics. since the chemistry-and physics-based parameters are interdependent. Existing models consider only one of these two aspects. The present work aimed to account for the heterogeneous conditions and develop a modeling methodology that integrates ash chemistry and granular physics. With this motivation. the study comprised of the following model development stages-1) development of an agglomeration modeling methodology based on binary particle collisions. 2) study of heterogeneities in ash chemical composition and gaseous atmosphere. 3) computation of a distribution of particle collision frequencies based on granular physics for a poly-disperse particle size distribution. 4) combining the ash chemistry and granular physics inputs to obtain agglomerate growth probabilities and …,True,21XIYJwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/hq37vn56b,1225353807204934333,/scholar?cites=1225353807204934333,,,https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/12382,0,0,0

Pisupati,,,,5,Proceedings of the International Conference on Coal Science and Technology. Paper # 3136414,Penn State has developed a mathematical model to predict ash agglomeration in fluidized beds based on two-particle collisions. It uses the Stokes’ criterion to test every collision for sticking. It integrates effects of ash chemistry and particle physics in making predictions of particle growth rate. Non-uniform conditions in the reactor such as the poly-disperse nature of ash particles. heterogeneity in ash chemical composition and particle temperatures have been incorporated.Simulations were performed to study the agglomeration of Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and anthracite in reducing environments. Further. the heterogeneity in ash chemical composition of these coals was investigated using gravity separated fuel fractions. FactSage TM thermodynamic simulations and also computational fluid dynamics were used to study ash agglomeration in these systems while HT-XRD. TGA. TMA and SEM-EDX helped to validate the trends obtained. The results indicated initiation of agglomeration around particles rich in iron and calcium phases. even under the relatively lower fluidized bed operating temperatures. Once particle-level agglomeration is initiated in the bed. major operational problems may occur. These are difficult to predict using bulk analysis alone with granulation models that are restricted to homogeneous systems.

1326765,Incorporation of hydrodynamics and ash chemistry into a unified model for prediction of agglomeration in fluidized beds,2015,Aditi B Khadilkar and Peter L Rozelle and Sarma V Pisupati,,,,625-633,AIChE,Study of particle growth or agglomeration involves a detailed understanding of both the thermodynamics of phases that lead to the liquid binder formation or the binder-liquid chemistry. and also the fluid dynamics of particles in the system. As particle growth progresses and the particle size distribution changes. the bed hydrodynamics such as particle collision frequencies also change continuously. This progression makes it challenging to predict the kinetics of particle growth. since the chemistry and physics-based parameters are interlinked. Models that can incorporate interdependencies and variations in both bed hydrodynamics and binder chemistry are required for more accurate predictions. Penn State has developed a unique two-particle collision based model that combines the two effects mentioned above. The model is being applied to polydispersed fluidized bed combustion and gasification systems. In the Penn State model. thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are used to estimate the amounts of slag-liquid in the system. while the evolution of particle collision frequencies is accounted for by tracking the number density of differently sized particles. while using the kinetic theory of granular flow. Computational fluid dynamics modeling is used in conjunction to obtain initial inputs to the model. The model helped to gain an understanding of low-temperature ash agglomeration in these systems and understand parameters that may promote the initiation of agglomerate growth at the particle-level.

1326766,Critical Factors in Understanding the Mechanism of Ash Agglomeration in Fluidized Bed Systems,2014,Aditi. B. Khadilkar and Peter. L. Rozelle and Sarma. V. Pisupati,,,,,,A simple mathematical model was developed to study ash agglomerate growth in fluidized bed systems. The model can trace the temporal evolution of ash particle size distribution in the system. It evaluates every possible two-particle collision for sticking based on the Stokes’ criterion. Agglomeration occurs when there is viscous dissipation of the particle kinetic energy by the slag-liquid formed on ash particles. Several chemical and physical parameters such as fuel chemistry. ash surface properties. slag rheology and particle hydrodynamics affect agglomeration. An integrated model capable of making predictions based on both the fuel composition (chemistry) as well as the reactor configuration (physics). under a given set of operating conditions has been developed as a useful tool for the industry. It would help to predict and prevent agglomeration during combustion and gasification in fluidized beds. including advanced combustion technologies such as chemical looping combustion. The slag-liquid formation tendencies were studied through the use of FactSageTM thermodynamic equilibrium simulation software. Using this technique. the slag-liquid formation tendencies for Pittsburgh seam coal were predicted under both combustion and gasification gaseous atmospheres and experimentally validated using TGA/DTA. XRD and Thermo mechanical analysis (TMA). The hydrodynamics were studied through the use of MFIX-Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges. a computational fluid dynamics software.

Our objective was to design a space to evaluate the performance of Swiss-developed low exergy building systems in the tropical climate of Singapore using an integrated design approach. The method we employed for evaluation in the tropics was to design and build a test bed out of the shipping containers that transported the prototype low exergy systems from Switzerland to Singapore. This approach resulted in a novel laboratory environment containing radiant cooling panels and decentralized air supply. along with a self-shading. inflated “bubble” skin. experimental low emissivity (LowE) glazing.

This study examines the concept of sustainable construction before the South African background and compares it to the European understanding. The theoretical analysis is completed by the practical implementation of sustainable construction. in the actual construction of load-bearing Straw Bale houses in South Africa by the author as the construction manager. The building sector has a major influence on resource use and energy consumption; so has transport and mobility. but in what mutual relation? A Life Cycle Assessment is carried out for the mentioned building project. examining the environmental performance of said Straw Bale construction in terms of embodied energy. using Inventory Tables mostly from Switzerland. corrected with the energy intensity of the national economies. All life cycles from material extraction to building demolition are considered. with a detailing on the construction process and the utilisation stage. The Straw Bale construction is compared to a conventional brick design to assess the influence of this natural building technique. The impact of the building is then compared to the different transport processes to find an order of magnitude for that relation.,True,glbrdl8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,4,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/160907,5886703303297485739,/scholar?cites=5886703303297485739,,,,0,0,0
1326801,Heat bus for the tropics–exergy analysis of coupling decentralised chillers with central cooling towers,2013,Marcel Bruelisauer and Forrest Meggers and Raphael Engler and Hansjürg Leibundgut,,Proc. Clima,,,,High humidity and temperature in the tropics are above accepted indoor climate conditions. necessitating the removal of heat against the natural potential difference. Under the Low Exergy paradigm. the objective is to minimise not only this heat flow but also to decrease the heat rejection temperature for the airconditioning system thereby increasing its efficiency. Air-cooled split-type condensers are most commonly used but inherently inefficient due to the high condenser temperature. We propose a system where decentralised water-cooled condensers are connected to an evaporative cooling tower by a hydraulic heat bus system. This paper investigates the critical parameters for the overall performance of this novel system by evaluating different design scenarios for a case study in Singapore and assesses the system in relation to air-cooled condensers. We found that the pumping exergy for the heat bus represents only a very small part of the total exergy demand as long as the hydraulic network is judiciously designed. Choosing a larger box size for the cooling tower than strictly necessary results in lower fan power and lower condenser temperature. Compared to air-cooled systems. the heat bus system reduces total exergy demand by 39%. If sensible and latent loads are split and sensible loads are met by high-temperature cooling systems. the system COP increases to 7.9. resulting in 68% exergy demand reduction. This study shows how a simple network can unlock large saving potential for air-conditioning systems while flexibly catering to individual needs.,True,glbrdl8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcel_Bruelisauer/publication/259220740_Heat_Bus_for_the_Tropics_-_Exergy_Analysis_of_Coupling_Decentralised_Chillers_with_Central_Cooling_Towers/links/02e7e53ac33df73451000000/Heat-Bus-for-the-Tropics-Exergy-Analysis-of-Coupling-Decentralised-Chillers-with-Central-Cooling-Towers.pdf,17166599735747514922,/scholar?cites=17166599735747514922,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcel_Bruelisauer/publication/259220740_Heat_Bus_for_the_Tropics_-_Exergy_Analysis_of_Coupling_Decentralised_Chillers_with_Central_Cooling_Towers/links/02e7e53ac33df73451000000/Heat-Bus-for-the-Tropics-Exergy-Analysis-of-Coupling-Decentralised-Chillers-with-Central-Cooling-Towers.pdf,0,0,0

SB13 Singap., Research Publishing, Singapore",,,,The façades of the shop houses in Rochor and Chinatown shine brightly and in full colour. but as soon as we step behind. into the backlanes. we are met by heat and noise from hundreds of split type airY conditioners. Backlanes in lowYrise shop house typologies are generally utilised for support activities of the major economic activities on the main streets such as waste disposal and delivery. This is also where we find today batteries of airYcooled split type condensers that are inherently energy inefficient. We suggest a novel technical solution. the heat bus system. that not only reduces energy use by 50% but also ameliorates the thermal microclimate by introducing waterYcooled condenser connected to a central cooling tower. increasing the thermal comfort for pedestrians. It can also used as a trigger for architectural and urban design interventions that upgrade the backlane qualitatively and transform the backlane into a space that fosters social encounters and new economic activities. The nature of the shared infrastructure can be utilised to reYevaluate the neighbourhood. how to increase its value for occupants and owners. The suggested design variation is a prototypical example of applying the heat bus system to a horizontal setting of a backlane.

1326806,LowEx heat rejection systems in the tropics: Beyond energy efficiency. towards integrated multi-scale cooling systems,2014,Marcel Mjongchel Brülisauer,,,,,,Cooling systems in the tropics are currently extremely inefficient. Their energy performance and the integration of the technical systems into the building can be improved by re-examining the role of heat rejection using the LowEx concept. The more usual and highly specialised approaches from building systems engineering can become rigidly precise. limiting their ability to make necessary paradigm changes. The LowEx concept is a systems approach. which is used in this thesis to challenge how different components of a cooling system in the tropics relate to each other and how the overall system is embedded in the thermal context of the tropics. Based on the principles of 2nd law thermodynamics. exergy accounts not only for the amount but also the quality of energy. which is especially relevant for heat flows. One of the main research objectives of this thesis is to build upon the experience in the moderate climate and expand the LowEx concept for building systems to the hot-humid tropical climate.This thesis is structured as a paper-dissertation. exploring three main strategies to improve the energy performance of cooling systems. The first strategy is a systems approach to reduce the temperature lift of the chiller by improving heat rejection systems and the associated heat transfers to reduce the condensation temperature. The second strategy is to generally increase the internal exergetic efficiency of the cooling equipment itself. The third strategy is to sustain a high exergetic efficiency for low temperature lifts. to uphold the improvements of smaller temperature lifts.

Future Cities Laboratory (FCL),Kampong Glam. Alongside the original residents who moved into the neighbourhood since its inception more than 30 years ago. a handful of younger creative entrepreneurs. from architects to graphic designers. has recently found their atelier spaces and homes in Lavender. International studies have shown that young creatives need to be located in well-connected central areas but they also need spaces with low rent. These central locations with affordable rent are often ‘hidden gems’ that can harbour creative entrepreneurs. at least for the time being. in increasingly expensive cities where such locations are threatened precisely by the anomaly of their assets. The dilemma for global creative cities is how to keep these rents low. as demand and prices both increase in such centrally-located spaces. Since the publication of the book. The rise of the creative class. by American economist Richard Florida in 2002. the word “creative” has come to be the indicator for globalised. post-industrial. knowledge-based and service-dominated advanced economies. In fact. as Singapore moves into its 50th year of independence next year. it seems ‘knowledge-based economy’and ‘creative economy’are oft-heard buzzwords describing the city-state’s aspirations for the next lap. To foster Singapore’s emerging creative sector. often made up of young. cosmopolitan and small entrepreneurs who are starting out. ageing spaces that are in centrally-located areas like Lavender should not only be encouraged to stay. but also nurtured.

The combustion of CO shows a distinct induction period over most catalysts while the reaction of HCHO proceeds steadily over every catalyst. Catalysts with varied calcination temperatures exhibit the same activity order in both reactions. The catalyst calcined at 200 °C appears to show the highest activity for either of the two reactions. suggesting that the amount of metallic Au and size of Au particles are crucial for both reactions. The mass specific activity (MSA) of Au in those catalysts calcined at 200 °C decreases with increasing Au loading for CO combustion but is almost independent of the Au loadings for HCHO combustion.

The saddle point on the free energy surface of the reaction system was represented by catalytic geometrical constraints. and the binding energy between the active site and transition state was minimized to reduce the activation energy barrier. The resulting hyperscale combinatorial optimization problem was tackled using a novel heuristic global optimization algorithm. which was inspired and tested by the protein core sequence selection problem.

The encapsulation of a positively charged protein. represented by hen-egg white lysozyme. by mPEG-b-PMAA micelles was achieved using a pH or salt-concentration swing. as shown by both structural characterization using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy and an activity assay. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that using an acidic pH gave a more compact polymer–micelle assembly than did using a basic pH. As a result. this compact structure had less solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). indicating that lysozyme was encapsulated by mPEG-b-PMAA and that the active site was shielded by the polymer.

A predictive kinetic model maintains high fidelity to the true chemistry usually via a full-detail molecule representation which distinguishes all the molecules and isomers. Unfortunately such full-detail representation quickly becomes intractable for large molecules because the number of isomers grows very rapidly with size. Several less detailed representations have been developed. including the popular Structure-Oriented Lumping (SOL) method. which allow one to model larger molecules. In this paper we first examine scalability for two existing representations (full-detail and SOL) and propose a new modeling methodology tailored for heavy systems: fragment-based modeling. which promises the best scalability.

1326915,A Review on the Influence of CO2/Shale Interaction on Shale Properties: Implications of CCS in Shales,2020,Ahmed Fatah and Ziad Bennour and Hisham Ben Mahmud and Raoof Gholami and Md Hossain,13,,12,3200,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a developed technology to minimize CO 2 emissions and reduce global climate change. Currently. shale gas formations are considered as a suitable target for CO 2 sequestration projects predominantly due to their wide availability. Compared to conventional geological formations including saline aquifers and coal seams. depleted shale formations provide larger storage potential due to the high adsorption capacity of CO 2 compared to methane in the shale formation. However. the injected CO 2 causes possible geochemical interactions with the shale formation during storage applications and CO 2 enhanced shale gas recovery (ESGR) processes. The CO 2/shale interaction is a key factor for the efficiency of CO 2 storage in shale formations. as it can significantly alter the shale properties. The formation of carbonic acid from CO 2 dissolution is the main cause for the alterations in the physical. chemical and mechanical properties of the shale. which in return affects the storage capacity. pore properties. and fluid transport. Therefore. in this paper. the effect of CO 2 exposure on shale properties is comprehensively reviewed. to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of CO 2/shale interaction on shale properties. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the CO 2/shale interactions and describes the results achieved to date. The pore structure is one of the most affected properties by CO 2/shale interactions; several scholars indicated that the differences in mineral composition for shales would result in wide variations in pore structure system.

The induced fracture increases the permeability of the formation by providing conductive channels to the formation which results in improved fluids productivity.Hydraulic fracturing is a common practice in oil and gas. particularly in the development of unconventional low porosity and low permeability reservoirs. However. as the hydraulic fracturing technique is costly. considerable preparations efforts must be made before executing the fracturing operation including simulating the intended fracture model.A simulation model of a hydraulic fracturing assists in forecasting and controlling the intended fractures that are to be induced. Although the simulation model can be helpful. it may not exactly mimic or predict the actual initiated fractures due to the complex nature of the actual …,True,dUfWJ98AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-abstract/OMAE2020/84430/V011T11A014/1093151,,,,,,0,0,0
1326918,A Review of Fracturing Technologies Utilized in Shale Gas Resources,2020,Hisham Ben Mahmud and Mansur Ermila and Ziad Bennour and Walid Mohamed Mahmud,,,,,IntechOpen,The modern hydraulic fracturing technique was implemented in the oil and gas industry in the 1940s. Since then. it has been used extensively as a method of stimulation in unconventional reservoirs in order to enhance hydrocarbon recovery. Advances in directional drilling technology in shale reservoirs allowed hydraulic fracturing to become an extensively common practice worldwide. Fracturing technology can be classified according to the type of the fracturing fluid with respect to the well orientation into vertical. inclined. or horizontal well fracturing. Depth. natural fractures. well completion technology. capacity. and formation sensitivity of a shale reservoir all play a role in the selection of fracturing fluid and fracturing orientation. At present. the most commonly used technologies are multi-section fracturing. hydra-jet fracturing. fracture network fracturing. re-fracturing. simultaneous fracturing. and CO2 and N2 fracturing.

1326919,Effect of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid Viscosity on Stimulated Reservoir Volume for Shale Gas Recovery,2017,Ziad Bennour,,,,,京都大学 (Kyoto University),1.1 BackgroundEnergy shortage is one of the world’s concerns because of the high demand to use resources for power purposes by the industrial societies. As the demand rises. these natural resources are diminishing. because simply they are in limited supply. Many global initiatives try to resolve the energy shortage and also increase the regulations and restriction on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Combined strategies are set to solve the energy problem by maximizing energy efficiency. optimizing energy use and developing new sources of clean energy such as shale gas.Shale gas refers to the natural gas trapped within formations of shale. a finegrained sedimentary rock that can be a rich source of petroleum and natural gas. However. the low permeability of shale greatly inhibits the flow of gas from reservoir rocks to production wells. The economic viability of producing natural gas from shale formations depends highly on the effective stimulation of reservoirs. which is mainly achieved by combining the horizontal or directional drilling with planned multistage hydraulic fracturing (HF). Multistage HF stimulation on wells is a constant routine for the recovery of oil and gas from low permeability sedimentary reservoirs in shale gas provinces in the North America (eg King. 2010). This practice has been in use for long time and proved successful especially in shale gas reservoirs (Arthur et al.. 2008).,True,dUfWJ98AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/225563/1/ykogk04275.pdf,,,,,https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/225563/1/ykogk04275.pdf,0,0,0

This method will become much more feasible by compensating for its cost. if it can be combined with economically viable processes such as shale gas recovery and geothermal energy extraction from hot dry rock. When CO 2 is injected deeper than 1000 m. the temperature and pressure usually satisfy the condition to make CO 2 to be supercritical state. which has much lower viscosity than that of water. To examine behavior of the supercritical state CO 2 (SC-CO 2) in rock. we conducted hydraulic fracturing experiments using SC-CO 2. water. and viscous oil in granite specimens under a tri-axial deviatoric stress condition. Source distributions of acoustic emission events showed that hydraulic fracturing with SC-CO 2 can induce more intense cracks branching and spreading wider than those with water. The result suggests that SC-CO 2 fracturing forms more effective pathways for shale gas recovery and hot dry rock geothermal extraction while enabling economically feasible underground sequestration of CO 2.,True,dUfWJ98AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/journalofmmij/131/4/131_115/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/journalofmmij/131/4/131_115/_pdf,0,0,0

In comparison. the relatively underexplored Continuous Hydrothermal Flow Synthesis (CHFS) method was used to make highly defective sub-5 nm MgCr2O4 crystals. When these materials were made into electrodes. they were shown to possess markedly different electrochemical behavior in a Mg2+ ionic liquid electrolyte. at moderate temperature (110 °C).

1326936,Microwave-assisted synthesis and local analyses of positive insertion electrodes for Li-ion batteries,2016,Thomas E Ashton,,,,,,Efficient energy storage holds the key to reducing waste energy and enabling the use of advanced handheld electronic devices. hydrid electric vehicles and residential energy storage. Recently. Li-ion batteries have been identified and employed as energy storage devices due to their high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. in comparison to previous technologies. However. more research is required to enhance the efficiency of Li-ion batteries by discovering electrodes with larger electrochemical discharge capacities. while maintaining electrochemical stability. The aims of this study are to develop new microwave-assisted synthesis routes to nanostructured insertion cathodes. which harbor a greater affinity for lithium extraction and insertion than bulk materials. Subsequent to this. state-of-the-art synchrotron based techniques have been employed to understand structural and dynamic behaviour of nanostructured cathode materials during battery cell operation. In this study. microwave-assisted routes to a-LiFePO4. VO2(B). V3O7. H2V3O8 and V4O6(OH)4 have all been developed. Muon spin relaxation has shown that the presence of b-LiFePO4 has a detrimental effect on the lithium diffusion properties of a-LiFePO4. in agreement with first principles calculations. For the first time. a-LiFePO4 nanostructures have been obtained by employing a deep eutectic solvent reaction media showing near theoretical capacity (162 mAh g–1). Studies on VO2(B) have shown that the discharge capacity obtained is linked to the synthesis method. Electrochemical studies of H2V3O8 nanowires have shown outstanding discharge capacities (323 mAh g–1 …,True,Oq688KUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7856/,,,,,,0,0,0

1326972,Bio-based Products from Biomass,2011,Zhaohui Tong and Letian Wang and Clay B Olson,2011,EDIS,7,,,We may not realize it. but nearly all of us rely heavily on products derived from energy resources. Examples of such products include fossil fuel-based chemicals like plastics that are used almost everywhere in our daily lives. At present. most of our energy and petroleum-derived materials are made from nonrenewable resources. such as coal. petroleum. oil. and natural gas (fossil fuels). because they have been historically available as primary products from long-established industries. However. for several reasons. there is a growing urgency to produce energy and related bio-based products from renewable resources. Firstly. fossil fuels will be depleted very quickly because they cannot be replaced or produced as fast as they are being consumed. According to research done by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. petroleum resources will last only another 70 years (Aguilera 2008). Eventually. when it becomes too costly to continue producing fossil fuels or when they become depleted completely. it will become necessary to use renewable resources as alternatives to fossil fuels. Secondly. deriving energy from fossil fuels has long-term negative impacts on the environment. such as greenhouse gas emissions. air pollution. and the associated effects of climate change (acid precipitation. ozone depletion. forest destruction. and the emission of radioactive substances)(Dincer 2000). Thirdly. the large amount of petroleum-derived materials (chemicals. plastics) that are made from fossil fuels further aggravates the depletion of nonrenewable energy resources.

Nissan Leaf electric vehicle (EV) uses skewed-rotor IPMSM as a traction motor. This motor is considered as a benchmark in this work. Although. skewing improves the torque quality of the motor by reducing the torque ripple. it reduces the average torque and increases the motor manufacturing complexity and cost. This article proposes improvements to the benchmark motor torque quality without skewing. The proposed motor uses the same stator winding and rotor magnet topologies of the benchmark motor with the same geometric constraints and magnet volume. Modifications are applied to the placement of the magnets in the rotor and the shape of the flux barriers to achieve the performance requirements. The design procedure of the proposed unskewed design is illustrated.

In this research. a topological plot is first defined to represent the load bearing topology of the cylinder head. A simplified model enabling a designer to clearly understand the global matching relationship between the key components of a cylinder head is then identified from the topological plot. After characterizing the stress/strain behavior through parametric analysis. an interesting phenomenon associated with stress convergence in the cylinder head is observed. A concise mathematical explanation for this phenomenon is then derived from the well-known Kuhn–Tucker conditions. leading to a novel optimization criterion for cylinder head design. In this criterion. the optimal solution is described as an ideal “balanced point” among the main design parameters in terms of weight distribution of …,True,KKH6yPYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0954407012459322,3727350629287318149,/scholar?cites=3727350629287318149,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.4009&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this method. two methods are mainly employed to construct weight model: (1) Neural Network is used to establish the spatial weight model. which makes good use of the pixels in support window; (2) An edge hold off Mean-Shift method is proposed to distribute the intensity weight accurately. For decreasing the matching cost error. the census transform is introduced to calculate the matching cost. The influence of the parameters on the performance of our method is also discussed at last.

Abdullahi and I. and Ismail and A. and Musa,57,European Journal of Scientific Research,4,626-634,,While the various international energy agencies vehemently warned on the increasing energy demand. the global proven fossil fuels’ reserves were projected to last only for the next few decades. Therefore. the search for alternative energy sources is unavoidable. Biofuel. particularly biogas. is renewable alternative with strong potentials for future energy security and environmental sustainability. Thus. multi-dimensional studies on all aspect of its production are necessary. In the current research. a “batch feeding digester” was developed to evaluate the effect of temperature and seeding parameters on the biogas yield and rate of digestion. Biogas production was monitored using 1.8 Kg of cow dung substrate in the digester. capable of producing 20 Liters of net reaction gases. Kinetic modeling revealed the reaction to generally proceeds by first order kinetics with respect to the substrate concentration ([S]). Similarly. rise in both temperature and seeding parameters enhanced biogas production. with temperature effect outweighing by at least 25%.

The International Atomic Energy (IAEA) requires the operator of each licensed nuclear power plant to demonstrate that the site is acceptably safe from the perspective of the internal and external risk of exposure to workers. visitors and third parties who are working within the site vicinity. One of the potential external hazards is the unintentional aircraft accident with the potential on consequential damage to the site through impact. fuel fire and other effects. The fire and explosion overpressure resulting from the accident have the potential to damage the nuclear structural components and gave a challenge to a safe reactor shut down. The equivalent TNT. TNO multi energy and Baker-Strehlow models were used to estimate the overpressure from the explosion within the distances of 50-410 m from the first impact location of nuclear reactor. The structural damage at varying distances from the fire and explosion hazards was estimated using Probit equation. Analysis of the results shows that the control room at a distance of 210 m would be highly damage with a probability of 99%. The probability for major structural damage at a radial distance of 410 m is 93%. The findings of this analysis may be used to evaluate the safety improvements required on the nuclear power plant on the risk associated with aviation-related hazards and provide an insight on the safe design and the sitting of the existing facilities and/or new nuclear installations.,True,Cxl9VZoAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aminu_Ismaila/publication/316668201_Consequence_Assessment_of_Vapour_Cloud_Explosion_Involving_Large_Commercial_Airliner_Crash_upon_Nuclear_Reactor_Containment/links/590b201fa6fdcc49617a7bd3/Consequence-Assessment-of-Vapour-Cloud-Explosion-Involving-Large-Commercial-Airliner-Crash-upon-Nuclear-Reactor-Containment.pdf,13589607526193392471,/scholar?cites=13589607526193392471,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aminu_Ismaila/publication/316668201_Consequence_Assessment_of_Vapour_Cloud_Explosion_Involving_Large_Commercial_Airliner_Crash_upon_Nuclear_Reactor_Containment/links/590b201fa6fdcc49617a7bd3/Consequence-Assessment-of-Vapour-Cloud-Explosion-Involving-Large-Commercial-Airliner-Crash-upon-Nuclear-Reactor-Containment.pdf,0,0,0

1327000,Effect of Local Processing Techniques on the Nutrients and Anti-Nutrients Content of Bitter Cassava (Manihot Esculenta Crantz),2018,AR Ismaila and JS Alakali and TG Atume,6,American Journal of Food Science and Technology,3,92-97,,The effects of local processing techniques on the nutrients and anti-nutrients content of bitter cassava were investigated. Raw bitter cassava tubers were boiled to produce (Rogo). sundried to produce (chips). roasted to produce (roasted chips). fried to produce (Kuese). partially fermented and sun dried to produce (Elubo). fermented by submersion to produce (Akpu) and finally. fermented by solid state to produce (yellow and white Gari). All these locally processed cassava products were subjected to proximate. mineral and anti-nutrient analysis using standard methods. The result of the proximate showed that. raw bitter cassava is composed of 1.85% ash. 64.38% moisture. 4.11% crude fibre. 1.03% crude protein. 0.66% lipids and 30.88% total carbohydrate. Mineral analysis of the raw bitter cassava tuber contained 32.00 mg/100g Calcium. 12.55 mg/100g Magnesium. 1.38 mg/100g Iron and 80.17 mg/100g Phosphorous. Even though all processing techniques significantly expose more of the the mineral content. fermentation had highest effect. The anti-nutrients analysis showed that the raw peeled tuber contained 98.16 mg/100g cyanide. 44.00 mg/100g oxalate 304.20 mg/100g phytate and 73.00 mg/100g saponin. In general all the processing techniques showed a significant reduction of the phytate. oxalate and saponin content of the cassava. However. only fermentation. sun drying and garification were able to reduce the cyanide content of bitter cassava below the safe level (10mg/100g) recommended by Standard Organization of Nigeria.

Accurate simulation of the atmospheric dispersion of radioactive materials is important for assessing the ecological risks of a new Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) project. The Hybrid Single-Particle Langrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYsplit) model developed by the United States Air Resource Laboratory is a state-of-the-art model for computing complex air dispersion scenarios. In this study. the HYsplit model was used to generate the representative of the scaling factors of air concentrations (in Bq m–3) and surface depositions (in Bq m–2) of radionuclides released from the stack of hypothetical (NPP) in Nigeria. The computed radionuclides’ air concentration and surface deposition data were used to assess the environmental and human health impacts of the Nigeria’s pioneer NPP. No statistically significant environmental and health impacts were predicted under normal operation conditions of the NPP. The impacts of various accident scenarios under different meteorological and release conditions were investigated.

Epiphytic terrestrial algae were known to have a tendency towards atmospheric gases due to its high sorption capability. Besides the pollutant. the different texture of the bark of the trees also plays an important role for the colonization of the algae. This present work studies on two parameters that canaffect the number of algal cells per unit area (density); the increased pollutants and tree bark texture. Sampling stations which represent the polluted and relatively unpolluted environment hasbeen chosen. Quadrat sampling method was used to estimate the density of algae on 30 random trees inhabiting 15 x 15 cm quadrat. Results showed that both polluted and unpolluted sites were dominated by the same algal species. the Coccomyxa confluens (Kützing) Fott. The polluted environment significantly support higher number ofepiphyticalgaeat 202±37 x 104 cells/cm2compared to the unpolluted area at 63±12 x 104cells/m2.

The ignition of the cotton was investigated at 25KW/m 2. A Temet FTIR was used for the toxic gas measurement for raw and diluted tests. Comparison of the two set of data have shown that cone calorimeter with simulated enclosure is a good method for the evaluation of toxicity from materials under air starved fires. but is unrepresentative of CO yields at very low ventialtion rate (5ACH) due to the non repeatabilty of the measured HRR beteween raw and diluted test but repeatable at 10ACH The cotton fires was also observed to exhibited both flaming and slow smouldering combustion with the low yield of acrolein and formaldehyde in the peak heat release rate region. but very high in the smouldering combustion phase.

1327040,Bayesian Statistical Framework for Deconvolving the Distribution of Relaxation Times from Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Data,2018,Mohammed B Effat and Francesco Ciucci,,ECS Meeting Abstracts,44,2554,IOP Publishing,   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful electrochemical characterization technique used in scientific research and industry. Interpreting the EIS data correctly is the essential step to unravel the nature of the underlying physical processes happening inside the electrochemical system (e.g. Li-ion battery) and to obtain the quantitative values of the corresponding parameters (i.e. diffusion coefficients. reaction rate constants. etc.). The most common approach to interpret impedance data is by fitting to an equivalent circuit model (ECM). The problem of this approach is that many (ECMs) can fit the data well. In the past decade. the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) has appeared as a complementary methodology that enables better interpretation to the impedance data. In this method. the time scales of the underlying processes can be directly accessed. enabling the construction of the most …,True,3IpDLfwAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2018-01/44/2554/meta,,,,,,0,0,0

The use of this model. unlike many of other models in the literature. allows accurate modeling of stomatal conductance for many plant types and under several environmental conditions. It also guarantees the modeling of the photosynthesis process. which is important for microclimate and CO2 enrichment purposes. due to the direct coupling between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in this model. Although the many advantages of this model. the many details associated with it may be the reason behind not being used in greenhouse microclimate modeling studies. Thus. this paper comes with an aim of facilitating the use of this model and encouraging modelers of greenhouses’ microclimate to use this powerful model by providing them the necessary background for the treatment of the model in a well organized form that contains all the necessary and required information they may need in their use of the model. In this paper. the photosynthesis-stomatal conductance coupled model is introduced by first illustrating briefly the biochemical background of the photosynthesis process and then introducing the accurate biochemical model that represents it.

Retrofitting existing homes may have substantial carbon-mitigation and cost-saving potential. Retrofit subsidies may increase energy improvement activities. raise awareness and lever market offers.

According to recent systematic reviews residential energy efficiency interventions may benefit health. It is argued that home energy improvement are complex interventions and that a better understanding of the latent mechanisms and contextual issues that may shape the outcome of interventions is needed for effective intervention design. This realist review synthesises the results of 28 energy efficiency improvement programs. This first part provides a review of the explanatory factors of the three key pathways. namely warmth in the home. affordability of fuel and psycho‐social factors. and the pitfall of inadequate indoor air quality. The review revealed that REEIs improved winter warmth and lowered relative humidity with benefits for cardiovascular and respiratory health. In addition. residential energy efficiency improvements consolidated the meaning of the home as a safe haven. strengthened the householder’s perceived autonomy and enhanced social status. Although satisfaction with the home proved to be an important explanation for positive mental health outcomes. financial considerations seemed to have played a secondary role.

1327058,The use of simulation software for building performance assessment in existing commercial buildings with heritage values,2013,James Pow Chew Wong and Nicola Willand,,,,,,This paper explores the use of building performance simulation software in assessing the building performance of two existing commercial buildings with heritage values in Australia. The research found that the differences between the simulation results and the NABERS assessment (a national rating system that measures the environmental performance of Australian buildings) ranged from 30% to 80% for electricity usage. and about 350% for natural gas usage. The outcome suggests that some uncertainty exists in the assessments and that these could be due to assumptions used in the operational energy modelling of the case study buildings when on-site information was not available.,True,-bf8AdcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_2301.pdf,4770934487964684538,/scholar?cites=4770934487964684538,,,http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2013/p_2301.pdf,0,0,0

The pilot studies trialled a variety of energy efficiency initiatives and communications strategies aimed at changing energy consumers’ decision-making and behaviours. These initiatives differed in their complexity and cost. with varying levels of success. Among them. the co-benefits experienced by households was substantial and warrants further investigation. ECA’s Power Shift Project Two allows such investigation to occur. Exploring the range of cobenefits in Australia. as they relate to energy efficiency improvements. may have significant consequences as links between energy efficiency and health and well-being demonstrate thatenergy efficiency improvements could result in households experiencing many. and invariablymore important. benefits beyond energy efficiency.Project Description: To complete Power Shift Project Two. GEER will build upon the foundation research of LIEEP by conducting a ‘deep dive’analysis into 19 of the 20 pilot studies 1. Investigations will be conducted on the individual project reports and supplemented by obtaining informal feedback. as needed. through the broader GEER network. and through a range of secondary sources (eg.

1327082,Performance Improvement and Two-Phase Flow Study of a Piezoelectric Micropump with Tesla Nozzle-Diffuser Microvalves,2019,Shahram Derakhshan and Borhan Beigzadeh and Mohammad Reza Rashidi and Hossein Pourrahmani,12,Journal of Applied Fluid Mechanics,2,,,The Present article aims to design a piezoelectric micropump using a combinational form of microvalves with sufficient diodicity in low-pressure gradients. The goal is to enhance the capability of piezoelectric micropumps with Tesla-type valves in order to deliver insulin. Tesla-type valves are in the category of passive valves which have sufficient diodicity in case of high-pressure gradients. However. low mass flow rates are often required in drug delivery devices. In this paper. the performance of MT135 Tesla-type valve in low pressure-gradient flows has been investigated and a range of reunion angles. which have not been studied before has been examined by numerical solutions. Inspired by nozzle-diffuser valve types. some changes in the bypass path of the microvalve have been exerted to boost the diodicity of the valve in low-pressure conditions that resulted in 9.97% increase of diodicity. At last but not least. the velocity gradients in singlephase flow of water has been attained and performance of micropump toward other kinds of flows has been investigated by a volume of fluid (VOF) model including water as the primary phase and air as the secondary one. To complete the analysis. a VOF model consisting of an arbitrary kind of Casson fluid with the primary phase of water was reached and discussed.,True,v9vNhi8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5,https://www.sid.ir/FileServer/JE/112520190201.pdf,13216396728973436270,/scholar?cites=13216396728973436270,,,https://www.sid.ir/FileServer/JE/112520190201.pdf,0,0,0

The addition of polyolefin elastomers has proved to be an approachable solution for low impact strength of PP. while it would also reduce the Young’s modulus and tensile strength. That is why reinforcement would be applied to this combination to enhance the elastic modulus. The mechanical properties of the prepared composites were devised to train an artificial neural network to predict these properties of the system in 6256 unknown points.

Though universal energy access is desirable. a significant reduction in fossil fuel usage is required before mid-century if global warming is to be limited to <2 °C. Here we quantify the changes in the global energy mix necessary to address population and climate change under two energy-use scenarios. finding that renewable energy production (9% in 2014) must comprise 87–94% of global energy consumption by 2100. Our study suggests >50% renewable energy needs to occur by 2028 in a <2 °C warming scenario. but not until 2054 in an unconstrained energy use scenario.

1327093,The climate-independent need for renewable energy in the 21st century,2017,Kevin J Warner and Glenn A Jones,10,Energies,8,1197,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In December 2015 the nations of the world agreed. in principle. to limit global warming to no more than 2 C above pre-industrial levels. In order to achieve this goal. recent publications have shown that (1) more than 50% of known fossil fuel reserves need to remain unused. and (2) the timing of the transition away from fossil fuels needs to achieve 50% renewable energy by 2028. an expansion of renewable sources of 37-fold in the next 12 years. This rate of expansion is unprecedented and unlikely to be achieved. Even utilizing the 50% of fossil fuels untapped in a< 2 C scenario results in significant expansion of renewable energy sources by 2100. Here we examine three fossil fuel reserve estimates and two per capita energy consumption tracks to understand how dominant renewable energy sources need to be during the second half of the 21st century. We find that per capita energy consumption rates are a more significant factor in the demand for renewable energy infrastructure. as wide ranging estimates of fossil fuel reserves still result in peak production by mid-century. At either of the consumption rates. attempting to uphold the 2 C global warming goal would demand more energy from renewable sources than was produced from all sources in 2014. In total. the world will likely require between 600 and 2000 exajoules of renewable energy by the year 2100. a significant expansion from the 13 produced in 2014. Despite meaningful gains in renewable energy sources. the transition away from fossil fuels is not keeping pace with rising global population. and expansion of global per capita consumption.

1327094,Energy and population in sub-Saharan Africa: energy for four billion?,2018,Kevin J Warner and Glenn A Jones,5,Environments,10,107,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Sub-Saharan Africa is home to several of the world’s least developed economies. Additionally. forty percent of the nearly one billion people in this region lack access to basic electricity. There are several initiatives and programs aimed at increasing electricity access. clean cooking fuel. and renewable energy around the world. Economic development efforts have traditionally relied on increasing an economy’s use of fossil fuels. However. global climate change agreements and mitigation efforts are in direct contrast with this approach. As such. future development efforts must fit into the larger energy–population–climate nexus of global sustainability. Here we utilise a quantitative approach to examine three scenarios for development in sub-Saharan Africa and compare the results to nine historical examples of economic development. While no perfect development analogue was found. there are several lessons that can be learned from the last half century of efforts. We find that UN projected population growth in the region is expected to outpace non-renewable energy availability. The population of sub-Saharan Africa. and subsequent projected growth (4 billion by 2100). will represent a significant energy and climate strain on the 21st century world. In a larger sense. the social and economic development of sub-Saharan Africa is likely to be tied to an increase in per capita energy consumption. This increase is not going to come from traditional fossil fuels and will therefore require significant investment in a renewable energy infrastructure.

Historically. economic and social development have been subsidized by cheap and abundant fossil-fuels. Climate change from fossil-fuel emissions has resulted in the need to reduce fossil-fuel emissions in order to avoid catastrophic warming. If climate goals are achieved. China and India will have been the first major economies to develop via renewable energy sources. In this article. we examine the factors of projected population growth. available fossil-fuel reserves. and renewable energy installations required to develop scenarios in which both China and India may increase per capita energy consumption while remaining on trach to meet ambitious climate goals. Here. we show that China and India will have to expand their renewable energy infrastructure at unprecedented rates in order to support both population growth and development goals.

1327096,Peak population: timing and influences of peak energy on the world and the United States,2012,Kevin Warner,,,,,,Peak energy is the notion that the world’s total production of usable energy will reach a maximum value and then begin an inexorable decline. Ninety-two percent of the world’s energy is currently derived from the non-renewable sources (oil. coal. natural gas and nuclear). As each of these non-renewable sources individually peaks in production. we can see total energy production peak. The human population is tightly correlated with global energy production. as agriculture and material possessions are energy intensive. It follows that peak energy should have a significant effect on world population. Using a set of mathematical models. including M King Hubbert’s oil peak mathematics. we prepared three models. The first approached the peak energy and population problem from the point of view of a “black-box” homogeneous world. The second model divides the world into ten major regions to study the global heterogeneity of the peak energy and population question. Both of these models include various scenarios for how the world population will develop based on available energy and per capita consumption of that energy. The third model examines energy and climate change within the forty-eight contiguous American states in order to identify some of the “best” and some of the “worst” states in which to live in the year 2050.  The black box model indicates that peak energy will occur in 2026 at a maximum production of 104.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE). Total energy production in 2011 was 92.78 BBOE. Three scenarios of different energy consumption rates suggest a peak world population occurring between 2026 and 2036. at 7.6 …,True,nQTLvkoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/148302,16137963425345433072,/scholar?cites=16137963425345433072,,,https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/148302/WARNER-THESIS-2012.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1,0,0,0

1327098,Energy. Climate and Population: Growth. Peaks. and Declines 1900-2100,2016,Kevin James Warner,,,,,,This dissertation is derived from numerical models that quantitatively examine energy. climate. and population. Future energy production in each chapter is modelled using the single-cycle Hubbert technique. Population figures are taken from United Nations projections. Per capita energy consumption is projected in each chapter either using regression modelling. or as a set of goals unique to the study. Annual energy demand is a product of per capita energy consumption and population. Renewable energy demand is defined as the total energy demand minus the projected non-renewable energy production. Emissions from energy production are calculated from global-averages for each source.   The global-scale model of energy production and consumption suggests that peaking non-renewable energy will create renewable energy demand equal to 50% of global energy by 2054 and by 2028 in order to achieve climate goals. Similar modelling of regional-scale energy consumption goals highlights specific challenges for that energy transition. including population growth. development. and dependence on imported energy. A sensitivity analysis of the global model inputs uncovers that increasing current per capita energy consumption 3% negates the total global non-hydro renewable energy contribution. Additionally. doubling fossil fuel reserves results in 32% reduction in non-hydropower renewable energy demand by 2100.   After determining the changes required to achieve certain goals in Sub-Saharan Africa. a search for a sufficient historical analogue provided evidence that the changes necessary would be globally unprecedented.

1327101,Energy. resource extraction and society: impacts and contested futures,2018,Anna Szolucha,,,,,Routledge,Energy is central to the fabric of society. This book revisits the classic notions of energy impacts by examining the social effects of resource extraction and energy projects which are often overlooked. Energy impacts are often reduced to the narrow configurations of greenhouse gas emissions. chemical spills or land use changes. However. this neglects the fact that the way we produce. distribute and consume energy shapes society. political institutions and culture. The authors trace the impacts of contemporary energy and resource extraction developments and explain their significance for the shaping of powerful social imaginaries and a reconfiguration of political and democratic systems. They analyse not only the complex histories and landscapes of industrial mining and energy development. including oil. coal. wind power. gas (fracking) and electrification. but also their significance for contested energy and social futures. Based on ethnographic and interdisciplinary research from around the world. including case studies from Australia. Germany. Kenya. the Netherlands. Nicaragua. Norway. Poland. Turkey.

Part of protecting environmental and public health is identifying potential risks before licenses are issued and drilling operations proceed. To this end. two case studies. focusing on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures of California and New York. are analyzed in this paper. Both states have histories of strong environmental protection law and policy [8–10] and legally require an EIA to be conducted before development of HVHF sites [11. 12]. an outgrowth of the 1969 federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). New York State conducted what appears to be a thorough EIA [13] and concluded that as there were too many gaps in the data on HVHF. fracking could not proceed. California’s EIA. which was less extensive. and did not consider health impacts [14]. concluded that HVHF could proceed. relatively unabated. A comparison of these cases illustrates that the processes designed to ensure adequate identification. monitoring. and assessment of environmental impacts are prone to differences [15]—an outcome of the fact that laws governing HVHF in the US are not consistent across. nor controlled at. the federal level [16. 17].,True,qO9biXUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,9,https://cse.ucpress.edu/content/2/1/1.36,3157978582524572497,/scholar?cites=3157978582524572497,,,https://cse.ucpress.edu/content/2/1/1.36,0,0,0

We focus on children as beneficiaries of environmental rights on account of their vulnerability to environmental impacts on their physical and mental health. Current legal frameworks. unless explicitly identifying children as beneficiaries. arguably tend to be adult-centric. Our goal here is to develop a comprehensive rights-based framework to ensure that children are protected against adverse environmental impacts. We argue that approaches that safeguard children’s rights to life. health. and education should include environment-related issues. standards. and protections for those rights to be fully implemented.

I expand on the definition of energy as an inherently social phenomenon and try to rethink the notion of energy impacts beyond the physical and material operation of energy developments and technologies. Instead. energy projects are analysed here as sites of new sociotechnical relations that implicate a broad set of materialities and temporalities in the operation of extractive industries and renewable technologies. I go beyond the local environments and show how energy impacts and resistance that they generate. point to the various scales at which energy is made significant for democracy. justice and equality. By reviewing the relevant literature and building on the analysis in the current volume.

Although the United States has extracted shale gas in different states for several decades. the United Kingdom is in the early stages of developing its domestic shale gas resources. in the hopes of replicating the United States’ commercial success with the technologies [2. 3]. However. the extraction of shale gas using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling poses potential risks to the environment and natural resources. human health. and communities and local livelihoods. Risks include contamination of water resources. air pollution. and induced seismic activity near shale gas operation sites.

We interpret social good in this context as environmental justice and sustainability. Environmental justice includes notions of equality. equity. social inclusion. human rights. public participation. and accountability. We define sustainability as human action that protects the environment for current and future generations and supports human well being. We argue here for the role of children as promoters of social good through their participation in citizen science. as inclusivity is a core tenet of environmental justice. This paper thus evaluates how participation in outdoor. eco-citizen science projects benefits the child’s development. and leads to commitment to environmental stewardship and justice. and promotion of social good as adults.

The concept that the onshore unconventional gas industry has a temporary effect on the land on which it operates creates a regulatory paradox. On one hand. unconventional gas activities create energy security. national wealth and a bourgeoning export industry. On the other. agricultural land and agriculturalists may be significantly disadvantaged by unconventional gas activities potentially producing permanent damage to non-renewable fertile soils and spoiling the underground water tables. Thus. threatening future food security and food sovereignty. This book explores the socio-regulatory dimensions of coexistence between agricultural and onshore unconventional gas land uses in the jurisdictions with the highest concentration of proven unconventional gas reserves–Australia. Canada. the USA. the UK. France. Poland and China. In exploring the differing regulatory standpoints of unconventional gas land uses on productive farming land in the chosen jurisdictions. this book provides an original three-part categorisation of regulatory approaches addressing the coexistence of agricultural land and unconventional gas namely: adaptive management. precautionary and. finally. statism.

France legislated a prohibition on domestic hydrocarbon exploration and production by 2040. in line with national carbon emissions reduction goals. As the law applies only to France or French territories. there is argued incentive for French-based companies to move their extractive activities abroad. France also passed in 2017 a remarkable ‘due diligence’ law—the Duty of Care Act—that holds large French companies responsible for impacts of their activities worldwide. including subsidiaries and the totality of their supply chains. The law’s potential reach is unclear as there is currently no case law to guide decision-making and application of its provisions.

To establish context. we briefly overview the history of the United States NPS and other relevant federal agencies’ roles and responsibilities in protecting federal lands that have been set aside due to their value as areas of natural beauty or historical or cultural significance [3]. We present a case study of Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP) situated within the Bakken Shale Formation—a lucrative region of oil and gas deposits—to examine potential impacts if areas of TRNP. particularly areas designated as “wilderness.” are opened to resource extraction. or if the development in other areas of the Bakken near or adjacent to the park’s boundaries expands [4].

Such methods should also ideally utilise readily available materials and have a relatively straightforward field application. The Asian clam. Corbicula fluminea (Müller. 1774) is a high impact freshwater invader that can dominate macroinvertebrate communities and physically alter benthic habitats. Moreover. C. fluminea has shown a high degree of physiological and ecological plasticity. and has displayed a remarkable capacity for human-mediated passive dispersal. Globally. despite repeated efforts to mitigate spread and implement substantial population control measures. C. fluminea continues to invade and spread. Accordingly. effective population eradication and control measures are urgently required. Here. we examine the efficacy of commercially available dry ice (DI) pellets (ie solid CO2 pellets at− 78 C) to kill C. fluminea. when applied both directly (water absent) and indirectly (clams submerged). Experiment 1 revealed the ability of 9 mm DI pellets to induce substantial C. fluminea mortality. with a direct application of 300 g DI at 5 min exposure inducing 100% clam mortality.

This paper describes the outreach element of a project on invasive alien species. A communications plan was drawn up to streamline communications efforts. allowing us to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities to engage with the public. while still maintaining the desired focus. using minimal resources. Here. we use two simple metrics—“passive reach” and “interactions”—to measure the extent and the intensity of communications. and we also look at the advantages and limitations provided by different media. Broadcast media and social media have the capacity to reach a wide audience. but have a low percentage of interaction. Workshops and citizen science events tend to reach a much smaller audience. but generate greater levels of engagement. Understanding these dynamics is important in designing an effective communications plan. which uses the minimum number of resources to generate maximum impact.

Although broad-spectrum aquatic disinfectants have been suggested as a suitable decontamination mechanism to enhance invader spread-prevention strategies. inconsistencies concerning their effectiveness are reported within the literature. Here. we examine the use of two aquatic disinfectants. which were developed to kill damaging microbes. to induce substantial degradation of the apical fragmentary propagules of five invasive macrophytes: Crassula helmsii (Kirk) Cockayne; Egeria densa Planchon; Elodea canadensis Michx; Hydrocotyle ranunculoides Linnaeus; Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss.

The Asian clam. Corbicula fluminea (Müller. 1774). is a high impact freshwater invader that can dominate macroinvertebrate communities and physically alter benthic habitats. Globally. despite efforts to implement substantial population control measures. C. fluminea continues to invade. spread and persist within freshwater environments. Accordingly. improved eradication. population suppression and rapid reaction techniques are urgently required. As C. fluminea beds can often become exposed during low water conditions. the present study examines the efficacy of an open-flame heat torch. generating~ 1000 C. in killing exposed individuals. Direct and indirect applications of the open-flame torch were examined. for C. fluminea residing on top of or within the substrate. respectively. Experiments revealed that≥ 3 seconds of direct exposure to the flame causes complete mortality of C. fluminea. while only low mortality rates of between 8–11% were achieved for mud-dwelling C. fluminea following 30 seconds of indirect exposure.

Increased numbers of vectors and pathways have reduced the island’s biotic isolation. increasing the risk of new introductions and their associated impacts on native biodiversity. It is likely that these risks are greater here than they are in continental MSs. where the native biodiversity is richer. A horizon scanning approach was used to identify the most likely invasive alien species (IAS) (with the potential to impact biodiversity) to arrive on the island of Ireland within the next ten years. To achieve this. we used a consensus-based approach. whereby expert opinion and discussion groups were utilised to establish and rank a list of 40 species of the most likely terrestrial. freshwater and marine IAS to arrive on the island of Ireland within the decade 2017–2027. The list of 40 included 18 freshwater. 15 terrestrial and seven marine IAS. Crustacean species (freshwater and marine) were taxonomically dominant (11 out of 40); this reflects their multiple pathways of introduction. their ability to act as ecosystem engineers and their resulting high impacts on biodiversity.

1327163,Operational and policy implications of managing uncertainty in quality and emissions of multi-feedstock biodiesel systems,2012,Ece Gülșen,,,,,,As an alternative transportation fuel to petrodiesel. biodiesel has been widely promoted within national energy portfolio targets across the world. Early estimations of low lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of biodiesel were one of the main drivers behind extensive government support in the form of financial incentives for the industry. However. several recent studies have reported a high degree of uncertainty and variation (U&V) in these emissions. raising questions concerning the carbon benefits of biodiesel compared to petrodiesel. A smaller degree of U&V in physical feedstock characteristics emerging from compositional variation was already known to producers. Although feedstock blending has been broadly practiced by the industry to meet multiple fuel quality standards and to control costs. its implications on these U&V characteristics of biodiesel have not been explicitly addressed by researchers or policymakers. This work investigates the impact of feedstock blending on the U&V characteristics of biodiesel by using a chance-constrained (CC) blend optimization method. The objective of the optimization is minimization of feedstock costs subject to fuel standards and the decision variables are feedstock proportions. Two sets of prediction models are developed to represent the physical properties and lifecycle emissions of feedstocks within the CC model. The results indicate that blending can be used to manage U&V characteristics of biodiesel. and to achieve cost reductions through feedstock diversification.

In Iran. Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) is used as an additive to the base gasoline. Due to the destructive environmental effects of the mentioned material. our country. the same as other developed countries. should seek to use a replacement for the mentioned additive. The combination of the base gasoline and fuel additives has such limitations like increase in the quantity of volatility. the reid vapor pressure (RVP) and decrease in calorific value of the fuel obtained. In this research. Ethanol. Tertiary Butyl Alcohol (TBA) and Metyl Tertiary Butyl Ether. in the volumetric ratios of 2.5. 5. 7.5. 10. 15 and 20. are blended with the base gasoline of Tehran Oil Refinery Company (TORC). The behavior of volatility of the obtained fuel has been investigated based on ASTM standards. The results obtained from the done investigation reveal that in case of using Ethanol as a fuel additive. certain changes should be made in the formulation of base gasoline. The mentioned combination has an undesirable effect on the other characteristics of fuel such as Octane Number. Addition of Tertiary Butyl Alcohol to gasoline shall result in trivial increase in the reid vapor pressure. Consequently. there will be no need for the replacement of light straight run gasoline (LSRG) compounds with heavier compounds in order to decrease the reid vapor pressure.,True,EU8FDSoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=464887,,,,,,0,0,0

Experimental results are presented for a cam-follower system characterized by a radial cam and a flat-faced follower. Under variation of the cam rotational speed. the follower is observed to detach from the cam and then show the emergence of periodic impacting behaviour characterized by many impacts and chattering. Further variations of the cam speed cause the sudden transition to seemingly aperiodic behaviour. These results are compared with the numerical simulation of a mathematical model of the system which shows the same qualitative behaviour. Excellent quantitative agreement is found between the numerical and experimental results.,True,MAVVXqAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,65,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-006-9188-8,681802117927512615,/scholar?cites=681802117927512615,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01304369/document,0,0,0

We show that a sudden transition to chaos is observed when a complete chattering motion (characterized theoretically by infinitely many impacts) is interrupted. Using numerical computations and semi-analytical methods we show that a cascade of grazing bifurcations is then originated. leading the system into chaos.

This approach is novel in the sense that it allows the formulation of generic formal rules as sets for the transition between continuous and discrete modes of a hybrid model. which can be further implemented as software routines for simulation purposes.

Metallic species in the oil formulation. mostly from detergents and anti-wear additives. have a significant impact on ash behavior when subjected to high temperatures during active regeneration of the filter. Certain compounds in the oil. especially derivatives of ZDDP (Zinc Dialkyl Dithiophosphate). interact with filter substrate and sinter at temperatures that the DPF is exposed to during active regeneration. This phenomenon of sintering or ‘ash wetting’ leads to ash-bridges in the DPF that result in reduction of soot storage capacity. higher back-pressure and possibly reduced active surface area for catalytic conversion of engine-out emissions.

Longer drain intervals have resulted in engines running 80000 kilometers or more before an oil change. This results in longer residence times of EGR soot in the crankcase and other parts of the engine drivetrain. The primary structure of soot from in-cylinder combustion is turbostratic carbon. as soot spends more time in the combustion chamber and in the crankcase it incorporates some of the chemistry of the aged oil as well as debris from the wear processes making the soot more abrasive.

Photovoltaic (PV) is considered as. not only as the future of humanity’s source of green energy. but also as a reliable solution to the energy crisis due to its sustainability. abundance. easy fabrication. cost-friendly and environmentally hazard-free nature. PV is grouped into first. second and third-generation cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). classified as third-generation PV. have gained more ground in recent times. This is linked to their transparency. high efficiency. shape. being cost-friendly and flexibility of colour. However. further improvement of DSSCs by quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) has increased their efficiency through the use of semiconducting materials. such as quantum dots (QDs). as sensitizers. This has paved way for the fabrication of semiconducting QDs to replace the ideal DSSCs with quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Moreover. there are no absolute photosensitizers that can cover all the infrared spectrum. the infusion of QD metal sulphides with better absorption could serve as a breakthrough. Metal sulphides. such as PbS. SnS and CuS QDs could be used as photosensitizers due to their strong near infrared (NIR) absorption properties.

This placed great emphasis on the synthesis route adopted for the preparation of the sensitiser.

Morphological. structural. and electrochemical instruments were used to assert the properties of both materials. The CuS/HDA photosensitiser demonstrated an appropriate lifetime and electron transfer. while the electron back reaction of CuS lowered the electron lifetime in the QDSSCs. The higher electrocatalytic activity and interfacial resistance observed from current density-voltage (I–V) results agreed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results for CuS/HDA.

This synthetic route offers a safe. easy and cost-effective method of achieving the desired material. The present work investigates the synthesis of inorganic PbS sensitizers through a molecular precursor route and their impact on improving the conversion efficiency in photovoltaic cells. PbS photosensitizers were deposited on TiO 2 by direct deposition. and their structure. morphologies and electrocatalytic properties were examined. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms PbS nanocrystal structure and the atomic force microscopy (AFM) displays the crystalline phase of uniform size and distribution of PbS. indicating compact surface nanoparticles. The electrocatalytic activity by lead sulfide. using N-di-isopropyl-N-octyldithiocarbamato (OCT) without hexadecylamine (HDA) capping (OCT-PbS) was very low in HI-30 electrolyte. due to its overpotential. while lead sulfide with OCT and HDA-capped (OCT-PbS/HDA) sensitizer exhibited significant electrocatalytic activity with moderate current peaks due to a considerable amount of reversibility. The OCT-PbS sensitizer exhibited a strong resistance interaction with the electrolyte. indicating very poor catalytic activity compared to the OCT-PbS/HDA sensitizer. The values of the open-circuit voltage (V OC) were~ 0.52 V. with a fill factor of 0.33 for OCT-PbS/HDA.

The electrocatalytic activity of MO-PbS/HDA sensitizer is very low compared to MO-PbS. which displays a higher current peak relative. The MO-PbS photosensitizer produces improved efficiency of 0.63%. better than MO-PbS/HDA photosensitizer. The Bode plot and EIS results of MO-PbS indicate a high catalytic activity. which may improve the conversion efficiency of quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).,True,CIiPsrQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167577X20304754,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johannes_Mbese2/publication/340574005_Electrocatalytic_Properties_of_PbS_Nanocrystal_Structured_from_bisN-14-Phenyl-N-4-Morpholine_dithiocarbamato_PbII_complexes_as_photosensitizer_for_Quantum-Dots-Sensitized_Solar_Cells/links/5e970b13a6fdcca78918f5a1/Electrocatalytic-Properties-of-PbS-Nanocrystal-Structured-from-bisN-1-4-Phenyl-N-4-Morpholine-dithiocarbamato-PbII-complexes-as-photosensitizer-for-Quantum-Dots-Sensitized-Solar-Cells.pdf,0,0,0

Despite. recent improvements generation of electricity from solar remains a costly low efficiency process. Development of the present photovoltaic technologies or newer ones is required to increase efficiency. This work details the development of a more efficient and cost effective counter electrode for the dye sensitized solar cell. The present platinum counter electrode utilized in dye sensitized solar cells has a low efficiency and is expensive. In order not to sacrifice efficiency for cheapness. palladium based alloys with transition metal elements nickel and cobalt were developed. The amount of palladium utilized is infinitesimal while the transition metal elements shore up electrocatalytic activity through charge transfer to the palladium atom. The chemical composition of the developed alloys was controlled through optimization of the volume ratios of the Pd. Ni and Co precursors during the hydrothermal synthesis process. Properties of the developed ternary palladium alloys were examined using various techniques including XRD. TEM. EDS. SEM. CV. CD and EIS. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the PdNiCo electrode possessed low charge transfer resistance as well as high reduction current density compared to the platinum electrode developed under similar conditions.

The effect of the cabin on the product in terms of natural heat convection is also evaluated.,True,1RaFYy8AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9032311683270220759&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1327274,Bir şalter sistemi için termal analiz,,Gülşen Yaman,,Balıkesir Üniversitesi Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü Dergisi,,1-9,,Distribution of electrical energy is important. Particularly during the management of power transmission networks. many critical systems enter the circuit and perform important functions. One of the most important of these is the high-voltage switching process. known as switch-mode operation. One of the problems that switching mechanism meets when performing its function is heat accumulation. It is imperative to examine the thermal design and consider design considerations under limited volume and special conditions. In this closed volume. the temperature values produced by these elements were experimentally measured at certain points and then these values were compared with the 3D finite volume based CFD determined values. This comparison demonstrates that the design could be based on CFD analysis values in terms of temperature appearance. This is a valuable contribution for cost minimization and optimal system design approach.Elektrik enerjisinin dağıtımı önemlidir.

In fact. it became necessary to correlate in further research the corruption with energy consumption. economic growth and CO2 emissions. This study used time series data from 1996–2012 in the MENA region with the main aim to contribute to empirical literature by using the PLS-SEM approach. Results from the PLS-SEM show evidence of economic growth causing CO2 emissions. Second. energy consumption is positively and significantly related to economic growth and also may increase CO2 emissions.

The space vector modulation (SVM) methods own distinct advantages over other PWM methods. However. MLI SVM has involved more mathematics in their executions. Hence. the digital signal processors (DSPs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) based digital implementations are highly preferred for MLI SVM realizations. which require exceptional properties. The conventional MLI SVMs use complex mathematical functions to solve their internal functions to identify the space vector diagram (SVD) sub-triangle and over modulation boundary switching on-times. Particularly these are the changes in the position of reference vector with respect to their sub-triangle positions involving higher mathematical functions. This paper proposes a simplified three-level MLI SVM that reduces the sub-triangle and over modulation switching on-time calculations with reduced mathematical functions. The proposed MLI SVM is derived based on two-level SVM without changing the reference vector position. unlike the traditional approaches. This helps in extending the SVM for any n-level inverter with additional LUTs. The detailed theoretical study. MATLAB-Simulink system generator simulations and Xilinx FPGA family SPARTAN-III-3A based experimental implementations are done with three-level neutral point MLI fed induction motor drive.

The electrical drive segment. the VSI based drives are unavoidable and they are closely operated with induction motor. permanent magnate synchronous motor and BLDC motor. These drives are normally needed high torque-power characters. Hence. the input DC-link side voltage is increased with help of increasing input AC in the rectifier input. However. this causes the power quality disturbance in the AC main and DC-link. In order to go for a increasing the AC voltage. the rectifier out is connected with DC to DC boost converter and they are increasing the DC voltage to meet out the drive DC-link voltage demand. With this aim. the paper proposes the idea to connect high step non-isolated high gain coupled DC to DC converter with three phase VSI for drives applications. The proposed converter has an ability to increase the voltage five times and the counter winding arrangement ratio of the converter is help for the further increase of gain. Inn this interface the front end DC to DC converters inductors are charged by making the short circuit with inverter switching. The converter voltage gain is controlled by shoot through of the VSI switch (converter gain directly proportional to inverter shoot through). The proposed converter has a higher degree of freedom in their values of winding and output voltage. Hence. the DC-link voltage of the inverter can be extended in any level.

The industrial drives are acquainting to use SVPWM owing extended speed–torque region operations. However. the extended SVPWM operation is uses much mathematical calculation to predict the switching on-times. which demands high digital platform. In order to reduce this calculation in this paper a simple on-time calculation based SVPWM is proposed.

1327347,Feasibility study of the thermal performance improvement of natural draft dry cooling towers due to flue gas injection,2011,Ali Jahangiri and Aliakbar Golneshan,12,World Applied Sciences Journal,4,568-575,,In steam power plants. any improvement in the cooling towers thermal performance will cause the condenser's temperature to decrease; which in turn enhances the power plant's efficiency. Due to water shortage. many power plants all around the world rely on natural draft dry cooling towers (Heller type). In these cooling towers. condenser's exit hot water is pumped to vertical or horizontal finned radiators which are arranged all around of the tower. The tower should then be able to cool down the circulating water to the condenser’s temperature. Conversely ambient air is sucked naturally through these radiators due to heat gain from the hot water. The heated air is then discharged through the tower's top exit to the ambient. Environmental conditions strictly affect Heller cooling tower's performance. Temperature. density and the mass flow rate of sucked air into the cooling tower will completely influence on its operation. To improve the cooling tower's performance it is proposed to inject the steam generator’s flue gas into the tower for better air suction. In this study a natural draft dry cooling tower incorporating the flue gas duct is modeled to study the effect of flue gas injection on the sucked air flow rate and the radiator heat transfer. Considering the buoyancy effect term. for a 3-D incompressible flow. the navier stoke's equations as well as the energy equation are solved by computational fluid dynamic method (CFD) to obtain the air flow pattern in and around the tower as well as the heat transfer from the radiators.

This paper investigates the thermo-physical contact between a single drop of water (0 ℃ as a fluid with higher temperature) with liquid methane. which is similar to liquefied natural gas. at a very low temperature (−162 ℃). Heat transfer between water drop and liquefied methane results in rapid pressure increase in a vapor film.

Due to operation in high-temperature and -pressure conditions. platen superheater (primary superheater) tubes in thermal power point boilers are exposed to breakdowns such as creep failure and overheating. Therefore. identifying the causes of these failures and its maintenance is very important. Platen superheater tubes have failed in several similar power plant units at the same specific area. This problem is analyzed by three methods to find out the reason. These methods are metallography. measuring oxide layer thickness and CFD. These methods prove that the temperature difference between tubes is the cause of failure at the critical area. Length difference between tubes is the reason of the temperature raising in this case.

The aim of this study is to match the electricity demand with the intermittent solar-based renewable resources profile and to minimize the energy cost. The main contribution of the proposed model addresses uncertainties of the thermal load in smart buildings by considering detailed types of loads such as hot water. heating. and ventilation loads. In smart grids. buildings are no longer passive consumers. They are controllable loads. which can be used for demand-side energy management. Smart homes. as a domain of Internet of Things (IoT). enable energy systems of the buildings to operate as an active load in smart grids. The proposed formulation is cast as a stochastic MILP model for a 24-h horizon in order to minimize the total energy cost. In this study. Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to generate 1000 random scenarios for two environmental factors: the outdoor temperature. and solar radiation. Therefore in the proposed model. the thermal load. the output power of the photovoltaic panel. solar collector power generation. and electricity load become stochastic parameters. The proposed model results in an energy cost-saving of 20%. and a decrease of the peak electricity demand from 7.6 KWh to 4.2 KWh.

The main contribution of this research is the comparative evaluation of on-grid decentralized or distributed renewable-powered desalination systems for sustainable water and energy supply planning. Applying a novel nexus approach. an interactive multi-period planning model is developed to highlight synergies and to identify conflicts of planning both energy and water sectors at the same time as endogenous subsystems of one overall system. For studying these synergies in this study. the pace of technology deployment and the path of decline in overall costs are assumed to be a function of experience and knowledge as two-factor learning curves. Using data from 81 projects. the levelized cost and capacity factor of utility-scale photovoltaic and wind supplies in the Middle East were calculated.

This need was manifested by the investigations following the collapses of bridges in Laval City. Canada and Sliver Bridge in the US Despite the considerable attention given to the adoption of a whole life-cycle approach in Building Information Modeling (BIM). very little work has been done to extend the usability of 3D design and as-built models of highway infrastructures into the operation and maintenance phase. Currently. efforts are being made to standardize the use of 3D models for the design of infrastructure projects within governmental bodies; however a clear framework that delineates the way in which the operation and maintenance data can be integrated into the design model is evidently lacking. Also. there is a tangible absence of a methodology that provides a systematic and automated base for leveraging the already existing project-level life-cycle data for the integrative management of infrastructures networks. In this paper. we propose a life-cycle approach for the infrastructure information modeling. whereby the 3D model will evolve from a design platform into an all-round information management tool whose applicability spans across the entire project life-cycle. Furthermore. the idea of incrementally building an infrastructure network management system based on the aggregation of project-level information models. eg BIM. is explored.

1327467,Simulation-Based Optimization of Energy Consumption and Occupants Comfort in Open-Plan Office Buildings Using Probabilistic Occupancy Prediction Model,2019,Shide Salimi,,,,,,Considering the ever-growing increase in the world energy consumption and the fact that buildings contribute a large portion of the global energy consumption arises a need for detailed investigation towards more effective energy performance of buildings. Thus. monitoring. estimating. and reducing buildings’ energy consumption have always been important concerns for researchers and practitioners in the field of energy management. Since more than 80% of energy consumption happens during the operation phase of a building’s life cycle. efficient management of building operation is a promising way to reduce energy usage in buildings. Among the parameters influencing the total building energy consumption. building occupants’ presence and preferences could have high impacts on the energy usage of a building. To consider the effect of occupancy on building energy performance. different occupancy models. which aim to estimate the space utilization patterns. have been developed by researches. However. providing a comprehensive occupancy model. which could capture all important occupancy features. is still under development. Moreover. researchers investigated the effect of the application of occupancy-centered control strategies on the efficiency of the energy-consuming systems.

However. most of the occupancy detection systems cannot provide this detailed information. which reduces their practicality for open-plan offices. Therefore. there is a need to use proper sensing techniques to distinguish between different occupants in open-plan offices when detecting occupancy patterns. In this study. the probabilistic occupancy modelling has been further enhanced using inhomogeneous Markov chain prediction model based on data collected by a Real Time Locating System (RTLS). The comparison between the occupancy profiles resulting from the prediction model and the actual profiles showed that the prediction model was able to capture the behaviour of occupants.

These systems are proven to save energy. however. their drawback is their impact on the creation of radiant temperature asymmetry and local thermal discomfort. especially in old buildings where the temperatures of surfaces (for example external walls with a low level of insulation and large windows) are low. This study aims to evaluate the potential application of low-temperature radiant ceiling heating systems (28–38 C) in old and energy-renovated buildings. based on subjective experiments and thermal comfort criteria such as thermal sensation. comfort. satisfaction. and sensation asymmetry votes. Later. in the Discussion section. the guideline for the radiant temperature asymmetry for the warm ceiling presented in ASHRAE Standard-55 is corrected for relatively low air temperatures and different surface temperatures corresponding to “about neutral” conditions for winter clothing. Findings of this research show that the radiant ceiling heating system operating at low temperatures (33–38 C) can provide fairly neutral thermal sensation and satisfactory comfort at the majority of body-parts. if the building envelope satisfies advanced building energy-efficiency regulations.

Additionally. their application in the renovation of existing buildings is relatively uncomplicated and requires minimal changes to the building’s construction. However. ASHRAE Standard-55 and former studies by Fanger indicated that among large-surface radiant systems. the highest percentage of dissatisfaction for an equal radiant temperature asymmetry (RTA) was reported for a warm ceiling. The maximum RTA of 4 K corresponding to 5% of dissatisfaction was suggested.

During the experiments. room air temperature. humidity. velocity and globe temperature. as well as skin temperature at eight body-points were measured. Findings of this research prove that the radiant ceiling heating system operating at even low temperatures (28-35 C) can provide fairly neutral thermal sensation and satisfactory comfort at the majority body-parts. if the building envelope satisfies advanced building energy-efficiency regulations. The overall thermal sensation and comfort closely follow the local votes at the upper-body limbs. Beyond the expectation. the head is perceived as the most comfortable body part. despite it is a sensitive extremity to warm conditions. Furthermore. the results show that unlike the local comfort votes. the local sensation votes are strongly related to the local skin temperatures.,True,5rxVD00AAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Reza_Safizadeh/publication/324648171_Evaluation_of_Radiant_Ceiling_Heating_Systems_for_Renovated_Buildings_based_on_Thermal_Comfort_Criteria/links/5ae050e0a6fdcc2935906bb7/Evaluation-of-Radiant-Ceiling-Heating-Systems-for-Renovated-Buildings-based-on-Thermal-Comfort-Criteria.pdf,4617333045143958048,/scholar?cites=4617333045143958048,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Reza_Safizadeh/publication/324648171_Evaluation_of_Radiant_Ceiling_Heating_Systems_for_Renovated_Buildings_based_on_Thermal_Comfort_Criteria/links/5ae050e0a6fdcc2935906bb7/Evaluation-of-Radiant-Ceiling-Heating-Systems-for-Renovated-Buildings-based-on-Thermal-Comfort-Criteria.pdf,0,0,0

1327492,Two-Stage Air-Dehumidification System for the Tropics – Assessment of Conceptual System Configurations,2014,M Reza Safizadeh and Alexander Morgenstern and Constanze Bongs and Hans-martin Henning and Joachim Luther,,,,,International Solar Energy Society,Under tropical climate conditions. conventional air-conditioning systems consume a considerable amount of electricity in order to get rid of the high latent load (humidity) of the ambient air. This is due to the applied simultaneous dehumidification and cooling processes. Therefore. an idea of a separate handling of the latent and the sensible loads is investigated by applying series connected heat powered dehumidification and electricity powered cooling systems. A two-stage dehumidification system including a membrane-based heat and mass exchanger and an Evaporatively COoled Sorptive dehumidification system (ECOS system) is proposed to dehumidify the ambient air; the sensible load (cooling of dehumidified air) is handled by an efficient conventional cooling process operating at relatively high evaporation temperatures (14 െ 20 Ԩ).The aim of this study is to evaluate different conceptual system configurations and to find optimized systems for tropical climate conditions (air humidity and temperature are in the order of 20 g୴/kgୟ୧୰ and 32 Ԩ. respectively) by means of simulation calculations. The dehumidification capacity. the total specific removed enthalpy and the thermal coefficient of performance (COP) of the system are used as criteria for an assessment of the proposed concepts. The dehumidification system is mathematically modelled in MATLAB and linked with TRNSYS-17.1. Experimental data are used to validate the components models.

Along with proximate and elemental analysis. calorific values were provided for RDF. MSW organic fraction. and coal samples. This followed by the thermogravimetric analysis of the same samples. In addition. Org MSW MSW and coal samples were blended in a proportion of 0.5/0.5 and 0.25/0.75 and then thermally treated in horizontal tube furnace both under air and inert gases to investigate the pyrolysis and gasification processes. TGA tests revealed that volatile content from Org MSW and RDF begin to be emitted at temperatures above 180-200 °C. Org MSW and RDF lose all their volatile contents at 500 °C and 700 °C. Pyrolysis experiments revealed that below 500 °C mostly tars are formed from Org MSW. Organic MSW and coal 0.5/0.5 blends yielded higher methane concentrations than coal or MSW alone. reaching 35-37 % at 800 °C.

The situation becomes more strenuous in fast-growing cities where increasing waste production can hardly be met by the capacity of existing facilities. Practices like waste prevention. recycling. reuse. and recovery are fundamental elements needed for the reduction of solid waste disposed in landfills. especially in fast-growing cities where more sustainable management practices need to be adopted. This study investigated the behavioral attitudes of citizens of the capital of Kazakhstan. Nur-Sultan (former Astana). towards household solid waste disposal and separation at the source. The survey was conducted through stratified random sampling during April and July of 2018 with the participation of 3281 respondents. It is the first attempt. to our knowledge. of assessing recycling trends in Kazakhstan from the household perspective. The results showed that 24% of respondents were already sorting household solid waste despite the absence of a separation system at the source. The study further demonstrated that separation at source could be effective if the local authorities were to introduce sound public awareness campaigns and install recycling bins in close proximity to residential buildings.

The current work explores the hydrodynamics of a small-scale circulating fluidised bed at elevated operating pressures ranging from 0.10 to 0.25 MPa. The initial experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure with air and O/CO environments as the fluidisation gas to simulate the hydrodynamics in a CFB. A comparison between the effects of air and O/CO mixtures on the hydrodynamics was outlined in this paper for particles of 160 μm diameter. A small but distinct effect on axial voidage was observed due to the change in gas density in the dense zone of the bed at lower gas velocity. while only minimal differences were noticed at higher gas velocities. The hydrodynamic parameters such as pressure drop and axial voidage profile along the height were reported at two different bed inventories (0.5 and 0.75 kg) for three mean particle sizes of 160. 302 and 427 μm and three superficial gas velocities. It was observed that the operating pressure had a significant effect on the hydrodynamic parameters of bed pressure drop and axial bed voidage profiles. The effect of solids loading resulted in an exponential change in pressure drop profile at atmospheric pressure as well as at elevated pressure. The experimental results on hydrodynamic parameters are in reasonable agreement with published observations in the literature.,True,1_v92bQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/11988,9835686037309264626,/scholar?cites=9835686037309264626,,,https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1826/11988/Hydrodynamic_experiments_on_a_small-scale_circulating_fluidised_bed_reactor-2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Among several management options. pyrolysis and combustion of MSW has regained interest because of improved combustion techniques. This work aims to investigate the thermal conversion and combustion characteristics of refuse derived solid fuel (RDF) samples and its individual compounds collected from Nur-Sultan’s MSW landfills. The waste-derived solid RDF samples originally consist of textile. mixed paper. and mixed plastic. In particular. the samples. including RDF and its three constituent components. were analyzed in the temperature range of 25 to 900 C. at three different heating rates. by thermogravimetric method. The gross calorific value for RDF derived from Nur-Sultan’s MSW was determined to be 23.4 MJ/kg. The weight loss rates of the samples. differential thermogravimetry (DTG). and kinetic analysis were compared between individual RDF components and for the mixed RDF. Combustion kinetics models were calculated using Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO). Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS). and Friedman methods. The results revealed that first decomposition of RDF samples was observed at the range of 180–370 C. Moreover. the activation energy for conversion of RDF was observed to be the highest among the constituent components and gradually decreased from 370 to 140 kJ/kmol.

Many process models have been developed for combustion process. including fixed and fluidized bed combustion for different types of coal; however. they are designed for specific process and lack generality. More recently. Aspen Plus has introduced new tools. and particularly featured a built-in unit operation model. to design fluidized bed processes. Herein. we comprehensively apply the novel tool to analyze the low grade coal combustion with varying process conditions such as: temperatures. fuel/air ratio. pressure. and other. The model developed in Aspen Plus was validated with our experimental data performed in a pilot-scale fluidized bed combustor. The fuel type of combustion used in the experiments is Ekibastuz coal (a type of low-grade Kazakhstan coal). The data from experiments were used to fine-tune the Aspen Plus model. Eventually. results indicate accuracy of the model in predicting the gas compositions and the reactor hydrodynamics. Furthermore. sensitivity analyses were performed in order to analyze the effect of temperature and feed flow rate on the combustion efficiency and flue-gas compositions.

Beside statistical data. we rely on case studies to present the profile of the most important Russian investors in each host country. The Visegrád countries have attracted less Russian investment than their economic importance would warrant. due to various factors. most notably the joint effects of reticence in host countries and firm strategies that do not necessarily see the subregion as a major priority. Most of the Russian investment examined is market. and to a lesser extent. resource seeking. concentrated in the hydrocarbons. steel and nuclear energy industries. often dominated by state-owned firms. Some innovative private Russian companies. with features similar to developed-country multinationals. can also be identified with market as well as efficiency-seeking investment.

Russian–Hungarian relations have developed in a vociferous and spectacular manner. demonstrating a broad understanding between the two leaders in world policy and economic matters. This turn of events. however. is astonishing given the small-scale economic underpinnings of bilateral relations and lack of clear business vision. This paper outlines a new kind of Russian influence-building through the Hungarian case. It maps out major milestones and interprets the construction process of Moscow’s regional power in an environment highly integrated into the Western value chains and once dominated by foreign multinationals. The paper finds that (a) the impetus for engagement came from both the Hungarian and Russian sides;(b) a successful transition from communism and smooth integration into Western value chains do not shield entirely against Russian leverage;(c) energy is the field where Russia can permanently preserve its credibility; and (d) Western powers and institutions have little leverage to stop this process.

Az orosz társaságok tőkeexportja a XIX. század utolsó évtizedeiben kezdődött. A tőke főként Kínába. Perzsiába és Mongóliába irányult. A két világháború közt a Szovjetunió nem vonta vissza az összes kihelyezett tőkét. de radikálisan csökkentette. A Törökországgal. Iránnal. Afganisztánnal és Mongóliával folytatott kereskedelem támogatása érdekében kereskedőtársaságok egész hálózatát hozta létre és működtette ezekben a hagyományos partnerországokban. A nyugat-európai kereskedőcégek csak később alakultak meg. Ezeken kívül bankok. szállítási társaságok. biztosítók és más cégek is létrejöttek szovjet tőkével (Bulatov 1998). A második világháborút követően némileg nőtt a külföldi társaságok száma. ám így sem voltak sokan. A nyugati szovjet leányvállalatok túlnyomó többsége az olaj. a fémek. a fa. a vegyi áru. a gépek és a járművek értékesítésében vett részt. A szovjet társaságok nem voltak különösen aktívak a KGST-államokban. a nyolcvanas évek közepén mindössze néhány közös vállalat működött. majd a peresztrojkának és a kelet-európai szabályozás javulásának köszönhetően ugrott meg a számuk (Liuhto–Vahtra 2004. 2007).2. Mindössze 699 millió dollárra rúgott a kihelyezett szovjet közvetlen külföldi tőkebefektetések (FDI) állománya 1990-ben. szemben az 1983-as 388 millió dollárral és az 1987-es 378 millió dollárral (Andreff 2003). A kihelyezett orosz FDI-állomány a kilencvenes évek közepén ötmilliárd dollár alatt. a kilencvenes évek végén tízmilliárd dollár alatt maradt. 2000 végén mindössze 20. 1 milliárd dollárt ért el. de némely szakértő már a kilencvenes évek közepén és második felében magasabb értékeket …,True,YA2ZuIYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,9,http://real.mtak.hu/80453/1/kh_199_u.pdf,1378631729660543339,/scholar?cites=1378631729660543339,,,http://real.mtak.hu/80453/1/kh_199_u.pdf,0,0,0

While. in general. these countries are heavily dependent on Russian gas. they have different conditions. varying approaches towards dependence and security of supply. and thus give differing energy policy answers. Diversification is a means of reducing dependence and enhancing security of supply. There are many types of diversification. To understand this complexity and assess CEE countries. we have developed a scheme of different CEE diversification options for Russian gas imports. In this article. we analyse these options and achievements for one specific country. Poland. which seeks a level of diversification that would enable ending Russian gas imports. We find that since the January 2009 Russian–Ukrainian gas crisis. Poland has taken concrete action. and it has finally made huge progress in gas import source diversification. New pipeline and liquefied natural gas capacities could allow Poland to reach its goal. though the existing import portfolio still lacks a supply contract for Norwegian gas imports to be supplied through the yet-to-be-built Danish–Polish Baltic Pipe. Without these amounts. Russian supplies could be necessary. or at least Russian molecule supplies. In contrast. domestic gas production does not seem to provide a grounding for diversification.

It also highlights Poland’s concern over foreign technological reliance regarding renewables production. We show how the energy perspective. the institutional context. as well as perceptions regarding threat. dependence and Russia influence choices made from among different security of supply dimensions.

The latter mostly refers to trade and investment. Russian investments in Hungary. however. have attracted considerable interest on only a few occasions. Possibly the first time this happened was at the turn of the century when Gazprom was to acquire majority stakes in two Hungarian (petro) chemical plants. TVK (now Mol Petrochemicals) and BorsodChem. At the turn of the 2010s. the acquisition of shares in the Hungarian oil and gas company Mol by Surgutneftegaz. Russia’s third-largest oil producer. was deserving of serious scrutiny. And in the mid-2010s. the project for the construction of two new reactors at the Paks nuclear power plant (the Paks-2 project) is worthy of special attention. In the first two cases. Russian attempts ultimately proved to be unsuccessful. and thus became examples legitimizing fear of Russian capital. Contrary to these two.

Világgazdasági Intézet,Az oroszországi kapitalizmusnak nincsenek szilárd gyökerei. azokon az alapokon nyugszik. amelyeket a központi tervgazdaság és a szocialista társadalom alatt tettek le. Miközben a piacgazdaság alapvető intézményeit hamar megteremtették Oroszországban. a régi rendszer számos jellemzője megmaradt. A kilencvenes évek eleje óta azonban a politikai-gazdasági rendszer lényeges változásokon ment keresztül. A fő választóvonalat a Jukosz olajtársaság elleni hadjárat megindítása jelentette 2003-ban. Az állam és az üzleti élet közötti kapcsolatok érdemben változtak meg: az állam jelentősen kiterjesztette a szerepét a gazdaságban. egy etatista periódus vette kezdetét egy nagyrészt liberális orosz kapitalizmust követően.

It concludes that extant theories of international investment-with the exception of Dunning's eclectic paradigm-have limited explanatory power over activities of Russian multinationals in the V4. and can hardly even explain the existence of such firms. So the ownership advantages of Russian investors are analysed primarily with the eclectic paradigm. duly adapted to the specifics of the given group of companies.

Az első világháború előtt jelentős szerepe volt a külföldi tőkeberuházásoknak az orosz birodalomban (Nove 1972). Az 1917. októberi forradalom azonban súlyos következményekkel volt a külföldi tulajdonra. sa szovjet vezetés visszautasította a nyugati államok reparációs igényeit. Ám mivel a külföldi tőkére Szovjet-Oroszországnak szüksége volt. 1920-ban megteremtették a koncessziók jogi feltételeit. 1928-tól újabb koncessziós szerződések kötésére már nem került sor; 1929 végén pedig Sztálin bejelentette. hogy a NEP korszaka lezárult. Az utolsó koncessziós vállalatot 1944-ben (illetve más forrás szerint 1946-ban) számolták fel. A koncessziós vállalatok nem járultak hozzá mérhetően a gazdaság feltőkésítéséhez és modernizációjához. s az államháztartás szempontjából sem volt különösebb szerepük (Seres 2007).2. A külföldi tőkeberuházásokban 1987 eleje jelentett újabb fordulópontot: a gorbacsovi peresztrojka jegyében lehetővé tették a közös vállalatok alapítását a Szovjetunióban. A Szovjetunió felbomlása előtt született meg az 1990. október 26-i elnöki rendelet a külföldi tőkeberuházásokról az SzSzKSz-ben és az 1991. július 4-i törvény a külföldi tőkeberuházásokról az OSzSzSzK-ban. amely engedélyezte a százszázalékos külföldi tulajdonú társaságok létét és a profitrepatriálást (UNCTAD WIR 1991; World Bank 1992). Az orosz gazdaság nehézségei. ám a stabilizáció jelei közepette (és az 1994-es FDI-beáramlás csökkenését követően) 1995-ben megszaporodtak a közvetlen külföldi tőkeberuházások Oroszországban. Ezek a befektetések a first mover előnyökre épültek (UNCTAD WIR 1996).

Világgazdasági Intézet,A tanulmányban az alacsony szén-dioxid-kibocsátású energiaforrásokra való átmenet helyzetét és kilátásait vizsgáljuk meg a magyarországi erőművi szektorban. Megnézzük. hogy Magyarország milyen utat járt be. és az eddigi tervek. valamint eredmények mögött milyen tényezők állnak: mi gátolja vagy ösztönzi az alacsony szén-dioxid-kibocsátású energiahordozókra való áttérést. A tanulmány mindezt ellátásbiztonsági megközelítésből teszi: az energiapolitikai döntéseket az ellátásbiztonság dimenziói (elérhetőség. megfizethetőség és fenntarthatóság) közötti választásnak. vagyis a különféle dimenziók közötti rangsorolásnak tekinti. Magyarországon az alacsony szén-dioxid-kibocsátású áramszektort az atomenergia dominálja. amelynek a részesedése tovább nőhet. A megújulók nagyon kis szerepet játszanak. sa kormányzatnak nincsenek is ambiciózus törekvései ezen a téren. A Paks II.-ről szóló döntés dacára bizonytalanság van a megújulók és a földgáz jövőbeli szerepét illetően. Mindazonáltal belátható időn belül egy atom–nap/biomassza–földgáz forgatókönyv valósulhat meg a magyarországi áramtermelésben az eddigi atom–szén–zöld (–földgáz) helyett. JEL-kód: L71. L95. O13. P28.

This paper is the second of a four-part series that outlines the international expansion of Russian multinationals in five EU-member Central and East European (CEE) states. ie. the Czech Republic. Hungary. Poland. Slovakia and Slovenia. Here. the focus is on the pull factors responsible for Russian FDI inflows into these countries. as well as on the sectors in which investments are made. In doing so. the research relies on company data analysed using Dunning’s eclectic paradigm of international production and his typology of four motives behind FDI. We find that most Russian FDI has been done in hydrocarbons. iron. steel and machinery. but banking. software solutions. electronic production. real estate and even the light industry have also been targeted. Investment is dominated by market-seeking and. to a lesser extent. efficiency-seeking projects carried out by state-owned or state-related private firms.

A világ primerenergia-felhasználása az 1980–1982-es csökkenést követően 2008-ig megszakítás nélkül növekedett. A világválság alatt 2009-ben 1. 1 százalékkal mérséklődött. amely az eddigi legnagyobb 1965 óta. mióta a BP közismert éves kiadványát publikálja. Az orosz energiafelhasználás 2009-ben 6. 4 százalékkal esett. miközben a bruttó hazai termék 5. 9 százalékkal. Oroszország a világ harmadik legnagyobb energiafelhasználója. 2009-ben 5. 7 százalékos globális részesedéssel. Az oroszországi energiafelhasználás 2008-ban (a 2009-es esést megelőzően) az 1990-es szint nem egész 80 százalékát tette ki. Az üvegházhatású gázok kibocsátása terén 30 százalékkal volt az 1990-es érték alatt.1.1. 2008 volt az első év. hogy az OECD-n kívüli energiafelhasználás nagyobb volt. mint az OECD-államoké. Az IEA 2010 őszén az előzetes adatokból úgy látta. hogy 2009-ben Kína megelőzte az Egyesült Államokat az energiafelhasználásban. A BP metodológiája szerint csak a második legnagyobb energiafelhasználó volt. de beszédes. hogy 2000-ben még az Egyesült Államok energiafelhasználásának a felét érte csak el. Oroszország tudatában van annak. hogy mint vezető energiaexportőrnek reagálnia kell erre a változásra. A szénnél és különösen az olajnál fontos lépéseket tett. a gáznál azonban határozottan rosszul áll.

However in this paper very simple and low temperature fabrication methods for long nanobelts of ZnO are mentioned. Doping of Mn in ZnO has so many advantages and utilities. Mn doped ZnO have ferromagnetism even above room temperature [7] and at nano level. coercivity of Mn doped ZnO increases. Due to this Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors (DMS) are considered as ideal systems for spintronics. DMS are semiconductors in which magnetic ion replace cations of the host semiconductor. The replaced magnetic ion couple with extended electrons in the semiconductor band and this coupling results in various interesting properties like magneto-optical and magneto-electrical effects [8. 9]. DMS are very interesting materials subjected to their promising applications to spintronics (spin+ electronics). There has been much interest in magnetic semiconductors which exploit both spin and charge carrier because of combination of two degree freedom promise new functionality of memories detectors and light emitting source [9-10]. However. the luminescence intensity of the Mn doping in ZnO nanobelts quenches by several orders of magnitude [11] and hence is not employed as an efficient phosphor for light emitting applications.

College of Engineering (www.iasj.net/),An attempt was made to evaluate the PV performance of one-axis daily tracking and fixed system for Baghdad. Iraq. Two experimental simulations were conducted on a PV module for that purpose. Measurements included incident solar radiation. load voltage and load current. The first experiment was carried out for six months of winter half of year to simulate the one-axis daily tracking. The azimuth angle was due south while the tilt angle was being set to optimum according to each day of simulation. The second experiment was done at one day to simulate the PV module of fixed angles. It is found that there is a significant power gain of 29.6% for the tracking system in respect to the fixed one. The one-axis daily tracking was much more effective near winter solstice as compared to other months.

College of Engineering (www.iasj.net/),Firstly. in this study. a brief updated description and applications of different solar collectors used in renewable energy systems for supplying electric and thermal energy was presented. Secondly. an attempt was made to utilize tilting orientation of solar collector for maximizing collector energy with time in respect to horizontal orientation. For energy calculation. global solar radiation was used since they are directly related. For that purpose. field measurements of half-hourly radiation on two flat panels of tilting and horizontal orientations were carried out throughout 8-month period under local climate of Baghdad. Then. energy gain and radiation level averages were calculated based on the field radiation data using Excel programming. The tilting orientation was found to be more effective for the winter months with significant energy gains of larger than 40% and maximum gain of 58%. On the contrary. the radiation levels on collector were lower during winter months. Finally. for clear sky condition. the average solar radiations for tilting and horizontal orientations of collector were of 910 W/m 2 and 713 W/m 2 respectively.,True,SpZui7YAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,http://joe.uobaghdad.edu.iq/index.php/main/article/view/335,1662617890179190554,/scholar?cites=1662617890179190554,,,https://joe.uobaghdad.edu.iq/index.php/main/article/download/335/290,0,0,0

Abbood Al-Khazzar,158,International Journal of Computer Applications,7,20-28,FCS (www.ijcaonline.org),Design and simulation of solar energy installations need hourly data of diffuse and beam radiation components for assessing the dynamic behavior of those systems. However. the most widely available data is the global solar radiation. Whereas. diffuse and beam data are not readily affordable. Thus. numerous empirical models of correlations were developed at different sites in the world to predict the required radiation components. In the present paper. an hourly correlation expressed in a third-degree polynomial relating the diffuse fraction with the clearness index was developed based on field measurements of global and diffuse solar radiations in Baghdad city (33.33o N). Iraq. The validation and accuracy of the developed correlation was evaluated using six widely used statistical parameters. Among these parameters. the values of linear coefficient of correlation. mean percentage error and root mean square error were found to be 0.885. 6.24% and 8.0% respectively which indicates good performance. In addition. eight different empirical diffuse models for various sites were chosen from the literature for statistical comparison with the developed correlation in this study. The best model was that of South America at site latitude 23.56o S with mean percentage error 16% and root mean square error 11.5% which shows the largest agreement.

A computer program was developed for that purpose to find the daily average. monthly. seasonal and annual energy profiles based on Klein model and Erbs correlation. Using generic system of solar collector at due south. hybrid energy yields: electric. heating and cooling were obtained. As a case study. the results were presented for latitudes 30o-37o N. Optimum tilt angles were found to be within 0o to 66o which nonlinearly depends on the relevant time period of the year and atmospheric condition. Two important findings were concluded. First. optimum angles would be larger for better atmospheric conditions with greater shifts during winter period while summer months are of less sensitivity. This shift was 10o-14o for winter monthly energy. 0o-8o for summer monthly energy. 11o-13o for total annual and heating energy and 1o-3o for total cooling energy. Second. deviations in the angles of commonly used empirical formulas were noticed to be larger in summer period and higher latitudes. These deviations were in the range of-10o to+ 20o as compared to the corresponding values of present study.

Within the CE framework. anaerobic digestion (AD) represents an attractive technology. as it uses waste to produce biogas as renewable energy and stabilizes the sewage sludge for land application. In this way. this technology contributes to “closing the loop” between energy consumption. food production and the disposal of the subsequent waste. However. these potential benefits may be limited by negative impacts related to the land disposal of the stabilized sewage sludge. For example. the presence of micropollutants (MPs) in the input sludge and the inability of current AD methods to remove them are recognized potential risks for human health and for the environment.

Only indirect methods such as pH studies are carried out. The OGJ acts a valve controlling the flow of solids. liquids and gases between the oesophagus and the stomach. Manometry can determine if a sphincter is toned or relaxed; but. it cannot confirm that the sphincter region is actually open. Distension is a new technique for measuring function in the OGJ. By measuring the cross-sectional area through the narrow region in the junction during distension of a catheter mounted bag. much more information on the opening and closing patterns of the junction can be determined.

1327592,An analysis of airflow patterns in auxiliary ventilated drivages,1997,Kenneth W Moloney,,,,,,In recent years the drivage advance rates achieved within the UK coal industry have increased. In the 1980's average drivage rates were 35m per week compared to the 100/150m per week possible today. These extended rates of advance have resulted in an increase in the potential methane. dust and heat generation within the vicinity of the drivage face. In order to effectively disperse this additional pollutant load a controlled increase in air quantity is required. Although advance rates have changed. current auxiliary ventilation practice has not. UK mining law requires that the fresh air must be delivered to within 5m of the face. This has lead to the wide spread adoption of the use of overlap auxiliary systems within mechanised drivages. since a pure forcing system set at this distance from the face would lead to excessive airborne dust. UK mining law does not at present consider on-board mounted exhaust scrubber fans to constitute an effective overlap fan within mechanised drivages. Consequently an additional overlap exhaust fan is required to be installed within such drivages. In an attempt to determine whether working conditions could be safely and economically improved within mechanised rapid development drivages utilising an on-board mounted exhaust fan. a series of preliminary full scale gallery trials were conducted. A summary of the principal findings of these trials is presented together with an outline of a series of representative CFD simulations.

The disease is a problem of stomach acid flowing into the oesophagus and hence it was decided that the nature of the flow warranted research as it would likely have an effect on the development of GORD. In this paper a series of steady state CFD models of the OGJ were developed. The geometries for these models were gathered via a Functional Lumen Imaging Probe (FLIP) providing a series of crosssectional areas at intervals through the OGJ. It was assumed that the OGJ was circular. that the only phase was water and that the stomach was under a greater pressure than the oesophagus. A dynamic model was also constructed which replicated the motion of the OGJ observed using the FLIP. Volume flow data was extracted from every time step in these simulations.

In recent years. there has been a growing attention toward mitigation of partial shading effect of the PV system through using modern optimization. The field of tracking MPP of the PV system attracts huge attention from the researchers. as it is the best way to increase PV plant efficiency. Under non-uniform solar irradiance. the power against voltage characteristics of PV array have more than one MPP. This condition leads to extra complications to track MPP and decreases the efficiency of the PV system.

For the first time. four environmental factors (the accumulation of dust. water droplets. birds’ droppings. and partial shading conditions) affecting system performance are investigated. simultaneously. in one study. The results obtained from this investigation demonstrate that the accumulation of dust. shading. and bird fouling has a significant effect on PV current and voltage. and consequently. the harvested PV energy.‘Shading’had the strongest influence on the efficiency of the PV modules. It was found that increasing the area of shading on a PV module surface by a quarter. half. and three quarters resulted in a power reduction of 33.7%. 45.1%. and 92.6%. respectively. However. results pertaining to the impact of water droplets on the PV panel had an inverse effect. decreasing the temperature of the PV panel. which led to an increase in the potential difference and improved the power output by at least 5.6%. Moreover. dust accumulation reduced the power output by 8.80% and the efficiency by 11.86%. while birds fouling the PV module surface was found to reduce the PV system performance by about 7.4%.

The effect of focus distance on concentration ratio. collector width. and heat gained by the coolant fluid are investigated. All parameters of the linear Fresnel reflector solar concentrator system are determined and the effect of cooling mass flow rate and cooling inlet temperature upon the system performance is evaluated. With regards to simulation results obtained via the focus distances. the width of mirrors decreased by increasing the number of mirrors. and in turn by increasing the focus distances. this resulted in an increase in CR values.

This study was operationalized in Jordan using a life-cycle assessment (LCA) method. The environmental impact is evaluated through lifecycle emissions that include all emissions during various phases of the project. The energy performance is illustrated by the energy indicators. The latter is the energy payback ratio (EPR) and the energy payback time (EPT). This study was conducted on a 38 Vestas V112 3-MW wind turbine located in the southern region of Tafilah in Jordan that is host to the country’s first wind farm.

Under a uniform distribution of the solar irradiance. there is only one maximum power point (MPP). which easily can be efficiently determined by any traditional MPPT method. such as the incremental conductance (INC). A different situation will occur for the non-uniform distribution of solar irradiance. where more than one MPP will exist on the power versus voltage plot of the PV/thermoelectric system. The determination of the global MPP cannot be achieved by conventional methods. To deal with this issue the application of soft computing techniques based on optimization algorithms is used. However. MPPT based on optimization algorithms is very tedious and time consuming. especially under normal conditions. To solve this dilemma. this research examines a hybrid MPPT method. consisting of an incremental conductance (INC) approach and a moth-flame optimizer (MFO). referred to as (INC-MFO) procedure. to reach high adaptability at different environmental conditions. In this way. the combination of the two different algorithms facilitates the utilization of the advantages of the two methods. thereby resulting in a faster speed tracking with uniform radiation distribution and a high accuracy in the case of a non-uniform distribution. It is very important to mention that the INC method is used to track the maximum power point under normal conditions. whereas the MFO optimizer is most relevant for the global search under partial shading.

The study covers a detailed description of flat photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) and CPV/T systems using water as a cooling working fluid. numerical model analysis. and qualitative evaluation of thermal and electrical output. The aim of this study was to achieve higher efficiency of the photovoltaic (PV) system while reducing the cost of generating power.

The utilization of this technology has been impeded due to low energy conversion efficiency. This paper aims to improve the energy conversion efficiency of the thermoelectric generator (TEG) model with a novel maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique. A variable fractional order fuzzy logic controller (VFOFLC)-based MPPT technique is proposed in the present work in which the operating point of the TEG is moved quickly towards an optimal position to increase the energy harvesting. The fraction order term α. introduced in the MPPT algorithm. will expand or contract the input domain of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC to shorten the tracking time and maintain a steady-state output around the maximum power point (MPP). The performance of the proposed MPPT technique was verified with the TEG model by simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. Then. the overall performance of the VFOFLC-based MPPT technique was analyzed and compared with Perturb and observe (P&O) and incremental resistance (INR)-based MPPT techniques. The obtained results confirm that the proposed MPPT technique can improve the energy conversion efficiency of the TEG by harvesting the maximum power within a shorter time and maintaining a steady-state output when compared to other techniques.

This has generated significant interest over the last few years via research. investigation. and evaluation looking for sustainable and economical energy sources. The intended objective is to alleviate some of the exhaust gas emissions and greenhouse effects by recovering the waste heat from industrial processes. Among the heat recovery systems. ORC is found to be an efficient and practical power production thermodynamic cycle. owing to its ability to utilize low grade temperature heat sources such as solar energy. geothermal water. biomass. wasted heat and thermal ocean energy conversion. In this study. the recovery of waste heat is utilized to transfer power to the ORC through an intermediate thermal loop in the production of electricity. The WHR was obtained from exhaust flue gases of rotary kiln in a cement plant in Jordan. possessing a temperature range between 280 C–380 C; the organic liquid used in the ORC is R245fa. The effects of varying factors on the ORC’s performance were analyzed and optimized. The cycle results analysis indicate that the possible electrical power production can be estimated to be around 323.33 kWe. values of 15.86% and 193.3 kW were reached for system performance and exergy. respectively. In addition. an economic analysis performed showed that the payback time period is approximately 3.75 years and monetary net savings could reach up to 200.000 JD per annum.

1327623,Thermal performance of a linear Fresnel reflector solar concentrator PV/T energy systems,2011,Mohamed R Gomaa,,,,,,This is a report on an investigation of photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors. Solar energy conversion efficiency was increased by taking advantage of PV/T collectors and low solar concentration technologies. combined into a PV/T system operated at elevated temperature. The main novelty is the coupling of a linear Fresnel mirror reflecting concentrator with a channel PV/T collector. Concentrator PV/T collectors can function at temperatures over 100 degrees celsius. and thus thermal energy can be made to drive processes such as refrigeration. desalination and steam production.

A practical case study of waste heat recovery from cement rotary kiln is applied. Arrays of TEGs can be longitudinally erected on secondary coaxial shell separated from kiln shell via an air gap. An experimental test rig has been established to test and evaluate the performance of the TEG. Two cooling methods. active and passive. have been considered. For the active cooling method. a forced closed-loop water cooling system is considered. A forced heat sink employed with passive cooling. Two main metrics are considered in the comparison; conversion efficiency and payback time. The main findings results confirmed that the performance of forced heat sink based passive is better than closed-loop water cooling system.

The first technique is the direct active cooling with water whereas the second one is a passive cooling that uses fins mounted on the backside of the PV module. Besides. an extra PV module is employed without any cooling system as a reference margin for comparison purposes. The experimental measurements for three individuals PV modules have been collected and compared. The results indicated that the temperature of the PV module surface had been reduced using two cooling techniques compared with the non-cooling module. The maximum temperature values are 38. 55. and 58 °C for water-cooling. fins cooling. and non-cooling module. respectively.

1327627,Enhancement of a Hydrogen Engine Cavitation Utilizing Mixed Fuel: a Review and Experimental Case Study,2020,Ramadan J Mustafa and Hani A Al-Rawashdeh and Ahmad O Hasan and Mohamed R Gomaa,,,,,,Previous studies examining gasoline and hydrogen engines have typically focused on factors pertaining to air to fuel ratios. their effects on an ICE performance. combustion byproducts produced during the ignition cycle and its subsequent environmental effects. Alternatively. this study examines the ways in which a hydrogen engine cavitation can be enhanced by using a graphene coated layer on the cylinder combustion chamber walls. SEM micrographs for the coated surfaces’ microstructure showed a uniform distribution of the graphene layer that was free from cavities and demonstrating little to no observable defects. The study’s results also showed large improvements in the BTE and exhaust temperature with respect to BMEP performance. This further resulted in significantly low levels harmful gaseous emissions. with observable reductions in the emissions of CO. NOx. and hydrocarbon derived from gasoline and pure hydrogen fuel. These results are thus indicative of a significant improvement in the performance of this particular typology of engine. in contrast to other experimentation focus found in other studies.

The principal attributes for this linkage is that the IGCC system generates electricity with most of the waste streams reused in the overall process and that the primary output is a stream of pure CO 2 that may be used directly as a heat transfer fluid. This CO 2 may be used either in EGS or as a sequestration stream into a porous aquifer with additional scavenging of heat. We explore the major components of the IGCC system related to coupling with fluid circulation within a geothermal reservoir. The principal features are that combustion of coal using oxygen (rather than air) produces an output stream of H 2 O and CO that may be converted to H 2 and CO 2. The hydrogen is available for combustion or higher-value uses and the pure stream of CO 2 reduces the aquifer storage space for sequestration or may be used. as in this case. as a supply stream for EGS. In this case. thermal energy from the EGS reservoir is converted to electricity. as is the steam from the combustion of hydrogen. The IGCC system integrates the combustion of coal with generation of electricity through a steam turbine and importantly with a concentrated output stream of CO 2 alone. This may be used for direct injection of CO 2 into the subsurface-either for sequestration in a porous aquifer or to develop a low fracture porosity EGS reservoir. In this application we concentrate on the latter. identifying the principal attributes of performance of such a system.

1327642,Metal organic chemical vapor deposition of environmental barrier coatings for the inhibition of solid deposit formation from heated jet fuel,2011,Arun Ram Mohan,,,,,,Solid deposit formation from jet fuel compromises the fuel handling system of an aviation turbine engine and increases the maintenance downtime of an aircraft. The deposit formation process depends upon the composition of the fuel. the nature of metal surfaces that come in contact with the heated fuel and the operating conditions of the engine. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of substrate surfaces on the amount and nature of solid deposits in the intermediate regime where both autoxidation and pyrolysis play an important role in deposit formation. A particular focus has been directed to examining the effectiveness of barrier coatings produced by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on metal surfaces for inhibiting the solid deposit formation from jet fuel degradation. In the first part of the experimental study. a commercial Jet-A sample was stressed in a flow reactor on seven different metal surfaces: AISI316. AISI 321. AISI 304. AISI 347. Inconel 600. Inconel 718. Inconel 750X and FecrAlloy. Examination of deposits by thermal and microscopic analysis shows that the solid deposit formation is influenced by the interaction of organosulfur compounds and autoxidation products with the metal surfaces. The nature of metal sulfides was predicted by Fe-Ni-S ternary phase diagram. Thermal stressing on uncoated surfaces produced coke deposits with varying degree of structural order. They are hydrogen-rich and structurally disordered deposits. spherulitic deposits. small carbon particles with relatively ordered structures and large platelets of ordered carbon structures formed by metal catalysis.

Utilizing the heat energy from the geothermal sites for the production of electricity presents a great opportunity for the simultaneous extraction of geothermal energy and sequestration of CO 2 emitted from the fossil fuel power plants. CO 2 captured by pre-combustion method is more suitable for heat extraction compared to that captured by post combustion method as it is discharged at high pressure suitable for sequestration. Therefore. after considering air-blown combustion. oxy-combustion and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC). pairing IGCC with Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) was found to produce a symbiotic combination for the simultaneous extraction of geothermal heat energy and sequestration of CO 2. This paper models the utilization of CO 2 as a heat transfer uid for the extraction of geothermal energy and utilizing the heat for the production of electricity from the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The simulations were performed in ASPEN Plus version 7.3. The first part focused on well simulation with CO 2 as a heat transfer uid for extraction of geothermal heat energy to predict the temperature profile and pressure profile along the length of the injection well and the production well. The second part focused on the modeling of organic Rankine cycle for the generation of electricity by utilizing the pressure and geothermal heat energy of CO 2.

1327648,Toward Affordable Low-Carbon Power: Economic and Environmental Analyses of Integrating CO2-EGS With IGCC,2012,Uday Turaga and Vishakha Shembekar and Subbaraman Viswanathan and Arun Ram Mohan and Sarma Pisupati and Derek Elsworth,,,,569-573,,We are currently studying the economics of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and various factors that can reduce its Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). As part of this effort. we are exploring the potential of reducing the collective system’s LCOE by integrating EGS with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle with Carbon Capture and Sequestration (IGCC-CCS). CO2-EGS offers a number of potential benefits. For example. heat transfer and fluid dynamics simulations suggest that CO2 could be a better heat mining agent than water in EGS. Additionally lower viscosity and larger expansivity of CO2 in comparison to those of water are expected to reduce parasitic losses by increasing buoyancy forces. CO2 sequestration would be an ancillary benefit. Similarly. IGCC has a number of benefits. The chemical conversion of coal to synthetic gas is a cleaner process than coal combustion. IGCC plants operate at higher efficiencies and produce a pure stream of CO2 which can be directly used in EGS as a heat extraction fluid. Given these benefits and complementarity. we are studying the economics. environmental footprint. and operational envelope of an integrated CO2-EGS-IGCC system. This paper describes our preliminary results including estimates of LCOE. environmental footprint. and issues associated with the operating envelope.,True,UVbQEq4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1030283.pdf,,,,,http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1030283.pdf,0,0,0

These technologies are symbiotic as the effluent stream from the IGCC may be directly used within the scCO 2-EGS. The inputs to the IGCC are coal and air that is first separated into nitrogen and oxygen. The coal is gasified in the presence of oxygen alone and used to produce synthesis gas (CO) that is then water-gas shifted to produce CO 2 and H 2. Of these two products. the CO 2 is used as the heat transfer fluid within the EGS and the H 2 is combusted with air to produce water. The principal benefits of the IGCC plants are its concentrated emission of CO 2 only. a minor production of water to augment the water used in the reaction and essentially no other effluents. For a proposed plant located near Albuquerque. NM a 550 MW IGCC scales to a CO 2 output of∼ 80 kg/s as make-up fluid for the EGS. For anticipated leak-off rates of the order of 5-10%. this results in reservoir circulation rates of 1600-800 kg/s. For this particular site. with a 5 km deep injector well tapping a 200C reservoir. these circulation rates. at 100 kg/s per well. result in a thermal output of∼ 300-150 MW-thermal to augment the 550 MWe from the IGCC. This plant will save emissions of 8.200 tons of NOx. 20.000 tons of SO 2 and 4.35 million tons of CO 2 emissions each year compared to a conventional fossil fuel power plant.

1327654,Effect of fuel density on the performance of a CNG fuelled engine,2002,Mardani Ali Sera and Rosli Abu Bakar and Kwan Leong Sin,,,,,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) has been one of the most widely researched fuels proposed to replace liquid petroleum based fuels. The use of CNG fuel has proven potential to reduce emissions compared to conventionally fuelled engine. CNG has a research octane value approximately 130. which allows an engine to operate at a higher compression ratio. CNG also has an excellent lean flammability limit allowing for lean burn operation. which reduces production of carbon monoxide (CO) and oxide of nitrogen (NOx) in the exhaust and raises thermal efficiency at part load. However. the main problem to commercialise the CNG engine was the lack of engine performance.

1327675,The Effects of Turbulent Flow in CNG Engine Mixer Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,2002,Rosli Abu Bakar and Kwan Leong Sin and Mardani Ali Sera,,,,,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Increasing emphasis on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as vehicle fuels is gaining popularity nowadays. mainly because of its cleaner exhaust emissions. lower fuel cost and higher-octane content. However. the main problem facing the full implementation of CNG as vehicle fuel is its lack of engine performance. due to loses in volumetric efficiency and low flame speed. It is known that flame speed can be increased by having a turbulent effect on the air flow going into the combustion chamber of the engine. CFD investigations have been performed to study the effects of air flow in a CNG engine mixer with turbulent device. The turbulent device contained of a thin blade which is located in the mixer. The function of this plate is to create a level of turbulent effect on the air passing through it. The existing mixer developed by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia.

The possibility of renovating them is strategic to improve both the quality of life and to the possibility of economic recovery for building companies. In the last decades. the attention of the scientific community has been addressed to the energy renovation. thanks to the strong activities of the European Community in this field. However. since a relevant part of the EC territory is at risk of earthquake. the possibility to combine both energy and seismic renovation actions may be strategic for many countries. In particular. Italy and Romania are linked by a common social tradition that springs from the Roman Empire. Nowadays. this link is stronger. thanks to common interests in social. cultural and business fields. Therefore. the investigation of possible synergies for seismic and energy renovation strategies may be really interesting for both countries. In this paper. after an overview of regulations and common practices for buildings with reinforced concrete structures. in both states. some key combined renovation interventions will be described and discussed. as well as advantages and perspectives of integrated renovation approaches.

1327691,Structural and life safety alternatives in urban landscape under extreme actions in seismic zones of Romania,2008,Emil-Sever Georgescu and Mihaela Stela Georgescu and Emil Albota,,"Proc. The 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, Beijing, China",,,,The paper investigates alternatives for design and/or strengthening of buildings. for structural and life safety. under extreme loadings. starting from earthquake engineering constraints. The Romanian Earthquake Code P100-1/2006 and EC 8 relate the life safety ultimate state and life safety criteria to collapse prevention through the mean recurrence interval of the design action. The recent EN 1991-1-7: 2006 refers only to some accidental actions and internal explosions. but excludes external blasts. military actions and sabotage or tornadoes. The paper aims to cover this gap by a multi-hazard approach. with an integrated design of architectural and structural members. In Romania. many low-rise buildings are stiffer. made of masonry and concrete. while high-rise reinforced concrete structures are slender and are more vulnerable to Vrancea long-period seismic motions. The new urban landscape evolves to higher steel structures. with glass envelopes. atria. covered canopies. outside elevators. underground and overground spaces. where there is a danger of blast pressure and fire spreading on vertical and horizontal direction. Advanced earthquake resistant design is an asset but some members are sight exposed. have higher risk exposure and reduced redundancy to other extreme actions. We have studied plan and volume solutions vs. robustness and progressive collapse criteria and the use of safe rooms against risks caused by collapse or shattering and projection of debris.

Cham,In urban areas. there is a need to evaluate the dynamics and impacts of impending disasters. in order to ensure planning for resilience. emergency actions. and humanitarian support. In this respect. a Bucharest area that suffered a deep trauma in the 1980s was studied. The total or partial demolition of the old urban fabric was ordered by the authoritarian regime to build a new Civic Center. The area was declared as a protected built area in the 1990s. The inventory of the building stock was done in the framework of this project. based on data on building’s age. height. and materials.

As this is at present a protected area. there is a need for a multi-hazard threats assessment. The cultural value was assessed with scoring criteria and methods. on six scaling stages. The functional value. as well as the seismic vulnerability was evaluated. for building classes and urban plan provisions. The hazards and scenarios were for: earthquakes. floods. extreme climatic events. technological and terrorist explosions and dangerous chemical spilling. The affected area would be large and a considerable amount of property damage and affected persons would be recorded; thus. community readiness is a must. The security centre was set on special criteria to provide sheltering and living conditions for evacuated persons. being also a community disaster preparedness locus. The authors aimed at technical and institutional management tools to create an urban security zone within or closer to the community. Under a multi-hazard threat. the location and the extent of the security centre was located in the premises of a local college. for seismic or explosion hazard. and in a park or in a public place on a close hill. for flood hazard.

Step-graded and continuously-graded structures. grown on nominally (001) oriented GaAs substrates. were analyzed. Tilt was measured as a function of position in a step-graded MBL. It was found that the tilt was strongest near the edges and tended to point toward the sample center. Step-grading induced a nearly linear tilt increase with xInAs. while tilt increased slowly below xInAs~0.10 then increased more sharply with In concentration in continuously-graded samples. The tilt behavior could be described by a model in which the tilt is attributed to imbalances in dislocations that result from cross-slip within a glide length of the sample edge.

GC Mishra; Excellent Publishing House, New Delhi, India)",,,,The ever-increasing energy demand. diminishing fossil fuel reserves. global warming and other environmental as well as economical concerns necessitate alternative forms of energy that are renewable and sustainable. The oils stored in biomass are energy rich and have structures that resemble the fossil fuels and are therefore. important precursors for making biodiesel. Oils can be produced in significant amounts by some microalgae. Microalgae potentially provide several advantages ie high biomass productivity. fed on carbon dioxide and thus mitigate greenhouse gases. have ability to grow on non-agricultural land and higher efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy. The study of various biosynthetic pathways that lead to the formation and accumulation of triglycerides and understanding the mechanisms that how these pathways can be utilized for commercial production of microalgae feedstock for biodiesel production is required. Microalgae have an ability to produce substantial amount of (20-50% dry cell weight) triglycerides as storage lipids under photo-oxidative stress and other adverse environmental conditions. Efficient lipid induction techniques have been developed in microalgae such as nutrient stresses (nitrogen or phosphorus starvation). osmotic stresses. temperature. radiation. heavy metals and chemicals.

Pain is not an easy sensation which will be simply accessed and could be directly measured. To make the right diagnosis and determine the most effective treatment plan for patients presenting with pain. systematic and precise pain assessment is required. The visual changes reflected on the face of a person in pain may be apparent for only a few seconds and occur instinctively. Tracking these changes is a time-consuming and difficult process in a clinical setting. This is often why it's motivating researchers and experts from medical. psychology and computer fields to conduct inter-disciplinary research in capturing facial expressions. The facial expressions of children's (0-2 years) in pain and in non-communicative patients need to be recognized as they are of utmost importance for proper diagnosis. The direct measurement of pain is related to the computation approach whereas indirect measurement is by observers ratings. The aim of this study is to correlate the results obtained from the observer. practitioner. and machine. The results showed that the experts often underestimated pain intensity in comparison to the observer and computational approaches used.

LIDAR. and imaging. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirrors are an effective method of achieving modest speeds and angular range at low cost. Typically there are a number of tradeoffs considered when designing a tip-tilt mirror. such as tilt angle and speed. For example. many mirrors are designed to scan at their resonant frequency to achieve large angles. This is effective for a scanning mode; however. this makes the device slow and ineffective as a galvo (quasi-static).

Such an approach allows the system designer to replace expensive drive electronics such as the high precision DACs and high voltage. linear amplifiers with a simple on-off switch. The advancements in the electronics industry tend to make precise timing cheaper and faster; our approach exploits these long-term trends to create low-cost control circuits.

Galvos move optical elements such as mirrors. quasi-statically. from one static position to another. and an important figure of merit is their step-settle relaxation time. Scanners move in an oscillatory fashion. typically at the device resonant frequency. MEMS devices. which have many advantages and are often used in such optical systems. are typically high Q devices.

Silicon anodes were fabricated with the monoliths by low pressure chemical vapor infiltration of silicon. This platform allows the carbon and silicon volume fractions to be independently varied in the anode. Anodes with a low silicon content (less than 5% by volume) showed high stability in cycling against lithium with a capacity retention of 89.7% between cycles 2 and 185.

Many techniques require resists and are limited to flat substrates that are chemically compatible with the resist and liftoff solvents. Furthermore. improved resolution is typically accompanied by decreased throughput. We present a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based. resist-free nanofabrication method for fabricating metamaterials on arbitrary substrates. The MEMS consists of a moveable stencil. which can be actuated with nanometer precision using electrostatic comb drive actuators.

Recent work has demonstrated that electroplating an interconnected carbon nanotube structure is possible through direct electrical contact to the CNT structure. However. this is not ideal as in many MEMS designs. features need to be both electrically and mechanically isolated from each other. Our current efforts have been directed toward electroplating CNT patterns through indirect electrical contact. Where indirect contact means electrical contacting to the CNT's through a patterned metallic lead that sits between the substrate and the grown CNT forests.

In addition. a cost benefit analysis is performed and a CHP-DH emission abatement cost is derived. To obtain realistic values of the emission reductions resulting from CHP-DH. an integrated dynamic analysis based on the unit commitment problem is implemented to take into account the interactions of the CHP unit with the electricity production park. Furthermore. different scenarios are created to analyze different CHP-DH configurations. The results show that emission savings of 115-120 ton/GWhth can be achieved if large CHP-CCGTs power the heating network.

In this study we developed a new configuration of an MDC called a microbial electrodeionization cell (MEDIC) stack using an MDC packed with ion-exchange resins (IERs) to enhance water desalination. Two different volumes (1.5 mL and 2.5 mL) of IERs were tested and compared to a control MDC without resins. The MEDIC reactor with 2.5 mL IER improved desalination performance by~ 40% using a relatively low-concentration salt solution and produced better quality water than the control MDC. due to the decrease in ohmic resistance by almost 28 Ω and improved cell conductivity. With 2.5 mL of IERs. power density increased by 70% from 0.38 (control MDC) to 0.65 W/m2. These results demonstrated that substantially improved performance can be achieved with an MEDIC reactor compared to conventional MDCs due to the use of IERs.,True,HLbLGzgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noura_Shehab/publication/257943930_Microbial_Electrodeionization_Cell_Stack_for_Sustainable_Desalination_Wastewater_Treatment_and_Energy_Recovery/links/0c9605266a3ca8fc4b000000.pdf,13356924986331272157,/scholar?cites=13356924986331272157,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noura_Shehab/publication/257943930_Microbial_Electrodeionization_Cell_Stack_for_Sustainable_Desalination_Wastewater_Treatment_and_Energy_Recovery/links/0c9605266a3ca8fc4b000000.pdf,0,0,0

As in a developing country context political considerations make tariff levels more important than supply security. satisfying the earmarked level of demand takes a back seat. Retail market regulators are often forced by politicians to keep the retail tariff at suboptimal level. This imposes budget constraint on distribution companies to procure electricity that it requires to meet the earmarked level of demand. This is the way demand response is introduced in the system and has its impact on spot market prices. We model such a situation of not being able to serve the earmarked demand as disutility to the regulator which has to be minimised and we compute associated equilibrium.

A very high incidence of poverty and low human development achievement are its hallmarks. However. recent trends show that Bihar’s economy is showing signs of improvement. The electricity sector has also seen significant progress since 2005. and more so after 2012. Since mass protests against the dismal performance of power delivery in the state in 2011. the government has been pumping huge sums of money into increasing the supply of and access to electricity.This paper shows that the electricity sector’s performance is intimately linked to political context of the state. During the Lalu Yadav/Rabri Devi regime from 1990 to 2005. which was mainly supported by lower castes and Muslims. the economy stagnated and so did the electricity sector. This was a direct result of Yadav’s hostile attitude towards the bureaucracy and corporate sector. In his view. the uppercaste-dominated bureaucracy was the main reason for the continued impoverishment of the lower castes. After 2005. Nitish Kumar’s government. which came into being thanks to an alliance between upper castes and some lower castes that did not benefit much under Yadav’s regime. began to seriously explore bureaucratic solutions to improving various public services. such as education. roads. and electricity. The political and social empowerment of lower castes during Yadav’s rule has since made it difficult for any Bihar government to survive without addressing basic needs of the population at large. This is a clear deviation from previous governments. which remained immune to addressing people’s needs and which allowed most resources …,True,Sf9DyUUAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC,1,https://www.raponline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rap-india-mappingpower-bihar-2017-may.pdf,8496598278583587234,/scholar?cites=8496598278583587234,,,https://www.raponline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rap-india-mappingpower-bihar-2017-may.pdf,0,0,0

However. it is widely recognized that significant differences do arise in the way policies get implemented in different regions. This chapter underscores the importance of the regional political context in explaining the much-delayed reforms that took place in the electricity sector of Bihar. The performance of the electricity sector is essentially embedded in three major epochs in the political history of Bihar in which a fifteen-year period of a particular political party figures centrally. The state was delayed in reforming the sector due to their approach of ‘state incapacity by design’which was deeply rooted in a larger sociopolitical institution called caste that is dominant in Bihar. Eventually.

Evidence from the most recent (68th) round of the National Sample Survey (NSS). released in 2014. however. indicates increases in calorie intake. notably among poorer income quintiles. This paper argues that the turnaround in these data is linked to the improved performance of pro-poor social protection measures. Analysis of data suggests a close association between states that have made the greatest improvements in social policy delivery systems. and increased calorie intake for the poorest quintile of rural populations.

1327854,Valuing flexibility of DG investments in transmission expansion planning,2007,Paul Vasquez and Fernando Olsina,,,,695-700,IEEE,Planning for efficient and well-timed investments in electric transmission systems. whereas properly managing the huge uncertainties involved. is currently a subject of considerable research interest. Retaining strategic flexibility in order to make fast and economic contingent decisions upon unexpected scenarios is a sound strategy for dealing with uncertainty within the transmission expansion problem. In this sense. distributed generation (DG) seems an effective way for adding flexibility to transmission expansion plans. In this article. a new expansion planning approach that properly assesses the option value of deferring expansion investments while flexibility is gained by investing in DG is proposed. In a numerical example. the economic value of the flexibility provided by different real options is compared against economies of scale of a larger. though more irreversible. transmission project obtained by classical …,True,w0myIB8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,43,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4538400/,11791298610969603742,/scholar?cites=11791298610969603742,,,,0,0,0

This value depends on variables that are not easily observable; for this reason. the calculation of these costs strictly require the application of methodologies mainly built on proxy estimations with which the economic and the social impact can be reasonably inferred. when segments of users face an outage or interruption of public electric supply service. This impact. expressed in monetary terms. is known as the Cost of Energy Not Supplied (CENS).

This fact is evidenced since planners frequently should make adjustments or additional contingent investments in order to mitigate the negative economic consequences that unexpected events have lead. The key concept of this proposal lies on considering available choices for reacting upon the diverse scenarios which could take place along the planning horizon. Under this perspective. planning for contingencies as well as incorporating technical and managerial embedded options (available in an investment project) must be properly accounted for along the planning process.

The methodology starts by optimally locating and sizing medium voltage/low voltage transformers then finding the optimal path for secondary circuits. The optimal number of transformers and their location are determined by k-means clustering algorithm. and validated using Davies-Bouldin index. In addition. the obtained centroids represent the load centers where transformers should be located. Once the transformers are located. the Dijsktra's algorithm. for shortest path problem. is used to find the optimal number and path of transformer's secondary circuits. This algorithm helps finding the minimum distance from transformers to consumers. Moreover. as a part of the database. electric poles are considered to find the path of secondary circuits.

Most Latin American counties have great potential for renewable energies. such as wind power. solar power. and hydroelectric power. For instance. Ecuador has had a huge investment in hydroelectric energy that are economically factual and eco-friendly. For this reason. the government implemented a programme targeting to improve migration from Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) to electricity for cooking and water heating because LPG has subsidy for residential customers. and it is not produced into the country.

Considering the importance of this issue. many experimental and numerical attempts have been made to estimate the performance of this tool regarding the resulting pressure drop and the separation efficiency (particles separation limit diameter). Most of the numerical studies for simulating the fluid flow pattern inside Hydrocyclones have been conducted using the ‘’Fluent’’ commercial software. The other alternative for this evaluation is the application of CFD in COMSOL Multiphysics. This work is mainly focused on studying the effect of entering tangent velocity and also determining the flow pattern by CFD simulation in the powerful COMSOL Multiphysics software. Thereafter. correlations proposed by a number of authors are compared with experimental data to evaluate their performances. Among them. the correlations suggested by Barth and Koch-Lich showed acceptable accordance with reference data and thus were chosen for sensitivity analysis. Based on the results. three geometrical parameters of the hydrocyclone body have considerable effects on the separation efficiency. The findings revealed that decreasing the outlet diameter and the inlet width result in increasing the efficiency of hydrocyclone while enlarging the body diameter has negative effects on it.

Several analytical and semi-analytical models have been theorized. yet the process needs more studies to be conducted to improve quick production rate predictions. Following the exponential geometry theory developed for finding the oil production rate. an upgraded predictive model is presented in this study.

By manipulating the basic equations. the required formulas for estimating the oil drainage rate. location of interface. heat penetration depth of steam ahead of the interface. and the steam required for the operation are obtained theoretically. The output of the proposed theory. afterwards. is validated with experimental data. and then finalized with data from the real SAGD process in phase B of the underground test facility (UTF) project.

Polish Academy of Science,Hydrogen is a nonpolluting and renewable fuel especially when it is used in fuel cells and it does not occur substantially in elemental form in nature. hence it has to be produced from various sources like water. fossil fuels. biomass and hydrogen sulfide (H2S); a waste gas is another potential source. There are diverse technologies upon hydrogen production. One of those is based on hydrocarbon reforming which includes natural gas. gasoline. diesel fuel. methanol. ethanol [1 3]. The preferred methods in converting hydrocarbons into hydrogen rich synthesis gas are steam reforming. catalytic partial oxidation and autothermal reforming [2]. Carrying out the mentioned reactions under mild conditions (lower temperature and pressure) requires convenient catalysts. The most widely used industrial catalyst is based on Ni. Although Ni is inexpensive with respect to noble metals and offers high activity in reforming reactions. there may be a risk for deactivation through carbon deposition on catalyst surfaces [4 6]. There are several studies concerning elimination of carbon formation during reforming reactions of hydrocarbons and increasing the activity and stability of these catalysts by using different oxide supports. promoters and secondary metal addition. Using CeO2 as a promoter or support inhibits carbon formation owing to its ability to act as an oxygen buffer by storing/releasing oxygen due to the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple [4. 7 13].Another factor influencing the reaction yield is the reactor type choice. Packed bed reactors are used in most industrial processes. however this type of reactors poses challenges in terms of sintering. pressure drop. and …,True,SrZ8JPssa3EC:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/125/a125z2p036.pdf,,,,,http://przyrbwn.icm.edu.pl/APP/PDF/125/a125z2p036.pdf,0,0,0

Many cities have started to define future strategies and plans to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Urban energy scenarios involve the consideration of a wide range of conflicting criteria. both socio-economic and environmental ones. Moreover. decision-makers (DMs) require proper tools that can support their choices in a context of multiple stakeholders and a long-term perspective. In this context. Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems (MC-SDSS) are often used in order to define and analyze urban scenarios since they support the comparison of different solutions. based on a combination of multiple factors. The main problem. in relation to urban energy retrofitting scenarios. is the lack of appropriate knowledge and evaluation criteria. The latter are crucial for delivering and assessing urban energy scenarios through a MC-SDSS tool. The main goal of this paper is to analyze and test two different methods for the definition and ranking of the evaluation criteria. More specifically. the paper presents an on-going research study related to the development of a MC-SDSS tool able to identify and evaluate alternative energy urban scenarios in a long-term period perspective.

It uses IMACLIM-R. an E3 (Environment–Energy–Economy) model allowing for the integration of urban forms. transport dynamics. environmental policies and behaviors. Building upon the study of a set of local low carbon experiments throughout the European Union (EU). the paper explores two contrasted stylized scenarios of the low carbon transition in Europe. It highlights that carbon pricing policies are useful guides for transition but cannot achieve the ambitious objective without significant transition costs. It shows that low carbon experiments in the transport and energy sectors are critical dimensions of complementary measures in favor of green infrastructures. Broadening and upscaling low carbon experiments helps overcome the inertias of the transport sector by fostering radical changes in infrastructures. thereby introducing deep transformations in mobility behavior. This can then generate positive macroeconomic outcomes. even though they are also dependent on specific financial support. calling for a renegotiation of the social contract based on specific fiscal reforms and measures to secure funding for these initiatives. The paper concludes with some research avenues for improving this preliminary work and calls for a better understanding of the complexity of the socio-economic patterns of both the transition and the conditions for an effective implementation.

Nevertheless. solar collectors are often installed as part of more complex Domestic Hot Water system (DHW). The aim of this work is to describe a methodology adopted for the experimental efficiency evaluation of Solar Collector systems for DHW production (SCDHW). In situ measurements of solar collector DHW system performance. including DHW storage and back-up heating system. have been compared with results from simulations performed using widely spread commercial software and f- chart method. In this paper ten SCDHW systems were analyzed. e. In situ measurements was carried out for at least 20 days for each plant. with sampling rate of ten minutes using ultra sound flow meter. and temperature probes. Almost all the plants had a previously installed heating power logger. Results show that generally the solar collector's area was exceeding actual DHW needing. resulting in measured lower efficiency (around 30%) than calculate by commercial software. Discrepancies between the measured and simulated data are probably due to unpredictable control system and end users behavior.,True,WxHjr_oAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,2,https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/handle/11336/92739,9386364423999405523,/scholar?cites=9386364423999405523,,,https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/bitstream/handle/11336/92739/CONICET_Digital_Nro.4d51a1c9-930a-43b9-a886-464e587e61ff_A.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

I processi di combustione. infatti. sono anche responsabili dell'immissione in atmosfera di gas climalteranti. che come ben noto accrescono l'effetto serra e dunque il pericoloso fenomeno del surriscaldamento globale.  La Comunità Europea ha messo in piedi già da tempo l'European Green Deal. un accordo che mira a portare l'Unione Europea ad essere il primo continente al mondo ad impatto climatico neutro entro il 2050.

Il sistema energetico mondiale al giorno d’oggi è basato principalmente su combustibili fossili. il cui utilizzo comporta la massiccia emissione di gas inquinanti. che sono assai dannosi per l’ambiente. Il risparmio energetico e la riduzione degli sprechi sono fondamentali per poter muoversi verso un modello energetico in cui le fonti di energia “pulite” siano dominanti. La gestione corretta e razionale dell’energia porta ad un significativo risparmio energetico e alla riduzione dell’impatto ambientale di cui i processi umani sono responsabili.  In questo lavoro si tratta il tema dell’energia in ambito industriale. focalizzandosi sulla diagnosi energetica e mostrando come essa sia un valido strumento di analisi per individuare gli sprechi energetici e la cattiva gestione dell’energia nei processi industriali. Il rispetto della normativa. tuttavia. non sempre è in linea con le esigenze di produzione. a causa delle difficoltà che si incontrano nell'installazione di un sistema di monitoraggio fisso; per questo motivo si ricorre a campagne di misura svolte con strumenti portatili. che portano comunque a risultati significativi.

Such “peroxizymes” are potentially very attractive catalysts for a broad range of oxidation reactions. Most peroxizymes. however. are inactivated by an excess of H 2 O 2. The electrochemical reduction of oxygen can be used as an in situ generation method for hydrogen peroxide to drive the peroxizymes at high operational stabilities. Using conventional electrode materials. however. also necessitates significant overpotentials. thereby reducing the energy efficiency of these systems. This study concerns a method to coat a gas‐diffusion electrode with oxidized carbon nanotubes (oCNTs). thereby greatly reducing the overpotential needed to perform an electroenzymatic halogenation reaction.

In this study. such control of BODIPY supramolecular assemblies was achieved by deliberate design and synthesis a BODIPY containing a strong halogen bond (XB) acceptor (-NO2) and donor (I.

B4 (1D tubular structure) and symmetric bifurcated motif B4-II (1D zig-zag chains structure) via NO··· I. Br XB interactions. These XB interactions promote singlet-to-triplet intersystem crossing and triplet-to-singlet reverse intersystem crossing due to delocalization of oxygen electrons partially onto the Br and I. which leads to unexpected fluorescence enhancement of B4-II.

However. it is challenging to efficiently tune the crystal packing of BODIPY derivatives because of their complex nature. In this study. such control of BODIPY supramolecular assemblies was achieved by designing a BODIPY containing a halogen bond (XB) acceptor (–NO2) and donor (I. Br) to mediate halogen bonding interactions. The mono halogenated 2 and 4 was unable to form XB. whereas 3 and 5 formed isostructural mono-coordinate motif 3. 5-I (1D tubular structure) and symmetric bifurcated motif 5-II (1D zig-zag chains structure) via NO··· I. Br XB interactions. The results show that the dispersion and electrostatic component are the major source of 3. 5-I and 5-II XB formations. The XB interaction between–NO2 and X (I. Br) promote singlet-to-triplet intersystem crossing and triplet-to-singlet reverse intersystem crossing due to delocalization of oxygen electrons partially onto the Br and I. Then this interaction leads to unexpected fluorescence enhancement of 5-II.

In this conceptualization. modernity is a product of processes which define the ‘modern period’: the expansion of capitalism. the rise of nation-states. and the development and spread of forms of rationality associated with scientific reason (Giddens 1991: 1; Rabinow 2008: 2). But these conceptions have not gone unchallenged. One particularly influential body of literature critiques the very concept of modernity as a repressive technology of differentiation involving the forced and largely fictional purification of nature from culture (ie. Latour 1993). and of Europe from its colonial others (ie. Dussel 2000; Escobar 1995; Mignolo 2011). Other perspectives critique the idea of a single modernity with discrete origins by broadening the concept’s reach to encompass and celebrate ‘alternative’modernities not beholden to a single genealogy emanating from enlightenment Europe (Gaonkar 2001; Rofel 1999; Trouillot 2002). The differences are clear: some say modernity comes unequivocally from Europe; some say we have never been modern. that modernity is a fiction imposed on the world by powerful actors seeking to dominate others; and others say that everyone is potentially modern in her own alternative way.Anthropological debates about the location. origins. and contents of modernity have been accompanied by the emergence of diverse methodological approaches. most of which emphasize the importance of contextualization.

Gilroy. as a British scholar. remains rooted in Eurocentric and Americentric views of the African Diaspora that largely disregard the significance of the African continent and do not explore the …,True,ha-KoLsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=insitu,12728821734239925735,/scholar?cites=12728821734239925735,,,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=insitu,0,0,0

Flags of Convenience: An Introduction,2020,Ryan Cecil Jobson,24,Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism,2 (62),67-77,Duke University Press,On 24 August 2019 a tropical depression formed in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 805 miles east-southeast of Barbados. Later that evening. the US National Hurricane Center in Miami upgraded the depression to a tropical storm with sustained wind speeds greater than forty miles per hour. When the storm eclipsed this crucial threshold. it received a name: Dorian. Five days later. a Hess-contracted floating production storage and offloading unit concluded a forty-two-day journey from Singapore to Guyana. As the first oil production vessel to reach Guyanese territorial waters. the Liza Destiny arrived decorated in the colors of Guyana’s Golden Arrowhead and signaled the opening act of the nascent Caribbean petrostate.

1327985,John L. Jackson. Jr.. Thin Description: Ethnography and the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem. Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press. 2013. x+ 394 pp.,,Ryan Cecil Jobson,,,,,,It is telling that Thin Description: Ethnography and the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem. a monograph that so blatantly defies ethnographic convention. opens on an airplane en route to the Holy Land. As John Jackson later details. the classical anthropological trope of the “arrival scene” is an authenticating gesture. but one that finds little purchase in social worlds that abound with digital media technologies and accompanying “field-sites…[that] come knocking at our doors or flitting across our computer screens”(2013: 48). In lieu of an arrival. the reader is made privy to a departure in a number of respects. By situating us in the cabin of a jetliner. Jackson makes clear that he has departed from the comforts of place. and along with it the comforts of an ethnographic paradigm that confers upon the anthropologist a divine right to interpretation.As Jackson delves further into the mythos and idiosyncrasies of various Hebrew Israelite communities. it becomes apparent that there is no more appropriate place to begin than the shock of in medias res. Just as an airplane is a nonplace situated betwixt disparate geographies. bureaucratic zones. and juridical authorities. the multifarious assemblages of African Hebrew Israelites are equally of this nonplace. lacking a verifiable ontology or site of originary belonging. Anthropology has long been preoccupied with the question of origins. seeking out communities of authentic natives that are subsequently captured by the ossifying gaze of ethnographic representation. In their failure to conform to these rigid expectations. African Hebrew Israelites have remained conveniently hidden from anthropological view …,True,ha-KoLsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,http://www.esureview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Thin-Description-Review_Ryan-Jobson.docx,,,,,http://www.esureview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Thin-Description-Review_Ryan-Jobson.docx,0,0,0

The performance of the system can be analyzed via applying the conservation principles of energy that is defined by the first law of thermodynamics. However. only regarding the conservation of energy is not sufficient to determine the real performance of the system. At this point. an exergy analysis is done to predict the useful part of the energy. also to provide the magnitudes and places of the irreversibilities and losses within the system. Moreover. the thermoeconomic analysis is done for providing useful information to design and operate a cost-effective system.

1328012,Rethinking economic growth theory from a biophysical perspective,2014,Blair Fix,,,,,Springer,"Neoclassical growth theory is the dominant perspective for explaining economic growth. At its core are four implicit assumptions: 1) economic output can become decoupled from energy consumption; 2) economic distribution is unrelated to growth; 3) large institutions are not important for growth; and 4) labor force structure is not important for growth. Drawing on a wide range of data from the economic history of the United States. this book tests the validity of these assumptions and finds no empirical support. Instead. connections are found between the growth in energy consumption and such disparate phenomena as economic redistribution. corporate employment concentration. and changing labor force structure. The integration of energy into an economic growth model has the potential to offer insight into the future effects of fossil fuel depletion on key macroeconomic indicators. which is already manifested in stalled or diminished growth and escalating debt in many national economies. This book argues for an alternative. biophysical perspective to the study of growth. and presents a set of"" stylized facts"" that such an approach must successfully explain.

I test the ‘dematerialization through services’ hypothesis with a focus on fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions—the primary drivers of climate change.

I hypothesize that income is most strongly determined by social power. as indicated by one’s position within an institutional hierarchy. While many theorists have proposed a connection between personal income and power. this paper is the first to quantify this relation. I propose that power can be quantified in terms of the number of subordinates below one’s position in a hierarchy. Using this definition.

But how this hierarchical structure affects income distribution has not been widely studied. To remedy this situation. this paper presents a new model of income distribution that explores the effects of social hierarchy. This ‘hierarchy model’ takes the limited available evidence on the structure of firm hierarchies and generalizes it to create a large-scale simulation of the hierarchical structure of the United States economy. Using this model. I conduct the first quantitative investigation of hierarchy’s effect on income distribution. I find that hierarchy plays a dominant role in shaping the tail of US income distribution. The model suggests that hierarchy is responsible for generating the power-law scaling of top incomes.

1328028,Capitalist income and hierarchical power: A gradient hypothesis,2018,Blair Fix,,Working Papers on Capital as Power,2018/06,1-32,,This paper offers a new approach to the study of capitalist income. Building on the ‘capital as power’ framework. I propose that capitalists earn their income not from any productive asset. but from the legal right to command a corporate hierarchy. In short. I hypothesize that capitalist income stems from hierarchical power. Based on this thinking. I hypothesize that the capitalist fraction of an individual’s income is a gradient function of hierarchical power (which I define as the number of subordinates under one’s control). Using data from US CEOs. I find evidence that this is true. Furthermore. a hierarchical model of the United States that generalizes this data accurately reproduces many aspects of the US distribution of capitalist income. including the relation between income size and capitalist income fraction.

1328029,World-Systems Analysis and Social Metabolism: Unequal Exchange as a Physical Process,2014,Blair Fix,10,,,,,A central hypothesis in dependency and world-systems theory is that there exists a single world economy characterized by an international division of labour between the Core and the Periphery (Frank & Press. 1966; Wallerstein. 2000). A vast wealth differential exists between these two polarities which. despite upward/downward trajectories of some areas. has proved to be remarkably stable over time. World-systems theory has sought to explain the persistence of this phenomenon through the concept of “surplus” transfer.The notion of surplus is central to Marxian thought. Marx characterized capitalism as a mode of production in which one class (capitalists) is able to appropriate the “surplus-value” of another class (labourers) through ownership of the means of production (Marx. 1867). In its most basic sense. this means that workers produce more than they consume. and the excess. the surplus. becomes the “property” of the capitalist. Dependency and worldsystem theorists elaborated on this notion by postulating that an international division of labour meant that core regions appropriated the surplus created in the periphery. This appropriation. which began as plunder. now predominantly takes place through market mechanisms. World-systems theorists argue that “free trade” systematically favours core regions at the expense of the periphery. allowing surplus to flow to the former through the process of “unequal exchange”(Hornborg. 2001). Most scholarship on this issue has focused on wage differentials and monetary terms of trade between the core and periphery (Amin. 1977;,True,EW_Ma3wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/11539271/Unequal%20Exchange%20Final.pdf,9126640457065393710,/scholar?cites=9126640457065393710,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/11539271/Unequal%20Exchange%20Final.pdf,0,0,0
1328030,Economic Development and the Death of the Free Market,2020,Blair Fix,,,2020/01,,Working Papers on Capital as Power,Free markets are. according to neoclassical economic theory. the most efficient way of organizing human activity. The claim is that individuals can benefit society by acting only in their self interest. In contrast. the evolutionary theory of multilevel selection proposes that groups must suppress the self interest of individuals. They often do so. the evidence suggests. by using hierarchical organization. To test these conflicting theories. I investigate how the ‘degree of hierarchy’in societies changes with industrial development. I find that as energy use increases. governments tend to get larger and the relative number of managers tends to grow. Using a numerical model. I infer from this evidence that societies tend to become more hierarchical as energy use grows. This result is inconsistent with the neoclassical theory that individual self-interest is what benefits society.

1328034,Living the Good Life in a Non-Growth World. Investigating the Role of Hierarchy,2021,Blair Fix,,,2021/02,,Working Papers on Capital as Power,Humanity's most pressing need is to learn how to live within our planet's boundaries - something that likely means doing without economic growth. How. then. can we create a non-growth society that is both just and equitable? I attempt to address this question by looking at an aspect of sustainability (and equity) that is not often discussed: the growth of hierarchy. As societies consume more energy. they tend to become more hierarchical. At the same time. the growth of hierarchy also seems to be a key driver of income/resource inequality. In this essay. I review the evidence for the joint relation between energy. hierarchy and inequality. I then speculate about what it implies for achieving a sustainable and equitable future.

1328035,How the History of Class Struggle is Written on the Stock Market,2020,Blair Fix,,Economics from the Top Down,,,,[Second of a two-paper series]   Class struggle. Bichler and Nitzan observe. is a part of all hierarchical societies. But capitalism is the first social order to quantify this struggle. It does so through prices. which Bichler and Nitzan propose indicate power. Stock prices. Bichler and Nitzan argue. indicate the power of owners to earn income. If we’re interested in class struggle. we want to compare this capitalist power to the power of workers. Here’s a simple way to do so. We compare the price of stocks to the price of wage labor. Bichler and Nitzan call this ratio the ‘power index’.  My goal here is to test Bichler and Nitzan’s thesis. Does the power index quantify US class struggle? Although a simple ratio of two prices. the power index. Bichler and Nitzan claim. tells us about class conflict at large. When the power index falls. workers are winning the struggle. When the power index rises. capitalists are winning.  Is Bichler and Nitzan’s claim true? In this post. I look at the evidence. I test how three different indicators of class struggle relate to the power index. Here’s what I find. When workers strike more. win a living minimum wage. and get government to progressively tax the rich. the stock market declines relative to wages. My conclusion is that Bichler and Nitzan are onto something. The history of class struggle does seem to be written on the stock market.  [The first paper. 'Stocks are Up. Wages are Down.

Another billion in Bezos’ coffers. Let’s put some numbers to this sound of money. Since 2017. Bezos’ net worth has grown by about $4 million per hour — roughly 500.000 times the US minimum wage. This accumulation of wealth would be absurd during normal times. Today. as many workers lose their jobs to a brutal pandemic. it’s obscene. While Bezos is the pinnacle of capitalist excess. his wealth is part of a larger story. Over the last 40 years. stock prices have surged while wages have stagnated. What does this trend mean?  In this post. I take a deep dive into the stock market. I’ll first tell you what the stock market is not. It’s not an indicator of ‘productive capacity’. Nor is it ‘fictitious capital’. So what is it? The stock market. argue Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler. is how capitalists quantify their power. To understand what Nitzan and Bichler are talking about. we’ll unmask the ritual that defines our social order — the ritual of capitalization. Read on to take the red pill and lift the veil of capitalist ideology.  [The second paper in the series.

However. computational limitations arise at larger spatial scales. and difficulties emerge in the quantification of the different urban agglomeration levels when attempting to model varying network behaviours at multiple spatial scales.

The clustering method is adjusted to account for geodependent demand data as well as typical daily load profiles.

Construction of the Trombe wall is optimized. using different types of glassing on the outside of the wall. For summer day. the glass is considered to be covered with PV stripes during the daylight in order to prevent overheating. The central concrete core of the wall is covered with a layer of dark paint. on the outside. to improve absorptivity of the wall.

Beograd,In this paper. presented is the stale-of-the-art of energy Efficiency of residential buildings in Serbia. Special attention is paid to energy efficiency in already existing buildings. The average energy consumption in residential buildings in Serbia is over 150 kWhm(-2) per year. while in developed European countries it is about 50 kWm(-2) per year. In this paper examined is the contribution of ventilation losses. through the windows of low quality. regardless whether they are poorly made. or made from bad materials. or with no adeguate glass. Besides ventilation losses. which are of major importance in our buildings. special attention is paid to transmission losses. which are conseguence of the quality and energy efficiency of the facade. All of the above statements are proved by measurements obtained on a representative building of the Block 34 in New Belgrade. built in the eighties of the last century. In addition to measurements performed the calculation of energy consumption for heating during winter has been made. The results of two different methods of calculation of energy consumption for heating are compared with the values obtained by measuring.,True,4X9d0B0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,27,http://grafar.grf.bg.ac.rs/handle/123456789/287,17079513542016542991,/scholar?cites=17079513542016542991,,,https://grafar.grf.bg.ac.rs/bitstream/handle/123456789/287/285.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The experimental investigation was performed in a real university classroom during the winter semester in city of Belgrade. Measurements were taken for four scenarios. with different indoor comfort conditions. Variations were made by setting the central heating system on/off. adding an additional heat source to provoke higher indoor temperatures. and measuring the radiant asymmetry impact. Innovative questionnaires were developed especially for the research. in order to investigate students’ subjective feelings about local thermal comfort and indoor environmental quality. Local predicted mean vote and predicted percentage dissatisfied indices were calculated using data measured in situ. The results were compared to existing models recommended in literature and European and ASHRAE standards. Student productivity was evaluated using novel tests. designed to fit the purposes of the research. Surveys were conducted for 19 days under different thermal conditions. during lectures in a real classroom. using a sample of 240 productivity test results in total. Using the measured data. new correlations between the predicted mean vote. CO2. personal factor and productivity loss were developed.

Special attention is paid to the apartments of the same type. size. geometry. orientation and position in the building and have the same installed radiator capacity. nevertheless they differ in annual energy consumption for heating. In some flats. heat consumption is above average. while there are some flats. which from year to year have heat consumption below the average values. For this reason. the simulation of heat consumption for heating is done for a base model that is calibrated according to the average measured heat consumption. using weather data for a typical meteorological year in Belgrade. Other models. including the behavior of users and maintaining different levels of thermal comfort are given concurrently with the basic model. A comparative analysis shows the differences in energy consumption for heating per year in the function of users’ behavior.

1328087,Design and implementation of an automatic irrigation system based on monitoring soil moisture,2017,Ayoade F Agbetuyi and HE Orovwode and AA Awelewa and ST Wara and Tobiloba Oyediran,,Journal of Electrical Engineering,,,,An automatic irrigation control system has been designed to facilitate the automatic supply of adequate of water from a reservoir to field or domestic crops in all agricultural seasons. One of the objectives of this work is to see how human control could be removed from irrigation and also to optimize the use of water in the process. The method employed is to continuously monitor the soil moisture level to decide whether irrigation is needed. and how much water is needed in the soil. A pumping mechanism is used to deliver the needed amount of water to the soil. The work can be grouped into four subsystems namely; power supply. sensing unit. control unit and pumping subsystems which make up the automatic irrigation control system. A moisture sensor was constructed to model the electrical resistance of the soil; a regulated 12 volts power supply unit was constructed to power the system; the control circuit was implemented using operational amplifier and timer; and the pumping subsystem consisting of a submersible low-noise micro water pump was constructed using a small dc-operated motor. System response tests were carried out to determine the time taken for the system to irrigate potted samples of different soil types having different levels of dryness. The results obtained showed that sandy soils require less water than loamy soils and clay soils require the most water for irrigation.,True,cvn5hPMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,11,http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/10162/,4999790136161344856,/scholar?cites=4999790136161344856,,,http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/10162/1/WARA%20LATEST%20doc%281%29.pdf,0,0,0

Several methods including the installation of capacitor banks are available for improving power factor in order to reduce the kilovolt ampere (kVA) demand of the load and power loss from the power supply system. However. literatures have shown that improvement of power factor has effect on switching transients which is dangerous for industrial loads and operating personnel. In this work. we investigated the effect of improving the power factor of a power system beyond 0.8 (lagging) on switching transient levels using FUMMAN industry power network as a case study. A power factor measuring tool was modelled using the mathematical relation between power factor. reactive power and active power. The modelled equations were simulated Matlab/Simulink software (Version 7.9.0.529 ‘R2009b’). The characteristics of the system under study namely root mean square (r.m.s) voltage. peak steady state voltage. peak transient voltage and kVA demand were measured during the simulation with and without parallel connection of capacitor bank across the system. The result from the analysis showed that FUMMAN industry power network was operating at a lagging power factor of 0.8 with r.m.s voltage of 412.1 V. peak steady state voltage of 582.8 V. peak transient voltage of 701.9 V and kVA demand of 1878 kVA without the capacitor bank.

Climate risks are multi-dimensional. covering a range of geophysical. social. and economic issues. The intensification of these risks and the degree to which they are accurately priced by financial markets are of increasing concern to global economic stability. Integrating climate risks into financial decision-making is crucial to long-term economic and financial stability as these risks affect return on investment. Broader recognition of these risks will be necessary for sustainable development. For every USD 10 paid in interest by developing countries. an additional dollar will be spent due to climate vulnerability. This financial burden exacerbates the present-day economic challenges of poorer countries. The magnitude of this burden will at least double over the next decade. The climate consequences on poorer countries’ cost of capital and overall fiscal health need to be addressed. A range of existing policy and market responses can build climate resilience in vulnerable countries and deliver demonstrable financial benefits. Investments that enhance the resilience of climate vulnerable countries are crucial to not only helping vulnerable countries deal with the consequences of climate risks. but also bring down their cost of borrowing.,True,UfHYcJIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,17,http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/26038/,17210334970758509462,/scholar?cites=17210334970758509462,,,https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/26038/1/ClimateCostofCapital_FullReport_Final.pdf,0,0,0

1328116,The High Cost of Electricity Price Uncertainty,2020,Anastasiya Ostrovnaya and Iain Staffell and Charles Donovan and Robert Gross,,Available at SSRN,,,,The rapid worldwide growth of renewable energy has been largely underpinned by government support over the past decade. The need for subsidy is fading as the cost of electricity from renewables converges with that from fossil fuels. but the withdrawal of support schemes will also remove the revenue stability offered by auction schemes and contracts for differences. Exposure to market risk (fluctuating wholesale electricity prices) raises the cost of capital for merchant renewable generators. Here we quantify the extent to which increased volatility in future power prices affects revenues by combining electricity market and stochastic discounted cash flow models. Renewable projects relying purely on merchant pricing may see cost of capital rise by two percentage points (eg from 7% to 9%). Unless new private or government actors provide hedging solutions. fewer developers will undertake new renewable energy projects. slowing the energy transition and increasing its cost to society.,True,UfHYcJIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3588288,5519837349745920336,/scholar?cites=5519837349745920336,,,,0,0,0

A study was carried out to assess the feasibility of installing solar photovoltaic (PV) modules atop train coaches. Most long-distance trains having LHB coaches do not have self-generating systems. thus making power cars mandatory to supply the required power for lighting loads. Feasibility of supplementing diesel generator sets with power from solar PV modules installed on coach rooftops has been reported in this communication.

This work has shown that the area available on coach rooftops is more than sufficient to generate the required power. during sunlight hours. for the electrical loads of a non-A/C coach even during winter. All calculations were done keeping a standard route as the reference. Taking the cost of diesel to be Rs 66/litre. it was estimated that there will be annual savings of Rs 5.900.000 corresponding to 90.800 litres diesel per rake per year by implementing this scheme.

Adaptive capacity is an element of resilience and is defined in the paper. There is currently no indicator of adaptive capacity of individuals in small geographies sensitive to a variety of policy measures. such as those affecting fitness. obesity. bicycle availability and bicycle infrastructure. whose impacts (at least in the short term) are on a smaller scale than large-scale land use and urban morphology change. We propose a conceptual approach for designing a method to quantify this indicator. The indicator shows the proportion of the population of areas who would have the capacity to commute to work principally by bicycle or walking following the shock. It assesses capacity grounded in current data and avoids as far as possible the need for speculation about the future. We believe this makes progress towards producing a good indicator with relatively un-controversial. transparent simplifying assumptions.

We test the hybrid technique on a UK example estimating the capability of individuals to make journeys by walking and cycling. in order to produce a novel indicator of resilience to the disruption of fuel availability.

1328144,Improving estimates of capacity of populations to make journeys by walking and cycling: An individual modelling process applied to whole populations using spatial microsimulation,2015,I Philips and David Watling and Paul Timms,,University Transport Studies Group. City University London,,,,A novel approach to estimating a population‟ s capacity to travel by walking and cycling (also referred to as active modes) is presented. Estimating capacity to walk and cycle is distinct from predicting future walking and cycling behaviour based upon current behaviour. Capacity is useful in developing anticipatory policy responses to transport scenarios which are not based on current trends or are attempting to encourage transformational policies. We identify several possible application areas for this method (an indicator of resilience to permanent reduction in fuel supply; assessing walking and cycling as a strategy to adapt to short term fuel disruptions; improvement of walking cycling targets; better estimation of the service area of public transport stops; integration into accessibility measures and better understanding transport based social exclusion). Current estimations of capacity to walk and cycle applied by practitioners are poor: Frequently a simple distance buffer is applied. or the whole population‟ s capacity to travel is estimated based on the current behaviour of a small sample of existing cyclists. Factors such as the variation in physical capability between individuals and topography are ignored. The improved model we describe incorporates an estimate of the maximum distance that could physically be travelled by an individual given a time budget. given their physical health. age characteristics. topography. headwinds. constraints on travel such as bike availability and the need to incorporate escort trips on the way to activities.

Because of this. it is possible that there will be a severe and long lasting reduction in the fuel available for motorised transport which could manifest itself suddenly as a fuel shock.  This thesis is concerned with the conceptual design. methodological development and application of a new spatially explicit transport policy indicator which estimates:  Who could get to work tomorrow by walking and cycling if there was a fuel shock today? This thesis estimates the potential that walking and cycling have to increase resilience to fuel shocks in the period immediately after the fuel shock.   A conceptual model of resilience to fuel shocks by individuals was devised.  A novel hybrid static spatial microsimulation technique was developed.  It was used to generate a population of individuals with the appropriate attributes to estimate for large populations the capacity to make journeys using only walking and cycling.  This modelling process is generic and can be used to generate indicator results wherever suitable data exist.  Using a simple scenario of a fuel shock which occurs today. current data could be used to estimate the indicator.  A case study using the census data covering England. the Health Survey For England and other data sets was produced.   Validation of the modelling process informs the analysis of the results.   The results demonstrate the ability of the indicator to show variation between areas. in both a base case and when specific policy measures are applied.

Understanding the factors driving this process is therefore important for sustainable transport policy. with implications for how governments steer their national car fleets towards ultra-low emission vehicles in the future. At a general level. this paper contributes to this wider body of work which aims to understand the factors which led to the transition from petrol to diesel. Specifically. the paper investigates whether the availability of relatively cheap diesel fuel in the Republic of Ireland affected the rate of diesel car ownership in Northern Ireland. A geographic approach is used. which involves generating spatial variables measuring nearness to the Republic of Ireland and comparing these with the proportion of the local car stock that is fuelled by diesel.

This information has been comprehensively recorded on a centralised computer system since 2006. and was first made publicly available in 2010. A major research project. running from 2012-2016. has been undertaken to understand the potential of this data to explore a range of issues. including vehicle ownership and use. vehicle-related energy use and vehicle-related emissions that affect air quality impacts and climate change. As part of this work. the project team has also had confidential access to information about vehicle location. enabling relatively fine-scale geographical analysis. This paper focuses on one aspect of the project. namely the insights generated on vehicle mileages. As well as briefly explaining the techniques used to convert the randomly timed odometer readings into a set of usable mileage information. the paper demonstrates: 1) At both large and small geographical scales. the distribution of private car mileages follows a reasonably similar pattern. with the best fit probably being a gamma distribution. One implication is that mean mileages are a relatively meaningful way of comparing areas. although examination of the distributions also shows that other distributional properties vary by a greater amount. and may also be helpful for differentiating areas that mean mileages would otherwise suggest were similar; 2) Looking at the variation in both mileages and vehicle characteristics between areas. there is considerably greater differences in the average amount that people drive …,True,Ho9lLcgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,https://trid.trb.org/view/1441061,8719480665261067047,/scholar?cites=8719480665261067047,,,,0,0,0

Whilst decarbonisation technology. and smart systems can contribute to the solution. critical examination of the capability to reduce travel demand is also essential. Emerging research in transport carbon reduction argues for deriving regional level transport carbon budgets from the best available climate models. For these budgets be translated into targets and action. there need to be indicators of local level demand and carbon emissions which can then be used to determine the level of demand reduction needed. Whilst it is common to produce trip end models or synthetic populations for transport models. these estimates of demand usually are used merely as an input to a network model. Demand estimates are not questioned in terms of whether there is capability to reduce demand or whether a reduction in that demand would create vulnerability to social exclusion or whether reduction in demand would curb ‘excess travel’. Small area indicators of demand by purpose. visualised in a way which is easy for non-technical policy makers to understand the (rather than being hidden as matrices deep inside a model) provide useful insights. Furthermore. it is possible using geo-demographic data and approaches from quantitative social science to contextualise demand in a way which gives indicators of the impact of demand reduction in terms of CO₂ savings. vulnerability and curbing excess.

Our indicator identifies the number of people in each area who have some potential for mode shift from walking. cycling. public transport or car commuting to an all-inclusive taxi service within a MaaS package. We find the method quick and straightforward. In our case study. potential to shift from walk to an all-inclusive taxi service within a MaaS package is almost double the potential shift away from car. which represents a risk of increased car use.1. research questions and hypothesesDefinitions of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) are varied but include the notion that it provides subscribers with the ability to use a number of modes. including taxi services. within the MaaS package (Mulley 2017). Docherty. Marsden. & Anable (2018); Lyons (2018); Pangbourne et al.(2019); and Polis (2017) hypothesize potential for both positive and negative effects of smart mobility services such as MaaS. and uneven spatial distribution of effects of its component parts. such as an all-inclusive taxi service within a MaaS package. If the mode shift from car driving to an all-inclusive taxi service within a MaaS package occurs. this might be environmentally beneficial. but only if the vehicle fleet becomes smaller and reduces emissions (eg Becker. et al.. 2019). If mode shift to taxi from walking. cycling. or public transport occurs. this may have negative consequences (eg. increased energy use. air quality impacts. and reduced physical exercise).,True,Ho9lLcgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4073/8b86962d92223d13949d1eea1fdd7dacac6d.pdf,,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4073/8b86962d92223d13949d1eea1fdd7dacac6d.pdf,0,0,0

Mode shift from car use to walking. cycling and e-bike use is one of many possible solutions. addressing for some locations the multiple negative impacts of car use including reduction in transport energy demand. Walking is the most sustainable and equitable travel mode. Cycle use is also sustainable and may be provided equitably. E-Bikes are a smart technology often overlooked due to the hype around e-cars. and are potentially a sustainable and more equitable means of reducing transport energy demand.    Some useful work has investigated the potential for emissions reduction by mode shift though a number research opportunities remain. Until recently information at fine spatial scales was not available on either total car use nor the distance individuals in these same small areas were capable of travelling by walking. cycling and e-bike use.    This paper brings these two data sets together. This allows production of novel spatial indicators.    – Firstly. an estimate of the potential car travel distance which may be transferred to walking. cycling and e-bike use.    – Secondly. indicators of the energy reduction potential of transfer of distance travelled from car to walking. cycling and e-bike use are produced and described.

1328154,A spatial microsimulation approach to modelling capacity for active travel in Scotland,2019,M Pearce and G Macklon and M Dallas and I Philips,,,,,Leeds,This paper sets out the steps we have taken in first simulating a spatial dataset and then developing a model to estimate the capacity of people to travel actively in different areas of Scotland. This model takes into account relevant characteristics of the population including age. gender and health.  Spatial microsimulation is a well-established technique that estimates what individuals are like in an area. based on aggregate statistics. Our approach is based on similar recent work conducted on English data. In Scotland our source of health data was the 2016 Scottish Health Survey and our spatial data source was the 2011 census which provides data at output level (geographical areas of around 125 households).  We identified attributes that are required to model an individual’s capacity to travel actively and which are collected for the Scottish Health Survey. such as age. gender. whether the individual had a long-term limiting illness and whether he or she was economically active. The spatial microsimulation approach then allows us to combine these attributes with the spatial data to estimate the number of individuals in each category in each output area.  Our approach also incorporates data from the 2016 Scottish Household Survey to help simulate which individuals in our local populations have access to a bicycle – a critical factor in their ability to travel actively.   Using the simulated population. our model calculates a maximum cycling and walking distance for each individual based on a number of factors: an estimate of their VO2max (the maximum amount of oxygen that an individual can make use of during exercise) which. when combined with …,True,Ho9lLcgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147450/,,,,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147450/,0,0,0

University of Leeds,The aim of this report is to provide a social assessment of the impacts of Section 3 of the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road: Brynmawr to Tredegar. using a mixed methods approach which adapts and builds on the UK WebTAG appraisal guidance units 4.1 and 4.2. We define social assessment in this document as a study of the social and distributional impacts which estimate the impacts of the implemented scheme at the point of opening rather than a detailed ex-ante appraisal. In the absence of detailed ex-ante appraisal. this report sets a baseline from which future evaluation may be conducted. This is the first application of a new mixed methods approach to social assessment of the impacts of transport infrastructure investment in the UK. It was commissioned by the Welsh Government in specific recognition of the need for improved guidance in this area of project delivery. The results reported here. along with its accompanying annexes. also contribute to greater understanding of social and distributional impacts. which builds upon and extends the current quantitative approach in WelTAG / WebTAG.

The transition process has been accompanied by major disruption of much existing production. and by large changes in living standards and income distribution. After experiencing deep post-communist recessions. almost the whole region is now growing quite rapidly. But measuring these large and rapid changes is difficult and uncertain due to poor data quality. frequent changes in statistical methodology. and other problems. This paper develops a framework for building a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Kazakhstan based on the UN 1993 System of National Accounts and Input-Output tables. A highly aggregated macro-SAM is constructed first. mostly using National Accounts data. At the second stage. a disaggregated micro-SAM is built using macro-SAM aggregates and Input-Output tables. To reconcile the Input-Output tables with the National Accounts. we use cross entropy and least squares methods of adjustment. This procedure also allows us to eliminate various inconsistencies in the final SAM. Third. using household survey data. we introduce several household types into the model (essentially. cohorts defined according to their income levels) to enable us to study income distribution and trends in it during Kazakhstan’s transition.

This industry is analyzed in a broader context with the help of the economy-wide modeling tools such as Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) and Input-Output models. Such approach allows taking into account all possible linkages the oil and gas industry has with the rest of the economy.

The thesis proceeds with a description of building a CGE model for Kazakhstan and construction of the SAM. Subsequently. using the above mentioned tools Chapter Four analyses a spillover impact of the oil and gas sector on the rest of the economy. The study establishes that the sector accounted directly and indirectly for about forty percent of economic growth between 2001 and 2005.

Second. religious activity. as measured by giving per member. church income and participation. will not decrease as market competitiveness (or complexity) increases. Empirical evidence lends support to the first hypothesis. but casts doubt on the second. and the supply-side theories underpinning it. which posit a causal link between increased competitiveness (complexity) and higher levels of religious activity.

STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITY,,Robert I Mochrie and John W Sawkins and Alexander Naumov,,,,,,In May 1843. a large group of ministers resigned from the Church of Scotland in protest against the British government’s assertion that the civil courts’ jurisdiction was supreme in matters of church governance. This event. commonly known as the ‘Disruption’. represented the culmination of a decade-long debate both within the established Scottish church and between the church and the British government. over the issue of patronage. ie the right of local patrons (often leading landowners) to determine the choice of parish minister 2.Those quitting the Church of Scotland. approximately one third of all ministers and half of the Church of Scotland’s membership. went on to establish the Free Church of Scotland. For the next forty years there was intense interdenominational rivalry between the Church of Scotland. the Free Church and another large dissenting body. the United Presbyterian Church (formed in 1847 from groups that had seceded in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries from the Church of Scotland). Increased voluntary giving to the rivalrous denominations funded efforts to evangelise the Scottish population. Large scale competitive church building programmes. especially in the rural areas and small towns that are the focus of this study. underlined the determination of the new denominations to consolidate their positions in the religious market 3.,True,u0MWtdYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.578.4138&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.578.4138&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Since the Prandtl number for argon gas is less than that for the air. the thermal performance of the CSWH increases. The experiments are conducted for mass flow rates of 2.5. 3. 3.5 and 4 kg/h. The results show that an increase in the flow rate leads to a decrease in the temperature difference the of water between the inlet and outlet of the coil due to reduction of the residence time of the fluid. The energy efficiency of the collector reaches its maximum at the mass flow rate until 3.5 kg/h. and then reduces at higher values of mass flow rate because the water temperature difference decreases dramatically.

Since these backup solutions are expensive and inefficient. they form a significant proportion of the operating expenses. To address this problem. we propose using a personal comfort system (an illustrative configuration can comprise a LED light and a DC desk fan) that is powered by batteries in computing devices. With this approach. cost savings are realized through two mechanisms. (i) by reducing the dependence on high-power lighting and air conditioning during times of power outage. and (ii) by charging the batteries at optimal times. taking advantage of the variable cost of power supply. Simulations show that the expected energy savings from this methodology are in the region of 26%. compared with the …,True,m9xWDmQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7007639/,6479035451158645191,/scholar?cites=6479035451158645191,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harshad_Khadilkar/publication/282951384_DC_Picogrids_as_Power_Backups_for_Office_Buildings/links/5678f71008ae125516efa770/DC-Picogrids-as-Power-Backups-for-Office-Buildings.pdf,0,0,0

This paper assesses the economic feasibility of producing hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) using waste vegetable oils as feedstock. The supply of hydrogen for the upgrading of the oil is obtained through a high-temperature electrolysis process. fed by low-carbon electricity. The use of waste materials eliminates the competition with food crops (e.g. soybean or rapeseed) and promotes the recycle of substances that should be treated for disposal. The results of the study show that the production cost of HVO with the considered plant are around 33% higher than that of fossil diesel. Moreover. the variable that has the strongest impact on the production cost of HVO is the price of the waste vegetable oil. which affects the final results more than the electricity price and the cost of the electrolyser.,True,a42_05sAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610219304886,17075064642639202365,/scholar?cites=17075064642639202365,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610219304886/pdf?md5=f51c351d421b66dfde26d6dbe7505454&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610219304886-main.pdf,0,0,0

1328283,Techno-economic analysis and optimization of electrochemical energy storage solutions,2018,Guido Lorenzi,,,,,,The need to integrate the rapidly growing share of variable renewable energy sources in the power sector requires solutions that are capable of mitigating the intermittent nature of these sources. They are expected to constitute the backbone of the electricity generation system in the coming years in order to reach ambitious goals in terms of energy security and reduction of environmental impact. Energy storage appears a promising solution to improve the capability of variable renewable plants to meet the energy demand at all times. mainly through the re-allocation of the generation surplus.Among the several options that can favor the integration of variable renewables. electrochemical storage technologies-batteries and electrolysis cells-constitute the focus of this dissertation. These approaches can be used to defer substantial quantities of energy for medium to long time intervals. are largely location independent. and are considered a strategic part of the decarbonization pathway in the European Union. which represents the geo-political framework under investigation. Battery storage systems are analyzed in both small-and large-scale settings to quantify the energetic and economic benefits deriving from a more efficient use of renewable energy.

1328286,The investigation of consumers’ behavior intention in using green skincare products: a pro-environmental behavior model approach,2018,Jacky Chin and Bernard C Jiang and Ilma Mufidah and Satria Fadil Persada and Bustanul Arifin Noer,10,Sustainability,11,3922,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Increasing environmental awareness among societies is motivating consumers to use green cosmetic products. Green skincare products are the fastest growing sector in the worldwide market compared with other green cosmetic products. However. compared with general cosmetic products. the market share of green cosmetic products in Indonesia is relatively low. The present research investigated consumers’ purchasing intentions toward green skincare products in Indonesia using the pro-environmental reasoned action (PERA) model. A total of 251 female consumers participated in this study. Structural equation modeling was conducted to reveal the relationships between the five factors in the PERA model. The results indicated that perceived authority support (PAS) has a positive effect on perceived environmental concern (PEC). PAS and PEC have positive effects on attitude (AT) and subjective norms (SN). and AT and SN have positive effects on behavioral intention (BI) to purchase green skincare products. with the key factor being attitude. The PERA model was able to describe 62.6% of the BI to purchase green skincare products. Green skincare companies are recommended to produce more green skincare products and market the products by involving public figures and emphasizing the green attributes. Furthermore. we recommend that green skincare companies produce quality and sustainable products using quality processes. and be involved in pro-environmental activity to increase consumer attention to the green skincare products.

Both developed and developing regions are promoting the use of green products. The current study aimed to know the behavior intention on ecolabel product usage from citizens in developing and developed regions. The extended Theory of Planned Behavior. known as Pro-Environmental Planned Behavior Model (PEPB). was used as the assessment model. Two questionnaire surveys were conducted to extract the necessary information for analyzing user’s behavior intention in two different regions. Taiwan and Indonesia were selected as case studies of developed and developing regions. respectively. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the proposed model and the result reveals that the model explains 49% of behavior intention to use ecolabel product in Taiwan’s case and 72% in Indonesia’s case. The findings revealed that attitude (AT) is the key factor to determine the behavioral intention (BI) in both Taiwan and Indonesia. Several practical recommendations based on the finding can be considered as input for the governments and related agencies to persuade manufacturing companies to produce more ecolabel products. Increased citizens’ intention to use ecolabel products help the company to reach broader target market and provide incentives to manufacturing companies to produce more environmentally friendly products.

Photolithography is a commonly used method to create these multi-layered microgels. but it is not applicable to non-photocrosslinkable materials. Also. conventional micromolding methods do not allow creating multi-layered microgels due to the static environment of the microstructures. Herein. we created dynamic micromolds by exploiting the thermoresponsiveness of poly (N-isopropylacrylamide). These micromolds allowed sequential molding of microgels at different temperatures.

1328309,Energy poverty: global challenges and local solutions,2014,Antoine Halff and Benjamin K Sovacool and Jon Rozhon,,,,,OUP Oxford,This edited volume looks at energy poverty. an issue whose pivotal role in the fight for human development is only now being recognised by policymakers. Nearly one quarter of humanity still lacks access to electricity. Close to one third rely on traditional fuels like firewood and cow dung for cooking. at great cost to their health and welfare. While most prevalent in parts of Africa and Asia. energy poverty is a global problem which concerns us all. This book. which brings together economists. policymakers. entrepreneurs. and other practitioners from all over the world. is dedicated to a single goal: finding a solution to this haunting problem. It is part history. part economics. part political analysis. part business case review. and part field handbook. Part One focuses on defining and measuring the problem and benchmarking progress in solving it. an obvious prerequisite to any successful energy-access policy. Part Two reviews past and current energy access programs. with an eye towards finding out what worked and what didn't and what can be replicated elsewhere. These case reviews are told as seen on the ground-China's experience by top Chinese officials and Africa's by African regulators and scholars. Based in part on those cases. the book's last. more forward-looking section aims to present practitioners with a tool kit. a menu of options to speed up their efforts. The energy access agenda is gaining traction at a time of rising concerns about climate change and resource constraints. This book shows that bringing modern energy to those who lack it not just a moral imperative. but will likely benefit the world as a whole without harming the …,True,KXZ5ZzoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,53,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HIJ1BQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:m6QMySMcUrEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=A5GR9RfSuQ&sig=pCQRJE7RjjL5MrU-4awR0VxK97w,12777306032826000539,/scholar?cites=12777306032826000539,,,,0,0,0

Their reasons for doing so seem compelling. They include. inter alia. cutting oil consumption. diversifying fuel supplies. improving energy security. cutting greenhouse gas emissions. protecting air quality. and supporting agriculture. And global biofuel production is growing.

This report explores the outlook for marine bunkers. a niche market that accounts. depending on estimates. for up to 7 percent of the demand barrel. It focuses on the impact of new environmental restrictions that aim to drastically reduce sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships as of January 2020. placing them against the background of past innovations that have been reshaping ships’ fuel consumption patterns and assessing their likely impact on future innovation in the sector.Of the three main compliance options available to ship owners ahead of the new “global sulfur cap.” two—installing “scrubbers” to capture SOx emissions from shippers’ current fuel of choice. high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO). and switching from oil-based bunker fuels to liquefied natural gas (LNG)—are more capital intensive and require more advanced planning than the third. switching from HSFO to lower-sulfur products. such as low-sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) or marine gas oil (MGO). Analysts reckon that most shippers will opt to run low-sulfur fuels. but they fear that rising demand for these fuels will bump against refining capacity limits and cause price spikes that might spread to other markets. notably diesel and even crude oil. Some analysts have suggested that delays could help the industry better prepare for the new rules.

1328318,China and the Oil Price War: A Mixed Blessing,2020,Erica Downs and ANTOINE HALFF and DAVID SANDALOW and ERIN BLANTON,25,Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy commentary,,,,The coronavirus caused Chinese end-user oil consumption to collapse in January and February (setting in motion the chain of events that led to the breakdown of the Russian-Saudi alliance on oil prices). 3 As air. road and rail transport ground to a halt and construction. automobile manufacturing and other labor-intensive industries came to a standstill. end-user demand dropped by an estimated 3 million to 4 million bpd. Signs of recovery are emerging in some segments of China’s economy. including increases in the labor migration and freight logistics indices. Other indicators. such as the coal consumption by independent power producers and urban civil transportation indices. 4 as well as measurements of cement plant activity. remain deeply depressed. Meanwhile. the ripple effects of China’s slowdown across the global supply chain and spread of the coronavirus around the world look set to depress external demand for Chinese exports. further hampering China’s manufacturing and industrial activity.When oil prices collapsed in 2014. low oil prices helped trigger an acceleration in Chinese economic growth. Such a surge may occur again once the coronavirus pandemic is safely behind us.

1328319,The Art of the OPEC Deal,2018,Antoine Halff,,"Center on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University",,,,On its face. OPEC’s meeting marathon in Vienna last week–including the 7th OPEC International Seminar. the 174th Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 4th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting--was a show of strength by a resurgent organization whose obituary had been written by many analysts after the price collapse of 2014. and which is now evidently rejoicing in its vitality. A feeling of mission accomplished was in the air as the ministers took stock of the market rebound since the “Declaration of Cooperation”(DOC) of December 10. 2016 that saw its member states and their non-OPEC partners. led by Russia. create what turned out to be a highly effective program of production cuts. A heavy dose of ceremony was on the menu. including a dance show by cheerleaders waving LCD batons programmed to show the flags of the member states--and Russia’s. Behind the glitz. there was also a fair amount of backroom dealings. ending on a high note with an agreement to lift production by an unspecified amount. a move hailed by most market commentators as a significant achievement and a welcome supply injection in an oil market increasingly perceived as at risk of overheating. 1On closer look. however. there were fine worry lines behind the Organization’s confident smile. OPEC’s dalliance with Moscow. often identified as a historic development and a key factor behind the group’s re-empowerment. may be more problematic than it seems.

Unofficial GDP and inflation measures—the country has long ceased to provide economic indicators—show a sharp deterioration. Declines in oil production and exports are accelerating. The government has fallen behind in debt payments. past the grace period in several cases. Despite these alarming developments. the regime shows surprising resilience. While hard to gauge. popular support for the government and the ruling party. which President Nicolas Maduro has been purging of potential rivals. has yet to evaporate. Military support for Maduro. meanwhile. seems as strong as ever. The challenges ahead are thus daunting for both the leadership and the fractured opposition. with no clear path out of the crisis. The impact of new US sanctions imposed in August 2017. while a matter of debate. seems limited. at least for the short term.Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) convened its first expert workshop on Venezuela last June1. The alarming developments that have been unfolding in the interim called for a follow-up and reappraisal. On December 4. 2017. CGEP hosted a second roundtable that brought together a diverse group of about 45 experts from the oil and financial industries. academia. think tanks. consultancies. and multilateral organizations.

For the changes underway in the market go beyond a mere geographical reallocation of supply and demand or even refining capacity. The supply chain itself – the way oil is being delivered from the wellhead to end-users – is transforming. The old system. in which crude trading was largely global but refining and distribution were mostly local. is being turned on its head.

Fréderic Neyrat believes that “[w] e need to create a fiction of a catastrophe and act as if it was certain.[Because] we can. perhaps. avoid the worst if we believe that it is certain.” Timothy Morton’s concept of “dark ecology” follows a similar logic in describing a world in which the catastrophe has already begun to happen. having taken its course like a mortal sickness from which there is no redemption possible. In both there is an emphasis on incorporating the future into the present. detecting the roots of what will eventually happen in our everyday experience. This activity reminds me somewhat of looking for ghosts of the future. believing them to be as real as those of the past. Thinking of future as present requires an ontological turn. Morton’s “dark ecology” is characterized by processes that occur silently and invisibly on a planetary scale; he calls these processes “hyperobjects.” Hyperobjects are not only imperceptible but also hard to grasp with common sense; however. Morton insists that they are more real than what our common sense believes is “real” because they have enormous impact on our environment and on us. transforming generations of life to come.

1328377,Still Different? Biotechnology. Politics. and Culture in Spain,2016,Sainath Suryanarayanan and Katarzyna Beilin,,Ethics of Life. Contemporary Iberian Debates,,,,In 2011. WikiLeaks cables revealed that the Spanish government had asked the United States government to press Brussels not to enact additional laws regulating biotechnology (William). At the dawn of the third millennium. Spain has distinguished itself among the European Union (EU) and major EU nations in being the most enthusiastic supporter of all sorts of biotechnologies. even as the EU continues to adopt an ambivalent. precautionary stance in light of the risks posed by these emerging technologies of life (eg. Todt and Luján. Ferretti and Pavone). Proponents of Spain’s pro-biotechnology policies situate biotechnology research and development at the center of an emerging high-tech economy. which is denominated as “knowledge-based.” and portrayed as unshackled from Spain’s retrogressive. anti-Enlightenment past (eg. Nature Biotechnology. Bertero). Critics assert that Spain has implemented biotechnology policies in a hasty manner that renders Spanish society beholden to the interests of powerful multinational corporations and governments. and that this may be viewed as a continuation of Spaniards’ historically subservient orientation toward those in power. In this sense. Jorge Riechmann states that “Spain is still different”(Qué son 23) and in February of 2014 Eshter Vivas publishes in El público an article on GMOs based on the same idea and with a title similar to our essay’s:“Transgénicos:‘Spain is different.’” 1 While certain attitudes toward biotechnology in Spain can be. perhaps. interpreted in this way. we show that they result from a,True,RRosGaoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=sHA6DAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA203&dq=info:cgM5v67NoGEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=k9MQNHKgPO&sig=pn62dCoelThwOHOMcKxNC7lhGkY,7034848768368903026,/scholar?cites=7034848768368903026,,,,0,0,0

1328379,Debating ourselves; towards garden cities,2016,Katarzyna Beilin,,,,,Hispanic Issues Series,The challenge of becoming critical not only towards others’ ideas. but also towards one’s own. is an exciting part of the ethos of humanities. For the last few years. I constantly return to Mike Davis’s essay “Who Will Build the Ark?.” which does precisely that. Its first part develops a very pessimistic scenario for the future of humanity plagued by the Global Warming that most likely cannot be stopped as up-to-date failures of international efforts to reduce CO2 emissions show. The second part of his essay. however. rebels against the doom of the first part and argues for utopian thinking that can inspire action and stop or slow down the rising of the seas and other climate catastrophes. I want to propose adopting the dual structure of Davis’s essay for our debates with ourselves. keeping in mind that we may be working the very kernel of the humanities whose future similarly hesitates between collapse and survival.Today the humanities are in trouble. As nation states share their power with interconnected global corporations and most wars are fought for resources. there is less and less need to invest in the humanities to shape nation-loving citizens. Patriotism. more than a love of one’s land. is now defined in economic categories as an acquisition of power and the love for products and brands. which serves big businesses. Global business foresees a different role for the humanities through a mere construction of skills. Humanities scholars shall teach languages. writing. speaking. and aspects of culture to future salesmen and executives so that these business people may be more successful in their pursuits.

En este contexto Ecoherencia. una empresa social sin ánimo de lucro. investiga y enseña cómo usar plantas consideradas por la sociedad como malas hierbas a pesar de sus propiedades nutritivas. medicinales y agroecológicas—llamadas Plantas Multifuncionales (PlaMs)—. La facilidad con que estas plantas crecen se debe a lo que Ecoherencia llama «la memoria del suelo».

But for what they lack in getting the market right. they excel in their trade management. Their trade management is what I term active management. Always monitor the market for new information. Always be looking for signs of strength and weakness. Exit immediately on any adverse development. Exit a trade if it is not profitable within a certain amount of time. Good trades move in your favour right away. Time is a function that can kill a positive expectation. If you add to a position. you must move your stop up to the average point of entry.

In 1978. the changing structure of the physical spot market for oil brought about the development and launch of a successful oil futures contract for home heating oil on the 132-year-old NYMEX which was tied to physical delivery of the oil in New York Harbor. Successive oil futures contract and the development of an active and viable OTC market for forward oil trading in the 1980s brought significant structural changes to the global oil industry.

London,Once the board has authorized and established policies and procedures for the risk management program. senior management must execute the strategy; in other words. they must start using energy derivatives to hedge. As touched upon in previous chapters. hedging is the process in which an organization with energy price risk takes a position in a derivative instrument (swaps. options. futures) that gives an equal and opposite financial exposure to the underlying physical position to protect against major adverse price changes. The volumetric price exposure of the derivatives hedging instrument should be equal and opposite to the price exposure of the physical energy commodity that the organization wishes to reduce its price risk exposure in. It is important for Board of Directors to take hedging very seriously.

Paper trading for oil has grown on established futures exchanges to almost 400 million bbl/d with much greater growth on the OTC markets. Moreover. because major oil companies must now buy and trade on the spot markets to meet more of their supply needs that were previously met by their own production. their active involvement in paper trading has increased over time.

In Tanzania. the concept of choice remains peripheral. not only to debates at the national policy level. but also to the way that parents and communities frame their claims to educational opportunities. Drawing on ethnographic research in two contrasting regions–Singida and Kilimanjaro–the chapter describes not how people ‘choose’between their given options or rate the ‘choices’ open to them. but rather how they produce educational opportunities through social interaction. People cultivate and strengthen a variety of relationships. including those that involve putting oneself at the debt and the mercy of benefactors. and those that involve creating horizontal relationships of reciprocity. where people call on those with similar means and help them in turn. It is argued that it is through these relationships–rather than through a disinterested educational ‘market’–that people in Tanzania access educational opportunity.Once. when asked what the benefits were of having many children. a Nyaturu woman replied.‘If I have many. maybe one or two will succeed and come back to help me. If I only have three. and none succeeds. what’s the point?’Her explanation continued with a metaphor:‘Here in Singida Region. people plant many seeds... maize. sorghum. millet...

In his depiction of an urban Tanzanian landscape. artist and political cartoonist Nathan Mpangala (Majira. 14 October 2004; Figure 1) captured Tanzanians’ propensity to invoke and pay tribute to this legitimacy in their everyday endeavors by naming everything after Nyerere. 1 In the cartoon. a man drinking at a streetside table says to his companion:“I want to open a bar.

This article sketches Singidans’ prospect from this space and time of energy transition. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted between 2004 and 2019. it asks: how do rural Singidans eke energy from their natural and social environment? How can ideas of the sun and of labour in Nyaturu cosmology inform understandings of energy? And how are new energy technologies reshaping Singida's social and economic landscape?

1328447,The long-term effects of cautious feed-in tariff reductions on photovoltaic generation in the UK residential sector,2020,Monica Castaneda and Sebastian Zapata and Judith Cherni and Andres J Aristizabal and Isaac Dyner,155,Renewable Energy,,1432-1443,Pergamon,In recent years. the UK electricity sector has been seeking to achieve its environmental targets through subsidies to renewables. Although subsidies. through feed-in tariffs. to promote the adoption of photovoltaic (PV) systems by UK households had been successful. the government decided to significantly reduce these incentives. As these tariffs were precisely aimed to incentivise households to adopt PV systems. cutting those fees may have conflicted with the stated purpose of the policy. and its impact on industry participants is in turn uncertain.This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding of the long-term effects of cautious feed-in tariff reductions on household’s PV adoption. utilities and solar companies by considering a systems approach.

1328450,Assessing the effect of incentive policies on residential PV investments in Colombia,2018,Monica Castaneda and Sebastian Zapata and Andres Aristizabal,11,Energies,10,2614,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,As the cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) falls. their potential for transforming modern electricity generation increases. Solar PV provides a simpler way of producing clean and affordable energy. which makes it an attractive investment. Great investments in solar PV have occurred in industrialized countries. but government efforts to promote this technology have not been effective in nonindustrialized countries. Despite this. some of these countries may have a high solar PV potential. such as Colombia. where policies to encourage solar PV are only just starting to take place. Therefore. this paper proposes a simulation model to assess different policies—feed-in tariff. net metering. and capital subsidy—to promote solar PV investments in the Colombian residential sector. Policies are assessed considering the criteria of efficiency and effectiveness. Simulation results suggest that (i) net metering is the most efficient policy with a cost indicator of 20.298 USD/MW;(ii) feed-in tariff is the most effective policy as it reaches the highest level of avoided CO 2 emissions—4.792.823 million tons of CO 2—and a meaningful PV installed capacity of 7522 MW;(iii) capital subsidy is the least efficient policy as it has the highest cost indicator of 509.616 USD/MW.

The monopolies characteristic of the utilities sector. and the low incentive to innovate that result from this. will cause these industries to struggle for a market share in a more competitive future environment. Solar power business may emerge as an opportunity for electricity utilities increase earnings. though their burgeoning depends on favourable framework conditions. such as subsidies. The objective of this paper is to study the long-term effects of the deployment from distributed solar on solar companies’ generation and electricity utilities. The findings indicate that distributed generation may reduce the domestic energy consumption; however. the development of solar PV (photovoltaic) is limited under the British electricity market’s conditions. In addition. the most beneficial option to solar company is a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) model.

1328469,Foam filling options for crashworthiness optimization of thin-walled multi-tubular circular columns,2018,Murat Altin and Erdem Acar and Mehmet Ali Güler,131,Thin-Walled Structures,,309-323,,There is an increasing trend in using aluminum foam-filled columns in crash management systems due to their light weight in automotive industry. The main goal of this study is to optimize the crashworthiness of aluminum foam-filled thin-walled multi-tubular circular columns under quasi-static loading. The existing studies in the literature considered only lateral foam filling (the foam lateral dimension is variable and the foam height is equal to the column height). In the present study. we considered both lateral and axial foam filling and compared the performances of these two options. In optimization. the column thicknesses. taper angle. foam density. and foam height/diameter are considered as design variables. The quasi-static responses of the columns are determined through explicit dynamic Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using LS-DYNA software. and validated with quasi-static tests conducted in our facilities …,True,7gGgTlQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,16,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026382311830291X,12271522687002419076,/scholar?cites=12271522687002419076,,,,0,0,0
1328470,Thermodynamic. dynamic and flow friction analysis of a Stirling engine with Scotch yoke piston driving mechanism,2019,Halit Karabulut and Melih Okur and Serdar Halis and Murat Altin,,Energy,,,,This study concerns with the thermodynamic and dynamic analysis of an alpha type Stirling engine with Scotch-yoke piston driving mechanism. The thermodynamic aspect of the analysis is treated with a polytrophic nodal approximation. The pressure of nodal volumes is calculated with modified Schmidt formula which takes into account the pressure differences between nodal volumes caused by flow friction. The flow friction is calculated with adapted Darcy formula. The variation of the gas temperature in nodal volumes are calculated via the first law of thermodynamics given for unsteady open systems. The dynamic behavior of the engine is modeled via the motion equations of pistons and crankshaft. For a 2 kW nominal shaft power and 1400 rpm nominal speed. dimensions and working conditions of the engine were investigated by using realistic inputs. It was estimated that an engine having about 1.44 L …,True,7gGgTlQAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544218322898,8051414056702723558,/scholar?cites=8051414056702723558,,,,0,0,0
