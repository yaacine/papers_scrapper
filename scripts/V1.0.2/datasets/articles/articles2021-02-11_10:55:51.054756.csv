10102970,Role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in regulating abundance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27,1995,Michele Pagano and Sun W Tam and Anne M Theodoras and Peggy Beer-Romero and Giannino Del Sal and Vincent Chau and P Renee Yew and Giulio F Draetta and Mark Rolfe,269,Science,5224,682-685,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The p27 mammalian cell cycle protein is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Both in vivo and in vitro. p27 was found to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc2 and Ubc3 were specifically involved in the ubiquitination of p27. Compared with proliferating cells. quiescent cells exhibited a smaller amount of p27 ubiquitinating activity. which accounted for the marked increase of p27 half-life measured in these cells. Thus. the abundance of p27 in cells is regulated by degradation. The specific proteolysis of p27 may represent a mechanism for regulating the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases.,True,FuVNRZwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2147,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/269/5224/682.abstract,11020715074840518584,/scholar?cites=11020715074840518584,,,0,0,0
10102971,Cyclin D1 is a nuclear protein required for cell cycle progression in G1.,1993,Véronique Baldin and Jiri Lukas and Maria Jesfis Marcote and Michele Pagano and Giulio Draetta,7,Genes & development,5,812-821,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,A cascade of events is triggered upon the addition of growth factor to quiescent mammalian cells. which ultimately restarts proliferation by inducing the transition from G0/G1 to S-phase. We have studied cyclin D1. a putative G1 cyclin. in normal diploid human fibroblasts. Cyclin D1 accumulated and reached a maximum level before S-phase upon the addition of serum to quiescent cells. The protein was localized to the nucleus. and it disappeared from the nucleus as cells proceeded into S-phase. Microinjection of anti-cyclin D1 antibodies or antisense plasmid prevented cells from entering S-phase. and the kinetics of inhibition showed that cyclin D1 is required at a point in the cell cycle earlier than cyclin A. These results demonstrate that cyclin D1 is a critical target of proliferative signals in G1.,True,FuVNRZwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1793,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/7/5/812.short,12772904376432834867,/scholar?cites=12772904376432834867,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/7/5/812.full.pdf,0,0,0
10102972,SKP2 is required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27,1999,Andrea C Carrano and Esther Eytan and Avram Hershko and Michele Pagano,1,Nature cell biology,4,193-199,Nature Publishing Group,Degradation of the mammalian cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 is required for the cellular transition from quiescence to the proliferative state. The ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p27 depend on its phosphorylation by cyclin–CDK complexes. However. the ubiquitin–protein ligase necessary for p27 ubiquitination has not been identified. Here we show that the F-box protein SKP2 specifically recognizes p27 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner that is characteristic of an F-box-protein–substrate interaction. Furthermore. both in vivo and in vitro. SKP2 is a rate-limiting component of the machinery that ubiquitinates and degrades phosphorylated p27. Thus. p27 degradation is subject to dual control by the accumulation of both SKP2 and cyclins following mitogenic stimulation.,True,FuVNRZwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1764,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb0899_193,3916527782152482767,/scholar?cites=3916527782152482767,,https://www.dbt.univr.it/documenti/OccorrenzaIns/matdid/matdid801184.pdf,0,0,0

The human cyclin A gene was identified as the site of integration of hepatitis B virus in a hepatocarcinoma cell line; in addition. cyclin A is associated with the E2F transcription factor in a complex which is dissociated by the E1A oncogene product. Such findings suggest that cyclin A is a target for oncogenic signals. We have now found that DNA synthesis and entry into mitosis are inhibited in human cells microinjected with anti‐cyclin A antibodies at distinct times.

Here we present the crystal structure of the Cul1–Rbx1–Skp1–F box Skp2 SCF complex. which shows that Cul1 is an elongated protein that consists of a long stalk and a globular domain. The globular domain binds the RING finger protein Rbx1 through an intermolecular β-sheet. forming a two-subunit catalytic core that recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The long stalk. which consists of three repeats of a novel five-helix motif. binds the Skp1–F box Skp2 protein substrate-recognition complex at its tip. Cul1 serves as a rigid scaffold that organizes the Skp1–F box Skp2 and Rbx1 subunits. holding them over 100 Å apart.

Most significantly. the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex is maximally active at the G1/S transition. and overexpression of cyclin E decreases the time it takes the cell to complete G1 and enter S phase. We have now found that mammalian cells express two forms of cyclin E protein which differ from each other by the presence or absence of a 15-amino-acid amino-terminal domain. These proteins are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs and are localized to the nucleus during late G1 and early S phase.

Proteasome-mediated degradation activity of p27 was compared with its protein levels in a subset of tumor samples. We found that carcinomas with low or absent p27 protein displayed enhanced proteolytic activity specific for p27. suggesting that low p27 expression can result from increased proteasome-mediated degradation rather than altered gene expression. Patients whose tumors expressed p27 had a median survival of 151 months. whereas patients who lacked p27 (10%) had a median survival of 69 months.

In this review. we summarize the current knowledge on p27 function and its regulation by synthesis and by ubiquitin‐mediated degradation.

We found that p21 proteolysis requires functional ubiquitin and Nedd8 systems. Ubiquitinylated forms of p21 and p21(K0). a p21 mutant missing all lysines. are detected in vivo and in vitro. showing that the presence of lysines is dispensable for p21 ubiquitinylation. Instead. the free amino group of the N-terminal methionine of p21 is a site for ubiquitinylation in vivo. Although wild-type p21 is more abundantly ubiquitinylated than p21(K0) mutant due to the presence of internal lysine residues. their rates of proteolysis are indistinguishable. These results demonstrate that proteasomal degradation of p21 is regulated by the ubiquitin pathway and suggest that the site of the ubiquitin chain is critical in making p21 a competent substrate for the proteasome.,True,FuVNRZwAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,367,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867403007554,16317898356737362819,/scholar?cites=16317898356737362819,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867403007554,0,0,0

We found that all these proteins were differentially expressed in diploid cells derived from different tissues. in contrast to Cyclin E. Cyclin A and Cdk2 which are ubiquitously expressed. D-type Cyclins were never dramatically overexpressed and often very poorly expressed in tumor cell lines when compared to the levels in their normal counterparts. In contrast.

In contrast. a fraction of wild-type p27 and a p27 (S10D)-phospho-mimetic mutant translocates to the cytoplasm in the presence of mitogens. G1 nuclear export of p27 and its Ser10 phosphorylation precede cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activation and degradation of the bulk of p27.

Ltd,The Cdc25 dual‐specificity phosphatases control progression through the eukaryotic cell division cycle by activating cyclin‐dependent kinases. Cdc25 A regulates entry into S‐phase by dephosphorylating Cdk2. it cooperates with activated oncogenes in inducing transformation and is overexpressed in several human tumors. DNA damage or DNA replication blocks induce phosphorylation of Cdc25 A and its subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Here we have investigated the regulation of Cdc25 A in the cell cycle. We found that Cdc25 A degradation during mitotic exit and in early G 1 is mediated by the anaphase‐promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) Cdh1 ligase. and that a KEN‐box motif in the N‐terminus of the protein is required for its targeted degradation. Interestingly. the KEN‐box mutated protein remains unstable in interphase and upon ionizing radiation exposure.

We have used the HL-60 cell line to study regulation of p27 as cells withdraw from the cell cycle following treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We found that the amount of p27 is maximal in G0 cells. lower in G1 cells. and undetectable in S-phase cells. In contrast to the protein. the amount of p27 mRNA was the same in these populations. suggesting that accumulation of p27 during the cell cycle and as cells withdraw from the cell cycle is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. In S-phase cells. the degradation of p27 appears to predominate as a regulatory mechanism. In G0 cells. there was an increase in the synthesis rate of p27.

Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the N-Myc oncoprotein in neural stem/progenitor cells is thought to trigger the arrest of proliferation and begin differentiation.

Subcellular fractionation demonstrated endogenous Rac1 in the nucleus and Triton X-114 partition revealed that this pool is prenylated.

Cks1. promote proliferation largely by inducing the degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27. Overexpression of Skp2 in human cancers correlates with poor prognosis. and deregulation of SCF-Skp2-Cks1 promotes tumorigenesis in animal models. We identified small molecule inhibitors specific to SCF-Skp2 activity using in silico screens targeted to the binding interface for p27. These compounds selectively inhibited Skp2-mediated p27 degradation by reducing p27 binding through key compound-receptor contacts. In cancer cells. the compounds induced p27 accumulation in a Skp2-dependent manner and promoted cell-type-specific blocks in the G1 or G2/M phases.

Here. we report that the effects of E2F repression lag behind the onset of G1 cell cycle arrest in timed Rb reexpression experiments. In comparison. kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 protein accumulates with a faster kinetics. Conversely. Rb knockout leads to faster p27 degradation. Rb interacts with the N terminus of Skp2. interferes with Skp2-p27 interaction. and inhibits ubiquitination of p27. Disruption of p27 function or expression of the Skp2 N terminus prevents Rb from causing G1 arrest. A full-penetrance. inactive Rb mutant fails to interfere with Skp2-p27 interaction but. interestingly. a partial-penetrance Rb mutant that is defective for E2F binding retains full activity in inhibiting Skp2-p27 interaction and can induce G1 cell cycle arrest with wild-type kinetics.

We present a detailed study of the interaction between the histone acetyltransferase complexes SAGA and NuA4. and transcription activators. We demonstrate by affinity chromatography and photo–cross-linking label transfer that acidic activators directly interact with Tra1p. a shared subunit of SAGA and NuA4. Mutations within the COOH-terminus of Tra1p disrupted its interaction with activators and resulted in gene-specific transcriptional defects that correlated with lowered promoter-specific histone acetylation.

It prevents trans-histone exchange over coding regions and signals for histone deacetylation in the wake of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) passage.

Mechanisms that could be used in this competition have been characterized with the use of the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. The binding of GAL4 to a nucleosome core resulted in a ternary complex containing GAL4. the core histone proteins. and DNA. This ternary complex was unstable; upon the addition of nonspecific competitor DNA. it dissociated into either the original nucleosome core particle or GAL4 bound to naked DNA. Nucleosome core destabilization by GAL4 did not require a transcriptional activation domain.

K36me targets the Rpd3S complex to deacetylate transcribed regions and suppress cryptic transcription initiation at certain genes. Here. using a genome-wide approach. we report that the Set2–Rpd3S pathway is generally required for controlling acetylation at coding regions. When using acetylation as a functional readout for this pathway. we discovered that longer genes and. surprisingly. genes transcribed at lower frequency exhibit a stronger dependency. Moreover. a systematic screen using high-resolution tiling microarrays allowed us to identify a group of genes that rely on Set2–Rpd3S to suppress spurious transcripts.

Synchronous culture analyses indicate that the cells can enter into mitosis at normal timing but become lethal during mitosis. In comparison with the wild‐type mitosis. defects are found in the early spindle structure. the mitotic chromosome structure. the poleward chromosome movement by the spindle elongation and the telophase spindle degradation.

10103274,Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell by growth rate,1996,HDPP Bremer and Patrick P Dennis,2,,2,1553-69,ASM press,Schaechter et al.(121) first demonstrated that the macromolecular composition of the bacterial cell was related to its metabolic activity and that RNA-containing particles were involved in the synthesis of protein. When they examined the variations in growth and composition of Salmonella typhimurium cultures in different media. they realized that the cellular contents of DNA. RNA. and protein at a given temperature depended only on the growth rate and not on the nutrient supplement in the growth medium used to achieve that growth rate. They also found (i) that fast-growing bacteria are larger and contain more DNA. RNA. and protein than slow-growing bacteria.(ii) that the amounts of these macromolecules are exponential functions of growth rate. and (iii) that the exponents of these functions are different for different macromolecules. The last implies that the relative proportions of the different macromolecules change with growth rate; at a given temperature. RNA and ribosome concentration increase with increasing growth rate. DNA concentration decreases. and protein concentration remains almost constant. When the growth rate was varied by changing the temperature rather than the nutrient content of the growth medium. the DNA. RNA. and protein concentrations remained invariant. These early studies of bacterial physiology are documented by Maaløe and Kjeldgaard (95).

Once the bacteria have been endocytosed within a host-membrane-bound compartment by root cells. the bacteria differentiate into a new form that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. Bacterial differentiation and nitrogen fixation are dependent on the microaerobic environment and other support factors provided by the plant.

The strain containing the umuC::Mud(Ap. lac) fusion was identified on the basis of its UV nonmutability. Strains containing this putative null allele of umuC were (i) nonmutable by UV and other agents. (ii) slightly UV sensitive. and (iii) deficient in their ability to carry out Weigle reactivation of UV-irradiation bacteriophage lambda. The UV nonmutability of the strain could be suppressed by a derivative of the mutagenesis-enhancing plasmid pKM101. beta-Galactosidase synthesis in umuC::Mud(Ap. lac) fusion strains was inducible by UV and other DNA-damaging agents.

This proteolytic pathway is used to dispose of polypeptides synthesized from truncated mRNA molecules. Such proteins are tagged with an 11-amino-acid nonpolar destabilizing tail via a mechanism involving the 10Sa (SsrA) stable RNA and then degraded. We show here that the ATP-dependent zinc protease HflB (FtsH) is involved in the degradation of four unstable derivatives of the amino-terminal domain of the λcI repressor: three with nonpolar pentapeptide tails (cI104. cI105.cI108) and one with the SsrA tag (cI–SsrA). cI105 and cI-SsrA are also degraded by the ClpP-dependent proteases.

However. Rm1021 has the ability to produce a second EPS (EPS II) that can suppress the symbiotic defects of succinoglycan-deficient strains. EPS II is a polymer of modified glucose-(beta-1.3)-galactose subunits and is produced by Rm1021 derivatives carrying either an expR101 or mucR mutation. If the ability to synthesize succinoglycan is blocked genetically. expR101 derivatives of Rm1021 are nodulation-proficient. whereas mucR derivatives of Rm1021 are not. The difference in nodulation proficiency between these two classes of EPS II-producing strains is due to the specific production of a low molecular weight form of EPS II by expR101 strains.

Urgent action is needed. This review focuses on a less well-understood aspect of antibiotic action: the complex metabolic events that occur subsequent to the interaction of antibiotics with their molecular targets and play roles in antibiotic lethality. Independent lines of evidence from studies of the action of bactericidal antibiotics on diverse bacteria collectively suggest that the initial interactions of drugs with their targets cannot fully account for the antibiotic lethality and that these interactions elicit the production of reactive oxidants including reactive oxygen species that contribute to bacterial cell death. Recent challenges to this concept are considered in the context of the broader literature of this emerging area of research.

Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that umuC+ and its homolog dinB+ encode novel DNA polymerases with the ability to catalyze synthesis past DNA lesions that otherwise stall replication – a process termed translesion synthesis (TLS). Similar polymerases have been identified in nearly all organisms. constituting a new enzyme superfamily.

Although HU inhibition of RNR is well recognized. the mechanism by which it leads to cell death remains unknown. To investigate the mechanism of HU-induced cell death. we used a systems-level approach to determine the genomic and physiological responses of E. coli to HU treatment. Our results suggest a model by which HU treatment rapidly induces a set of protective responses to manage genomic instability. Continued HU stress activates iron uptake and toxins MazF and RelE. whose activity causes the synthesis of incompletely translated proteins and stimulation of envelope stress responses.

However. the proximity of CRISPR and cas genes strongly suggests that they have related functions which is hard to reconcile with the repair hypothesis. The protein sequences of the numerous cas gene products were classified into ~25 distinct protein families; several new functional and structural predictions are described. Comparative-genomic analysis of CRISPR and cas genes leads to the hypothesis that the CRISPR-Cas system (CASS) is a mechanism of defense against invading phages and plasmids that functions analogously to the eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi) systems. Specific functional analogies are drawn between several components of CASS and proteins involved in eukaryotic RNAi. including the double-stranded RNA-specific helicase-nuclease (dicer). the endonuclease cleaving target mRNAs (slicer). and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However. none of the CASS components is orthologous to its apparent eukaryotic functional counterpart. It is proposed that unique inserts of CRISPR. some of which are homologous to fragments of bacteriophage and plasmid genes. function as prokaryotic siRNAs (psiRNA). by base-pairing with the target mRNAs and promoting their degradation or translation shutdown.

Although. quantitatively. the genome is even more degraded than those of closely related Rickettsia species. Wolbachia has retained more intact metabolic pathways. The ability to provide riboflavin. flavin adenine dinucleotide. heme. and nucleotides is likely to be Wolbachia's principal contribution to the mutualistic relationship. whereas the host nematode likely supplies amino acids required for Wolbachia growth. Genome comparison of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi (wBm) with the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (wMel) shows that they share similar metabolic trends. although their genomes show a high degree of genome shuffling.

They are present in nearly all the sequenced genomes of archaea. bacteria and eukaryotes. with the exception of several species with small genomes. On the basis of experimental studies with the developmental regulator rhomboid from Drosophila and the AarA protein from the bacterium Providencia stuartii. the rhomboids are thought to be intramembrane serine proteases whose signaling function is conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Phylogenetic tree analysis carried out using several independent methods for tree constructions and the corresponding statistical tests suggests that. despite its broad distribution in all three superkingdoms. the rhomboid family was not present in the last universal common ancestor of extant life forms. Instead. we propose that rhomboids evolved in bacteria and have been acquired by archaea and eukaryotes through several independent horizontal gene transfers. In eukaryotes. two distinct. ancient acquisitions apparently gave rise to the two major subfamilies. typified by rhomboid and PARL (presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein). respectively. Subsequent evolution of the rhomboid family in eukaryotes proceeded by multiple duplications and functional diversification through the addition of extra transmembrane helices and other domains in different orientations relative to the conserved core that harbors the protease activity.

HipA is a “toxin” that causes reversible dormancy. whereas HipB is an antitoxin that binds HipA and acts as a transcriptional repressor of the hipBA operon. Comparative sequence analysis shows that HipA is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3/4-kinase superfamily. The kinase activity of HipA was examined.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a major mechanism of defense against viruses and transposable elements as well of regulating translation of endogenous mRNAs. The RNAi systems recognize the target RNA molecules via small guide RNAs that are completely or partially complementary to a region of the target. Key components of the RNAi systems are proteins of the Argonaute-PIWI family some of which function as slicers. the nucleases that cleave the target RNA that is base-paired to a guide RNA. Numerous prokaryotes possess the CRISPR-associated system (CASS) of defense against phages and plasmids that is. in part. mechanistically analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic RNAi systems. Many prokaryotes also encode homologs of Argonaute-PIWI proteins but their functions remain unknown. We present a detailed analysis of Argonaute-PIWI protein sequences and the genomic neighborhoods of the respective genes in prokaryotes. Whereas eukaryotic Ago/PIWI proteins always contain PAZ (oligonucleotide binding) and PIWI (active or inactivated nuclease) domains. the prokaryotic Argonaute homologs (pAgos) fall into two major groups in which the PAZ domain is either present or absent. The monophyly of each group is supported by a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved PIWI-domains. Almost all pAgos that lack a PAZ domain appear to be inactivated. and the respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted nucleases in putative operons. An additional. uncharacterized domain that is fused to various nucleases appears to be a unique signature of operons encoding the short (lacking PAZ) pAgo form.

Under the 'selfish operon' hypothesis. operons are viewed as mobile genetic entities that are constantly disseminated via horizontal gene transfer. although their retention could be favored by the advantage of coregulation of functionally linked genes. Here we apply comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis to examine horizontal transfer of entire operons versus displacement of individual genes within operons by horizontally acquired orthologs and independent assembly of the same or similar operons from genes with different phylogenetic affinities. Since a substantial number of operons have been identified experimentally in only a few model bacteria. evolutionarily conserved gene strings were analyzed as surrogates of operons. The phylogenetic affinities within these predicted operons were assessed first by sequence similarity analysis and then by phylogenetic analysis. including statistical tests of tree topology. Numerous cases of apparent horizontal transfer of entire operons were detected. However. it was shown that apparent horizontal transfer of individual genes or arrays of genes within operons is not uncommon either and results in xenologous gene displacement in situ. that is. displacement of an ancestral gene by a horizontally transferred ortholog from a taxonomically distant organism without change of the local gene organization.

In prokaryotes. the genes for most ribosomal proteins are clustered in several highly conserved operons. which ensures efficient co-regulation of their expression. Duplications of ribosomal-protein genes are infrequent. and given their coordinated expression and functioning. it is generally assumed that ribosomal-protein genes are unlikely to undergo horizontal transfer. However. with the accumulation of numerous complete genome sequences of prokaryotes. several paralogous pairs of ribosomal protein genes have been identified. Here we analyze all such cases and attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these ribosomal proteins. Complete bacterial genomes were searched for duplications of ribosomal proteins. Ribosomal proteins L36. L33. L31. S14 are each duplicated in several bacterial genomes and ribosomal proteins L11. L28. L7/L12. S1. S15. S18 are so far duplicated in only one genome each. Sequence analysis of the four ribosomal proteins. for which paralogs were detected in several genomes. two of the ribosomal proteins duplicated in one genome (L28 and S18). and the ribosomal protein L32 showed that each of them comes in two distinct versions. One form contains a predicted metal-binding Zn-ribbon that consists of four conserved cysteines (in some cases replaced by histidines). whereas. in the second form. these metal-chelating residues are completely or partially replaced.

Both the F-type (found in most bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts) and V-type (found in archaea. some bacteria. and eukaryotic vacuoles) ATPases can translocate either protons or sodium ions. The prevalent proton-dependent ATPases are generally viewed as the primary form of the enzyme whereas the sodium-translocating ATPases of some prokaryotes are usually construed as an exotic adaptation to survival in extreme environments. We combine structural and phylogenetic analyses to clarify the evolutionary relation between the proton- and sodium-translocating ATPases. A comparison of the structures of the membrane-embedded oligomeric proteolipid rings of sodium-dependent F- and V-ATPases reveals nearly identical sets of amino acids involved in sodium binding. We show that the sodium-dependent ATPases are scattered among proton-dependent ATPases in both the F- and the V-branches of the phylogenetic tree. Barring convergent emergence of the same set of ligands in several lineages. these findings indicate that the use of sodium gradient for ATP synthesis is the ancestral modality of membrane bioenergetics. Thus. a primitive. sodium-impermeable but proton-permeable cell membrane that harboured a set of sodium-transporting enzymes appears to have been the evolutionary predecessor of the more structurally demanding proton-tight membranes.

Typically. toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all α-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase β-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods. we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains. KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains. such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic. inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life.

We performed a comparative analysis of archaeal. eukaryotic. and bacterial B-family DNA polymerases. which are the main replicative polymerases in archaea and eukaryotes. combined with an analysis of domain architectures. Surprisingly. we found that eukaryotic Polymerase ε consists of two tandem exonuclease-polymerase modules. the active N-terminal module and a C-terminal module in which both enzymatic domains are inactivated.

Processed transcripts encompassing these spacers guide the cleavage of the cognate foreign DNA or RNA. Most CRISPR-Cas loci. in addition to recognized cas genes. also include genes that are not directly implicated in spacer acquisition. CRISPR transcript processing or interference. Here we comprehensively analyze sequences. structures and genomic neighborhoods of one of the most widespread groups of such genes that encode proteins containing a predicted nucleotide-binding domain with a Rossmann-like fold. which we denote CARF (CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold). Several CARF protein structures have been determined but functional characterization of these proteins is lacking. The CARF domain is most frequently combined with a C-terminal winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and “effector” domains most of which are predicted to possess DNase or RNase activity. Divergent CARF domains are also found in RtcR proteins. sigma-54 dependent regulators of the rtc RNA repair operon. CARF genes frequently co-occur with those coding for proteins containing the WYL domain with the Sm-like SH3 β-barrel fold. which is also predicted to bind ligands. CRISPR-Cas and possibly other defense systems are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by multiple ligand-binding proteins containing WYL and CARF domains which sense modified nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives generated during virus infection.

10103465,Live virus-free or die: coupling of antivirus immunity and programmed suicide or dormancy in prokaryotes,2012,Kira S Makarova and Vivek Anantharaman and L Aravind and Eugene V Koonin,7,Biology direct,1,1-10,BioMed Central,The virus-host arms race is a major theater for evolutionary innovation. Archaea and bacteria have evolved diverse. elaborate antivirus defense systems that function on two general principles: i) immune systems that discriminate self DNA from nonself DNA and specifically destroy the foreign. in particular viral. genomes. whereas the host genome is protected. or ii) programmed cell suicide or dormancy induced by infection. Almost all genomic loci encoding immunity systems such as CRISPR-Cas. restriction-modification and DNA phosphorothioation also encompass suicide genes. in particular those encoding known and predicted toxin nucleases. which do not appear to be directly involved in immunity. In contrast. the immunity systems do not appear to encode antitoxins found in typical toxin-antitoxin systems. This raises the possibility that components of the immunity system themselves act as reversible inhibitors of the associated toxin proteins or domains as has been demonstrated for the Escherichia coli anticodon nuclease PrrC that interacts with the PrrI restriction-modification system. We hypothesize that coupling of diverse immunity and suicide/dormancy systems in prokaryotes evolved under selective pressure to provide robustness to the antivirus response. We further propose that the involvement of suicide/dormancy systems in the coupled antivirus response could take two distinct forms: 1) induction of a dormancy-like state in the infected cell to ‘buy time’ for activation of adaptive immunity; 2) suicide or dormancy as the final recourse to prevent viral spread triggered by the failure of immunity.

We have identified a large number of trait QTLs including loci driving variation in cardiac function on chromosomes 2 and 6 and a hotspot for adiposity. energy metabolism. and glucose traits on chromosome 8. Integration of adipose gene expression data identified a core set of genes that drive the chromosome 8 adiposity QTL. This chromosome 8 trans eQTL signature contains genes associated with mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation and maps to a subnetwork with conserved function in humans that was previously implicated in human obesity. In addition. human eSNPs corresponding to orthologous genes from the signature show enrichment for association to type II diabetes in the DIAGRAM cohort. supporting the idea that the chromosome 8 locus perturbs a molecular network that in humans senses variations in DNA and in turn affects metabolic disease risk. We functionally validate predictions from this approach by demonstrating metabolic phenotypes in knockout mice for three genes from the trans eQTL signature. Akr1b8. Emr1. and Rgs2. In addition we show that the transcriptional signatures for knockout of two of these genes.

While genome-wide association studies in humans and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses in mice have identified candidate genes for an increasing number of complex traits and genetic diseases. the resources and time-consuming process necessary for obtaining detailed quantitative data have made sleep seemingly intractable to similar large-scale genomic approaches. Here we describe analysis of 20 sleep-wake traits from 269 mice from a genetically segregating population that reveals 52 significant QTL representing a minimum of 20 genomic loci. While many (28) QTL affected a particular sleep-wake trait (e.g.. amount of wake) across the full 24-hr day. other loci only affected a trait in the light or dark period while some loci had opposite effects on the trait during the light vs. dark. Analysis of a dataset for multiple sleep-wake traits led to previously undetected interactions (including the differential genetic control of number and duration of REM bouts). as well as possible shared genetic regulatory mechanisms for seemingly different unrelated sleep-wake traits (e.g.. number of arousals and REM latency). Construction of a Bayesian network for sleep-wake traits and loci led to the identification of sub-networks of linkage not detectable in smaller data sets or limited single-trait analyses.

However. the genetic context of carbapenemase genes is not always confirmed in epidemiological surveys. and the frequency of their chromosomal integration therefore is unknown. A previously sequenced collection of blaKPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae from a single U.S. institution (2007 to 2012; n = 281 isolates from 182 patients) was analyzed to identify chromosomal insertions of Tn4401. the transposon most frequently harboring blaKPC.

By using microarray technology. a more complete description of the blood proteome of IBD patients is feasible. It may help to achieve a better understanding of the disease. We analyzed blood serum profiles of 1128 proteins in IBD patients of European descent (84 Crohn’s Disease (CD) subjects and 88 Ulcerative Colitis (UC) subjects) as well as 15 healthy control subjects. and linked protein variability to patient age (all cohorts) and genetic components (genotype data generated from CD patients). We discovered new. previously unreported aging-associated proteomic traits (such as serum Albumin level). confirmed previously reported results from different tissues (i.e.. upregulation of APOE with aging). and found loss of regulation of MMP7 in CD patients. In carrying out a genome wide genotype-protein association study (proteomic Quantitative Trait Loci. pQTL) within the CD patients. we identified 41 distinct proteomic traits influenced by cis pQTLs (underlying SNPs are referred to as pSNPs). Significant overlaps between pQTLs and cis eQTLs corresponding to the same gene were observed and in some cases the QTL were related to inflammatory disease susceptibility.

Understanding the biological bases of these early non-motor symptoms may reveal therapeutic targets that prevent disease onset or slow disease progression. but the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex clinical presentation remain largely unknown.

10103569,A systems biology approach for uncovering the genetic landscape for multiple sleep-wake traits,2013,Peng Jiang and Andrew Kasarskis and Christopher J Winrow and John J Renger and Fred W Turek,,The Genetic Basis of Sleep and Sleep Disorders,,104,Cambridge University Press,The very complexity of sleep leads to the prediction that the underlying regulatory process will involve products of many interrelated genes. Thus. complex genetic and genomic approaches are likely to be powerful tools to probe components underlying the sleep–wake cycle and aid in understanding sleep physiology and regulation. Only recently have system genetics approaches been used to uncover the complex genetic landscape and gene networks that underlie multiple interrelated sleep traits. Aside from the recent advances in genetic tools. future sleep genetic studies are expected to benefit from new developments in genetic methodologies. such as systems genetics approaches discussed in detail in this review. Although still in the early stages of discovery. systems genetics approaches have identified novel genes involved in sleep. Future analyses of rich available data sets on multiple sleep–wake phenotypes. linked to genomic loci and gene expression profiles in multiple brain regions in segregating mouse populations. are expected to yield new insights into sleep–wake regulatory mechanisms. as well as sleep disorders. and for revealing new potential targets for pharmacological interventions.

In some cases. multiple drug resistant KD mutations can coexist in an individual patient (“polyclonality”). Alternatively. more than one mutation can occur in tandem on a single allele (“compound mutations”) following response and relapse to sequentially administered TKI therapy.

The starting model was that obtained from the real space search described previously (Navia. M.A.. Segal. D.M.. Padlan. E.A.. Davies. D.R.. Rao. D.N.. Rudikoff. S. and Potter. M. “Crystal structure of galactan‐binding mouse immunoglobulin J539 Fab at 4.5 Å resolution.” Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 76:4071–4074. 1979). This Fab structure has now been refined by restrained least‐squares procedures to an R‐value of 19% for the 11.690 unique reflections between 8.0 Å and 2.6 Å. The rms deviation from ideal bond lengths is 0.025 Å. The overall structure differs from McPC603 Fab. another mouse IgA.κ antibody. in that the elbow bend. relating the variable and constant parts of the molecule. is 145° vs. 133° for McPC603.

Substrate-based peptide mimics constitute a major class of inhibitors of HIV PR presently being developed for AIDS treatment. One such compound. KNI-272. which incorporates allophenylnorstatine (Apns)–thioproline (Thp) in place of Phe–Pro. has potent antiviral activity and is undergoing clinical trials. The structure of the enzyme–inhibitor complex should lead to an understanding of the structural basis for its tight binding properties and provide a framework for interpreting the emerging resistance to this drug.Results The three-dimensional crystal structure of KNI-272 bound to HIV PR has been determined to 2.0 å resolution and used to analyze structure–activity data and drug resistance for the Arg8→Gln and Ile84→Val mutations in HIV PR.

The crystal structure originally reported by Irwin et al.(1976) has been re-interpreted using a new density-modification technique. The reinterpretation is confirmed by the complete amino acid sequence (D. Barker & (G. Winter. personal communication). The structure consists of an amino-terminal α β domain. a domain containing five α-helices. and a region of 99 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. which appears to be disordered. The re-interpretation reveals two new α-helices in the α β domain. and some changes in chain connections. The strands of the β-sheet are in the order A. F. E. B. C. D. with A antiparallel to the others. The arrangement of strands B to F is topologically identical to arrangements found in many other proteins. including the first five strands of the sheet in the NAD-binding domain of the …,True,9fuCe0QAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,178,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283682902558,399484330674526199,/scholar?cites=399484330674526199,,,0,0,0
10103590,Calculation of an OMIT map,1988,TN Bhat,21,Journal of applied crystallography,3,279-281,International Union of Crystallography,A space-group-general computer program to compute an OMIT map using fast Fourier transforms is presented. In this procedure an asymmetric unit of the unit cell is divided into several boxes. For each box a set of phases is calculated by the inverse Fourier transforms of the existing electron density distribution which has been modified so that the electron density values in and around that box is a constant. An OMIT map is then calculated for each box by the Fourier transforms of the observed amplitudes with these phases. The computer program may be used to reduce bias in electron density maps during model building and refinement of macromolecules. The procedure was used to detect error in the atomic model of a derivative of ribonuclease (personal communication by J. Nachman. National Cancer Institute. Frederick. Maryland. USA).,True,9fuCe0QAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,169,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?pn0020,3881973530650539327,/scholar?cites=3881973530650539327,,,0,0,0

I have been solved and refined X-ray crystallography techniques. The crystals of the free and lysozyme-bound Fabs were grown under identical conditions and their X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1 and 2.5 Å. respectively. Two molecules of the Fab-lysozyme complex in the asymmetric unit of the crystals show nearly identical conformations and thus confirm the essential structural features of the antigen-antibody interface. Three buried water molecules enhance the surface complementarity at the interface and provide hydrogen bonds to stabilize the complex. Two hydrophobic buried holes are present at the interface which. although large enough to accomodate solvent molecules. are void.

C2 symmetry-based. diol-containing inhibitors of HIV PR. one of which. A-77003. has reached clinical trials. However. the stereochemistry of the diol core influences protease inhibition and antiviral activity in a manner that is not well understood. We analyzed the crystal structures of a diastereomeric series of C2 symmetry-based diol inhibitors. along with a deshydroxy analogue. bound to HIV PR and found that the stereochemistry of the diol core influences the mode of binding to the active site aspartic acids. Diasteromers with similar binding affinity can bind in different. asymmetric and symmetric. modes. while those with different binding affinities can bind in a similar manner.

To understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon. we studied the anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) monoclonal antibody (mAb) D11.15. which cross-reacts with several avian lysozymes. in some cases with a higher affinity (heteroclitic binding) than for HEL. We have determined the crystal structure of the Fv fragment of D11.15 complexed with pheasant egg lysozyme (PHL). In addition. we have determined the structure of PHL. Guinea fowl egg lysozyme. and Japanese quail egg lysozyme. Differences in the affinity of D11.15 for the lysozymes appear to result from sequence substitutions in these antigens at the interface with the antibody. More generally. cross-reactivity is seen to require a stereochemically permissive environment for the variant antigen residues at the antibody-antigen interface.,True,9fuCe0QAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,159,https://www.pnas.org/content/90/16/7711.short,6470299653266525830,/scholar?cites=6470299653266525830,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/90/16/7711.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this procedure. an atom of the tentative model does not contribute to the phases used to calculate electron density values at or near its current position. that is within the region containing it and a neighborhood surrounding that region. In this way. the phases used to calculate electron density values within a region are not biased by the model atoms contained within that region or its neighborhood. The number of atoms which are omitted for a given region is maintained at a small fraction of the total structure so that the phases used to calculate electron density values may still be a good approximation to the phases of the complete structure. The procedure was used to improve the model of the Fab portion of the mouse galactan-binding immunoglobulin J539 …,True,9fuCe0QAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,151,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?a24151,10816799235369385990,/scholar?cites=10816799235369385990,,,0,0,0
