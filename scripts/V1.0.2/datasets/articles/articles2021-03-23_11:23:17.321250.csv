Generally. most molecular orientation analyses using SFG have been performed on dielectric substrates. to avoid the spectral interference between resonant and the near-resonant background signal. Although rutile crystal can be treated as a dielectric substrate. its electronic state contributes to the intensity and interferes with the resonant signal when the SFG frequency is close to its band gap energy. In addition. the rutile crystal is a uniaxial birefringent material. and the (110) surface is anisotropic. which further complicates the spectral analysis.

1203608,Improvements on the Analysis and Instrumentation for Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy and Microscopy,2013,Joon Hee Jang,,,,,,Sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy has been established as one of the most essential tools to investigate chemistry of the surfaces and interfaces for several decades. Orientation. structure. and chemical reaction of molecules at the interfaces have been examined by using temporally and spatially resolved SFG. As a unique method to observe the chemistry at the interfaces. SFG has a great potential for further developments. In this dissertation. the possibility of extending the SFG field is gauged. including the introduction of detailed theory and formulation of SFG. Firstly. the principle of sum frequency vibrational depletion spectroscopy (SVDS) technique is presented. Newly developed SVDS has been established for observing vibrational behaviors of molecules on the surface with high spatial resolution below the diffraction limit. This technique is accomplished by depletion of the ground state molecules around the center of probing focal spot on the surface.

1203611,Quantitative Orientation Analysis by Sum Frequency Generation in the Presence of Non-Resonant Signal,1979,Joon Hee Jang and Francis Lydiatt and Rob Lindsay and Steven Baldelli,43,Phys. Rev. Lett,,1683,,Sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopic techniques are used to investigate the molecular orientation of adsorbed acetonitrile on rutile TiO2 (110) at the solid-vapor interface. Generally. most molecular orientation analyses using SFG have been performed on dielectric substrates. to avoid the spectral interference between resonant and the non-resonant background signal. Although rutile crystal can be treated as a dielectric substrate. its electronic state contributes to the intensity and interferes with the resonant signal when the SFG frequency is close to its band gap energy. In addition. the rutile crystal is a uniaxial birefringent material and the (110) surface is anisotropic. which further complicates the spectral analysis. In this study. various SFG measurement techniques were applied and quantitative analytical methods were established to avoid misinterpretation of surface orientation. SFG vibrational spectra of acetonitrile on rutile TiO2 (110) surface have been measured at distinct polarization combinations and compared to spectra obtained by the polarization mapping and null angle method. By varying the polarization combinations of SFG. the magnitude and shape of the spectra undergo substantial change. which originate from the interference between non-resonant signal from the rutile substrate and resonance signal from the adsorbed molecule. Theory. simulation. and analytical methods for obtaining quantitative orientation information in the presence of non-resonant signal of a molecule on an anisotropic semiconductor substrate are presented.,True,CWmd5bcAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,0,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/24435308/PRE-PEER-REVIEW.PDF,,,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/24435308/PRE-PEER-REVIEW.PDF,0,0,0

One was to rationally design the positioning of chemical functionalities within candidate molecules. followed by an iterative synthesis–optimization process. The second was the use of a “brutal force” approach of combinatorial chemistry coupled with advanced screening for function. Although both methods provided important results. “rational design” often resulted in time‐consuming efforts of modeling and synthesis only to find that the candidate molecule was not performing the designed job. “Combinatorial chemistry” suffered from a fundamental limitation related to the focusing of the libraries employed. often using lead compounds that limit its scope.

The synthesized and purified crystalline solids are thermally stable and start to decompose after melting. Non-isothermal DSC curves. recorded at several heating rates. were used to evaluate the melting properties and the kinetics of thermal decomposition. The isoconversional and model-fitting methods were applied to determine the activation parameters from the common analysis of multiple curves measured at different heating rates.

This incorporates a wide range of architectures including simple one-dimensional chains with small ligands to large mesoporous frameworks. Generally. the formation process proceeds automatically and. therefore. is called a self-assembly process. In general. the type and topology of the product generated from the self-assembly of inorganic metal nodes and organic spacers depend on the functionality of the ligand and valences and the geometric needs of the metal ions used. In this book the authors explain main group metal coordination polymer in bulk and nano size with some of their application. synthesis method and etc. The properties of these efficient materials are described at length including magnetism (long-range ordering. spin crossover). porosity (gas storage. ion and guest exchange). non-linear optical activity. chiral networks. reactive networks. heterogeneous catalysis. luminescence. multifunctional materials and other properties.,True,dKuZDLYAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,23,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=LlUQDgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=info:_Qv-RCtAZ7cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=XIdnvXqpfW&sig=jUgEb6yzItd2ZTQjxHeYhz5sdaQ,13215602186127281149,/scholar?cites=13215602186127281149,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/41892/1/48.pdf,0,0,0

1203685,Pillared Metal-Organic Frameworks: Properties and Applications,2019,Lida Hashemi and Ali Morsali,,,,,John Wiley & Sons,In the last two decades. metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have provoked considerable interest due to their potential applications in different fields such as catalysis. gas storage and sensing. The most important advantages of MOFs over other porous materials is the ability of tailoring their pore size. functionality and even the topology of the framework by rational selection of the molecular building blocks. Therefore. many chemists have tried to engineer the structure of MOFs to achieve specific functions. Pillared metal organic frameworks are a class of MOFs composed of inorganic secondary building units (SBUs) and two sets of organic linkers. generally oxygen-and nitrogen-donor ligands. Typically. in the structure of pillared MOFs. the oxygen-donor struts link the metal clusters into a two-dimensional (2D) sheet and the N-donor struts pillar the sheets to generate a three-dimensional (3D) framework. Thus. the construction of MOFs by utilizing two sets of organic linkers could provide an extra possibility for further tuning of MOF’s pore walls. A variety of functional groups including imine. amide and heterocycles were successfully incorporated into bidentate pillar ligand skeleton. Interestingly. by using pillaring linkers with different length. a wide diversity of metal-organic frameworks with tunable pore dimensions and topologies can be obtained.

To address this question. a near infrared responsive oligonucleotide-coated (AS1411. hairpin. or both) gold nanoplate loaded with doxorubicin is demonstrated to be nontoxic to cells without triggered release. while being acutely toxic to cells after 5 minutes of laser exposure to trigger DOX release. Conjugation of oligonucleotides to the nanoplates is confirmed by an average increase in hydrodynamic diameter of 30.6 nm. an average blue shift of the plasmon resonance peak by 36 nm. and an average −10 mV shift in zeta potential of the particles. DOX loading through intercalation into the hairpin DNA structure is confirmed through fluorescence measurements. For both GNP-Hairpin and GNP-Hairpin-AS1411. ~60% of loaded DOX is released after the first 5 minutes of laser exposure ( nm). with complete release after two more 5-minute exposures. Preliminary proof of concept is demonstrated in vitro using A549 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines as models for breast and lung cancer. respectively.

Thermally driven MEMS components are often used for their rapid response and ability to apply relatively high forces. However. thermally driven MEMS often have high power consumption and require physical wiring to the device. This work demonstrates a basis for designing light-powered MEMS with a wavelength specific response. This is accomplished by patterning surface regions with a thin film containing gold nanoparticles that are tuned to have an absorption peak at a particular wavelength.

New York. NY,For optical diagnosis of the human body. using near infrared (NIR) has several advantages: NIR penetrates into the tissue deeper than UV or visible light. and in NIR most of the tissue-originated fluorescence may be avoided. Although NIR fluorophores are valuable. only a few can be used for humans and they have relatively low quantum yields. If the fluorescence emission of NIR fluorophores can be artificially enhanced. it can increase the sensitivity of optical diagnosis. In addition. conditionally emitted contrast agents as in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or molecular beacon can be developed. One way of artificially changing fluorescence is by applying an electric field to the fluorophore.

The goal of the H2020 Proteus project (www.proteus-sensor.eu) is to meet this demand: based on the use of a set of novel conjugated polymers (FR1753131) functionalizing non-covalently multi-walled carbon nanotubes. we herein demonstrate the simultaneous monitoring of pH. chlorine. chloride and calcium ions with a single heavily minaturized sensor chip. The principle of sensing is based on the resistance variations of the functionnalized carbon nanotube network (deposited by ink-jet printing) upon changing chemical concentrations in water. In this paper. we present the functionalization strategy. from polymer design to proof of CNT functionnalization to CNT-polymer interaction modeling. Then we show the fabrication process and study the sensor array response. both in the lab and along field deployments. The measurements clearly show selectivity between the different CNT-polymers sensors. for instance pH sensitivity enhancement by a factor of 10 compared with the other devices with one of our polymers tuned with a urea-derivative. For field testing. the sensor chips are integrated into a 250cm3 pre-industrial sensor nodes and tested for several weeks in Sense-City 40m water loop.

1203785,Long Range Two-Photon Scattering Spectroscopy Ruler For Screening Prostate Cancer Cells,,Bhanu Priya Viraka Nellore and Stacy J Jones and Paresh Chandra Ray,,,,,,Optical ruler has served as a key tool for scientists from different disciplines to address a wide range of biological activity. Since the optical window of state of the art FRET rulers is limited to a 10-nm distance. developing long range 10 optical rulers is very important to monitor real life biological processes. Driven by this need. the current manuscript reports for the first time the design of long-range two-photon scattering (TPS) spectroscopy ruler using gold nano-antenna separated by bi-functional rigid double strand DNA molecule. 15 which controls the spectroscopy ruler length. Reported data demonstrate that the TPS spectroscopy ruler’s working window is a within a 25 nm distance. which is more than twice that of well recognized FRET optical ruler. Possible mechanism for two-photon spectroscopy ruler’s long range 20 capability have been discussed using angle resolved TPS measurement and FDTD simulations. Solution phase experimental data demonstrated that long range TPS ruler using A9 aptamer can be used for the screening of prostatespecific membrane antigen (PSMA)(+) prostate cancer cells 25 even at 5 cells/mL level. Reported result with PSMA (-) normal skin HaCaT cells indicate that TPS ruler based assay has capability to enable distinction from non-targeted cell lines. Ultimately. long range TPS ruler can be used towards better understanding chemical and biological processes. 30,True,1vng6qMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suhash_Chavva/publication/271831451_Long_Range_Two-Photon_Scattering_Spectroscopy_Ruler_For_Screening_Prostate_Cancer_Cells/links/54d2cf5e0cf25017918094b2.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suhash_Chavva/publication/271831451_Long_Range_Two-Photon_Scattering_Spectroscopy_Ruler_For_Screening_Prostate_Cancer_Cells/links/54d2cf5e0cf25017918094b2.pdf,0,0,0

An attempt to unravel the existing controversy has been made by studying the solvation dynamics of dansyl labeled proteolytic enzyme α-chymotrypsin in both native and denatured state. In the native state the dansyl probe at the surface of the protein interacts largely with the hydration water while in the denatured state the solvation relaxation of the probe in the randomly oriented polypeptide chain is mainly governed by the polar amino acid residues of the protein.

1203919,Applications of superatom theory in metal cluster chemistry,2016,Marcus A Tofanelli,,,,,,One of the largest modern scientific debates is understanding the size dependent properties of a metal. While much effort has been performed on understanding metal particles from the top down to much less work has been accomplished from the bottom up. This has lead to a great deal of interest in metal clusters. Metal clusters containing 20 to 200 metal atoms are similar yet strikingly different to both to normal coordination chemistry and continuous bulk systems. therefore neither a classical understanding for bulk or molecular systems appears to be appropriate.  Superatom theory has emerged as a useful concept for describing the properties of a metal cluster in this size range. In this model a new set of ‘superatomic’ orbitals arises from the valence electrons of all the metals in a cluster. From superatom theory the properties of a metal cluster. such as stability. ionization energy. reactivity. and magnetism. should depend on valence of the superatomic orbitals. similar to a normal atom. However superatom theory has largely been used to describe the high stabilities of metal clusters with completed electronic configurations. Thus many features of superatom theory have remained largely untested and the extent that the superatom model truly applies has remained in question for many years.   Over the past decade increases in synthetic and analytical techniques have allowed for the isolation of a series of stable monodisperse gold thiolate monolayer protected clusters (MPCs) containing from 10 to 500 gold atoms. The wide range in sizes and high stability of gold thiolate clusters provides an instrumental system for understanding superatom theory …,True,AlqvYlIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://mountainscholar.org/handle/10217/178864,,,,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/178864/Tofanelli_colostate_0053A_13901.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This poses the question of how do flexible soluble molecules promote the formation of water crystals. as they do not expose a well-defined surface to ice.

The methyl groups rigidize the ice-binding site. slow the water dynamics at the ice-binding surface. and stabilize the clathrate-like water in the anchored clathrate motif that binds these proteins to ice.

Organic surfaces. biomolecules. and even liquid/vapor interfaces can promote the nucleation of crystals.

The conditions that lead to ordering of alkanes at interfaces. and whether interfacial ordering of the molecules leads to heterogeneous crystal nucleation of alkanes or surface freezing. have not yet been elucidated. Here we use molecular simulations with the united-atom OPLS and PYS alkane models and the mW water model to determine what properties of the surface control the interfacial orientation of alkane molecules. and under which conditions interfacial ordering results in homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation of alkane crystals. or surface freezing above the melting point. We find that liquid alkanes present a preference towards being perpendicular to the alkane–vapor interface and more parallel to the alkane–water interface. The orientational order in the liquid is short-ranged. decaying over~ 1 nm of the surface. and can be reversed by tuning the strength of the attractions between alkane and the molecules in the other fluid. We show that the strength of the alkane–fluid interaction also controls the mechanism of crystallization and the face of the alkane crystal exposed to the fluid: fluids that interact weakly with alkanes promote heterogeneous crystallization and result in crystals in which the alkane molecules orient perpendicular to the interface. while crystallization of alkanes in the presence of fluids. such as water. that interact more strongly with alkanes is homogeneous and results in crystals with the molecules oriented parallel to the interface.

Experiments indicate that soots of different origins display a wide range of abilities to heterogeneously nucleate ice. The ability of pure graphite to nucleate ice in experiments. however. seems to be almost negligible. Nevertheless. molecular simulations with the monatomic water model mW with water-carbon interactions parameterized to reproduce the experimental contact angle of water on graphite predict that pure graphite nucleates ice. According to classical nucleation theory. the ability of a surface to nucleate ice is controlled by the binding free energy between ice immersed in liquid water and the surface.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can potentially circumvent drug resistance. probably through a bacterial membrane-disruption mechanism. However. they suffer from low in vivo stability. potential immunogenicity. and difficulty in optimization. The development of antimicrobial peptidomimetics is therefore an emerging research area as they avoid the potential disadvantages of AMPs. Cyclic peptidomimetics are of significant interest since constraints induced by cyclization are expected to further improve their antimicrobial activity. Nonetheless. the report of cyclic oligomeric peptidomimetics for antimicrobial development is rare.

Invasive tumor cells generate three splice variants of the metastasis gene osteopontin. the shortest of which (osteopontin-c) supports anchorage-independence. Osteopontin-c signaling upregulates three interdependent pathways of the energy metabolism. Glutathione. glutamine and glutamate support the hexose monophosphate shunt and glycolysis and can feed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. leading to mitochondrial ATP production. Activation of the glycerol phosphate shuttle also supports the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Metabolic probing with N-acetyl-L-cysteine. L-glutamate. or glycerol identified differential regulation of the pathway components. with mitochondrial activity being redox dependent and the creatine pathway depending on glutamine. The multiple skewed components in the cellular metabolism synergize in a flow toward two mechanisms of ATP generation. via creatine and the respiratory chain.

Identification and validation of disease biomarkers using statistical significance analysis (SSA) is critical for translation to clinical practice. SSA is performed by assessing a null hypothesis test using a derivative of the Student's t test. e.g.. a Welch's t test. Choosing how to correct the significance level for rejecting null hypotheses in the case of multiple testing to maintain a constant family-wise type I error rate is a common problem in such tests. The multiple testing problem arises because the likelihood of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. i.e.. a false positive. grows as the number of tests applied to the same data set increases.

This is because of a poor understanding of therapeutic targets. Low-grade inflammation is often higher in older adults and remains a key risk factor of aging-related morbidities and mortalities. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal (dysbiotic) gut microbiome and dysfunctional gut permeability (leaky gut) are linked with increased inflammation in older adults. However. currently available drugs do not treat aging-related microbiome dysbiosis and leaky gut. and little is known about the cellular and molecular processes that can be targeted to reduce leaky gut in older adults.

One of the main causes of the instability of DSSCs is the use of liquid electrolytes. In addition. exploring nano-sized particles of CdS as an alternative sensitizer for organic dye in dye-sensitized solar cells have attracted great interest due to the high cost and the instability of the organic dye. Our study has found that the CdS-coated TiO2 cell degrades rapidly in the liquid electrolytes even under dark environment. In this work. a solid-state solar cell structure of Glass/FTO/TiO2/CdS:Cu/FTO/glass was successfully made with an efficiency of 0.7%. CdS:Cu served as both the p-type conductor and absorber. No efficiency was obtained for cell structures of glass/FTO/TiO2/CdS/FTO/glass. This indicates the effectiveness of hole conducting behavior of CdS:Cu.

Sudan. To achieve this goal 40 biological samples such as hair and nails (20 for each) samples were obtained randomly from the gold miners in 10 sampling sites and analyzing using US EPA Method 7473. A direct mercury analyzer (DMA-80; Milestone Inc.. Shelton. CT. USA) was adopted to determine the mercury levels. The average of mercury concentration levels in the hair samples of gold miners were 8.34 mg/kg. 5.14 mg/kg. 7.26 mg/kg. 4.40 mg/kg. 3.04 mg/kg. 4.81 mg/kg. 3.49 mg/kg. 4.29 mg/kg. 3.26 mg/kg. 3.02 mg/kg respectively. while in nail samples were 7.18 mg/kg. 6.78 mg/kg. 7.02 mg/kg. 4.40 mg/kg. 4.39 mg/kg. 7.26 mg/kg. 6.95 mg/kg. 2.53 mg/kg. 3.82 mg/kg. 3.55 mg/kg respectively. The results indicated that the mercury levels in all samples exceeded the permissible limit set by Environmental protection agency.(USEPA) and World health organization.(WHO). The research indicates that the gold miners and local populations in the study area can have high exposure to mercury vapors because the miners burn the gold-mercury amalgam to vaporized the mercury and recover the gold.

In the last decades. C-H functionalization reactions have arosed as an excellent approach to such goal. The main advantages of C-H functionalization events is the no need of prefunctionalization of the substrate as well as the ubiquity of the C-H bonds. However. numerous challenges are present as well. such as the poor reactivity of these bonds and selectivity issues. During the present work. we have been able to develop two methodologies that employ C-H bonds as coupling partner with aryl halides under palladium-catalysis for the construction of benzofused bucyclic systems of high added value: Benzocyclobutenones and indanes. In the first case. an aldehydic C(sp2)-H bond is activated for the synthesis of a highly strained four-membered ring.

In the 2D experiments. the hatch spacing was chosen to balance track overlap and smoke formation. The quality of the layers after DMP depends greatly on the flowability of the powder. DMP of simple cubes (3D) of relative density> 99.70% was achieved. showing that the DMP of zinc into personalized biodegradable implants and other components is feasible.,True,DDZ_ZP8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,10,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80800717.pdf,11873525530989431342,/scholar?cites=11873525530989431342,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80800717.pdf,0,0,0

One plum sample was used to show that anthocyans from fruit skin consisted mainly of cyanidin 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside. This conclusion agrees with the literature [3]. However. other data [4] indicate that peonidin derivatives make a significant contribution to the anthocyan complex. Furthermore. the formation of cyanidin 3-galactoside has been reported [3].The present article contains results of further systematic research using HPLC studies of plant anthocyans. Skin (or the red part of the skin in green fruit) was peeled from fruit of different color and stage of ripening.

Experimental data that the sorption of a flavylium structure is poorly sensitive to the position of OH groups. and that the retention of anthocyanins depends on the length of bonded alkyl radicals of reversed phase. form the basis of the proposed hypothesis. It is noted that the retention of anthocyanins depends on the orientation of hydroxyl groups in carbohydrate radicals. due to which the chromatographic behavior of anthocyanins is different for glucosides and galactosides. for arabinosides and xylosides. and so on. In other words. retention is a reliable indicator of the composition of a carbohydrate fragment.

Thladiantha dubia. Valeriana officinalis. and Vernicia montana. It was found that a sequence of elution of TGs of the same types is the same without any inversions for full range of mobile phase compositions: punicic (C18: 3 9Z11E13Z)< jacaric (C18: 3 8Z10E12Z)< catalpic (C18: 3 9E11E13Z)< α-eleostearic (C18: 3 9Z11E13E)< calendic (C18: 3 8E10E12Z)< β-eleostearic (C18: 3 9E11E13E)< all-E calendic (C18: 3 8E10E12E) acids. TGs and fatty acid compositions were calculated for all oil samples. Regularities of solute retentions as a function of isomeric conjugated octadecatrienoic acid moiety structure are discussed.

Lower littoral zone (LLZ) along the shore which remains inundated by sea water showed more population of anaerobic bacteria (212 x 104 CFUg-1) than that of mid littoral zone(MLZ) (102 x 104 CFUg-1) and upper littoral zone(ULZ)  (60 x 104 CFUg-1). Population of aerobic bacteria was found to be maximum in ULZ (57 x 104 CFUg-1) compared to MLZ (46 x 104 CFUg-1) and LLZ (14 x 104 CFUg-1). Population of methanogens increased with rise of sea level which in turn emitted more methane than CO2. A stable dynamic equilibrium for growth rate of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria observed in ULZ and is ecologically more consistent than LLZ particularly with respect to methane emission from sediment.

These materials have been used for applications in chemistry. catalysis. electronics. separation science. biochemistry and nanotechnology [1. 2]. The fact that these materials can be made use of incorporating polymeric. organic. inorganic and organometallic ‘guests’ in the porous ‘hosts’ has served numerous important chemical applications [3]. Microporous (eg zeolites) and mesoporous materials serve as the two major categories of the porous inorganic matrices. Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials and are being used widely as industrial catalysts [4]. Of the microporous materials used for industrial purposes. zeolites ZSM-5 (MFI) and Na-Y (Faujasite. FAU) are the two most important members of the zeolite family. possessing medium and large pores in their respective frameworks.Surfactant-templated mesostructures have played a prominent role in materials chemistry during the last decade [5]. The excitement began with the discovery of hexagonally ordered mesoporous silicate structures by Mobil Corporation (M41S materials)[6] and by Kuroda. Inagaki and coworkers (FSM-16 materials)[7]. These materials initially appeared to be the Holy Grail sought after by zeolite chemists of the time. They possessed extremely high surface areas and easily accessible. uniform pore sizes.

FTIR analysis was performed to characterize the cross-linked chitosan structure for the material obtained. The results show that Sebacic acid can distort several properties of chitosan after cross-linking. After cross-linking. the positions of bands within the chitosan FTIR spectra were shifted. SEM and AFM reveal that cross-linked chitosan has a smoothness. This cross-linking approach can be useful in obtaining materials with different properties.,True,nG6YGysAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15374260922157227707&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

In that spirit. O-acetamidoethyl-N-acetyltyramine (OANAT) possesses two flexible side chains of similar size. substituted at opposite ends of a phenyl ring. which intuitively should have two largely decoupled regions of the potential energy surface involving coordinates localized on one or the other side chain. In addition. the chains have sufficient length and H-bonding capacity to fold back over the phenyl ring. forming interchain hydrogen bonds.  Resonant two-photon ionization and UV-UV holeburning spectroscopy identifies six conformational isomers of OANAT. Resonant ion-dip infrared spectroscopy identified three of these six as independent chain conformers. and three as possessing interchain H-bonds. To better understand the independent chain class. single chain molecules containing one or the other peptide mimetic side chains of OANAT were also studied. These molecules include the alkyl chain species N-phenethyl-acetamide (NPEA. 1 conformer) and N-(p-methoxyphenethyl-acetamide) (NMPEA. 3 conformers). and the alkoxy chain species N-(2-phenoxyethyl)-acetamide (NPOEA. 4 conformers).

Conformational isomerization can therefore occur by reorientation of the ethylamine side chain. hindered rotation of the OH group. or a combination of the two.  Building on our recently completed study of the conformation-specific spectroscopy of serotonin.}}.  we report here the results of a study of the energy thresholds to isomerization in serotonin using stimulated emission pumping-population transfer (SEP-PT) spectroscopy.  The method involves selective excitation of conformer X early in the supersonic free jet by SEP to produce ground state X with well-defined internal energy E.  Following re-cooling of the excited molecules. conformer Y is interrogated selectively downstream in the expansion using laser-induced fluorescence.  As the dump laser wavelength is tuned to higher vibrational levels in the ground state. the first transition that produces a gain in the population of conformer Y sets the energy threshold to XY conformational isomerization.  Energy thresholds for all seven AX channels are determined (where SERO(A) is the lowest energy conformer of serotonin). and compared against the corresponding signal in the AA reactant channel.   The barriers that involve hindered rotation of the ethylamine side chain are generally similar to those in TRA. while the energy threshold to hindered rotation of the OH group is determined to be \.\.\.\.\.\wn.

UV-UV hole-burning (UVHB)  spectroscopy was used to prove the existence of two conformations. with S-Sorigins at 35667.8  (conformer A) and 35811.5 cm (conformer B).  Fluorescence-dip infrared (FDIR) spectroscopy was  used to record infrared spectra of these two conformers in the hydride stretch region.  Conformer A  was found to have a free OH (3657 cm) and a H-bonded OH stretch fundamental (3531 cm). consistent  with {\it{ab initio}} calculations for an OHOH inter-ring H-bond structure.  Conformer B exhibits only a  single OH stretch fundamental at 3560 cm. indicative of a C2 symmetry structure in which the OH  groups on each ring H-bond to the  cloud of the opposing ring.  S-state FDIR spectra were also  recorded. showing dramatic changes in the strengths of the H-bonding upon electronic excitation.

In addition. the newly-developed method of stimulated emission pumping-population transfer  spectroscopy (SEP-PTS) was used to place direct experimental bounds on the barrier to conformational isomerization in  meta-ethynylstyrene.  S S origin transitions of oES and pES occur at 32369 and 33407 \wn.  respectively.  In mES. the cis and trans conformations are calculated to be close in energy. In the R2PI spectrum of mES. the two most prominent peaks (32672 and 32926 \wn) were confirmed by UVHB spectroscopy to be S S origins of these two conformers.

These three conformers (labeled A-C) differ in the amount of low-frequency vibronic structure observed. with conformer A exhibiting the most (torsional modes at 32. 50. and 62 cm). conformer B next (a single mode at 37 cm). and conformer C the least (no low frequency modes observed).  A Franck-Condon Factor analysis will be presented to establish the geometry changes in the chain accompanying electronic excitation.  Melatonin conformer A exhibited complete IVR when a vibronic band 502 cm above the S origin was pumped.  In this case all observed emission appears in a broadened origin-like emission characteristic of IVR from the ring mode into the low-frequency modes of the chain.  Interestingly. when the identical band is pumped in conformer B. sharp bands from the initial level carrying the oscillator strength are observed. and the broadened origin-like emission is much narrower.  Both effects indicate that IVR in conformer B is much less efficient than in A. by a factor of ten or more.

RESULTS ON WATER …,2004,Jasper R Clarkson and Esteban E Baquero and Timothy S Zwier,,,,,Ohio State University,As described in the preceding talks. stimulated emission pumping (SEP)- population transfer spectroscopy (SEP-PTS) can been utilized to drive and measure barriers of conformational isomerization in flexible biomolecules. This technique has now been applied to 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) water complex in order to probe the influence of the complexed water molecule on the barrier to isomerization and the relative energies of the conformational minima of IPA. The IPA monomer is known to have two observable conformers in the supersonic expansion in which the propionic acid side chain is gauche on the pyrrole side (conformer A) or anti (conformer B) relative to the indole ring. Previous work (J.R. Carney. et al.. JACS 123. 5596 (2001)) indicates that water molecules in  and  form H- bonded bridges between the carbonyl and the OH groups of the carboxylic acid. It was also observed that bands belonging to these clusters are only slightly shifted and preserve the relative intensities of the IPA monomer transitions. suggesting that these water clusters retain the respective IPA conformation in the presence of water. In the present study clear upper and lower bounds to the energy thresholds for isomerizing  cluster conformer A to conformer B and conformer B to conformer A are determined via SEP-PTS. This places bounds on the barriers to isomerization in the presence of water and determines the relative energies of the conformational minima.

Results from one color and two color resonant two photon ionization (R2PI). laser induced fluorescence (LIF). UV-UV hole-burning. and resonant ion dip infrared (RIDIR) spectroscopies will be presented. The electronic spectrum is highly congested and thus far can be accounted for by six conformations according to R2PI UV-UV hole-burning spectroscopy. The electronic origins of these six conformers are split into a closely spaced pair ( separation) near . and a set of four shifted over  to the blue. The set of four is further divided into a closely spaced pair and two remaining origins due to single conformations.

In the condensed phase. these two contributions are often difficult to distinguish from one another. This talk will focus on the insights to such vibrations that can be gleaned from a study of the isolated. jet-cooled molecules and their solvent-containing complexes. using examples from the authors' recent work. By interrogating the isolated molecule after cooling in a supersonic expansion. the conformational populations are trapped in the zero-point levels of one or a few of the lowest energy conformational minima. and solvent effects are removed. Electronic excitation of an aromatic substituent often produces vibronic structure associated with the low frequency vibrations of flexible side-chains against the aromatic. Double resonance methods enable the acquisition of ultraviolet and infrared spectra of the individual conformations in order to determine how the low frequency motions change with molecular conformation. The intermolecular vibrations can then be explored by addition of solvent molecules to the aromatic solute. Franck-Condon activity involving these vibrations is often observed as the solvent molecules respond to electronic excitation of the aromatic solute.,True,JbeHHpAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/20962,,,,,0,0,0

Furthermore. it was possible to oxidize the enantiomerically enriched boration products into the corresponding cross aldol-type products (3→ 4) without racemization and in excellent yield.Comment: This protocol allows the enantioselective formation of chiral organoboron compounds of type 3. which can possibly serve as important synthetic intermediates. Even b. b-dialkyl-substituted substrates could be transformed with excellent selectivities.

The catalyst system consists of CuPF6 (MeCN) 4. the chiral QuinoxP* ligand and lithium tert-butoxide. The authors rationalized that a catalytic amount of LiPF6 was generated in the reaction that accelerates the catalytic cycle. therefore lithium salt is essential to this reaction.Comment: The reaction provides high enantioselectivities of the product boronic esters. The cyclic enone substrates may be 5-. 6-. or 7-membered. and the b-substituent can be various aryl and alkyl groups. The boronic ester products can also be transformed into many other useful organic compounds.

Investigations into the potential use of carbon nanomaterials for such applications started about two decades ago. Since then. numerous in vitro studies have examined interactions between these nanomaterials and neurons. either by evaluating their compatibility. as vectors for drug delivery. or for their potential use in electric activity sensing and manipulation. The results obtained indicate that carbon nanomaterials may be suitable for medical therapies. However. a relatively small number of in vivo studies have been carried out to date. In order to facilitate the transformation of carbon nanomaterial into practical neurobiomedical applications. it is essential to identify and highlight in the existing literature the strengths and weakness that different carbon nanomaterials have displayed when probed in vivo. Unfortunately the current literature is sometimes conflicting and confusing.

1204449,Osteoblastic Differentiation on Graphene Oxide-Functionalized Titanium Surfaces: An In Vitro Study,2020,Roberta Di Carlo and Antonello Di Crescenzo and Serena Pilato and Alessia Ventrella and Adriano Piattelli and Lucia Recinella and Annalisa Chiavaroli and Silvia Giordani and Michele Baldrighi and Adalberto Camisasca and Barbara Zavan and Mirella Falconi and Amelia Cataldi and Antonella Fontana and Susi Zara,10,Nanomaterials,4,654,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Background: Titanium implant surfaces are continuously modified to improve biocompatibility and to promote osteointegration. Graphene oxide (GO) has been successfully used to ameliorate biomaterial performances. in terms of implant integration with host tissue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) viability. cytotoxic response. and osteogenic differentiation capability in the presence of GO-coated titanium surfaces. Methods: Two titanium discs types. machined (control. Crtl) and sandblasted and acid-etched (test. Test) discs. were covalently functionalized with GO. The ability of the GO-functionalized substrates to allow the proliferation and differentiation of DPSCs. as well as their cytotoxic potential. were assessed. Results: The functionalization procedures provide a homogeneous coating with GO of the titanium surface in both control and test substrates. with unchanged surface roughness with respect to the untreated surfaces. All samples show the deposition of extracellular matrix. more pronounced in the test and GO-functionalized test discs. GO-functionalized test samples evidenced a significant viability. with no cytotoxic response and a remarkable early stage proliferation of DPSCs cells. followed by their successful differentiation into osteoblasts. Conclusions: The described protocol of GO-functionalization provides a novel not cytotoxic biomaterial that is able to stimulate cell viability and that better and more quickly induces osteogenic differentiation with respect to simple titanium discs. Our findings pave the way to exploit this GO-functionalization protocol for the production of novel dental implant materials …,True,huAs2PEAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/4/654,10531808519934111348,/scholar?cites=10531808519934111348,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/4/654/pdf,0,0,0

Ammonia is also being considered as a renewable energy carrier. allowing efficient storage and transportation of renewables. For these reasons. the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is currently being intensely investigated as the basis for future mass production of ammonia from renewables.

In this study. silicon nanoparticles are embedded in micron-sized porous carbon spheres (Si-MCS) via a facile hydrothermal process in order to provide a stiff carbon framework that functions as a cage to hold the pulverized silicon pieces. The carbon framework subsequently allows these silicon pieces to rearrange themselves in restricted domains within the sphere.

The electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 (the nitrogen reduction reaction “NRR”) requires the consecutive six-electron/proton transfer reactions to proceed and this leads to the sluggish kinetics. In addition. the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER.

In particular. the surface of such a catalyst should exhibit higher affinity for nitrogen. as opposed to hydrogen. to facilitate the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Detailed density functional theory (DFT) studies by Skúlason and co-workers3 suggest that this is hardly possible with most metals traditionally considered in electrocatalytic research. One metal not included in the analysis in ref. 3 and long known to be a very poor HER catalyst4 is bismuth. which was very recently introduced by Hao et al. 1 as an efficient NRR catalyst in their report in Nature Catalysis. However. DFT data reported in the same paper clearly indicate that N2 adsorption on various bismuth surfaces is highly thermodynamically unfavourable with an essentially insurmountable energy barrier of more than 2.7 eV.Nevertheless. despite this contradiction. the highly impressive experimental data on the Bicatalysed NRR reported by Hao et al. 1 present the best performances reported to date and therefore would represent important progress in this field.

Using the method of dual series relations. we calculate the rate constant with a high accuracy and obtain some approximate analytical formulas. We compare our results with an approximate analytical formula derived before by the constant‐flux approximation and with numerical calculations based on the Brownian dynamics simulation. It is shown that in the case of strong attractive potential the rate constant only slightly depends on the size of the active site and tends to the classical Debye result for isotropically reactive particles with a further increase in the Onsager length.

One of the major hurdles to overcome in using vegetable oil as a diesel fuel is high viscosity. Here. we experimentally determine the viscosity of unaltered waste soybean oil (WSO) blended with petroleum fuels. Three blend viscosity models Arrhenius. Wright. and the ASTM D7152-05 Standard were evaluated for viscosity prediction accuracy over a temperature range of −10 to 40 °C.

1204691,Multienzyme Immobilized Polymeric Membrane Reactor for the Transformation of a Lignin Model Compound,2018,Rupam Sarma and Md. Saiful Islam and Mark P. Running and Dibakar. Bhattacharyya,10,Polymers,4,463,MDPI,We have developed an integrated. multienzyme functionalized membrane reactor for bioconversion of a lignin model compound involving enzymatic catalysis. The membrane bioreactors were fabricated through the layer-by-layer assembly approach to immobilize three different enzymes (glucose oxidase. peroxidase and laccase) into pH-responsive membranes. This novel membrane reactor couples the in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide (by glucose oxidase) to oxidative conversion of a lignin model compound. guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether (GGE). Preliminary investigation of the efficacy of these functional membranes towards GGE degradation is demonstrated under convective flow mode. Over 90% of the initial feed could be degraded with the multienzyme immobilized membranes at a residence time of approximately 22 s. GGE conversion product analysis revealed the formation of oligomeric oxidation products upon reaction with peroxidase. which may be a potential hazard to membrane bioreactors. These oxidation products could further be degraded by laccase enzymes in the multienzymatic membranes. explaining the potential of multi enzyme membrane reactors. The multienzyme incorporated membrane reactors were active for more than 30 days of storage time at 4 C. During this time span. repetitive use of the membrane reactor was demonstrated involving 5–6 h of operation time for each cycle. The membrane reactor displayed encouraging performance. losing only 12% of its initial activity after multiple cycles of operation.

J. Electrochem. Sci,,1792-1808,,The corrosion behavior of AlMgSi alloy in a solution of 3.5% NaCl in H2O as a function of time of immersion has been studied and assessed by means of electrochemical techniques. These included potentiodynamic polarization curves. linear polarization resistance (LPR). electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and electrochemical noise measurements (EN). The corrosion rate expressed in terms of corrosion current density of AlMgSi alloy resulted higher than that of pure Aluminum. The precipitation of Mg2Si phase and the formation of the galvanic couple Al-Mg induced a shift of the current density towards higher values.

The designed controller will be required to be robust to large changes in the time delay as well as in all other parameters of the model. such as static gain and time constants. The methodology developed here is based on fractional order PI controllers (FPI). which have proven to be more robust than classical PI controllers. by virtue of the extra ¿ parameter (fractional order) that permits it to fulfill additional specifications. The results obtained will be compared with another FPI designed specifically to be robust to changes in all the parameters. except time delay. which is considered constant.,True,O5GxCp8AAAAJ:0ngZmJvimKcC,18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5347163/,11709960158985516586,/scholar?cites=11709960158985516586,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raul_Rivas-Perez/publication/224087304_Fractional_PI_controller_design_with_optimized_robustness_to_time_delay_changes_in_main_irrigation_canals/links/552c878f0cf29b22c9c45e68.pdf,0,0,0

We have investigated the mechanism of C1–C2 bond cleavage by cAD using a fatty aldehyde that incorporates a cyclopropyl group. which can act as a radical clock. When reacted with cAD. the cyclopropyl aldehyde produces 1-octadecene as the rearranged product. providing evidence for a radical mechanism for C–C bond scission. In an alternate pathway. the cyclopropyl aldehyde acts as a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of cAD through covalent binding of the alkyl chain to the enzyme.,True,_x-Yi8oAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC,51,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja3115949,14256460885731606088,/scholar?cites=14256460885731606088,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3651851/,0,0,0

The last step in this pathway involves the decarbonylation of fatty aldehydes to the corresponding alkanes or alkenes. In cyanobacteria. this is catalyzed by an aldehyde deformylating oxygenase.

Existing biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel suffer from several fundamental disadvantages. Hence. there is significant interest in developing superior alkane-based ‘drop-in’ biofuels that could serve as direct substitutes for gasoline. In Nature. alkanes are biosynthesized from fatty aldehyde precursors by enzymes collectively known as aldehyde decarbonylases. Conversion of aldehydes to alkanes is an unusual and chemically challenging reaction. As a consequence the mechanisms of these enzymes are very poorly understood. One such enzyme. aldehyde decarbonylase from cyanobacteria (cAD) is the subject of this dissertation.  cAD was over-expressed and purified from E. coli. Spectroscopic characterization established that the enzyme is a metallo-protein and requires only iron for activity. The enzyme converted octadecanal to heptadecane. Formate was formed as the co-product. The enzyme required a reducing system comprising ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase/NADPH for activity; however. the activity was extremely low. Therefore. an alternate reducing system made of phenazine methosulphate/NADH was employed that resulted in ~100 fold improvement in activity. It was found that the enzyme has broad substrate range and converts aldehydes of chain lengths C18-C7 to the corresponding alkanes. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were investigated using octadecanal as well as a relatively soluble substrate heptanal. Although initial investigation in the reaction suggested cAD may catalyze the reaction in an oxygen …,True,_x-Yi8oAAAAJ:7Frjd3zlGBUC,0,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/107315,,,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/107315/debasis_1.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Recent reports demonstrated the increased motility of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) grown under hypoxic conditions compared to normoxic cells. However. the directional migration of hMSC cultured in hypoxia has not been investigated. In this study we examined the in vitro transmembrane migration of hMSC permanently cultured in hypoxia in response to various cytokines. We also studied the involvement of RhoA. a molecule believed to play an essential role in the migration of MSC via reorganization of the cytoskeleton. We compared the directional migration of human hMSCs grown permanently under normal (21%. normoxic) and low O2 (5%. hypoxic) conditions until passage 4 using an in vitro transmembrane migration assay. A series of 17 cytokines was used to induce chemotaxis. We also compared the level of GTP-bound RhoA in the cell extracts of calpeptin-activated hypoxic and normoxic hMSC.

We also demonstrated for the first time that hMSC are dramatically more sensitive to activation of RhoA.

These particles have been synthesized using spherical iron particles by linking them with a polymer and are called polymerized chains. We have shown that. in oscillatory squeeze mode. the suspensions of such chain-like particles develop yield stress several times higher than that of conventional magnetorheological fluids based on spherical iron particles. This is explained in terms of solid friction between polymerized chains. which form entangled aggregates in the presence of a magnetic field. For the suspension of spherical particles. the squeezing force increases with the magnetic field intensity at low magnetic fields. but decreases dramatically at higher fields because of cavitation or air entrainment. Such a decrease in transmitted force does not take place in suspensions of …,True,kGsjnCIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,6,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/20/20/204132/meta,7521235013904381367,/scholar?cites=7521235013904381367,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Modesto_Lopez-Lopez/publication/51239440_Oscillatory_squeeze_flow_of_suspensions_of_magnetic_polymerized_chains/links/0912f50cb5d2588d58000000.pdf,0,0,0

In the singular limit where the convolution kernel is replaced by a Dirac delta. one formally recovers a conservation law. Can we rigorously justify this formal limit? We exhibit counterexamples showing that. despite numerical evidence suggesting a positive answer. one does not in general have convergence of the solutions. We also show that the answer is positive if we consider viscous perturbations of the nonlocal equations. In this case. in the singular local limit the solutions converge to the solution of the viscous conservation law.,True,LeizvP0AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,23,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00205-019-01375-8,2789102466631290626,/scholar?cites=2789102466631290626,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04547,0,0,0

In this study. new aromatic-rich diorganotin (IV) complexes were tested as photostabilizers in PVC films. The diorganotin (IV) complexes were synthesized in 79–86% yields by reacting excess naproxen with tin (IV) chlorides. PVC films containing 0.5 wt% diorganotin (IV) complexes were irradiated with ultraviolet light for up to 300 h. and changes within the films were monitored using the weight loss and the formation of specific functional groups (hydroxyl. carbonyl. and polyene). In addition. changes in the surface morphologies of the films were investigated. The diorganotin (IV) complexes enhanced the photostability of PVC. as the weight loss and surface roughness were much lower in the films with additives than in the blank film. Notably. the dimethyltin (IV) complex was the most efficient photostabilizer. The polymeric film containing this complex exhibited a morphology of regularly distributed hexagonal pores. with a honeycomb-like structure—possibly due to cross-linking and interactions between the additive and the polymeric chains. Various mechanisms. including direct absorption of ultraviolet irradiation. radical or hydrogen chloride scavenging. and polymer chain coordination. could explain how the diorganotin (IV) complexes stabilize PVC against photodegradation.

The morphological images of the polymeric film showed a rough surface and a large number of regularly distributed hexagonal pores.

The polyphosphate structures were determined using FT-IR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopies. and their elemental compositions were confirmed by EDX spectroscopy. Polyphosphates were added to poly (vinyl chloride)(PVC) at low concentrations to fabricate thin films. The PVC films were irradiated with ultraviolet light for long periods. and the effect of polyphosphates as the photostabilizer was investigated by determining changes in the infrared spectra (intensity of specific functional group peaks). reduction in molecular weight. weight loss. and surface morphology. Minimal changes were seen for PVC films containing polyphosphate compared to that for the blank film. In addition. optical. scanning electron. and atomic force microscopies were used to inspect the surface morphology of films. Undesirable changes due to photodegradation were negligible in PVC films containing additives compared to films containing no additives. In addition. the surfaces were smoother and more homogeneous.

The topography and hydrophilicity of the surfaces were characterized using atomic force microscopy and a water contact angle instrument. respectively. Scratch hardness and adhesion of the Ti film were measured using a mechanical tester. Biocompatibility assessments were performed using cultured human corneal fibroblasts and whole blood ex vivo. The optical quality of the Ti sputtered BK was evaluated using a custom-made optical bench.Results: By contact angle studies. the Ti coating improved PMMA hydrophilicity to match that of medical-grade Ti (Ti-6Al-4V-ELI). Ti sputtering of contact surfaces resulted in a plate-like morphology with increased surface roughness. without impacting the transparency of the BK optical component. Scratch testing indicated that the mechanical behavior of the Ti coating was similar to that of casted Ti. and the coating was stable in pull-off adhesion testing. Sputtered Ti film was highly biocompatible based on tests of cell viability. adhesion. proliferation. differentiation. collagen deposition. and keratocan expression. the properties of which exceeded those of uncoated PMMA and did not induce increased complement activation.Conclusions: Titanium coating of the BK stem generated a mechanically and biologically favorable interface. which may help to enhance …,True,RGuIQMgAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,1,https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772108,10772683506560418382,/scholar?cites=10772683506560418382,,https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772108,0,0,0

The theory permits the systematic evaluation of corrections to the isotropic Flory mean field approximation for arbitrary rod orientational distributions. with the Flory theory being the zeroth order isotropic limit of the full theory. The corrections to the zeroth order mean field entropy are represented as a cluster expansion and may be evaluated as a series expansion in the polymer volume fraction φ. We compute all corrections through order φ3 that survive in the thermodynamic limit for the general anisotropic case. along with new fourth order results. which also extend the isotropic limit theory.

Cytotoxicity of citrate. EGCG. C-GNPs. and E-GNPs was evaluated by the water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. Nanoparticle cellular uptake studies were performed by TEM and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Dialysis method was employed to assess drug release. Cell viability studies showed greater growth inhibition by E-GNPs compared to EGCG or C-GNPs. Cellular uptake studies revealed that. unlike C-GNPs. E-GNPs were taken up more efficiently by cancerous cells than noncancerous cells. We found that E-GNP nanoformulation releases EGCG in a sustained fashion. Furthermore. data showed that E-GNPs induced more apoptosis in cancer cells compared to EGCG and C-GNPs. From the mechanistic standpoint. we observed that E-GNPs inhibited the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) with greater potency than EGCG. whereas C-GNPs were only minimally effective.

The foams have a homogeneous pore distribution and a major fraction of the pores are smaller than 0.5 mm. Only when using the smallest particles (13 μm) does the pore size increase to 1–3 mm due to a faster coalescence process.

The reaction causes foaming of the glass melt. After the reaction. the Tg decreases with increasing Na2CO3 content and reaches a minimum value of Tg. However. this Tg value is even lower than that of the homogeneous bulk glass with the same chemical composition. The lower Tg of the foam glass could be attributed to inhomogeneous incorporation of Na in the glass. leading to Na-rich domains that cause an overall decrease of Tg. Remarkably. after 5 min treatment at 1073 K. the Tg drops by 120 K. indicating that the reaction between Na2CO3 and glass is very fast. Increasing treatment duration causes a slight increase of Tg likely due to both a more homogeneous Na distribution and the compositional change of the glass as a result of Na2SrSi2O6 crystal formation.,True,_yqOyqwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,39,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309314002002,5668498769718674388,/scholar?cites=5668498769718674388,,,0,0,0

CRT panel glass has high recycling potential due to its non-hazardous composition. Here we report on the foaming of CRT panel glass using Na2CO3 as the foaming agent. We explore how heat treatment temperature and concentration of Na2CO3 affect the density and porosity of the foam glasses. and whether Na2O is incorporated in the glass network. The optimum foaming temperature for minimising density and maximising closed porosity is found to be between 1023 and 1123 K.

1204989,N2S2 Donor Sets as Models for Metalloenzyme Active Sites,,Christopher S Mullins and Craig A Grapperhaus and Mark S Mashuta and Pawel M Kozlowski,,,,,,The nucleophilicity of transition metal thiolates is well-documented. Biologically relevant electrophilic substrates include oxygen or oxygen-transfer agents (such as H2O2) and alkylation agents (such as CH3I). Nature makes use of the latter with Zn-containing de-alkylation proteins such as the Ada repair mechanism and the former in the case of the post-translationally modified active form of Nitrile Hydratase.The reactivity of Ni thiolate systems towards alkylation has been known for nearly a halfcentury. whereas recent work has elucidated the realm of sulfur-based oxygenation. Zinc thiolate systems are known to be alkylated as well; however. many reports show a loss of Zn-S bonding upon alkylation. Prior to our work in this area. there were no reports of Zn thiolate sulfur-based oxygenation. In a side-by-side study with the same chelating ligand both alkylation and oxygenation of Ni and Zn thiolates was accomplished. Through DFT calculations the difference in Ni versus Zn reactivity is attributable to energetic overlap of metal d orbitals with the thiolate ligand p orbitals. As shown below. the HOMO of Ni (bme-dmed)(left) has good mixing of these orbitals whereas Zn (bme-dmed)(right) is predominantly sulfur p in character.,True,lfuJEpIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7107617969182685517&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

These drawbacks significantly affect the electrochemical properties of Si anodes and thereby inhibit their commercialization. Coupling Si anodes with inactive Al2O3 materials is one possible way of addressing these issues. In this study. we developed Si-based multicomponent anode materials comprising a multiscale porous silicon framework uniformly passivated with thin Al2O3 layers.

Among various strategies. the introduction of conductive and buffering carbon layers can resolve the typical problems (such as a large volume change and poor electrical conductivity) of alloy-type anodes to some extent.

1205033,Design of High Energy Density Anode Materials for Next-generation Energy Storage Systems,2019,Dongki Hong,,,,,Graduate School of UNIST,As environmental regulation on conventional fossil fuel energy would be tightened. interest in renewable energy and energy storage devices have been gradually increased. Especially. the electric vehicle (EV) field which mainly includes a great portion of the battery market. would be estimated to grow more than 100 times bigger than the current size in 20 years. However. the insufficient energy density of the current lithium ion battery (LIB) system hinders the popularization of the EVs. Therefore. the demands for high energy density energy storage systems have been increased sharply owing to the development of long-range EVs. The potential solutions for the enhancing energy density are the introduction of silicon (Si). germanium (Ge) anode based LIB and lithium metal battery (LMB) systems. The main difference between LIB and LMB is the number of host material. LIB consist of two host materials of anode/cathode. electrolyte. and separator. In LIB. lithium (Li) is stored as an ion state. thus it shows good electrolyte compatibility. stable battery performance. but relatively low energy density. On the other hands. LMB has one host material. Instead of anode host materials. metallic Li is occupied. We can expect higher gravimetric and volumetric energy density in LMB owing to the extra elimination of host material in the anode side. However. deposited Li metal is thermodynamically unstable and causes Li dendrite growth. resulting in low Coulombic efficiency and safety issue. Herein. we introduce diverse strategies of Si/Ge based anodes (LIB) and gel polymer electrolyte (GPE)/electrolyte additives (LMB) for high energy density battery systems.

Pressure relief valves are safety elements of pressurised systems. such as natural gas systems. chemical plants. or hydraulic power transmission circuits. Being a spring-mass system. the valve itself has its own dynamics. however. the presence of the reservoir and the connecting pipeline might lead to a risky combination of the valve body dynamics and the pipeline dynamics. Due to the complex fluid-structure interaction. such systems have a tendency to'self-oscillate'.Investigations that aimed to deeply understand the valve body dynamics highlighted the necessity of the proper derivation of the force balance on the poppet even for unsteady case.

1205068,Some questions on the representations of finite groups: Depth. vanishing properties. expansiveness,2016,Franciska Petényi,,,,,,In this PhD dissertation we investigate some properties related to representations of finite groups. We introduce three different problems. which we examine in three different classes of groups: the symmetric groups. the Suzuki and the Ree groups.The dissertation is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the concept of depth. We determine the ordinary and combinatorial depth of the maximal subgroups of the Suzuki groups and of the Ree groups. In the second part we consider the vanishing properties of characters of a group. We construct several estimates for the number of vanishing conjugacy classes and for the number of vanishing elements of a fixed irreducible character of the group. We compare these estimates for the above mentioned group classes. In the last part we examine which groups can be character expansive. When trying to describe these groups one considers a problem. which is close to the k (GV) problem. however we still can prove some interesting intermediate results.,True,Cd6jKBYAAAAJ:In6cVmBjs0IC,0,https://repozitorium.omikk.bme.hu/bitstream/handle/10890/5306/ertekezes.pdf?sequence=2,,,,https://repozitorium.omikk.bme.hu/bitstream/handle/10890/5306/ertekezes.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

Structure. and Photophysical Properties,2017,Pierre-Henri Lanoë and Btissam Najjari and Florine Hallez and Geoffrey Gontard and Hani Amouri,5,Inorganics,3,58,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,A series of novel N-heterocyclic carbene coinage metal complexes containing a naphthalimide (NI) chromophore has been prepared and fully characterized. Two types of molecules are described those where the NI unit is directly attached to the carbene unit with the general formulae [(L 1)–M–X]. M= Cu. X= Cl (1a); M= Ag. X= I (1b) and M= Au. X= Cl.(1c). While in the second family. a π-extended carbene ligand precursor L 2–H+ I−(3) was prepared where the NI unit is distant from the imidazole unit via a phenyl-alkyne bridge. Only two N-heterocyclic carbene metal complexes were prepared [(L 2)–M–Cl]. M= Cu (2a) and M= Au (2c). The related silver carbene compound could not be isolated. The molecular structure of the carbene complex 1c was determined and confirmed the formation of the target compound. Interestingly. the structure shows the presence of an aurophilic interaction Au··· Au at 3.407 Å between two individual molecules. The photophysical properties of the compounds were investigated in solution at room temperature. Preliminary results suggested that all compounds are luminescent and act as blue emitters (420–451 nm). These transition emissions can be attributed to the intraligand origin of the NI chromphore. Moreover. the carbene complexes featuring L 2 ligand with π-extended system were found to be more luminescent.

Carrot was collected at 13    locations in five districts. Chemometric methods (CA and PCA) were applied to    classify localities according to heavy metal content in carrots. CA separated    localities into two statistical significant clusters. PCA permitted the    reduction of 12 variables to four principal components explaining 79.94% of the total variance. The first most important principal component was strongly associated with the value of Cu. Sb. Pb and Tl. This study revealed that CA and PCA appear useful tools for differentiation of localities in different  districts using the profile of heavy metal in carrot samples.

Experiments are conducted at normal load 10. 15 and 20 N. sliding velocity 1. 1.5 and 2 m/s and relative humidity 70%. Variations of friction coefficient with the duration of rubbing at different normal loads and sliding velocities are investigated. Results show that friction coefficient is in fluenced by duration of rubbing. normal load and sliding velocity. In general. friction coefficient increases for a certain duration of rubbing and after that it remains constant for the rest of the experimental time. The obtained results reveal that friction coefficient decreases with the increase in normal load for teflon and nylon mating with smooth or rough mild steel counter face. On the other hand. it is also found that friction coefficient increases with the increase in sliding velocity for both of the tested materials. Moreover. wear rate increases with the increase in normal load and sliding velocity. The magnitudes of friction coefficient and wear rate are different depending on sliding velocity and normal load for both smooth and rough counterface pin materials.,True,TOzVq4wAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,6,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1997302422113497183&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1997302422113497183,/scholar?cites=1997302422113497183,,,0,0,0

RASSF6 interacts with MDM2 and stabilizes p53. BCL‐XL is a prosurvival member of BCL‐2 family proteins. BCL‐XL directly inhibits proapoptotic BAX and BAK. BCL‐XL also traps tBID. a proapoptotic activator BH3‐only protein. and sequesters p53. In addition. BCL‐XL regulates the mitochondrial membrane permeability via voltage‐dependent anion channel. In these manners. BCL‐XL plays an antiapoptotic role. We report the interaction of BCL‐XL with RASSF6. BCL‐XL inhibits the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2 and suppresses p53 expression. Consequently. BCL‐XL antagonizes RASSF6‐mediated apoptosis.

This change brings many challenges for copper metallization. One of the biggest challenges is to maintain low internal stress of the copper deposit. This is key to avoid solar wafer warpage and maintain good adhesion. Copper deposits with high ductility are also desired to prevent or reduce the potential for the copper deposit to crack under stress over time. Ideal copper deposits exhibit low internal stress and high ductility. However. development of this plating chemistry is a challenge. as improvement in one attribute typically comes at the expense of another.

FC or CC was “sandwiched” between two layers of PEDOT in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (PEDOT/mediator/PEDOT…SDS). The composite electrodes were evaluated for the electrocatalytic oxidation of dopamine (DA). The FC1 mediator showed the highest rate for electron transfer and enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This is due to the inclusion of the ferrocenium ion and the polar substituted –COOH group in the matrix which increases the electronic conduction of the film. SDS enhanced the preconcentration/accumulation of DA ions at the surface that resulted in enhanced detection.

It is found that the salt-induced precipitation and redispersion is more versatile in that the precipitate can actually be redispersed in both aqueous and organic media. However. in terms of mechanism both the routes seem to be very similar wherein the orientational change of oleic acid on the silver surface in the two different environments—organic and aqueous—plays a crucial role in the adaptability of the system to the different environments.

A variety of differently functionalized 1-aryl-6. 7-dimethoxy-1. 2. 3. 4-tetrahydroisoquinolines were synthesized. We employed classic intramolecular Materials and methods: Bischler-Napieralski cyclodehydration to generate the isoquinoline core. All the structures were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The cytotoxic activities against three human cancer cell lines and primary culture of healthy hepatocyte cells were evaluated for all the synthesized compounds and structure-activity relationships were established by MTT asay. It was shown that 8a has demonstrated selective cytotoxicity Results: against breast adenocarcinoma (IC50: 43.3 µM). 4d. 3f against laryngeal adenocarcinoma (IC50: 18.0 and 2.3 µM respectively) with the absence of toxicity to healthy cells.

The macrocycle formed has a persistent elliptiform cavity that is lined with the sulfur atoms of the thiophenes and the π-faces of the perylene diimide. Due to the linkage of the perylene diimide subunits. the macrocycles exist in both chiral and achiral forms.

The volatile fraction was monitored by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas-chromatography. while the variation of the composition of the main components was analyzed by 1 H NMR. Both techniques allowed the detection of some decomposition products. such as polymers. terpenes. and derivatives of the Maillard process. The analysis of the chemical composition prior to and after bentonite treatment revealed a tendency for the clays to retain specific chemical groups (such as carboxylic acids or double bonds). independent of their particle size. A pair comparison test was conducted in order to detect the sensory differences of the intensity of aroma between the WCO treated with the two different bentonites.

Divisione di chimica organica,Follicular Fluid (FF) provides a special environment to the oocyte during its maturation in vivo. The FF is derived from the sanguineous plasma and secretions. synthesised in the follicle wall that contain a large variety of metabolites (1). These metabolites are probably involved in the physiology of the oocytes (1). The chemical composition of follicular fluids is important because it is an indicator of the secretory activities and metabolism of follicular cells and thus could be related to the follicular quality. It could also provide a useful indication of the oocyte growth and maturation (2). High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a unique tool for studying metabolites. Initially. NMR spectroscopy was used mainly in biomedicine but it is found now in many physiological applications (3). As the NMR spectroscopy provides opportunities for obtaining qualitative and quantitative data from body fluids. it was hypothesized that this technique could provide information on mammals’ follicular fluid and on intrafollicular changes that occur during follicular growth and ovulation. As some of these changes are probably of crucial importance for oocyte developmental competence. a better knowledge of the mammals’ follicular fluid composition by 1H NMR analysis should help to resolve some of the problems encountered during in vitro procedures in the mammals.

Here. HTC was used to treat Phaeodactylum tricornutum lipid-rich biomass producing a solid hydrochar from the surface of which adsorbed lipids were removed by hexane extraction following filtration of the solid hydrochar from the process liquid product. Approximately 7% of the input biomass was recovered and transesterified for qualitative and quantitative GCMS analysis for fatty acid methyl esters. Transesterifiable lipids accounted for 94% of the material recovered by solvent extraction. Of the transesterified fatty acids (FA) analysed. the majority was monounsaturated (40.4%) and saturated (37%) C-16 FA. Other FA detected included saturated and monounsaturated C-18 (7.7% and 1.9%) and saturated C-14 (5.3%) and C-25 (1.5%). Thermal analysis (TGA/DSC) of the hydrochar in air showed calorific values of 10.6 MJ kg-1 (delipidated hydrochar) and 3.1 MJ kg-1 (non-delipidated hydrochar) with the latter exhibiting the presence of volatalisable components. Germination trials were conducted to assess the potential phytotoxic effects of these hydrochars. Delipidated hydrochar showed a germination index of 73% suggesting the presence of some phytotoxicity.

Consequently there is an urgent need for analytical tools to help manage carbon reduction without compromising business growth potential. Here we discuss pragmatic methodologies for benchmarking carbon emissions together with models for managing carbon against suitable performance indicators.

1205411,Exploring the Links Between Carbon Emissions and Performance. Share Price and Disclosure,2014,Christopher Ennis and Tarek Montaser and ID Idoko and Samuel Idamu and Abdullah Munir and Mangesh Gharfalkar,,,,,,Increasing pressure on economic actors has produced a degree of standardization and commensuration of carbon emissions reporting and an increasing amount of comparable data is in the public domain. We have recently developed a method for interpreting this data-set to produce a league table of sustainability performance: actors are ranked according to a Performance Score comparing actual performance to the ideal direction of change of the underlying (environmental and economic) parameters. allowing direct and meaningful comparison between actors of quite different natures. The league table is applied to investigate links between emissions performance and both financial performance and the quality of voluntary disclosure of carbon performance data. Using emissions data for FTSE350 companies–publically available via the Carbon Disclosure Project–we analyze correlations between company league table performance and. on the one hand. relative share price movement and. on the other. position in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. We have found no detectable indication of a link between carbon emissions performance (as measured by position in the league table) and either the quality of carbon disclosure or the financial performance of a company. The lack of linkage between carbon performance and either disclosure of share price may be due to a number of reasons: paucity of data/small effect sizes (it may be too early to see the effects); immaturely established causal mechanisms (it may be too early for the effects to manifest); share price and disclosure are not strongly related to emissions performance.,True,ldarALAAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://research.tees.ac.uk/ws/files/6360413/527859.pdf,,,,https://research.tees.ac.uk/ws/files/6360413/527859.pdf,0,0,0
1205412,Hydrothermal Extraction of Algal Fatty Acid and Hydrochar Characterisation,2014,Christopher Ennis,,,,,,Several species of Microalgae are rich sources of lipids that are valuable feedstock for biodiesel production. However. there are significant technical and economic challenges to the development of algal biofuels. not least of which is the dehydration of the algal biomass before conventional lipid extraction. Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) of algal biomass is suitable for facile extraction of biodiesel-precursor triacylglycerides. During algae HTC. cell-rupture liberates lipids to the aqueous phase. These adsorb to the subsequently produced carbon-rich char and are removed from aqueous phase by filtration. Extraction of the lipids into an organic wash phase liberates lipids without prior drying of the algal biomass. This study aims to elaborate the quality of the extracted lipids for biofuels applications and the utility of the algal HTC char as a fuel and as a soil amendment. Algal biomass (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) was subjected to hydrothermal carbonisation at moderate conditions to yield a solid char from which lipids were extracted into hexane. Fatty acid methyl ester yield following subsequent transesterification was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to establish lipid recovery. yield and distribution.

Sci. Rev. lett,2,45-52,,Low alloy steels are widely employed for boiler tubing and steam piping in thermal power plants. This is mainly due to its excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance as well as superior strength at high temperature and pressure. Scale formation in internal surface of boiler tubes is one of the major problems in most of highpressure boilers of thermal power stations. Two major problems result from deposit fouling on the interior tube surfaces:(1) Loss of heat transfer. and (2) Under-deposit corrosion. Therefore. it is necessary to clean the heat transfer surfaces to remove scale formed during normal operation. in order to minimize corrosion and maintain the desired heat transfer capabilities of industrial equipment.

Thermal and Electrochemical Studies,2013,M Yosuva Suvaikin and A Sabastiyan and C Kalaivanan and C Muthukumar,,,,,,The coordination chemistry of Mannich bases has been a subject of investigation by many researchers. Mannich bases possess a wide range of pharmacological uses viz. antibacterial. antifungal. antimalarial. cytotoxic etc. activities. In the present study the Mannich base 2-(dimethylaminomethyl) isoindoline-1. 3-dione and its complexes with copper (II) have been synthesized and characterized. Their structures have been established on the basis of analytical. magnetic. conductance. IR. electronic and EPR spectral data. 2-(Dimethylaminomethyl)-isoindoline-1. 3-dione (DMID) is found to act as a neutral bi-dentate ligand coordinating to the metal ion through a carbonyl oxygen and tertiary amino nitrogen atoms. The non-electrolytic nature of the complexes is evidenced by their low molar conductance values. On the basis of magnetic moments. electronic and EPR spectral data. the chloro and nitrato CuII complexes are assigned an octahedral stereochemistry. The bromo and sulphato complexes are assigned pseudo tetrahedral geometry. The TG and DTA studies on the chloro and bromo complexes were undertaken.

Our results show that the radical anion of the Z isomer is able to rapidly isomerize to the corresponding E configured counterpart with a dramatically enhanced rate as compared to the neutral species. Due to a subsequent electron transfer from the formed E radical anion to the neutral Z starting material the overall transformation is catalytic in electrons; i.e.. a substoichiometric amount of reduced species can isomerize the entire mixture.

This ‘variable-head’ functionalization provides a family of dyes with photophysical characteristics very similar to those of Disperse Red 1. one of the most commonly used azo dyes in materials science.

Here. we show that a chain reaction leading to quantitative Z → E isomerization can be initiated before reaching the destructive anodic peak potential. This hole-catalyzed pathway is accessible to all azobenzenes. without exception. and offers tremendous advantages over the recently reported reductive. radical-anionic pathway because it allows for convenient chemical initiation without the need for electrochemical setups and in the presence of air. In addition. catalytic amounts of metal-free sensitizers. such as methylene blue. can be used as excited-state electron acceptors. enabling a shift of the excitation wavelength to the far red of the azobenzene absorption (up to 660 nm) and providing quantum yields exceeding unity (up to 200%).
