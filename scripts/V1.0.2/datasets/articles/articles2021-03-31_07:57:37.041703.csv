1232215,Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours,2012,Cancer Genome Atlas Network,490,Nature,7418,61,Nature Publishing Group,We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays. DNA methylation. exome sequencing. messenger RNA arrays. microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms. each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53. PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at> 10% incidence across all breast cancers; however. there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3. PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups. possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements …,True,heCFUDcAAAAJ:MbTKqoTs-1EC,7464,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11412,9261474742361229653,/scholar?cites=9261474742361229653,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11412,0,0,0

Although the signature that natural selection imparts on DNA sequence variation is difficult to disentangle from the effects of neutral processes such as population demographic history. selective and demographic forces can be distinguished by analyzing multiple loci dispersed throughout the genome. We studied the molecular evolution of 132 genes by comprehensively resequencing them in 24 African-Americans and 23 European-Americans. We developed a rigorous computational approach for taking into account multiple hypothesis tests and demographic history and found that while many apparent selective events can instead be explained by demography. there is also strong evidence for positive or balancing selection at eight genes in the European-American population. but none in the African-American population. Our results suggest that the migration of modern humans out of Africa into new environments was accompanied by genetic adaptations to emergent selective forces. In addition. a region containing four contiguous genes on Chromosome 7 showed striking evidence of a recent selective sweep in European-Americans.

Two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living in these regions exhibit unique circulatory. respiratory. and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Although these responses have been well characterized physiologically. their underlying genetic basis remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition. groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection. we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another. with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly. one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing. EGLN1 (also known as PHD2). shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans.

Here. we interrogate the multilayered history of North Africa by characterizing the effect of hypothesized migrations from the Near East. Europe. and sub-Saharan Africa on current genetic diversity. We present dense. genome-wide SNP genotyping array data (730.000 sites) from seven North African populations. spanning from Egypt to Morocco. and one Spanish population. We identify a gradient of likely autochthonous Maghrebi ancestry that increases from east to west across northern Africa; this ancestry is likely derived from “back-to-Africa” gene flow more than 12.000 years ago (ya). prior to the Holocene. The indigenous North African ancestry is more frequent in populations with historical Berber ethnicity. In most North African populations we also see substantial shared ancestry with the Near East. and to a lesser extent sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. To estimate the time of migration from sub-Saharan populations into North Africa. we implement a maximum likelihood dating method based on the distribution of migrant tracts. In order to first identify migrant tracts. we assign local ancestry to haplotypes using a novel. principal component-based analysis of three ancestral populations. We estimate that a migration of western African origin into Morocco began about 40 generations ago (approximately 1.200 ya); a migration of individuals with Nilotic ancestry into Egypt occurred about 25 …,True,0wQ8O80AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,270,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002397,3544937898975834466,/scholar?cites=3544937898975834466,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002397,0,0,0

Hispaniola). two mainland (Honduras. Colombia). and three Native South American (Yukpa. Bari. and Warao) populations. We combine these data with a unique database of genomic variation in over 3.000 individuals from diverse European. African. and Native American populations.

We develop a novel ancestry-specific PCA (ASPCA) method to reconstruct the sub-continental origin of Native American. European. and African haplotypes from admixed genomes. We find that the most likely source of the indigenous ancestry in Caribbean islanders is a Native South American component shared among inland Amazonian tribes. Central America. and the Yucatan peninsula. suggesting extensive gene flow across the Caribbean in pre-Columbian times. We find evidence of two pulses of African migration.

However. increasing use of immune-based therapies. including the widely used class of agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. has exposed a discrete group of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

Skin. gut. endocrine. lung and musculoskeletal irAEs are relatively common. whereas cardiovascular. hematologic. renal. neurologic and ophthalmologic irAEs occur much less frequently.

The high frequency with which ionizing radiation and certain chemicals can cause genes to mutate made it possible to perform genetic studies that were not feasible when only spontaneous mutations were available. As a result. much of our understanding of genetics of higher organisms is based upon studies utilizing induced mutations for analyzing gene function. Alkylating agents. which yield predominantly point mutations. have been especially valuable. since the resulting altered and truncated protein products help to precisely map gene and protein function.

Since abnormalities of the hippocampus are known to be associated with temporal lobe seizures and memory dysfunction. we investigated the effects of experimental traumatic brain injury on hippocampal structure and function in the rat. Using a model of fluid- percussion injury. we have discovered that neurons of the dentate hilus are vulnerable to a brief. unilateral impact to the extradural surface of the brain. One week after trauma. there was a dramatic reduction in hilar neurons ipsilateral to the impact. and a milder but significant decrease in neurons on the contralateral side as well.

I discuss the extension of existing multilocus methods to include ambiguous haplotypes in tests of models which distinguish between the cis and trans phase. A likelihood‐ratio test is proposed. using the expectation‐maximization (E‐M) algorithm to account for haplotype ambiguities. Assumptions about the population structure are required. but realistic situations. including population stratification. which violate the assumptions lead to conservative tests.

1232300,Power and predictive accuracy of polygenic risk scores,2013,Frank Dudbridge,9,PLoS Genet,3,e1003348,Public Library of Science,Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers. and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant. to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders. and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases. however. the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here. the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples. explained genetic variance. selection thresholds for including a marker in the score. and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits. the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered. whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples. up to an …,True,pEfsoJsAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,1160,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003348,2224169330210806788,/scholar?cites=2224169330210806788,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003348,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The interaction of the fluorescent dye thiazole orange (TO) with nucleic acids is characterized. It is found that TO binds with highest affinity to double‐stranded (ds) DNA [log(K) ≈ 5.5 at 100 mM salt]. about 5–10 times weaker to single‐stranded polypurines. and further 10–1000 times weaker to single‐stranded polypyrimidines. TO binds as a monomer to dsDNAs and poly(dA). both as a monomer and as a dimer to poly(dG) and mainly as a dimer to poly(dC) and poly(dT). The fluorescence quantum yield of TO free in solution is about 2 · 10−4. and it increases to about 0.1 when bound to dsDNA or to poly(dA). and to about 0.4 when bound to poly(dG).

In contrast to past theories of rainforest speciation. which emphasize geographic isolation. these results suggest that natural selection may play an important role in generating rainforest biodiversity.

However. these estimations relied on the assumption that all mutations occurring in the ancestry of a pair of genes lead to observable differences (the infinite-sites model). This mutation model may not be very realistic. especially in the case of the control region of mitochondrial DNA. where this methodology has been mostly applied. In this article. we show how to infer past demographic parameters by explicitly taking into account a finite-sites model with heterogeneity of mutation rates.

It is based on the retrospective coalescent approach initially described by Kingman (1982a. b). and clearly exposed in a series of other articles (Donnelly and Tavaré 1995; Ewens 1990; Hudson 1990). The coalescent backward approach does not simulate the genetic history of the whole population. like in conventional forward simulations. but rather reconstructs the gene genealogy (coalescent history) of samples of genes drawn from different demes in a population.

It is unclear whether the pathways that control organ size also impinge on stem/progenitor cells. A highly expressed gene in stem cells is YAP1 [1]. the ortholog of Drosophila Yorkie. a downstream component of the Hippo pathway [2]. Mutations in components of this pathway produce tissue overgrowth phenotypes in the fly whereas mammalian orthologs. like salvador [3]. merlin [4].

By screening a gene family RNAi library. we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 as a novel component of the Fanconi anemia pathway. Inhibition of USP1 leads to hyperaccumulation of monoubiquitinated FANCD2. Furthermore. USP1 physically associates with FANCD2. and the proteins colocalize in chromatin after DNA damage.

Historically. work has focused on the influence of parents on offspring but recent advances have extended this perspective to interactions among other relatives and even unrelated individuals. IGEs lead to complicated pathways of inheritance. where environmental sources of variation can be transmitted across generations and therefore contribute to evolutionary change.

1232397,Quantitative genetics and developmental constraints on evolution by selection,1984,James M Cheverud,110,Journal of theoretical biology,2,155-171,Academic Press,It has often been argued that the principles of random mutation and selection are insufficient to account for macroevolutionary phenomena. such as the origin of morphological novelty and directionality in evolution. A third. epigenetic. principle is said to be required and this principle is thought not to be included in microevolutionary theory. The third principle has most recently been identified as internal selection and/or non-random phenotypic effects of mutation. It is shown that the genetic variance/covariance matrix of quantitative genetic theory measures developmental constraints due to internal selection and non-random mutation. The genetic variance/covariance matrix causes the response to selection to deviate from the optimal rate and direction as specified by the selection gradient. which measures direct selection on the phenotypes. Therefore. microevolutionary theory takes account of developmental …,True,vkvsp84AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,697,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519384800508,6478645261526874770,/scholar?cites=6478645261526874770,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Cheverud2/publication/16703136_Quantitative_genetics_and_developmental_constraints_on_evolution_by_selection/links/59b802b8aca2722453a6e513/Quantitative-genetics-and-developmental-constraints-on-evolution-by-selection.pdf,0,0,0

Quantitative genetic models predict that the co-selection of traits involved in a common function will lead to pleiotropic effects at the loci affecting them while functionally-unrelated traits will be affected by separate sets of loci (Wagner. 1996). The patterns of genetic variation produced by these pleiotropic mutations and stabilizing selection for functionally and developmentally interacting traits results in their specific co-inheritance relative to other traits. This in turn leads to their co-ordinated response to selection. Therefore. functional and developmental integration lead to genetic integration which. in turn leads to evolutionary integration.

1232420,Introduction: Parameters in minimalist theory,2010,Ian Roberts and Anders Holmberg,1,Parametric variation: Null subjects in minimalist theory,,57,Cambridge University Press,The papers collected here represent some of the work carried out in the period 2002-2007 by the group working on the project “Null Subjects and the Structure of Parametric Theory”. funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Great Britain (Grant No. APN14458). The group consisted of Theresa Biberauer. Anders Holmberg. Chris Johns. Ian Roberts. Michelle Sheehan and David Willis. The central goal of that project was to investigate and. if possible. refine the notion of parameter of Universal Grammar. as it has been understood in generative theory since roughly 1980. by looking carefully at the phenomena associated with one of the best-known and most widely discussed examples of a parameter: the null-subject parameter (NSP). This volume brings together a number of articles focussing on the nature of null subjects in a range of languages; Biberauer (2008a) is a sister volume arising from the same project. which focuses more on parameter theory than on null subjects. while Holmberg (to appear) focuses on partial null-subject languages. 2In this Introduction. we would like to set the papers in context. Accordingly. we first discuss the phenomena from English and various Romance languages which originally motivated the postulation of the NSP. Next. we summarise the main kinds of null-subject system that have been identified in the comparative-syntax literature. We complete Section One by summarising the two principal approaches to the analysis of null subjects. whose classical exponents are Rizzi (1986) and Borer (1986).,True,uabCiwEAAAAJ:37UQlXuwjP4C,449,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anders_Holmberg10/publication/285764521_Introduction_Parameters_in_minimalist_theory/links/59a997ab0f7e9bdd114ac386/Introduction-Parameters-in-minimalist-theory,8384525962025051396,/scholar?cites=8384525962025051396,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anders_Holmberg10/publication/285764521_Introduction_Parameters_in_minimalist_theory/links/59a997ab0f7e9bdd114ac386/Introduction-Parameters-in-minimalist-theory,0,0,0

Today man's most important staple foods are derived directly from seeds as they have been since neolithic times.(It is a sobering thought. as Harlan* has pointed out. that nothing significant has been added to his diet since then.) From those times he must have learned to collect. conserve and cultivate seeds; and the accumulated experience has been handed down. This book then is part of an ancient tradition. for here we are still primarily concerned with these skills. Seeds are plant propagules comprised of embryos in which growth has been suspended. usually supplied with their own food reserves and protected by special covering layers. Typically they are relatively dry structures compared with other plant tissues and. in this condi tion) they are resistant to the ravages of time and their environment. But resistant is a relative tenn and seeds do deteriorate: the type. the extent and the rapidity of the deterioration. and the factors which control it are important to agronomists. horticulturalists. plant breeders. seedsmen. seed analysts. and those concerned with the conservation of genetic resources.,True,uabCiwEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,446,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SJTqCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:2ghd-3Cs_-8J:scholar.google.com&ots=udRT9YMA3V&sig=w6VJ6hS1cLNnIvAr0K4Lk-ix180,17293730695379486938,/scholar?cites=17293730695379486938,,,0,0,0

The relative effect of water potential has been analysed in an oily seed (lettuce) and a non-oily seed (barley) and found to be more or less identical. The lower limit for the relation in various species coincides with a seed moisture content (wet basis) between about 2 and 6%. Below this level there is little or no improvement in longevity with reduction in moisture content. The upper limit coincides with moisture contents of between 15 and 28%. depending on whether the seeds are oily or non-oily. A water potential of about −14 MPa is the threshold for respiration which increases more-or-less linearly with increase in water potential above this level.

The MAPK-activated kinases. the Rsks. catalyzed the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD at serine 112 both in vitro and in vivo. The Rsk-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 suppressed BAD-mediated apoptosis in neurons. Rsks also are known to phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element–binding protein) at serine 133. Activated CREB promoted cell survival. and inhibition of CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 triggered apoptosis.

The recent identification of a number of substrates for the serine/threonine kinase Akt suggests that it blocks cell death by both impinging on the cytoplasmic cell death machinery and by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell death and survival.

1232440,Tutorial on variational autoencoders,2016,Carl Doersch,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05908,,,,In just three years. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated distributions. VAEs are appealing because they are built on top of standard function approximators (neural networks). and can be trained with stochastic gradient descent. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of complicated data. including handwritten digits. faces. house numbers. CIFAR images. physical models of scenes. segmentation. and predicting the future from static images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs. explains the mathematics behind them. and describes some empirical behavior.

We show that mammalian FOXO3a also functions at the G2 to M checkpoint in the cell cycle and triggers the repair of damaged DNA. By gene array analysis. FOXO3a was found to modulate the expression of several genes that regulate the cellular response to stress at the G2-M checkpoint. The growth arrest and DNA damage response gene Gadd45a appeared to be a direct target of FOXO3a that mediates part of FOXO3a9s effects on DNA repair.

We report that survival factors trigger the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAD at a site (Ser-155) within the BAD BH3 domain. When BAD is bound to prosurvival Bcl-2 family members. BAD Ser-155 phosphorylation requires the prior phosphorylation of Ser-136. which recruits 14-3-3 proteins that then function to increase the accessibility of Ser-155 to survival-promoting kinases. Ser-155 phosphorylation disrupts the binding of BAD to prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and thereby promotes cell survival.

The IGF-1/Akt pathway has a dual effect on huntingtin-induced toxicity. since activation of this pathway also results in a decrease in the formation of intranuclear inclusions of mutant huntingtin. We demonstrate that huntingtin is a substrate of Akt and that phosphorylation of huntingtin by Akt is crucial to mediate the neuroprotective effects of IGF-1.

Several regions with a potential unusual DNA structure. including high-flexibility. low-stability. and non-B-DNA-forming sequences were identified in this region. We performed a similar analysis on the published FRA3B sequence and the putative partial FRA7G. which also revealed an impressive cluster of regions with high flexibility and low stability.

The notion that biological systems ought to evolve to a state of higher stability against mutational and environmental perturbations seems simple enough. but has been exceedingly difficult to prove. Part of the problem has been the lack of a definition of canalization that incorporates an evolutionary genetic perspective and provides a framework for both mathematical and empirical study. After briefly reviewing the importance of canalization in studies of evolution and development. we aim. with this essay. to outline a research program that builds upon the definition of canalization as the reduction in variability of a trait. and uses molecular genetic approaches to shed light on the problems of canalization.

These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together. our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First. our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed. such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts. including non-protein-coding transcripts. and those that extensively overlap one another. Second. systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites. including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification.

1232527,Mood. food. and obesity,2014,Minati Singh,5,,,925,Frontiers,Food is a potent natural reward and food intake is a complex process. Reward and gratification associated with food consumption leads to dopamine (DA) production. which in turn activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. An individual will repeatedly eat a particular food to experience this positive feeling of gratification. This type of repetitive behavior of food intake leads to the activation of brain reward pathways that eventually overrides other signals of satiety and hunger. Thus. a gratification habit through a favorable food leads to overeating and morbid obesity. Overeating and obesity stems from many biological factors engaging both central and peripheral systems in a bi-directional manner involving mood and emotions. Emotional eating and altered mood can also lead to altered food choice and intake leading to overeating and obesity. Research findings from human and animal studies support a two-way link between three concepts. mood. food. and obesity.

1232534,edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data,2010,Mark D Robinson and Davis J McCarthy and Gordon K Smyth,26,Bioinformatics,1,139-140,Oxford University Press, Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks. especially for gene expression studies. involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts. improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication. provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

Inc.,Primary liver cancer (PLC) is common in many areas of the developing world. but uncommon in most of the developed world. Some evidence suggests. however. that the global pattern of PLC may be changing. To clarify this issue. we examined incidence rates for PLC over the 15‐year time period. 1978–92. in selected cancer registries around the world. With some exceptions. developed countries have experienced PLC increases in incidence whereas developing countries have experienced declines. Although the reasons for the trends are not entirely clear. the increased seroprevalence of HCV in the developed world and the elimination of HBV‐cofactors in the developing world are likely to have contributed to the patterns.

In mixed culture of lymphocytes and cell lines in which endogenous interferon is produced. interferon mediates an enhancement of cytotoxicity that represents up to 70-90% of the observed cytotoxicity. The effect of interferon on target cells is antagonistic to the effect on the lymphocytes: the susceptibility to cell-mediated lysis of various cells upon pretreatment with interferon is decreased and in some cases almost completely suppressed. Interferon renders target cells resistant to natural killer cells acting by an intracellular mechanism which requires RNA and protein synthesis.

Exposure of blastocysts to rabbit anti-mouse serum together with complement results in the death of all cells; however. when blastocysts are exposed to antiserum alone and then transferred to guinea pig complement. only the trophoblastic cells are killed. These results suggest that the mouse blastocyst is not permeable for certain antibodies. The inner cell masses can easily be separated from the remnants of trophoblastic cells and are then able to grow and differentiate in vitro.

Analysis of the assembled genome revealed a whole-genome duplication event; about 8000 pairs of duplicated genes from that event survived in the Populus genome. A second. older duplication event is indistinguishably coincident with the divergence of the Populus and Arabidopsis lineages. Nucleotide substitution. tandem gene duplication. and gross chromosomal rearrangement appear to proceed substantially more slowly in Populus than in Arabidopsis. Populus has more protein-coding genes than Arabidopsis. ranging on average from 1.4 to 1.6 putative Populus homologs for each Arabidopsis gene.

Heavily subsidised farmers in rich countries produce sufficient surplus food to feed the hungry. but not at a price the poor can afford. Even donating the rich world's surplus to the poor would not solve the problem. Most poor people earn their living from agriculture. so a deluge of free food would destroy their livelihoods. Thus. the only answer to world hunger is to safeguard and improve the productivity of farmers in poor countries. Diets of subsistence level farmers in Africa and Latin America often contain sufficient carbohydrates (through cassava. corn/maize. rice. wheat. etc.). but are poor in proteins. Dietary proteins can take the form of scarce animal products (eggs. milk. meat. etc.). but are usually derived from legumes (plants of the bean and pea family).

The enzyme unknots and untangles DNA by passing an intact helix through a transient double-stranded break that it generates in a separate helix. Beyond its physiological functions. topoisomerase II is the target for some of the most active and widely prescribed anticancer drugs currently utilized for the treatment of human cancers. These drugs act in an insidious fashion and kill cells by increasing levels of covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes that are normally fleeting intermediates in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Over the past several years. we have made considerable strides in our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of topoisomerase II and the mechanism of action of drugs targeted to this enzyme.

There are several ways in which mutagenesis can be reduced or prevented. Chemicals which act to interfere with DNA repair or with mutagen metabolism can be effective antimutagens: however such compounds may also increase the probability of mutations by different chemicals or at different sites. In contrast. mutagen scavengers may be less prone to increase mutations by other chemicals. Selected examples illustrate that antimutagenic effects are often specific to certain classes of mutagen and/or certain test systems. Thus. if antimutagens are to have any impact on human disease. it is essential that they are specifically directed against the most common mutagens in daily life.

For obtaining the minimum real power injection by SC of DFIG. an objective function is derived along with practical constraints like injected voltage limit on SC. phase jump mitigation and angle of voltage injection. Classical optimization has been used to find the solution of the objective function derived for minimizing real power injection of SC of DFIG along with the constraints.

Chem. Pharm. Res,5,418-432,,The goal of any drug delivery system is to provide a therapeutic amount of drug to the proper site in the body to achieve promptly & then maintain the desired drug concentration. That is why the drug delivery system should deliver dr ug at a state dictated by the needs of the body over a specified period of treatment. This idealized objective points to the two aspects most important to drug delivery. namely. spatial placement relates to targeting a drug to a specific organ or tissue while temporal delivery refers to the control of rate of drug delivery to the target tissue. Bioadhesion can be defined as the process by which a natural or a synthetic polymer can adhere to a biological substrate. When the biological substrate is a mucosal layer then the phenomena is known as mucoadhesion. The substrate possessing bioadhesive property can help in devising a delivery system capable of delivering a bioactive agent for a prolonged period of time at a specific delivery site.

Human embryonic stem cells (HESCs) derived from pre-implantation blastocyst also grow well in hypoxic conditions. Expecting that the differentiating HESCs might mimic anaerobic-to-aerobic metabolic transition of the early human life. we examined the mitochondria-related changes in these cells. We observed that mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial DNA content were increased with differentiation. which was accompanied by the increase of the amount of ATP (4-fold) and its by-product reactive oxygen species (2.5-fold). The expression of various antioxidant enzymes including mitochondrial and cytoplasmic superoxide dismutases. catalase. and peroxiredoxins showed a dramatic change during the early differentiation.

Children so defined are often reported to be bright and able in other intellectual domains. but they have tremendous difficulties in learning to read and spell. The concept of dyslexia. as defined in this way. has been surrounded by controversy since its first use. Many people have objected to the negative (by exclusion) features of the definition (eg. Rutter & Yule. 1975; Taylor. Satz. & Friel. 1979). Recently. Siegel (1989) has argued that intelligence should play no part in defining dyslexia. Likewise.

Despite its apparently high—and rising—incidence. LD remains one of the least understood and most debated disabling conditions that affect school-aged children (and adults). Indeed. many disagree about the definition and classification of LD; the diagnostic criteria and assessment practices used in the identification process; the content. intensity. and duration of instructional practices employed; and the policies and legal requirements that drive the identification and education of those with LD. 1We take the position that many of these debates can be informed by converging scientific data. On the basis of this evidence. we contend that many of the persistent difficulties in developing valid classifications and operational definitions of LD are due to reliance on inaccurate assumptions about causes and characteristics of the disorders.

1232754,Hybridization as an invasion of the genome,2005,James Mallet,20,,5,229-237,Elsevier Current Trends,Hybridization between species is commonplace in plants. but is often seen as unnatural and unusual in animals. Here. I survey studies of natural interspecific hybridization in plants and a variety of animals. At least 25% of plant species and 10% of animal species. mostly the youngest species. are involved in hybridization and potential introgression with other species. Species in nature are often incompletely isolated for millions of years after their formation. Therefore. much evolution of eventual reproductive isolation can occur while nascent species are in gene-flow contact. in sympatry or parapatry. long after divergence begins.

We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation. highlighting issues of current interest and debate.

Host races in plant–feeding insects. in particular. have often been used as evidence for the probability of sympatric speciation. Here. we provide verifiable criteria to distinguish host races from other biotypes: in brief. host races are genetically differentiated. sympatric populations of parasites that use different hosts and between which there is appreciable gene flow. We recognize host races as kinds of species that regularly exchange genes with other species at a rate of more than ca. 1% per generation. rather than as fundamentally distinct taxa.

Here we show that a shift in colour pattern mimicry was crucial in the origin of two butterfly species. The sister species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno recently diverged to mimic different model taxa. and our experiments show that their mimetic coloration is also important in choosing mates. Assortative mating between the sister species means that hybridization is rare in nature. and the few hybrids that are produced are non-mimetic. poorly adapted intermediates. Thus. the mimetic shift has caused both pre-mating and post-mating isolation. In addition. individuals from a population of H. melpomene allopatric to H. cydno court and mate with H. cydno more readily than those from a sympatric population.

Color patterns in both Müllerian and Batesian mimicry are often determined by relatively few pattern-regulating loci with major effects. Many of these loci are “supergenes.” consisting of multiple. tightly linked epistatic elements. On the one hand. strong purifying selection on these genes must explain accurate resemblance (a reduction of morphological diversity between species). as well as monomorphic color patterns within species. On the other hand. mimicry has diversified at every taxonomic level; warning color has evolved from cryptic patterns. and there are mimetic polymorphisms within species. multiple color patterns in different geographic races of the same species. mimetic differences between sister species. and multiple mimicry rings within local communities.

To assess stratification empirically. we analyzed data from 11 case-control and case-cohort association studies. We did not detect statistically significant evidence for stratification but did observe that assessments based on a few dozen markers lack power to rule out moderate levels of stratification that could cause false positive associations in studies designed to detect modest genetic risk factors. After increasing the number of markers and samples in a case-cohort study (the design most immune to stratification). we found that stratification was in fact present.

We investigated SNPs using 871 patients and 863 controls. following up the top hits in four independent cohorts comprising 1.460 patients and 12.995 controls. all of European origin. We found no genome-wide significant associations. nor could we provide support for any previously reported candidate gene or genome-wide associations. We went on to examine CNVs using a subset of 1.013 cases and 1.084 controls of European ancestry. and a further set of 60 cases and 64 controls of African ancestry. We found that eight cases and zero controls carried deletions greater than 2 Mb. of which two. at 8p22 and 16p13.11-p12.4. are newly reported here. A further evaluation of 1.378 controls identified no deletions greater than 2 Mb. suggesting a high prior probability of disease involvement when such deletions are observed in cases. We also provide further evidence for some smaller. previously reported. schizophrenia-associated CNVs. such as those in NRXN1 and APBA2.

Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed. the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed. sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly. within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide. although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles. at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications.

The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets. including gene expression datasets. can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies. but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100.000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers. our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results. hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test.

However. recent analyses suggest that when all the genes expressed in a given tissue (notably placenta 1 and skeletal muscle 2) are examined. these genes do not map to random locations but instead resolve to clusters.

1232937,The genetic code is one in a million,1998,Stephen J Freeland and Laurence D Hurst,47,Journal of molecular evolution,3,238-248,Springer-Verlag, Statistical and biochemical studies of the genetic code have found evidence of nonrandom patterns in the distribution of codon assignments. It has. for example. been shown that the code minimizes the effects of point mutation or mistranslation: erroneous codons are either synonymous or code for an amino acid with chemical properties very similar to those of the one that would have been present had the error not occurred. This work has suggested that the second base of codons is less efficient in this respect. by about three orders of magnitude. than the first and third bases. These results are based on the assumption that all forms of error at all bases are equally likely.

There is some consensus that the solution to the mystery is that sex either enables the creation and spread of advantageous traits (possibly parasite resistance) or helps to purge the genome of deleterious mutations. Recent experimental work has allowed testing of some of the assumptions underlying the theoretical models. most particularly whether interactions between genes are synergistic and whether the mutation rate is adequately high.

The simultaneous use of multiple markers from a linkage group increases the sensitivity of the test statistic. and thus the power for the …,True,ZY9Lk6cAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,875,https://www.genetics.org/content/136/3/1195.short,2864146280373137638,/scholar?cites=2864146280373137638,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/136/3/1195.full.pdf,0,0,0

Empirical confidence intervals were calculated using a bootstrap resampling method for a backcross population derived from inbred lines. Sample sizes were either 200 or 500 individuals. and the QTL explained 1.5. or 10% of the phenotypic variance. The method worked well in that the proportion of empirical confidence intervals that contained the simulated QTL was close to expectation. In general. the confidence intervals were slightly conservatively biased. Correlations between the test statistic and the width of the confidence interval were strongly negative. so that the stronger the evidence for a QTL segregating. the smaller the empirical confidence interval for its location.

Two simple approaches using multiple markers are proposed. one using least squares and the other maximum likelihood. These methods are intended to provide a relatively fast screening of the entire genome to pinpoint regions of interest for further investigation. They are compared with a more traditional single-marker least-squares approach. The use of multiple markers is shown to increase power and has the advantage of providing an estimate for the location of the QTL. The maximum-likelihood and the least-squares approaches using multiple markers give similar power and estimates for the QTL location. although the likelihood approach also provides estimates of the QTL effect and sire heterozygote frequency.

First. these identify chromosomes containing loci controlling trait variation and subsequently attempt to map QTLs to locations within chromosomes. This population gives evidence for a large QTL affecting back fat and another for abdominal fat segregating on chromosome 4. The best locations for these QTLs are within 4 cM of each other and. hence. this is likely to be a single QTL affecting both traits.

Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed. the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed. sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly. within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide. although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles. at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions. attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions.

Using genome-wide marker data. we have previously demonstrated that the problem can be severe in a global sample of 95 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. and that established methods for controlling for population structure are generally insufficient. Here. we use the same sample together with a number of flowering-related phenotypes and data-perturbation simulations to evaluate a wider range of methods for controlling for population structure. We find that. in terms of reducing the false-positive rate while maintaining statistical power. a recently introduced mixed-model approach that takes genome-wide differences in relatedness into account via estimated pairwise kinship coefficients generally performs best. By combining the association results with results from linkage mapping in F2 crosses. we identify one previously known true positive and several promising new associations. but also demonstrate the existence of both false positives and false negatives. Our results illustrate the potential of genome-wide association scans as a tool for dissecting the genetics of natural variation. while at the same time highlighting the pitfalls.

The model includes deleterious mutations at loci throughout the genome. causing ‘background selection’. as well as a single locus at which a polymorphism is maintained. either by frequency-dependent selection or by local selective differences. These balanced polymorphisms induce long coalescence times at linked neutral loci. so that sequence diversity at these loci is enhanced at statistical equilibrium. We study how equilibrium neutral diversity levels are affected by the degree of population subdivision. the presence or absence of background selection. and the level of inbreeding of the population.

In recent years. neurophysiological anomalies have been identified in young and adult offspring of alcoholic probands. These neuroelectric features have been replicated in several laboratories across many different countries and are observed in male and female alcoholics and some of their relatives and offspring.

This is likely due. in part. to the heterogeneous nature of the construct of impulsivity. Many different measures of impulsivity have been employed in human studies. using both questionnaire and laboratory‐based tasks. Animal studies also use multiple tasks to assess the construct of impulsivity. In both human and animal studies. different measures of impulsivity often show little correlation and are differentially related to outcome. suggesting that the impulsivity construct may actually consist of a number of more homogeneous (and potentially more meaningful) subfacets.

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals.

This study was conducted to discover several hundreds of thousands of porcine SNPs using next generation sequencing technologies and use these SNPs. as well as others from different public sources. to design a high-density SNP genotyping assay.  Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 19 reduced representation libraries derived from four swine breeds (Duroc. Landrace. Large White. Pietrain) and a Wild Boar population and three restriction enzymes (AluI. HaeIII and MspI) were sequenced using Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA). The SNP discovery effort resulted in the de novo identification of over 372K SNPs. More than 549K SNPs were used to design the Illumina Porcine 60K+SNP iSelect Beadchip. now commercially available as the PorcineSNP60. A total of 64.232 SNPs were included on the Beadchip. Results from genotyping the 158 individuals used for sequencing showed a high overall SNP call rate (97.5%). Of the 62.621 loci that could be reliably scored. 58.994 were polymorphic yielding a SNP conversion success rate of 94%. The average minor allele frequency (MAF) for all scorable SNPs was 0.274.

The first genetic linkage map was published by Hutt (1936) followed by many revisions. with the latest published by Bitgood and Somes (1993). These early “classical” maps were based on feather colour. morphological. immunological and physiological genetic markers. As with most other livestock species. these classical maps have progressed slowly and ultimately 44 loci were mapped onto eight linkage groups. When international collaborative efforts to produce a molecular map of the chicken genome were established (Burt et al.. 1995a; Burt and Cheng. 1998). progress and interest in the chicken as a model genome have accelerated.

Associations were studied between these markers and two fatness traits: intramuscular fat content and backfat thickness. Association analyses were performed using interval mapping by regression under two genetic models: (1) an outbred line-cross model where the founder lines were assumed to be fixed for different QTL alleles; and (2) a half-sib model where a unique allele substitution effect was fitted within each of the 19 half-sib families. Both approaches revealed for backfat thickness a highly significant QTL on chromosome 7 and suggestive evidence for a QTL at chromosome 2. Furthermore. suggestive QTL affecting backfat thickness were detected on chromosomes 1 and 6 under the line-cross model.

1233075,Development of suitable photobioreactor for algae production–A review,2012,RN Singh and Shaishav Sharma,16,,4,2347-2353,Pergamon,Microalgal species are recently in the spotlight for biofuels production like biodiesel. bioethanol and biohydrogen. Algae are also used as a biofertiliser. source of nutrient and for controlling pollution. Algae being a photosynthetic organism are produced in the photo bioreactors. Hence the design and development of photobioreactors for maximum production of algae is very important.

Re-evaluation of literature-reported gold-catalyzed reactions revealed a significant difference in the reactivities with and without silver. In extreme cases (more than “rare”). the conventional [L-Au]+ catalysts could not promote the reaction without the presence of silver. This investigation has therefore revealed a long-overlooked “silver effect” in gold catalysis and should lead to revision of the actual mechanism.,True,PKr0chgAAAAJ:Dq_Ke-OEjMgC,412,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja303862z,10168253027389447169,/scholar?cites=10168253027389447169,,,0,0,0

A soluble SA-binding protein has been purified from tobacco with an affinity and specificity of binding that suggest it is a SA receptor. Recently. this protein has been shown to be a catalase whose enzymatic activity is inhibited by SA binding. We have proposed that the resulting increase in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species plays a role in the induction of defense responses such as PR protein gene expression. Here we report that INA. like SA. binds the SA-binding protein/catalase and inhibits its enzymatic activity.

The technique involves three steps: (i) restriction of the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters.

PCR amplification of restriction fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing.

Control of the disease has been hampered by a limited understanding of the genetic and biochemical bases of pathogenicity. including mechanisms of infection and of resistance in the host.

The mu opioid receptor is the primary site of action for the most commonly used opioids. including morphine. heroin. fentanyl. and methadone. By sequencing DNA from 113 former heroin addicts in methadone maintenance and 39 individuals with no history of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. we have identified five different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of the mu opioid receptor gene. The most prevalent SNP is a nucleotide substitution at position 118 (A118G). predicting an amino acid change at a putative N-glycosylation site.

Among many genes in this region. we selected eight transcripts expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle. heart and/or brain as the best candidates for the disease. We now report. in all five patients studied. unique mutations in one of the genes. STA: these mutations result in the loss of all or part of the protein.

Haplotype estimation in such cohorts is a central step in many downstream analyses. Using genotypes from six cohorts from isolated populations and two cohorts from non-isolated populations. we have investigated the performance of different phasing methods designed for nominally ‘unrelated’ individuals. We find that SHAPEIT2 produces much lower switch error rates in all cohorts compared to other methods. including those designed specifically for isolated populations. In particular. when large amounts of IBD sharing is present. SHAPEIT2 infers close to perfect haplotypes. Based on these results we have developed a general strategy for phasing cohorts with any level of implicit or explicit relatedness between individuals. First SHAPEIT2 is run ignoring all explicit family information. We then apply a novel HMM method (duoHMM) to combine the SHAPEIT2 haplotypes with any family information to infer the inheritance pattern of each meiosis at all sites across each chromosome. This allows the correction of switch errors. detection of recombination events and genotyping errors. We show that the method detects numbers of recombination events that align very well with expectations based on genetic maps. and that it infers far fewer spurious recombination events than Merlin. The method can also detect genotyping errors and infer recombination events in otherwise uninformative families. such as trios and duos. The detected recombination events can be used in association scans for recombination phenotypes.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T shows that passive viewing of beautiful female faces activates reward circuitry. in particular the nucleus accumbens. An extended set of subcortical and paralimbic reward regions also appear to follow aspects of the keypress rather than the rating procedures. suggesting that reward circuitry function does not include aesthetic assessment.,True,2UQAbkEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1462,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301004913,12820948084334772888,/scholar?cites=12820948084334772888,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627301004913,0,0,0

Forty-eight participants first completed a standard measure of gF (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices). They then performed verbal and nonverbal versions of a challenging working-memory task (three-back) while their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Trials within the three-back task varied greatly in the demand for attentional control because of differences in trial-to-trial interference. On high-interference trials specifically. participants with higher gF were more accurate and had greater event-related neural activity in several brain regions.

In The Invisible Gorilla. Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons. creators of one of psychology's most famous experiments. use remarkable stories and counterintuitive scientific findings to demonstrate an important truth: Our minds don't work the way we think they do. We think we see ourselves and the world as they really are. but we're actually missing a whole lot. Chabris and Simons combine the work of other researchers with their own findings on attention. perception. memory. and reasoning to reveal how faulty intuitions often get us into trouble. In the process. they explain:• Why a company would spend billions to launch a product that its own analysts know will fail• How a police officer could run right past a brutal assault without seeing it• Why award-winning movies are full of editing mistakes• What criminals have in common with chess masters• Why measles and other childhood diseases are making a comeback• Why money managers could learn a lot from weather forecasters Again and again. we think we experience and understand the world as it is. but our thoughts are beset by everyday illusions. We write traffic laws and build criminal cases on the assumption that people will notice when something unusual happens right in front of them. We're sure we know where we were on 9/11. falsely believing that vivid memories are seared into our minds with perfect fidelity.

Common variant alleles situated both in the promoter and structural region of the human MBL gene (MBL2) influence the stability and the serum concentration of the protein. Epidemiological studies have suggested that genetically determined variation in MBL serum concentration influences the susceptibility to and the course of different types of infections. autoimmune. metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. but this is still a subject of debate. The fact that these genetic variations are very frequent indicates a dual role for MBL in host defence.

Of several kinds of neural elements. ranging in size from ion channels to cytoarchitectonic divisions. the neuron is the fundamental building block. Understanding processes that control numbers of neurons in the brains of different animals at different stages of development is therefore of great importance. Two approaches can be taken to the problem of neuron number. The first is a cellular and molecular approach that focuses on final effects and final causes that regulate this variable in single species.

1233236,A new set of BXD recombinant inbred lines from advanced intercross populations in mice,2004,Jeremy L Peirce and Lu Lu and Jing Gu and Lee M Silver and Robert W Williams,5,BMC genetics,1,1-17,BioMed Central,Recombinant inbred (RI) strains are an important resource for mapping complex traits in many species. While large RI panels are available for Arabidopsis. maize. C. elegans. and Drosophila. mouse RI panels typically consist of fewer than 30 lines. This is a severe constraint on the power and precision of mapping efforts and greatly hampers analysis of epistatic interactions. In order to address these limitations and to provide the community with a more effective collaborative RI mapping panel we generated new BXD RI strains from two independent advanced intercrosses (AI) between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) progenitor strains. Progeny were intercrossed for 9 to 14 generations before initiating inbreeding. which is still ongoing for some strains. Since this AI base population is highly recombinant. the 46 advanced recombinant inbred (ARI) strains incorporate approximately twice as many recombinations as standard RI strains. a fraction of which are inevitably shared by descent. When combined with the existing BXD RI strains. the merged BXD strain set triples the number of previously available unique recombinations and quadruples the total number of recombinations in the BXD background. The combined BXD strain set is the largest mouse RI mapping panel. It is a powerful tool for collaborative analysis of quantitative traits and gene function that will be especially useful to study variation in transcriptome and proteome data sets under multiple environments. Additional strains also extend the value of the extensive phenotypic characterization of the previously available strains.

Profilin isolated from platelets binds with high affinity to small clusters of phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules in micelles and also in bilayers with other phospholipids. The molar ratio of the complex of profilin with PIP2 is 1:7 in micelles of pure PIP2 and 1:5 in bilayers composed largely of other phospholipids. Profilin competes efficiently with platelet cytosolic phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C for interaction with the PIP2 substrate and thereby inhibits PIP2 hydrolysis by this enzyme.

1233283,Principles of crop improvement.,1979,Norman Willison Simmonds,,Principles of crop improvement.,,,Longman.,"A chapter on trials and multiplication outlines the steps required for the accurate assessment of varietal performance in designed experiments. Attention is drawn to the erroneous conclusions which will probably be reached when varieties are compared at an inadequate number of trial sites. Varietal registration and multiplication schemes are discussed and methods used in the production of hybrid varieties are enumerated. The approaches to disease resistance have evolved rapidly during the past 15 years. In the fourth of the main chapters on basic principles. it is emphasized that ecological disruption. brought about by extensive monocultures with a narrow genetic base. is at the root of the problem of crop vulnerability. Some of the shortcomings of both specific and broadly based resistance types are indicated and a number of examples are given of differing attempts in the development of durable resistance. There is a chapter on special techniques which are. or may become. useful for breeding breeding Subject Category: Techniques. Methodologies and Equipmentsee more details. The topics included are polyploidy. wide crossing. haploidy. mutagenesis and in vitro methods. Professor Simmonds has permitted himself to judge the extent to which each technique has fulfilled the potential originally expected of it.

A cost-effective and efficient approach for the development of a custom genotyping assay interrogating 54.001 SNP loci to support GWA applications in cattle is described. A novel algorithm for achieving a compressed inter-marker interval distribution proved remarkably successful. with median interval of 37 kb and maximum predicted gap of <350 kb. The assay was tested on a panel of 576 animals from 21 cattle breeds and six outgroup species and revealed that from 39.765 to 46.492 SNP are polymorphic within individual breeds (average minor allele frequency (MAF) ranging from 0.24 to 0.27). The assay also identified 79 putative copy number variants in cattle. Utility for GWA was demonstrated by localizing known variation for coat color and the presence/absence of horns to their correct genomic locations. The combination of SNP selection and the novel spacing algorithm allows an efficient approach for the development of high-density genotyping platforms in species having full or even moderate quality draft sequence. Aspects of the approach can be exploited in species which lack an available genome sequence.

Discounting. or preference for immediate over delayed rewards of larger value. is often associated with impulsivity and is a risk factor for addictive disorders such as pathological gambling. cigarette smoking. and drug and alcohol abuse. The ventral striatum (VS) is involved in mediating behavioral responses and physiological states associated with reward. and dysregulation of the VS contributes to addiction. perhaps by affecting impulsive decision-making. Behavioral tests of delay discounting (DD). which index preference for smaller immediate over larger delayed rewards. covary with impulsive tendencies in humans.

Chr9p21 encodes the long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL). ANRIL expression is associated with the Chr9p21 genotype and correlated with atherosclerosis severity. Here. we report on the molecular mechanisms through which ANRIL regulates target-genes in trans. leading to increased cell proliferation. increased cell adhesion and decreased apoptosis. which are all essential mechanisms of atherogenesis. Importantly. trans-regulation was dependent on Alu motifs. which marked the promoters of ANRIL target genes and were mirrored in ANRIL RNA transcripts. ANRIL bound Polycomb group proteins that were highly enriched in the proximity of Alu motifs across the genome and were recruited to promoters of target genes upon ANRIL over-expression. The functional relevance of Alu motifs in ANRIL was confirmed by deletion and mutagenesis. reversing trans-regulation and atherogenic cell functions. ANRIL-regulated networks were confirmed in 2280 individuals with and without coronary artery disease and functionally validated in primary cells from patients carrying the Chr9p21 risk allele.

Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing. we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells. cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly ‘housekeeping’. whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs. with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates. whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved.

Immunologists are now trying to understand the properties of these interesting molecules. Evidence suggests that T cell alpha beta receptors recognize a complex of an antigen-derived peptide bound to one of the cell-surface products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. It is likely that alpha beta receptors and MHC proteins have coevolved to have some affinity for each other. During T cell development in the thymus. cells bearing self-reactive receptors are deleted by the mechanisms of tolerance. and cells are preferentially allowed to mature if they bear receptors that will be able to recognize antigen plus self-MHC after they have become full-fledged T cells.

By a genome-wide association study (320 patients and 1.500 controls) and subsequent replication altogether involving a total of 3.300 Asian SLE patients from Hong Kong. Mainland China. and Thailand. as well as 4.200 ethnically and geographically matched controls. genetic variants in ETS1 and WDFY4 were found to be associated with SLE (ETS1: rs1128334. P = 2.33×10−11. OR = 1.29; WDFY4: rs7097397. P = 8.15×10−12. OR = 1.30). ETS1 encodes for a transcription factor known to be involved in a wide range of immune functions. including Th17 cell development and terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. SNP rs1128334 is located in the 3′-UTR of ETS1. and allelic expression analysis from peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed significantly lower expression level from the risk allele. WDFY4 is a conserved protein with unknown function. but is predominantly expressed in primary and secondary immune tissues. and rs7097397 in WDFY4 changes an arginine residue to glutamine (R1816Q) in this protein. Our study also confirmed association of the HLA locus. STAT4. TNFSF4. BLK. BANK1. IRF5. and TNFAIP3 with SLE in Asians.

New advances in this research direction are expected to play a key role in identifying loci that are different among different populations and are still associated with a disease.

Beyond this period of development. an essential biochemical dialogue develops between the conceptus (embryo and extraembryonic membranes) and maternal unit that permits development of a histotrophic uterine environment through the continued secretion of progesterone that is essential for continued development of the conceptus. Regulation of the lifespan of the corpus luteum (Cl). to sustain progesterone secretion. is critical for successful pregnancy in cattle. Failure of the conceptus to maintain CL function undoubtedly contributes to embryonic mortality.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The authors sought to determine whether developmental differences in the magnitude of embryonic mortality caused by heat stress in vivo are caused by changes in resistance of embryos to elevated temperature. In this regard. responses of oocytes. two‐cell embryos. four‐ to eight‐cell embryos. and compacted morulae to heat shock were compared. An additional goal was to define further the role of cumulus cells and glutathione in thermoprotection of oocytes.

They are but one category of the many secondary metabolites implicated in plant allelopathy. Phenolic allelochemicals have been observed in both natural and managed ecosystems. where they cause a number of ecological and economic problems. such as declines in crop yield due to soil sickness. regeneration failure of natural forests. and replanting problems in orchards. Phenolic allelochemical structures and modes of action are diverse and may offer potential lead compounds for the development of future herbicides or pesticides. This article reviews allelopathic effects. analysis methods. and allelopathic mechanisms underlying the activity of plant phenolic compounds. Additionally. the currently debated topic in plant allelopathy of whether catechin and 8-hydroxyquinoline play an important role in Centaurea maculata and Centaurea diffusa invasion success is discussed.

In SMRT sequencing. DNA polymerases catalyze the incorporation of fluorescently labeled nucleotides into complementary nucleic acid strands. The arrival times and durations of the resulting fluorescence pulses yield information about polymerase kinetics and allow direct detection of modified nucleotides in the DNA template. including N6-methyladenine. 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Measurement of polymerase kinetics is an intrinsic part of SMRT sequencing and does not adversely affect determination of primary DNA sequence. The various modifications affect polymerase kinetics differently. allowing discrimination between them.

This structure consists of a double-stranded portion. containing the insert of interest. and a single-stranded hairpin loop on either end. which provides a site for primer binding. Structurally. this format resembles a linear double-stranded molecule. and yet it is topologically circular. When placed into a single-molecule sequencing reaction. the SMRTbell template format enables a consensus sequence to be obtained from multiple passes on a single molecule. Furthermore. this consensus sequence is obtained from both the sense and antisense strands of the insert region.

Being at the bottomof many natural food chains. metal-accumulating plants are direcdy or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the dietary uptake of toxic heavy metals by humans and animals (2). While some heavy metals are required for life. their excessive accumulation in living organisms is always toxic. The danger of heavy metals is aggravated by their almost indefinite persistence in the environment. For example. lead (Pb). which is one of the more persistent metals. was estimated to have a soil retention time from 150 to 5000years (3).Heavy metals are present in soils as natural components or as a result of human activity.

Recall was high for behaviors that were incongruent with a personality-trait impression for a character. whereas recall was much lower for behaviors that were congruent or neutral with reference to the impression. Set size. the number of congruent and incongruent behaviors attributed to the character. was shown to be a major determinant of this result. The smaller the size of the incongruent set. the higher the probability of recalling an item from the set. There was no tendency for behaviors to cluster by trait category in recall output protocols.

Different services have different quality (QoS) requirements. maximum power and/or minimum rate constraints. In order to achieve the required QoS they can alter their power and/or rate of transmission. Different rates are represented by varying the processing gain.

The analysis examines the ability of these embankments to maintain the structural integrity of thaw-unstable permafrost that often underlies roadway or airport embankments in northern climates. As a result of low ambient temperatures acting on the embankment surface during winter months. an unstable density stratification develops in the embankment. Buoyancy-driven convection of the pore air occurs in reaction to the density gradient. The convection enhances the upward transport of heat out of the embankment during winter months. thus cooling the lower portions of the embankment and underlying foundation soil.

To complement genome-wide association (GWA) studies. we conducted a large and systematic candidate gene study of CAD susceptibility. including analysis of many uncommon and functional variants. We examined 49.094 genetic variants in ∼2.100 genes of cardiovascular relevance. using a customised gene array in 15.596 CAD cases and 34.992 controls (11.202 cases and 30.733 controls of European descent; 4.394 cases and 4.259 controls of South Asian origin). We attempted to replicate putative novel associations in an additional 17.121 CAD cases and 40.473 controls. Potential mechanisms through which the novel variants could affect CAD risk were explored through association tests with vascular risk factors and gene expression. We confirmed associations of several previously known CAD susceptibility loci (eg. 9p21.3:p<10−33; LPA:p<10−19; 1p13.3:p<10−17) as well as three recently discovered loci (COL4A1/COL4A2. ZC3HC1.

A Wiley Company,Van Buchem disease is an autosomal recessive sclerosing bone dysplasia characterized by skeletal hyperostosis. overgrowth of the mandible. and a liability to entrapment of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves. The genetic determinant maps to chromosome 17q12‐q21. We refined the critical interval to the < 1‐Mb region between D17S2250 and D17S2253 in 15 affected individuals. all of whom shared a common disease haplotype. Furthermore. we report here the identification of a 52‐kb deletion located within the interval and encompassing D17S1789 that is 100% concordant with the disorder. Although the deletion itself does not appear to disrupt the coding region of any known or novel gene(s). the closest flanking genes are MEOX1 on the proximal side. and SOST on the distal side of the deletion. MEOX1 is known to be important for the development of the axial skeleton. whereas the SOST gene is the …,True,NMlgf5oAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,302,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajmg.10401,13686081518320638462,/scholar?cites=13686081518320638462,,http://www.mm3admin.co.za/documents/docmanager/6e64f7e1-715e-4fd6-8315-424683839664/00021391.pdf,0,0,0

We also investigated the genomic basis of divergence among the cultivated populations and discovered a natural genetic variant in a β-carotene hydroxylase gene that could be used to breed cucumbers with enhanced nutritional value.

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes.

However. new tools and technologies. massive amounts of data. interdisciplinary approaches. and the complexity of the questions being asked are complicating replication efforts. as are increased pressures on scientists to advance their research [2]. As full replication of studies on independently collected data is often not feasible. there has recently been a call for reproducible research as an attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scientific claims [3]. This requires that papers in experimental science describe the results and provide a sufficiently clear protocol to allow successful repetition and extension of analyses based on original data [4]. The importance of replication and reproducibility has recently been exemplified through studies showing that scientific papers commonly leave out experimental details essential for reproduction [5]. studies showing difficulties with replicating published experimental results [6]. an increase in retracted papers [7]. and through a high number of failing clinical trials [8. 9]. This has led to discussions on how individual researchers. institutions. funding bodies. and journals can establish routines that increase transparency and reproducibility. In order to foster such aspects. it has been suggested that the scientific community needs to develop a ‘‘culture of reproducibility’’for computational science. and to require it for published claims [3]. We want to emphasize that reproducibility is not only a moral responsibility with respect to the scientific field. but that a lack of reproducibility can also be a burden for you as an individual researcher.

In western Eurasia this transition. the Upper Paleolithic. occurred about 45.000 years ago. but many of its features appear transiently in southern Africa about 45.000 years earlier. We show that demography is a major determinant in the maintenance of cultural complexity and that variation in regional subpopulation density and/or migratory activity results in spatial structuring of cultural skill accumulation. Genetic estimates of regional population size over time show that densities in early Upper Paleolithic Europe were similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa when modern behavior first appeared.

The extent to which these early European farmers were immigrants or descendants of resident hunter-gatherers who had adopted farming has been widely debated. We compared new mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from late European hunter-gatherer skeletons with those from early farmers and from modern Europeans. We find large genetic differences between all three groups that cannot be explained by population continuity alone. Most (82%) of the ancient hunter-gatherers share mtDNA types that are relatively rare in central Europeans today. Together. these analyses provide persuasive evidence that the first farmers were not the descendants of local hunter-gatherers but immigrated into central Europe at the onset of the Neolithic.,True,MaVPgCAAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,568,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/137.abstract,8077476042129958070,/scholar?cites=8077476042129958070,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/9098/1/IR-09-058.pdf,0,0,0

Middle Eastern and southern Asian groups. is rare or absent elsewhere in the world. Lactase gene haplotype conservation around a polymorphism strongly associated with LP in Europeans (−13.910 C/T) indicates that the derived allele is recent in origin and has been subject to strong positive selection. Furthermore. ancient DNA work has shown that the −13.910*T (derived) allele was very rare or absent in early Neolithic central Europeans. It is unlikely that LP would provide a selective advantage without a supply of fresh milk. and this has lead to a gene-culture coevolutionary model where lactase persistence is only favoured in cultures practicing dairying. and dairying is more favoured in lactase persistent populations. We have developed a flexible demic computer simulation model to explore the spread of lactase persistence. dairying. other subsistence practices and unlinked genetic markers in Europe and western Asia's geographic space. Using data on −13.910*T allele frequency and farming arrival dates across Europe. and approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters of interest. we infer that the −13.910*T allele first underwent selection among dairying farmers around 7.500 years ago in a region between the central Balkans and central Europe. possibly in association with the dissemination of the Neolithic Linearbandkeramik culture over Central Europe.

This raises two questions: how to represent human population genetic structure in the evaluation of drug safety and efficacy. and how to relate this structure to drug response. We address these by (i) inferring the genetic structure present in a heterogeneous sample and (ii) comparing the distribution of DME variants across the inferred genetic clusters of individuals.

Some have argued for the “culture-historical hypothesis.” whereby LP alleles were rare until the advent of dairying early in the Neolithic but then rose rapidly in frequency under natural selection. Others favor the “reverse cause hypothesis.” whereby dairying was adopted in populations with preadaptive high LP allele frequencies.

The ECRHS has shown that there are large geographical differences in the prevalence of asthma. atopy and bronchial responsiveness. with high prevalence rates in English speaking countries and low prevalence rates in the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe. Analyses of risk factors have highlighted the importance of occupational exposure for asthma in adulthood. The association between sensitization to individual allergens and bronchial responsiveness was strongest for indoor allergens (mite and cat). Analysis of treatment practices has confirmed that the treatment of asthma varies widely between countries and that asthma is often undertreated. In conclusion. the European Community Respiratory Health Survey has shown that the prevalence of asthma varies widely. The fact that the geographical pattern is consistent with the distribution of atopy and bronchial responsiveness supports the conclusion that the geographical variations in the prevalence of asthma are true and most likely due to environmental factors.,True,-WDQHjm32G4J:9yKSN-GCB0IC,507,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11589359,16416359524096481491,/scholar?cites=16416359524096481491,,,0,0,0

However. a subset of these tumours are extratesticular and mostly arise from paratesticular tissue. The paratesticular region is a complex anatomical area which includes the contents of the spermatic cord. testicular tunics. epididymis and vestigial remnants. eg the appendices epididymis and testis [1]. Histogenetically. this area is composed of a variety of epithelial. mesothelial and mesenchymal elements. Neoplasms arising from this region therefore form a heterogeneous group of tumours with different behavioural patterns. On rare occasions. tumours from distant sites may metastasize to the paratesticular region [2].

Ltd,Background: Surgical mortality data are collected routinely in high-income countries. yet virtually no low-or middle-income countries have outcome surveillance in place. The aim was prospectively to collect worldwide mortality data following emergency abdominal surgery. comparing findings across countries with a low. middle or high Human Development Index (HDI).Methods: This was a prospective. multicentre. cohort study. Self-selected hospitals performing emergency surgery submitted prespecified data for consecutive patients from at least one 2-week interval during July to December 2014. Postoperative mortality was analysed by hierarchical multivariable logistic regression.Results: Data were obtained for 10 745 patients from 357 centres in 58 countries; 6538 were from high-. 2889 from middle-and 1318 from low-HDI settings. The overall mortality rate was 1⋅ 6 per cent at 24 h (high 1⋅ 1 per cent. middle 1⋅ 9 per cent. low 3⋅ 4 per cent; P< 0⋅ 001). increasing to 5⋅ 4 per cent by 30 days (high 4⋅ 5 per cent. middle 6⋅ 0 per cent. low 8⋅ 6 per cent; P< 0⋅ 001). Of the 578 patients who died. 404 (69⋅ 9 per cent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74⋅ 2 per cent. middle 68⋅ 8 per cent. low 60⋅ 5 per cent).

However. the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular. Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus. there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately. currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations. We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC). a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking. DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data. providing assignment of individuals to groups. a visual assessment of between-population differentiation. and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data. which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally. we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza.

Among landscape variables. space is often considered as one of the most important. To reveal spatial patterns. a statistical method should be spatially explicit. that is. it should directly take spatial information into account as a component of the adjusted model or of the optimized criterion. In this paper we propose a new spatially explicit multivariate method. spatial principal component analysis (sPCA). to investigate the spatial pattern of genetic variability using allelic frequency data of individuals or populations. This analysis does not require data to meet Hardy–Weinberg expectations or linkage equilibrium to exist between loci. The sPCA yields scores summarizing both the genetic variability and the spatial structure among individuals (or populations).

Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable. and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data. such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site‐by‐species abundance tables. with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis.

The adoption of host resistance has proven to be the most economical and effective approach to control rice blast. In recent years. sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for the improvement of crops via gene-specific genome editing. and CRISPR/Cas9 is thought to be the most effective SSN. Here. we report the improvement of rice blast resistance by engineering a CRISPR/Cas9 SSN (C-ERF922) targeting the OsERF922 gene in rice. Twenty-one C-ERF922-induced mutant plants (42.0%) were identified from 50 T0 transgenic plants. Sanger sequencing revealed that these plants harbored various insertion or deletion (InDel) mutations at the target site. We showed that all of the C-ERF922-induced allele mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations. Mutant plants harboring the desired gene modification but not containing the transferred DNA were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations.

Genomic evolution has been difficult to delineate during invasion due to intratumor heterogeneity and the low number of tumor cells in the ducts. To overcome these challenges. we developed Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) to measure genomic copy number profiles of single tumor cells while preserving their spatial context in tissue sections. We applied TSCS to 1.293 single cells from 10 synchronous patients with both DCIS and IDC regions in addition to exome sequencing.

ANC-1 is shown to consist of mostly coiled regions with a nuclear envelope localization domain (called the KASH domain) and an actin-binding domain; this structure was conserved with theDrosophila protein Msp-300 and the mammalian Syne proteins. Antibodies against ANC-1 localized cytoplasmically and were enriched at the nuclear periphery in an UNC-84–dependent manner. Overexpression of the KASH domain or the actin-binding domain caused a dominant negative anchorage defect. Thus.

1233711,Accurate normalization of real-time quantitative RT-PCR data by geometric averaging of multiple internal control genes,2002,Jo Vandesompele and Katleen De Preter and Filip Pattyn and Bruce Poppe and Nadine Van Roy and Anne De Paepe and Frank Speleman,3,Genome biology,7,1-12,BioMed Central,Gene-expression analysis is increasingly important in biological research. with real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) becoming the method of choice for high-throughput and accurate expression profiling of selected genes. Given the increased sensitivity. reproducibility and large dynamic range of this methodology. the requirements for a proper internal control gene for normalization have become increasingly stringent. Although housekeeping gene expression has been reported to vary considerably. no systematic survey has properly determined the errors related to the common practice of using only one control gene. nor presented an adequate way of working around this problem. We outline a robust and innovative strategy to identify the most stably expressed control genes in a given set of tissues. and to determine the minimum number of genes required to calculate a reliable normalization factor. We have evaluated ten housekeeping genes from different abundance and functional classes in various human tissues. and demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relatively large errors in a significant proportion of samples tested. The geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping genes was validated as an accurate normalization factor by analyzing publicly available microarray data. The normalization strategy presented here is a prerequisite for accurate RT-PCR expression profiling. which. among other things. opens up the possibility of studying the biological relevance of small expression differences.,True,rhWqDgUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,17792,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-research0034?utm_source=xmol&utm_medium=display&utm_content=article_highlight&utm_campaign=BSCN_1_JG02_CN_GBIO_20Years_AH_paid_display_XMOL,10339963667484587183,/scholar?cites=10339963667484587183,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-research0034?utm_source=xmol&utm_medium=display&utm_content=article_highlight&utm_campaign=BSCN_1_JG02_CN_GBIO_20Years_AH_paid_display_XMOL,0,0,0

In MYCN single-copy neuroblastomas. elevated MYCN mRNA and protein levels are paradoxically associated with a more favorable clinical phenotype. including disseminated tumors that subsequently regress spontaneously (stage 4s-non-amplified). In this study. we asked whether distinct transcriptional MYCN or c-MYC activities are associated with specific neuroblastoma phenotypes. We defined a core set of direct MYCN/c-MYC target genes by applying gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP. ChIP-chip) in neuroblastoma cells that allow conditional regulation of MYCN and c-MYC. Their transcript levels were analyzed in 251 primary neuroblastomas. Compared to localized-non-amplified neuroblastomas. MYCN/c-MYC target gene expression gradually increases from stage 4s-non-amplified through stage 4-non-amplified to MYCN amplified tumors. This was associated with MYCN activation in stage 4s-non-amplified and predominantly c-MYC activation in stage 4-non-amplified tumors. A defined set of MYCN/c-MYC target genes was induced in stage 4-non-amplified but not in stage 4s-non-amplified neuroblastomas.

To probe this involvement. we asked how ubiquitylation regulates the activity of a transcription factor containing the VP16 TAD. We show that the VP16 TAD signals ubiquitylation through the Met30 ubiquitin-ligase and that Met30 is also required for the VP16 TAD to activate transcription. The requirement for Met30 in transcription is circumvented by fusion of ubiquitin to the VP16 activator. demonstrating that activator ubiquitylation is essential for transcriptional activation.

Microarray expression analysis was used to determine whether global biological differences underlie common pathological features of prostate cancer and to identify genes that might anticipate the clinical behavior of this disease. While no expression correlates of age. serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). and measures of local invasion were found. a set of genes was identified that strongly correlated with the state of tumor differentiation as measured by Gleason score. Moreover. a model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy.

To explore the molecular differences between human primary tumors and metastases. we compared the gene-expression profiles of adenocarcinoma metastases of multiple tumor types to unmatched primary adenocarcinomas. We found a gene-expression signature that distinguished primary from metastatic adenocarcinomas. More notably. we found that a subset of primary tumors resembled metastatic tumors with respect to this gene-expression signature. We confirmed this finding by applying the expression signature to data on 279 primary solid tumors of diverse types. We found that solid tumors carrying the gene-expression signature were most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome (P< 0.03).

We first identify AR activation inhibitors. including a group of structurally related compounds comprising celastrol. gedunin. and derivatives. To develop an in silico approach for target pathway identification. we apply a gene expression-based analysis that classifies HSP90 inhibitors as having similar activity to celastrol and gedunin.

The proteins encoded by these multiple genes regulate distinct functions. We show here a functional link between tumors with VHL mutations and those with disruption of the genes encoding for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits B (SDHB) and D (SDHD). A transcription profile of reduced oxidoreductase is detected in all three of these tumor types. together with an angiogenesis/hypoxia profile typical of VHL dysfunction. The oxidoreductase defect. not previously detected in VHL-null tumors. is explained by suppression of the SDHB protein. a component of mitochondrial complex II. The decrease in SDHB is also noted in tumors with SDHD mutations. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses show that the link between hypoxia signals (via VHL) and mitochondrial signals (via SDH) is mediated by HIF1α.

In addition. functional studies revealed this regulation to be critical for maintaining CDK2 kinase activity and growth of melanoma cells. Expression levels of MITF and CDK2 are tightly correlated in primary melanoma specimens and predict susceptibility to the CDK2 inhibitor roscovitine. CDK2 depletion suppressed growth and cell cycle progression in melanoma. but not other cancers. corroborating previous results.

Herein. we present a compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human sample population with an intermediate level of resolution of CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained a DNA methylation fingerprint of 1628 human samples in which we interrogated 1505 CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this epigenetic mark to be critical in tissue-type definition and stemness. particularly around transcription start sites that are not within a CpG island.

Although the signature that natural selection imparts on DNA sequence variation is difficult to disentangle from the effects of neutral processes such as population demographic history. selective and demographic forces can be distinguished by analyzing multiple loci dispersed throughout the genome. We studied the molecular evolution of 132 genes by comprehensively resequencing them in 24 African-Americans and 23 European-Americans. We developed a rigorous computational approach for taking into account multiple hypothesis tests and demographic history and found that while many apparent selective events can instead be explained by demography. there is also strong evidence for positive or balancing selection at eight genes in the European-American population. but none in the African-American population. Our results suggest that the migration of modern humans out of Africa into new environments was accompanied by genetic adaptations to emergent selective forces.

Notably. pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) are characterized by high mutation rates. We hypothesize that hypermutability is a property of ASD genes and may also include nucleotide-substitution hot spots. We investigated global patterns of germline mutation by whole-genome sequencing of monozygotic twins concordant for ASD and their parents. Mutation rates varied widely throughout the genome (by 100-fold) and could be explained by intrinsic characteristics of DNA sequence and chromatin structure. Dense clusters of mutations within individual genomes were attributable to compound mutation or gene conversion. Hypermutability was a characteristic of genes involved in ASD and other diseases.

Here we develop a method to estimate haplotypes from low-coverage sequencing data that can take advantage of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotypes on the same samples. First the SNP array data are phased to build a backbone (or ‘scaffold’) of haplotypes across each chromosome. We then phase the sequence data ‘onto’this haplotype scaffold. This approach can take advantage of relatedness between sequenced and non-sequenced samples to improve accuracy.

UNIV OF WROCLAW,During the last decade microsatellites or SSRs (simple sequence repeats) have been proven to be the markers of choice in plant genetics research and for breeding purposes because of their hypervariability and ease of detection. However. development of these markers is expensive. labour intensive and time consuming. in particular. if they are being developed from genomic libraries. In the context of large-scale sequencing and genomics programmes in various cereal species at different laboratories. a large set of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is being generated. which can be used to search for microsatellites. Keeping in view the importance of such type of SSRs. available ESTs of some cereal species like barley. maize. oats. rice. rye and wheat were investigated for a study of abundance. frequency and distribution of various types of microsatellites. SSRs were present in about 7% to 10% of the total ESTs in the investigated cereal genomes. On the basis of surveying EST sequences amounting to 75.2 Mb in barley. 54.7 Mb in maize. 43.9 Mb in rice. 3.7 Mb in rye. 41.6 Mb in sorghum and 37.5 Mb in wheat. the frequency of SSRs was 1/7.5 kb in barley. 1/7.5 kb in maize. 1/6.2 kb in wheat. 1/5.5 kb in rye and sorghum and 1/3.9 kb in rice. The overall average SSR frequency for these species is 1/6.0 kb. Trimeric repeats are the most abundant (54% to 78%) class of microsatellites followed by dimeric repeats (17% to 40%).

The p105 precursor of the p50 subunit of NF-κB is processed in vitro by an ATP-dependent process that requires proteasomes and ubiquitin conjugation. The C-terminal region of p105 is rapidly degraded. leaving the N-terminal p50 domain. p105 processing can be blocked in intact cells with inhibitors of the proteasome or in yeast with proteasome mutants. These inhibitors also block the activation of NF-κB and the rapid degradation of IκBα induced by tumor necrosis factor α.

Many different residues can be covalently modified. and it has been suggested that these modifications occur in a great number of independent. meaningful combinations. Published low-resolution microarray studies on the combinatorial complexity of histone modification patterns suffer from confounding effects caused by the averaging of modification levels over multiple nucleosomes. To overcome this problem. we used a high-resolution tiled microarray with single-nucleosome resolution to investigate the occurrence of combinations of 12 histone modifications on thousands of nucleosomes in actively growing S. cerevisiae. We found that histone modifications do not occur independently; there are roughly two groups of co-occurring modifications. One group of lysine acetylations shows a sharply defined domain of two hypo-acetylated nucleosomes. adjacent to the transcriptional start site. whose occurrence does not correlate with transcription levels. The other group consists of modifications occurring in gradients through the coding regions of genes in a pattern associated with transcription. We found no evidence for a deterministic code of many discrete states. but instead we saw blended. continuous patterns that distinguish nucleosomes at one location (e.g.. promoter nucleosomes) from those at another location (e.g.. over the 3′ ends of coding regions).

We find that nucleosomes at promoters are replaced more rapidly than at coding regions and that replacement rates over coding regions correlate with polymerase density.

Although various studies have assessed OPN protein levels in several tumor types. a broad survey of OPN expression in human neoplasia under the same experimental conditions has not been carried out.Experimental Design: We used immunohistochemistry to detect OPN in a selection of 350 human tumors and 113 normal tissues. from a variety of body sites. using stage-oriented human cancer tissue arrays. Tumors included malignancies from breast (26). ovary (22). endometrium (14). esophagus (10). stomach (11). pancreas (16). bile duct (1). liver (9). colon (20). kidney (53). bladder (33). prostate (28). head and neck (60). salivary glands (14). lung (17). skin (6). and brain (10).Results: High cytoplasmic OPN staining was observed …,True,lXmPFIwAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,555,https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/10/1/184.short,11677830598176441239,/scholar?cites=11677830598176441239,,https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/10/1/184.full.pdf,0,0,0
1233839,Osteopontin identified as lead marker of colon cancer progression. using pooled sample expression profiling,2002,Deepak Agrawal and Tingan Chen and Rosalyn Irby and John Quackenbush and Ann F Chambers and Marianna Szabo and Alan Cantor and Domenico Coppola and Timothy J Yeatman,94,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7,513-521,Oxford University Press, Background: New tumor markers and markers of tumor progression are needed for improved staging and for better assessment of treatment of many cancers. Gene expression profiling techniques offer the opportunity to discover such markers. We investigated the feasibility of sample pooling strategy in combination with a novel analysis algorithm to identify markers. Methods: Total RNA from human colon tumors (n = 60) of multiple stages (adenomas; cancers with modified Astler Collier stages B. C. and D; and liver metastases) were pooled within stages and compared with pooled normal mucosal specimens (n = 10) by using oligonucleotide expression arrays. Genes that showed consistent increases or decreases in their expression through tumor progression were identified. Northern blot analysis was used to validate the findings. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: More than 300 candidate …,True,lXmPFIwAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,521,https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/94/7/513/2520128,5834792035471926853,/scholar?cites=5834792035471926853,,https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/94/7/513/2520128,0,0,0

We used a gene expression profile derived from invasive. murine colon cancer cells that were highly metastatic in an immunocompetent mouse model to identify patients with colon cancer at risk of recurrence.This phase 1. exploratory biomarker study used 55 patients with colorectal cancer from Vanderbilt Medical Center (VMC) as the training dataset and 177 patients from the Moffitt Cancer Center as the independent dataset. The metastasis-associated gene expression profile developed from the mouse model was refined with comparative functional genomics in the VMC gene expression profiles to identify a 34-gene classifier associated with high risk of metastasis and death from colon cancer. A metastasis score derived from the biologically based classifier was tested in the Moffitt dataset.A high score …,True,lXmPFIwAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C,491,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508509019647,15580219362569748572,/scholar?cites=15580219362569748572,,https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(09)01964-7/fulltext,0,0,0

Subjects aged 60–69 are being invited to complete three guaiac faecal occult blood tests (6 windows) every 2 years. The programme aims to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer by 16% in those invited for screening.All subjects eligible for screening in the National Health Service in England are included on one database. which is populated from National Health Service registration data covering about 98% of the population of England. This analysis is only of subjects invited to participate in the first (prevalent) round of screening.By October 2008 almost 2.1 million had been invited to participate. with tests being returned by 49.6% of men and 54.4% of women invited.

More accurate measures of differential expression and effective data-normalization strategies are required to identify high-confidence sets of genes with biologically meaningful changes in transcription. Further. the analysis of a large number of expression profiles is facilitated by a common reference sample. the construction of which must be carefully addressed. We carried out a series of 'self-self' hybridizations in which aliquots of the same RNA sample were labeled separately with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes and co-hybridized to the same microarray. From this. we can analyze the intensity-dependent behavior of microarray data. define a statistically significant measure of differential expression that exploits the structure of the fluorescent signals. and …,True,lXmPFIwAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,460,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2002-3-11-research0062,6286856377411060394,/scholar?cites=6286856377411060394,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2002-3-11-research0062,0,0,0
