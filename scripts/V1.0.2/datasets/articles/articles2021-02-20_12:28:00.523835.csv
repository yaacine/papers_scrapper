Three types of commercial clays and one commercial zeolite were initially tested using standard solution; however. only one clay with the best removability and the zeolite were tested with pretreated leachate. The chosen clay sorption capacity with the standard solution reached 83%. while with the pretreated leachate solution has reached 95% and zeolites have reached. respectively. a removal of 73% and 81%. For this two adsorbents’ studies of equilibrium and kinetic of the sorption were also performed.

Except for natural clay. chemical pretreatment was required to increase the adsorption capacity of the treatment materials. All the clays wereexposed to microcystin solutions of 0.5x10-3. 1.0x10-3 and 10.0x10-3 ?g/mL in batch purification processes. The same solutions were used in purification processes with polymeric resins packed in columns. The microcystin- LR samples were quantified using ELISA immunoassay and removal capabilities and saturation of the treatment materials were evaluated. The modified clays showed a microcystin-LR removal efficiency rate between 82.90% and 99.86%. while the resins a rate between 87.6% and 99.74%.

1078501,Stability of soft magnetic helical microrobots,2020,Kiarash Samsami and Seyed Amir Mirbagheri and Farshad Meshkati and Henry Chien Fu,5,Fluids,1,19,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Nano/microrobotic swimmers have many possible biomedical applications such as drug delivery and micro-manipulation. This paper examines one of the most promising classes of these: rigid magnetic microrobots that are propelled through bulk fluid by rotation induced by a rotating magnetic field. Propulsion corresponds to steadily rotating and translating solutions of the dynamics of such microrobots that co-rotate with the magnetic field. To be observed in experiments and be amenable to steering control. such solutions must also be stable to perturbations. In this paper. we analytically derive a criterion for the stability of such steadily rotating solutions for a microrobot made of soft magnetic materials. which have a magnetization that depends on the applied field.

1078502,Saturation and coercivity limit the velocity of rotating active magnetic microparticles,2020,Kiarash Samsami and Seyed Amir Mirbagheri and Farshad Meshkati and Henry Chien Fu,5,Physical Review Fluids,6,064202,American Physical Society,One class of active particles that is especially promising for biomedical microrobotic applications is rigid magnetic microswimmers propelled via rotation by a magnetic field. For these particles there is a maximum rotational frequency. hence velocity. determined by the maximum torque exerted by the field on the particle magnetization. It has been expected that velocity can always be increased by increasing the field magnitude to increase torque. This expectation holds if magnetization is constant or responds linearly to applied field. but all real materials actually respond nonlinearly. since as field strength increases the magnetization saturates and is coerced to point along the field direction. Here we show that this saturation and coercivity limit the maximum velocity of these microparticles. These effects are particularly important for soft magnetic materials.

We study rigid magnetic microswimmers propelled rotationally using a rotating magnetic field as a commonly examined class of these microswimmers.

As microorganisms move through complex materials. they may induce spatial heterogeneity in the medium. which can affect swimming properties.

1078522,Long term effect of extremely low frequency electromagnetic field on islet of pancreas structure,2015,Smiljana Paraš and Vesna Koko and Igor Gojković and Milica Matavulj,36,Biologia Serbica,1-2,,,According to epidemiological studies. living and working in the presence of extremely low frquency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) may contribute to several modern human diseases. and may explain the large increase in the incidence of diabetes and pancreatic cancer in urban areas. However. the influence of ELF EMFs on the pancreas remains unclear. The present study tests the effects of 5 months exposure to non-homogenous extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (50 Hz) of two different intensity (500-50 µT and 1000-100 µT) on endocrine pancreatic structure in Wistar rats. Results show that animals exposed to ELF EMFs of low and high intensity display a reduced number of islets per section of pancreas: an effect particularly pronounced in animals exposed to stronger fields. The mean islet diameter was significantly higher in both groups versus control (p< 0.01. respectively). In contrast. exposure to ELF EMFs had no significant influence on the total volume density of pancreatic islets. However. ELF EMF exposure did induce an increase in the volume density of connective tissue and blood capillaries in Langerhans islets. especially upon treatment with ELF EMFs of higher intensity. ELF EMFs of lower intensity increased the percentage of alpha and beta cells while reducing the percentage of D and PP cells. In addition. low intensity ELF EMF fields increased the volume density of alpha cells. decreased the volume density of D and PP cells. and had no influence on the volume density of beta cells. ELF EMFs of higher intensity decreased the percentage of alpha and D cells. while increasing the percentage of beta and PP cells …,True,G6_j7dsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,3,https://ojs.pmf.uns.ac.rs/index.php/dbe_serbica/article/view/2425,10644569604957363435,/scholar?cites=10644569604957363435,,https://ojs.pmf.uns.ac.rs/index.php/dbe_serbica/article/download/2425/30,0,0,0

The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of early-age thermal conditioning (ETC). vitamin C (Vit C) supplementation. and their combination on the production characteristics and specific quality parameters of the meat of broilers which were exposed to chronic HS in the last two weeks of breeding. Four hundred broilers (Cobb 500) of both sexes were divided into 4 experimental groups. Group C was given Vit C (2 g/L) dissolved in water from day 22 until the end of production. Group T was exposed to ETC for a period of 24 h at the temperature of 38±1 ºC and 40%-60% relative humidity on the fifth day of breeding. Group TC was the combination of the groups T and C. while group K was the control group. The results indicate that ETC. independently or in combination with Vit C. improves the production characteristics in terms of feed conversion reduction (P< 0.05). The examined treatments increase the volume (P< 0.05) of certain parts of the body (carcass. legs and thighs. and back) with regards to total body weight. especially in group TC. Regarding meat quality determined according to pH value and meat color criteria (CIEL*). the best results were also observed in group TC. followed by groups T and C. These results justify the use of Vit C and ETC in summer conditions. when heat stress is expected; however. the best results can be achieved by combining these two methods. thus producing a synergistic effect.,True,G6_j7dsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,1,https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/veterinary/abstract.htm?id=26819,1502653819875136903,/scholar?cites=1502653819875136903,,https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/veterinary/issues/vet-20-44-2/vet-44-2-19-1905-95.pdf,0,0,0

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an environmentally-relevant concentration of a commonly prescribed antidepressant. venlafaxine (VFX) [1.0 μg/L]. in addition to a 5°C increase in water temperature on zebrafish metabolism. Fish were chronically exposed (21 days) to one of four conditions: (i) 0 μg/L VFX at 27°C; (ii) 1.0 μg/L VFX at 27°C; (iii) 0 μg/L VFX at 32°C; (iv) 1.0 μg/L VFX at 32°C. Following exposure. whole-body metabolism was assessed by routine metabolic rate (RMR) measurements. whereas tissue-specific metabolism was assessed by measuring the activities of major metabolic enzymes in addition to glucose levels in muscle. RMR was significantly higher in the multi-stressed group relative to Control. The combination of both stressors resulted in elevated pyruvate kinase activity and glucose levels. while lipid metabolism was depressed. as measured by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activity.

Under field conditions. rainbow darter were collected upstream and downstream of the Waterloo wastewater treatment plant in the Grand River. Ontario. Canada. Enzyme activities of major metabolic and mitochondrial enzymes were measured in muscle tissue of both species. Oxygen consumption was measured to assess the effects of stressors on routine metabolic rate. active metabolic rate. aerobic scope. and critical swimming speed. all of which are significant indicators of fishes performance in ecological frameworks.

Mongolia,2019,AN Mironovsky and AS Mavrin and AV Kozhara and Yu V Slyn’ko,50,Russian Journal of Ecology,3,307-309,Pleiades Publishing,Changes in ecological factors of the environment entail genetic and. consequently. phenetic rearrangements in populations [1]. For hydrobionts. water salinity is an important evolutionary factor [2]. In particular. cyprinid fish populations foraging in brackish waters of the Caspian Sea or introduced in mineralized lakes of Kazakhstan have morphological and genetic differences from freshwater populations [3. 4]. On the other hand. comparisons of Altai osmans O. potanini from brackish-water Lake Khyargas (7.63‰ salinity) and freshwater Lake Ayrag revealed no significant differences between them. and genetic parameters of fish in Ayrag samples proved to be closer to those in Khyargas samples than in samples from freshwater Lake Nogon in the same river system [5]. The absence of distinct divergence between conspecific groups inhabiting lakes with different salinities contradicts the results of previous studies [3. 4]. To elucidate this question. we performed an additional study involving assessment of the age composition of samples of the ecological forms of Altai osmans (herbivorous and piscivorous). and analysis of specific biotopic features of lakes Ayrag and Khyargas and landscape features of the study area.The age of fish was estimated from opercular bones and cleithra examined under a binocular microscope in transmitted light after clarification in 96% ethyl alcohol.

Life has evolved to maintain iron homeostasis for normal cellular and physiological functions and therefore imbalances in iron levels exert a wide range of consequences. Responses to iron dysregulation in blood development. however. remain elusive. Here. we found that iron homeostasis is critical for differentiation of Drosophila blood cells in the larval hematopoietic organ. called the lymph gland. Supplementation of an iron chelator. bathophenanthroline disulfate (BPS) results in an excessive differentiation of the crystal cell in the lymph gland.

Embryonically derived hemocytes. mostly composed of macrophage-like plasmatocytes. are largely identified by genetic markers. However. the cellular diversity and distinct functions of possible subpopulations within plasmatocytes have not been explored in Drosophila larvae. Here. we show that larval plasmatocytes exhibit differential expressions of Hemolectin (Hml) and Peroxidasin (Pxn) during development. Moreover. removal of plasmatocytes by overexpressing pro-apoptotic genes. hid and reaper in Hml-positive plasmatocytes. feeding high sucrose diet. or wasp infestation results in increased circulating hemocytes that are Hml-negative. Interestingly these Hml-negative plasmatocytes retain Pxn expression. and animals expressing Hml-negative and Pxn-positive subtype largely attenuate growth and abrogate metabolism. Furthermore. elevated levels of a cytokine. unpaired 3. are detected when Hml-positive hemocytes are ablated. which in turn activates JAK/STAT activity in several tissues including the fat body. Finally. we observed that insulin signaling is inhibited in this background. which can be recovered by concurrent loss of upd3. Overall. this study highlights heterogeneity in Drosophila plasmatocytes and a functional plasticity of each subtype. which reaffirms extension of their role beyond immunity into metabolic regulation for cooperatively maintaining internal homeostatic balance.,True,76cXQYMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00063/full,14993577806237070057,/scholar?cites=14993577806237070057,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00063/full,0,0,0

The resulting excitation energy is delivered to reaction centers (RCs). where photochemistry starts. The relative amounts of excitation energy arriving at the RCs of photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII) depend on the spectral composition of the light. To balance the excitations in both photosystems. cyanobacteria perform state transitions to equilibrate the excitation energy. They go to state I if PSI is preferentially excited. for example after illumination with blue light (light I). and to state II after illumination with green-orange light (light II) or after dark adaptation. In this study. we performed 77-K time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on wild-type Synechococcus elongatus 7942 cells to measure how state transitions affect excitation energy transfer to PSI and PSII in different light conditions and to test the various models that have been proposed in …,True,xLuueUcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272818301555,3506754724685740303,/scholar?cites=3506754724685740303,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272818301555,0,0,0

Photosynthetic organisms living in low-light conditions require on the one hand a large light-harvesting apparatus to absorb as many photons as possible. On the other hand. the excitation trapping time scales with the size of the light-harvesting system. and the longer the distance over which the formed excitations have to be transferred. the larger the probability to lose excitations. Therefore a compromise between photon capture efficiency and excitation trapping efficiency needs to be found.

1078587,The Limitation of the Consociational Arrangements in Iraq,2015,Eduardo Abu Ltaif,38,Ethnopolitics Papers,,,,The political crises in Iraq following the American invasion have triggered the need to revisit the power sharing arrangements established in the constitution and practised at the level of the political system. Since Iraq is a deeply divided society. consociationalism has been the main force of political reconstruction after the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s regime in 2003. However. the Iraqi constitution and the political system lack genuine consociational practices. The aim of this paper is to study the limitations of the consociational arrangements and offer prescriptions that may help ameliorate the challenges facing the fragile political system. The political system will be analysed within the framework of consociationalism and power sharing agreements. Two of Lijphart’s four conditions are absent in the consociational arrangements in Iraq: grand coalition and mutual veto. while two other characteristics of consociationalism. proportionality and autonomy. are strongly present but are not enough to preserve stability.,True,dcTNJRwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,8,https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/page-files/AbuLTaif_EP_No38.pdf,2645159819973174692,/scholar?cites=2645159819973174692,,https://www.psa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/page-files/AbuLTaif_EP_No38.pdf,0,0,0

1078594,Power Sharing in Lebanon: Consociationalism Since 1820,2019,Eduardo Wassim Aboultaif,,,,,Routledge,This book studies the origins and evolution of power sharing in Lebanon. The author has established a relationship between mobilization. ethnurgy (ethnic identification). memory and trauma. and how they impact power sharing provisions. The book starts with the events in the 1820s. when communities began to politicize their identities. and which led to the first major outbreak of civil violence between the Druze and the Maronites. Consequently. these troubled four decades in Lebanon led to the introduction of various forms of power-sharing arrangements to establish peace. The political systems introduced in Lebanon are: the Kaim-Makamiya (dual sub-governorship). a quasi-federal arrangement; the Mutassarifiya. the prototype of a power-sharing system; the post-independence political system of Lebanon which the book refers to as semi-consociation. due to the concentration of executive powers in the Presidential office; and finally. the full consociation of the Taif Republic. In each of these phases. there was a peculiar interaction between the non-structural elements that had a direct impact on power sharing; this led at times to instability. and at other times it brought down the system. as in 1840–1860 and 1975. Power Sharing in Lebanon is the first academic work that emphasizes the influence of the non-structural elements that hinder power sharing.

On the contrary. international and regional behaviour with respect to the Syrian crisis leaves the impression that the crisis will be a very long-and bloody-one. According to the United Nations. two hundred and twenty thousand Syrians have been killed since the uprising started in March 2011. four million Syrians have fled the country. and seven million Syrians are internally displaced. 1 The economy is shattered. cities and towns have been wiped from the map. chemical weapons have been used multiple times. and yet there are no signs that regional or international actors are willing to intervene to end the crisis. Enough work has been done on the causes of the Syrian revolt. with little emphasis regarding the reasons behind the prolongation of the war.

1078605,Using DNA barcoding to improve invasive pest identification at US ports-of-entry,2019,Mary JL Madden and Robert G Young and John W Brown and Scott E Miller and Andrew J Frewin and Robert H Hanner,14,PLoS One,9,e0222291,Public Library of Science,Interception of potential invasive species at ports-of-entry is essential for effective biosecurity and biosurveillance programs. However. taxonomic assessment of the immature stages of most arthropods is challenging; characters for identification are often dependent on adult morphology and reproductive structures. This study aims to strengthen the identification of such specimens through DNA barcoding. with a focus on microlepidoptera. A sample of 241 primarily immature microlepidoptera specimens intercepted at U.S. ports-of-entry from 2007 to 2011 were selected for analysis. From this sample. 201 COI-5P sequences were generated and analyzed for concordance between morphology-based and DNA-based identifications. The retrospective analysis of the data over 10 years (2009 to 2019) using the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system demonstrates the importance of establishing and growing DNA barcode reference libraries for use in specimen identification. Additionally. analysis of specimen identification using public data (43.3% specimens identified) vs. non-public data (78.6% specimens identified) highlights the need to encourage researchers to make data publicly accessible. DNA barcoding surpassed morphological identification with 42.3% (public) and 66.7% (non-public) of the sampled specimens achieving a species-level identification. compared to 38.3% species-level identification by morphology. Whilst DNA barcoding was not able to identify all specimens in our dataset. its incorporation into border security programs as an adjunct to morphological identification can provide secondary lines of evidence and lower taxonomic …,True,_nHjk78AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222291,5773269050653223752,/scholar?cites=5773269050653223752,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222291,0,0,0

Fucus distichus. in a Regime of Glacial Cycling: Implications for Benthic Algal Phylogenetics,2015,Haywood Dail Laughinghouse IV and Kirsten M Müller and Walter H Adey and Yannick Lara and Robert Young and Gabriel Johnson,10,PloS one,12,e0143795,Public Library of Science,Northern hemisphere rockweeds (Fucus) are thought to have evolved in the North Pacific and then spread to the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering Strait. They have dispersed and widely speciated in the North Atlantic and its tributary seas. Fucus distichus is likely near the ancestral member of this genus. and studies have shown that there are several species/subspecies in this complex (i.e. F. evanescens and F. gardneri). We used phylogenetic and haplotype analyses to test the phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of F. distichus. Our data and subsequent analyses demonstrate that. unlike previous studies that lacked samples from an extensive geographical area of the Arctic and Subarctic. there is a distinct Arctic haplotype that is the source of subspecies in both the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Fucus distichus occupies a low tide zone habitat. and in Arctic/Subarctic regions it is adapted to the severe stress of sea ice coverage and disturbance during many months per year. We hypothesize that the very large geographic area of Arctic and Subarctic rocky shores available to this species during interglacials. supported by large Arctic/Subarctic fringe areas as well as unglaciated refugia during glacial cycles. provided a robust population and gene pool (described by the Thermogeographic Model). This gene pool dilutes that of the more fragmented and area-limited Temperate/Boreal area populations when they are brought together during glacial cycles. We suggest that similar subspecies complexes for a variety of Arctic/Subarctic shore biota should be examined further in this context. rather than arbitrarily being split up …,True,_nHjk78AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143795,13752496605149137784,/scholar?cites=13752496605149137784,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143795,0,0,0

However. the ability to delineate species within taxonomically diverse and widely distributed marine groups. such as the Copepoda and Thecostraca. remains largely untested. We investigate whether a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI-5P) global pairwise sequence divergence threshold exists between intraspecific and interspecific divergences in the copepods plus the thecostracans (barnacles and allies). Using publicly accessible sequence data. we applied a graphical method to determine an optimal threshold value. With these thresholds. and using a newly generated planktonic marine data set. we quantify the degree of concordance using a bidirectional analysis and discuss different analytical methods for sequence-based species delimitation (e.g..

The introduction of insect pests considered invasive alien species (IAS) into a non‐native range poses a threat to native plant health. The early detection of IAS can allow for prompt actions by regulating authorities. thereby mitigating their impacts. In the present study. we optimized and validated a fast and cost‐effective eDNA metabarcoding protocol for biosurveillance of IAS and characterization of insect and microorganism diversity. Forty‐eight traps were placed. following the CFIA's annual forest insect trapping survey. at four locations in southern Ontario that are high risk for forest IAS.

It has been suggested that the rate of genetic evolution of a species and the amount of genetic diversity upon which selection can act may play a role in invasiveness. In this study. we examine whether invasive species have a higher relative pace of molecular evolution as compared with closely related non-invasive species. as well as examine the genetic diversity between invasive and closely related species. To do this. we used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences of 35 species with a European native range that are invasive in North America. Unique to molecular rate studies. we permuted across sequences when comparing each invasive species with its sister clade species. incorporating a range of recorded genetic variation within species using 405.765 total combinations of invasive. sister. and outgroup sequences. We observed no significant trend in relative molecular rates between invasive and noninvasive sister clade species. nor in intraspecific genetic diversity. suggesting that differences in invasive status between closely related lineages are not strongly determined by the relative overall pace of genetic evolution or molecular genetic diversity. We support previous observations of more often higher genetic diversity in native than invaded ranges using available data for this genetic region.,True,_nHjk78AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,2,http://www.eje.cz/pdfs/eje/2018/01/71.pdf,14967093730132901153,/scholar?cites=14967093730132901153,,http://www.eje.cz/pdfs/eje/2018/01/71.pdf,0,0,0

To be successful and contributory. early-career researchers (ECRs). including graduate students. need to be able to effectively navigate the literature. peer-review process. and scientific research with integrity.

Our discussion centres on the concepts of plagiarism and intellectual property. predatory journals. aspects of peer review. transparency in publishing. and false advanced accreditations. Negative elements within these topics may be especially damaging to ECRs. who may be less familiar with the research landscape.

A rapid and effective early detection biosurveillance program to identify species of concern is needed to reduce future impacts and costs associated with introduced non‐native species. One of the challenges facing insect surveillance trapping methods is the sheer volume of individual specimens in the collections. Although molecular identification methods are improving. they currently have limitations (e.g.. destructive processing of specimens) and a protocol addressing these limitations can support regulatory applications that need morphological evidence to corroborate molecular data.

1078612,Molecular Species Delimitation and Biogeography of Canadian Marine Planktonic Crustaceans,2016,Robert Young,,,,,,Zooplankton are a major component of the marine environment in both diversity and biomass and are a crucial source of nutrients for organisms at higher trophic levels. Unfortunately. marine zooplankton biodiversity is not well known because of difficult morphological identifications and lack of taxonomic experts for many groups. In addition. the large taxonomic diversity present in plankton and low sampling coverage pose challenges in obtaining a better understanding of true zooplankton diversity. Molecular identification tools. like DNA barcoding. have been successfully used to identify marine planktonic specimens to a species. However. the behaviour of methods for specimen identification and species delimitation remain untested for taxonomically div¬erse and widely-distributed marine zooplanktonic groups. Using Canadian marine planktonic crustacean collections. I generated a multi-gene data set including COI-5P and 18S-V4 molecular markers of morphologically-identified Copepoda and Thecostraca (Multicrustacea: Hexanauplia) species. I used this data set to assess generalities in the genetic divergence patterns and to determine if a barcode gap exists separating interspecific and intraspecific molecular divergences. which can reliably delimit specimens into species. I then used this information to evaluate the North Pacific. Arctic. and North Atlantic biogeography of marine Calanoida (Hexanauplia: Copepoda) plankton.

Unfortunately. there is no standard method for managing published qPCR data. and those currently used generally focus on only managing raw fluorescence data. However. associated with qPCR experiments are extensive sample and assay metadata. often under-examined and under-reported. Here. we present the Molecular Detection Mapping and Analysis Platform for R (MDMAPR). an open-source and fully scalable informatics tool for researchers to merge raw qPCR fluorescence data with associated metadata into a standard format. while geospatially visualizing the distribution of the data and relative intensity of the qPCR results. The advance of this approach is in the ability to use MDMAPR to store varied qPCR data. This includes pathogen and environmental qPCR species detection studies ideally suited to geographical visualization. However. it also goes beyond these and can be utilized with other qPCR data including gene expression studies. quantification studies used in identifying health dangers associated with food and water bacteria. and the identification of unknown samples. In addition. MDMAPR’s novel centralized management and geospatial visualization of qPCR data can further enable cross-discipline large-scale qPCR data standardization and accessibility to support research spanning multiple fields of science and qPCR applications.,True,_nHjk78AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://peerj.com/articles/9974/,,,,https://peerj.com/articles/9974/,0,0,0
