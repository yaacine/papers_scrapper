1287576,Unsupervised 3d pose estimation with geometric self-supervision,2019,Ching-Hang Chen and Ambrish Tyagi and Amit Agrawal and Dylan Drover and Stefan Stojanov and James M Rehg,,,,5714-5724,,We present an unsupervised learning approach to re-cover 3D human pose from 2D skeletal joints extracted from a single image. Our method does not require any multi-view image data. 3D skeletons. correspondences between 2D-3D points. or use previously learned 3D priors during training. A lifting network accepts 2D landmarks as inputs and generates a corresponding 3D skeleton estimate. Dur-ing training. the recovered 3D skeleton is reprojected on random camera viewpoints to generate new'synthetic'2D poses. By lifting the synthetic 2D poses back to 3D and re-projecting them in the original camera view. we can de-fine self-consistency loss both in 3D and in 2D. The training can thus be self supervised by exploiting the geometric self-consistency of the lift-reproject-lift process. We show that self-consistency alone is not sufficient to generate realistic skeletons. however adding a 2D pose discriminator enables the lifter to output valid 3D poses.

We present a weakly supervised approach to estimate 3D pose points. given only 2D pose landmarks. Our method does not require correspondences between 2D and 3D points to build explicit 3D priors. We utilize an adversarial framework to impose a prior on the 3D structure. learned solely from their random 2D projections. Given a set of 2D pose landmarks. the generator network hypothesizes their depths to obtain a 3D skeleton. We propose a novel Random Projection layer. which randomly projects the generated 3D skeleton and sends the resulting 2D pose to the discriminator. The discriminator improves by discriminating between the generated poses and pose samples from a real distribution of 2D poses. Training does not require correspondence between the 2D inputs to either the generator or the discriminator. We apply our approach to the task of 3D human pose estimation.

A novel wearable-sensor based faller classification method for the elderly was developed using accelerometer-based features from straight walking and turns. Seventy-six older individuals (74.15±7.0 years). categorized as prospective fallers and non-fallers. completed a six-minute walk test with accelerometers attached to their lower legs and pelvis. After segmenting straight and turn sections. cross validation tests were conducted on straight and turn walking features to assess classification performance. The best “classifier model—feature selector” combination used turn data. random forest classifier. and select-5-best feature selector (73.4% accuracy. 60.5% sensitivity. 82.0% specificity. and 0.44 Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC)). Using only the most frequently occurring features. a feature subset (minimum of anterior-posterior ratio of even/odd harmonics for right shank. standard deviation (SD) of anterior left shank acceleration SD.

Faller classification and fall risk assessment in elderly populations can facilitate preventative care before a fall occurs. Few research studies in the fall risk assessment field have focused on wearable-sensor-based features obtained during walking-turns. Examining turn based features may improve fall-risk assessment techniques.  Seventy-six older individuals (74.15 ± 7.0 years). categorized as prospective fallers (28 participants) and non-fallers (43 participants). completed a six-minute walk test with accelerometers attached to their lower legs and pelvis. Turn and straight walking sections were segmented from the six-minute walk test. with a feature set extracted for each participant.  This work aimed to determine if significant differences between prospective faller (PF) and non-faller (NF) groups existed for turn or straight walking features. A mixed-design ANOVA with post-hoc analysis showed no significant differences between faller groups for straight-walking features. while five turn based features had significant differences (p <0.05). These five turn based features were minimum of anterior-posterior REOH for right shank. SD of SD anterior left shank acceleration. SD of mean anterior left shank acceleration. maximum of medial-lateral FQFFT for lower back. and SD of maximum anterior left shank acceleration.

However. certain purpose-built Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used for this purpose. This paper describes an NLP-based approach to automated assessment that extends an earlier approach [1] to enable the automated marking of longer answers as well as answers that are partially correct. In the extended approach. the original Question Answer Language (QAL) is augmented to support the definition of regions of text that are expected to appear in a student’s answer. In order to explain the extensions to QAL. we present worked examples based on real exam questions.

1287592,NISER: Normalized item and session representations to handle popularity bias,2019,Priyanka Gupta and Diksha Garg and Pankaj Malhotra and Lovekesh Vig and Gautam Shroff,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.04276,,,,The goal of session-based recommendation (SR) models is to utilize the information from past actions (eg item/product clicks) in a session to recommend items that a user is likely to click next. Recently it has been shown that the sequence of item interactions in a session can be modeled as graph-structured data to better account for complex item transitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn useful representations for such session-graphs. and have been shown to improve over sequential models such as recurrent neural networks [14]. However. we note that these GNN-based recommendation models suffer from popularity bias: the models are biased towards recommending popular items. and fail to recommend relevant long-tail items (less popular or less frequent items). Therefore. these models perform poorly for the less popular new items arriving daily in a practical online setting. We demonstrate that this issue is. in part. related to the magnitude or norm of the learned item and session-graph representations (embedding vectors). We propose a training procedure that mitigates this issue by using normalized representations. The models using normalized item and session-graph representations perform significantly better: i. for the less popular long-tail items in the offline setting. and ii. for the less popular newly introduced items in the online setting.

However. RNNs require large labeled data for training and are computationally expensive to train. Pre-training a network for some supervised or unsupervised tasks on a dataset. and then fine-tuning via transfer learning for a related end-task can be an efficient way to leverage deep models for scenarios that lack in either computational resources or labeled data. or both.

We highlight practical aspects of the RUL estimation problem in this data challenge such as i) multiple operating conditions. ii) lack of knowledge of exact onset of failure or degradation. iii) different operational behavior across tools in terms of range of values of parameters. etc. We describe our solution in the context of these challenges. Importantly. multiple modes of failure are possible in an ion mill etching system; therefore. it is desirable to estimate the RUL with respect to each of the failure modes. The data challenge considers three such modes of failures and requires estimating RULs with respect to each one. implying learning three metric regression functions-one corresponding to each failure mode. We propose a simple yet effective extension to existing methods of RUL estimation using RNN based regression to learn a single deep RNN model that can simultaneously estimate RULs corresponding to all three failure modes. Our best model is an ensemble of two such RNN models and achieves a score of 1.91× 107 on the final validation set.,True,qXdDEHcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pankaj_Malhotra3/publication/328419708_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Online_Remaining_Useful_Life_Estimation_in_Ion_Mill_Etching_System/links/5bcd8a9a299bf17a1c6625bf/Recurrent-Neural-Networks-for-Online-Remaining-Useful-Life-Estimation-in-Ion-Mill-Etching-System.pdf,18362738430020190039,/scholar?cites=18362738430020190039,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pankaj_Malhotra3/publication/328419708_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Online_Remaining_Useful_Life_Estimation_in_Ion_Mill_Etching_System/links/5bcd8a9a299bf17a1c6625bf/Recurrent-Neural-Networks-for-Online-Remaining-Useful-Life-Estimation-in-Ion-Mill-Etching-System.pdf,0,0,0

It is difficult for engineers to diagnose the faults when multiple sensors are being monitored at once. The faults detected by RNNs can be better understood if the sensors carrying the faulty signature are known. To achieve this. we propose a sensor relevance scoring (SRS) approach that scores each sensor based on its contribution to the classification decision by leveraging the hidden layer activations of RNNs. Secondly. lack of labeled training data due to infrequent faults (or otherwise) makes it difficult to train RNNs in a supervised manner.

1287600,Batch-Constrained Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Session-based Recommendation,2020,Diksha Garg and Priyanka Gupta and Pankaj Malhotra and Lovekesh Vig and Gautam Shroff,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.08984,,,,Most of the existing deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for session-based recommendations either rely on costly online interactions with real users. or rely on potentially biased rule-based or data-driven user-behavior models for learning. In this work. we instead focus on learning recommendation policies in the pure batch or offline setting. ie learning policies solely from offline historical interaction logs or batch data generated from an unknown and sub-optimal behavior policy. without further access to data from the real-world or user-behavior models. We propose BCD4Rec: Batch-Constrained Distributional RL for Session-based Recommendations. BCD4Rec builds upon the recent advances in batch (offline) RL and distributional RL to learn from offline logs while dealing with the intrinsically stochastic nature of rewards from the users due to varied latent interest preferences (environments). We demonstrate that BCD4Rec significantly improves upon the behavior policy as well as strong RL and non-RL baselines in the batch setting in terms of standard performance metrics like Click Through Rates or Buy Rates. Other useful properties of BCD4Rec include: i. recommending items from the correct latent categories indicating better value estimates despite large action space (of the order of number of items). and ii. overcoming popularity bias in clicked or bought items typically present in the offline logs.,True,qXdDEHcAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08984,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08984,0,0,0

It is now realized that there is an untapped potential of Big-data in improving patient care. However. this is not taken into practice due to lack of communication between the doctors and the data-analysts.

Indeed. we observed that for adversarial instances originating from a given class. labeling tend to be done into a small subset of (incorrect) classes. Therefore. we argue that an ensemble of specialists should be better able to identify and reject fooling instances. with a high entropy (ie. disagreement) over the decisions in the presence of adversaries.

Hence. an important aspect of multitask learning is to understand the similarities within a set of tasks. Previous works have incorporated this similarity information explicitly (eg. weighted loss for each task) or implicitly (eg. adversarial loss for feature adaptation). for achieving good empirical performances. However. the theoretical motivations for adding task similarity knowledge are often missing or incomplete. In this paper. we give a different perspective from a theoretical point of view to understand this practice. We first provide an upper bound on the generalization error of multitask learning. showing the benefit of explicit and implicit task similarity knowledge. We systematically derive the bounds based on two distinct task similarity metrics: H divergence and Wasserstein distance. From these theoretical results. we revisit the Adversarial Multi-task Neural Network. proposing a new training algorithm to learn the task relation coefficients and neural network parameters iteratively. We assess our new algorithm empirically on several benchmarks. showing not only that we find interesting and robust task relations. but that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines. reaffirming the benefits of theoretical insight in algorithm design.,True,IIJuvsYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,15,https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09109,6997019387334504079,/scholar?cites=6997019387334504079,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.09109,0,0,0
1287605,Alternating direction method of multipliers for sparse convolutional neural networks,2016,Farkhondeh Kiaee and Christian Gagné and Mahdieh Abbasi,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01590,,,,The storage and computation requirements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be prohibitive for exploiting these models over low-power or embedded devices. This paper reduces the computational complexity of the CNNs by minimizing an objective function. including the recognition loss that is augmented with a sparsity-promoting penalty term. The sparsity structure of the network is identified using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). which is widely used in large optimization problems. This method alternates between promoting the sparsity of the network and optimizing the recognition performance. which allows us to exploit the two-part structure of the corresponding objective functions. In particular. we take advantage of the separability of the sparsity-inducing penalty functions to decompose the minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved sequentially. Applying our method to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN models. our proposed method is able to simplify the original model. generating models with less computation and fewer parameters. while maintaining and often improving generalization performance.

To this end. we propose an ensemble of diverse specialized CNNs along with a simple voting mechanism. The diversity in this ensemble creates a gap between the predictive confidences of adversaries and those of clean samples. making adversaries detectable. We then analyze how diversity in such an ensemble of specialists may mitigate the risk of the black-box and white-box adversarial examples. Using MNIST and CIFAR-10. we empirically verify the ability of our ensemble to detect a large portion of well-known black-box adversarial examples. which leads to a significant reduction in the risk rate of adversaries. at the expense of a small increase in the risk rate of clean samples.

To tackle this challenge. some recent works have demonstrated the gains of leveraging available OOD sets for training end-to-end calibrated CNNs. However. a critical question remains unanswered in these works: how to differentiate OOD sets for selecting the most effective one (s) that induce training such CNNs with high detection rates on unseen OOD sets? To address this pivotal question. we provide a criterion based on generalization errors of Augmented-CNN. a vanilla CNN with an added extra class employed for rejection. on in-distribution and unseen OOD sets. However. selecting the most effective OOD set by directly optimizing this criterion incurs a huge computational cost. Instead. we propose three novel computationally-efficient metrics for differentiating between OOD sets according to their"" protection"" level of in-distribution sub-manifolds. We empirically verify that the most protective OOD sets--selected according to our metrics--lead to A-CNNs with significantly lower generalization errors than the A-CNNs trained on the least protective ones. We also empirically show the effectiveness of a protective OOD set for training well-generalized confidence-calibrated vanilla CNNs. These results confirm that 1) all OOD sets are not equally effective for training well-performing end-to-end models (ie. A-CNNs and calibrated CNNs) for OOD detection tasks and 2) the protection level of OOD sets is a viable factor for recognizing the most effective one.

Moreover. merging datasets allows us to train one integrated object detector. instead of training several ones. which in turn resulting in the reduction of computational and time costs. However. merging the datasets from similar contexts causes samples with partial labeling as each constituent dataset is originally annotated for its own set of OoI and ignores to annotate those objects that are become interested after merging the datasets. With the goal of training\emph {one integrated robust object detector with high generalization performance}. we propose a training framework to overcome missing-label challenge of the merged datasets. More specifically. we propose a computationally efficient self-supervised framework to create on-the-fly pseudo-labels for the unlabelled positive instances in the merged dataset in order to train the object detector jointly on both ground truth and pseudo labels.

This pipeline is further extended to a multi-view approach. which assimilates keypoint information from correspondence sets generated from multiple views of the 3D template model. Fusion of multi-view information significantly improves geometric comprehension of the system which in turn enhances the pose estimation performance. Furthermore. use of correspondence framework responsible for the learning of pose invariant keypoint descriptor also allows us to effectively alleviate the data-scarcity problem.

Although. DCNNs have resulted in unprecedented visual recognition performances. they offer little transparency. To understand how DCNN based models work at the task of semantic segmentation. we try to analyze the DCNN models in semantic segmentation. We try to find the importance of global image information for labeling pixels.Based on the experiments on discriminative regions. and modeling of fixations. we propose a set of new training loss functions for fine-tuning DCNN based models.

It is this visual environment that has driven evolution. and that is clinically relevant. Yet nearly all of our understanding of the neural computations. biological function. and circuit mechanisms of the retina comes in the context of artificially structured stimuli such as flashing spots. moving bars and white noise. It is fundamentally unclear how these artificial stimuli are related to circuit processes engaged under natural stimuli. A key barrier is the lack of methods for analyzing retinal responses to natural images. We addressed both these issues by applying convolutional neural network models (CNNs) to capture retinal responses to natural scenes. We find that CNN models predict natural scene responses with high accuracy. achieving performance close to the fundamental limits of predictability set by intrinsic cellular variability. Furthermore. individual internal units of the model are highly correlated with actual retinal interneuron responses that were recorded separately and never presented to the model during training. Finally. we find that models fit only to natural scenes. but not white noise. reproduce a range of phenomena previously described using distinct artificial stimuli. including frequency doubling. latency encoding. motion anticipation. fast contrast adaptation. synchronized responses to motion reversal and object motion sensitivity.

Longitudinal in vivo imaging reveals that. while synaptic weights in both neuronal types are log-normally distributed. synapses onto PV+ neurons are less heterogeneous and more stable. Markov-model analyses suggest that the synaptic weight distribution is set intrinsically by ongoing cell type-specific dynamics. and substantial changes are due to accumulated gradual changes.

We first partition the output feature maps from a deep residual network (ResNet) into increasingly fine sub-regions and extract speaker embeddings from each sub-region through a learnable dictionary encoding layer. These embeddings are concatenated to obtain the final speaker representation. The SPE layer not only generates a fixed-dimensional speaker embedding for a variable-length speech segment. but also aggregates the information of feature distribution from multi-level temporal bins. Furthermore. we apply deep length normalization by augmenting the loss function with ring loss. By applying ring loss. the network gradually learns to normalize the speaker embeddings using model weights themselves while preserving convexity. leading to more robust speaker embeddings. Experiments on the VoxCeleb1 dataset show that the proposed system using the SPE layer and ring loss-based deep length normalization outperforms both i-vector and d-vector baselines.,True,Kxka7C8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,22,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08333,8838660839378944188,/scholar?cites=8838660839378944188,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08333,0,0,0

To address this issue. a promising approach is to map noisy speech features to corresponding clean features and to perform VAD using the generated clean features. This can be implemented by concatenating a speech enhancement (SE) and a VAD network. whose parameters are jointly updated. In this paper. we propose denoising variational autoencoder-based (DVAE) speech enhancement in the joint learning framework. Moreover. we feed not only the enhanced feature but also the latent code from the DVAE into the VAD network.

1287647,Meta-Learning for Short Utterance Speaker Recognition with Imbalance Length Pairs,2020,Seong Min Kye and Youngmoon Jung and Hae Beom Lee and Sung Ju Hwang and Hoirin Kim,,Interspeech,,,,In realistic settings. a speaker recognition system needs to identify a speaker given a short utterance. while the utterance used to enroll may be relatively long. However. existing speaker recognition models perform poorly with such short utterances. To solve this problem. we introduce a meta-learning scheme with imbalance length pairs. Specifically. we use a prototypical network and train it with a support set of long utterances and a query set of short utterances. However. since optimizing for only the classes in the given episode is not sufficient to learn discriminative embeddings for other classes in the entire dataset. we additionally classify both support set and query set against the entire classes in the training set to learn a well-discriminated embedding space. By combining these two learning schemes. our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art speaker verification models learned in a standard supervised learning framework on short utterance (1-2 seconds) on VoxCeleb dataset. We also validate our proposed model for unseen speaker identification. on which it also achieves significant gain over existing approaches.,True,Kxka7C8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,16,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02863,4807708698976556255,/scholar?cites=4807708698976556255,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02863,0,0,0

In this approach. we obtain a speaker embedding vector by pooling single-scale features that are extracted from the last layer of a speaker feature extractor. Multi-scale aggregation (MSA). which utilizes multiscale features from different layers of the feature extractor. has recently been introduced and shows superior performance for variable-duration utterances. To increase the robustness dealing with utterances of arbitrary duration. this paper improves the MSA by using a feature pyramid module. The module enhances speaker-discriminative information of features from multiple layers via a top-down pathway and lateral connections. We extract speaker embeddings using the enhanced features that contain rich speaker information with different time scales. Experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset show that the proposed module improves previous MSA methods with a smaller number of parameters.

Choosing appropriate features and model structures is a significant challenge and an active area of current VAD research. Mel-scale features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and log Mel-filterbank (LMFB) energies have been widely used in VAD as well as speech recognition. The reason for feature extraction in Mel- frequency scale to be one of the most popular methods is that it mimics how human ears process sound. However. for certain types of sound. in which important characteristics are reflected more in the high frequency range. a linear-scale in frequency may provide more information than the Mel- scale.

This causes two problems: 1) expert knowledge of each module is required. and 2) errors generated in each module accumulate passing through each module.

In this study. we implemented an end-to-end Korean TTS system using Google's Tacotron. which is an end-to-end TTS system based on a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism. We used 4392 utterances spoken by a Korean female speaker. an amount that corresponds to 37% of the dataset Google used for training Tacotron.

Multi-relational graphs are a more general and prevalent form of graphs where each edge has a label and direction associated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representations of nodes only.

There has been some recent progress in defining the notion of pooling in graphs whereby the model tries to generate a graph level representation by downsampling and summarizing the information present in the nodes. Existing pooling methods either fail to effectively capture the graph substructure or do not easily scale to large graphs. In this work. we propose ASAP (Adaptive Structure Aware Pooling). a sparse and differentiable pooling method that addresses the limitations of previous graph pooling architectures. ASAP utilizes a novel self-attention network along with a modified GNN formulation to capture the importance of each node in a given graph. It also learns a sparse soft cluster assignment for nodes at each layer to effectively pool the subgraphs to form the pooled graph. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and theoretical analysis. we motivate our choice of the components used in ASAP.

Some of the major challenges involved in developing such models are.(i) limited availability of materials data as compared to other fields.(ii) lack of universal descriptor of materials to predict its various properties. The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer learning. while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and Grossman [1]. where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals. In this work. we develop a new model (MT-CGCNN) by integrating CGCNN with transfer learning based on multi-task (MT) learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-CGCNN by simultaneous prediction of various material properties such as Formation Energy. Band Gap and Fermi Energy for a wide range of inorganic crystals (46774 materials). MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on correlated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error compared to CGCNN. even when the training data is reduced by 10%.

With the recent developments in deep-learning. single-model quality assessment methods have been also advanced. primarily through the use of 2D and 3D convolutional deep neural networks. Here we explore an alternative approach and train a graph convolutional network with nodes representing protein atoms and edges connecting spatially adjacent atom pairs on the dataset Rosetta-300k which contains a set of 300k conformations from 2.897 proteins. We show that our proposed architecture. ProteinGCN. is capable of predicting both local and global accuracies in protein models at state-of-the-art levels. Further. the number of free parameters in ProteinGCN is almost 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller compared to the 3D convolutional networks proposed earlier.

Although some works have attempted to explain the behavior of such KG-augmented models by indicating which KG inputs are salient (i.e.. important for the model's prediction). it is not always clear how these explanations should be used to make the model better. In this paper. we explore whether KG explanations can be used as supervision for teaching these KG-augmented models how to filter out unhelpful KG information. To this end. we propose SalKG. a simple framework for learning from KG explanations of both coarse (Is the KG salient?) and fine (Which parts of the KG are salient?) granularity. Given the explanations generated from a task's training set. SalKG trains KG-augmented models to solve the task by focusing on KG information highlighted by the explanations as salient.

We modify the batch contrastive loss. which has recently been shown to be very effective at learning powerful representations in the self-supervised setting. We are thus able to leverage label information more effectively than cross entropy. Clusters of points belonging to the same class are pulled together in embedding space. while simultaneously pushing apart clusters of samples from different classes. In addition to this. we leverage key ingredients such as large batch sizes and normalized embeddings. which have been shown to benefit self-supervised learning.

Opportunities and Limits,2019,Mario Fuentes Reyes and Stefan Auer and Nina Merkle and Corentin Henry and Michael Schmitt,11,Remote Sensing,17,2067,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Due to its all time capability. synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing plays an important role in Earth observation. The ability to interpret the data is limited. even for experts. as the human eye is not familiar to the impact of distance-dependent imaging. signal intensities detected in the radar spectrum as well as image characteristics related to speckle or steps of post-processing. This paper is concerned with machine learning for SAR-to-optical image-to-image translation in order to support the interpretation and analysis of original data. A conditional adversarial network is adopted and optimized in order to generate alternative SAR image representations based on the combination of SAR images (starting point) and optical images (reference) for training. Following this strategy. the focus is set on the value of empirical knowledge for initialization. the impact of results on follow-up applications. and the discussion of opportunities/drawbacks related to this application of deep learning. Case study results are shown for high resolution (SAR: TerraSAR-X. optical: ALOS PRISM) and low resolution (Sentinel-1 and-2) data. The properties of the alternative image representation are evaluated based on feedback from experts in SAR remote sensing and the impact on road extraction as an example for follow-up applications. The results provide the basis to explain fundamental limitations affecting the SAR-to-optical image translation idea but also indicate benefits from alternative SAR image representations.

Aerial images provide valuable information over a large area instantaneously; nevertheless. no current dataset captures the complexity of aerial scenes at the level of granularity required by real-world applications. To address this. we introduce SkyScapes. an aerial image dataset with highly-accurate. fine-grained annotations for pixel-level semantic labeling. SkyScapes provides annotations for 31 semantic categories ranging from large structures. such as buildings. roads and vegetation. to fine details. such as 12 (sub-) categories of lane markings. We have defined two main tasks on this dataset: dense semantic segmentation and multi-class lane-marking prediction. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation methods on SkyScapes. Existing methods struggle to deal with the wide range of classes. object sizes. scales. and fine details present.

To ensure annotation consistency. a list of rules was established and extended as special cases were discovered. These guidelines relate to two aspects of the annotation work: target identification and boundary topology. For the former. the annotators referred to the comprehensive class definitions found in section 2 to assign every object in the image to a semantic category. The vertical ordering of classes (or class overlays) was based on the natural physical ordering found in the real world. and as also considered in transportation systems. ie. vehicles were put on top of all road-like objects. etc. Some classes were annotated together to ensure that inter-object borders were not overlapping. but only after fixing the vertical class order. similarly to CityScapes [2]: the object boundaries of low-level classes were drawn more coarsely at places where they would be overlaid with the accurate masks of higher-level classes. This sped up the annotation process while still satisfying our quality requirements. Other objects such as vehicles were annotated separately. As a consequence. their borders did not necessarily match the boundaries of other classes in the resulting merged ground truth.

In the last decade. we have witnessed significant progress in object detection in ground imagery. but it is still in its infancy in airborne imagery. mostly due to the scarcity of diverse and large-scale datasets. Despite being a useful tool for different applications. current airborne datasets only partially reflect the challenges of real-world scenarios.

With such streaming mobility data. the online prediction of short-term human mobility at the city level can be of great significance for transportation scheduling. urban regulation. and emergency management. In particular. when big rare events or disasters happen. such as large earthquakes or severe traffic accidents. people change their behaviors from their routine activities. This means people's movements will almost be uncorrelated with their past movements. Therefore. in this study. we build an online system called DeepUrbanMomentum to conduct the next short-term mobility predictions by using (the limited steps of) currently observed human mobility data.

1287703,Fully end-to-end learning based conditional boundary equilibrium gan with receptive field sizes enlarged for single ultra-high resolution image dehazing,2018,Sehwan Ki and Hyeonjun Sim and Jae-Seok Choi and Saehun Kim and Munchurl Kim,,,,817-824,,A receptive field is defined as the region in an input image space that an output image pixel is looking at. Thus. the receptive field size influences the learning of deep convolution neural networks. Especially. in single image dehazing problems. larger receptive fields often show more effective dehazying by considering the brightness and color of the entire input hazy image without additional information (eg scene transmission map. depth map. and atmospheric light). The conventional generative adversarial network (GAN) with small-sized receptive fields cannot be effective for hazy images of ultra-high resolution. Thus. we proposed a fully end-to-end learning based conditional boundary equilibrium generative adversarial network (BEGAN) with the receptive field sizes enlarged for single image dehazing. In our conditional BEGAN. its discriminator is trained ultra-high resolution conditioned on downscale input hazy images. so that the haze can effectively be removed with the original structures of images stably preserved. From this. we can obtain the high PSNR performance (Track 1-Indoor: top 4th-ranked) and fast computation speeds. Also. we combine an L1 loss. a perceptual loss and a GAN loss as the generator's loss of the proposed conditional BEGAN. which allows to obtain stable dehazing results for various hazy images.,True,ThxospwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,17,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/w13/html/Ki_Fully_End-to-End_Learning_CVPR_2018_paper.html,7429021207598476056,/scholar?cites=7429021207598476056,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w13/Ki_Fully_End-to-End_Learning_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1287704,A deep motion deblurring network based on per-pixel adaptive kernels with residual down-up and up-down modules,2019,Hyeonjun Sim and Munchurl Kim,,,,0-0,,Due to the object motion during the camera exposure time. latent pixel information appears scattered in a blurred image. A large dataset of dynamic motion blur and blur-free frame pairs enables deep neural networks to learn deblurring operations directly in end-to-end manners. In this paper. we propose a novel motion deblurring kernel learning network that predicts the per-pixel deblur kernel and a residual image. The learned deblur kernel filters and linearly combines neighboring pixels to restore the clean pixels in its corresponding location. The per-pixel adaptive convolution with the learned deblur kernel can effectively handle non-uniform blur. At the same time. the generated residual image is added to the adaptive convolution result to compensate for the limited receptive field of the learned deblur kernel. That is. the adaptive convolution and the residual image play different but complementary roles each other to reconstruct the latent clean images in a collaborative manner. We also propose residual down-up (RDU) and residual up-down (RUD) blocks that help improve the motion deblurring performance. The RDU and RUD blocks are designed to adjust the spatial size and the number of channels of the intermediate feature within the blocks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our motion deblurring kernel learning network by showing intensive experimental results compared to those of the state-of-the-art methods.,True,ThxospwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,10,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/html/NTIRE/Sim_A_Deep_Motion_Deblurring_Network_Based_on_Per-Pixel_Adaptive_Kernels_CVPRW_2019_paper.html,15293046542411350124,/scholar?cites=15293046542411350124,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/NTIRE/Sim_A_Deep_Motion_Deblurring_Network_Based_on_Per-Pixel_Adaptive_Kernels_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1287705,High-resolution image dehazing with respect to training losses and receptive field sizes,2018,Hyeonjun Sim and Sehwan Ki and Jae-Seok Choi and Soomin Seo and Saehun Kim and Munchurl Kim,,,,912-919,,Haze removal is one of the essential image enhancement processes that makes degraded images visually pleasing. Since haze in images often appears differently depending on the surroundings. haze removal requires the use of spatial information to effectively remove the haze according to the types of image region characteristics. However. in the conventional training. the small-sized training image patches could not provide spatial information to the training networks when they are relatively very small compared to the original training image resolutions. In this paper. we propose a simple but effective network for high-resolution image dehazing using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). which is called DeHazing GAN (DHGAN). where the hazy patches of scale-reduced training input images are applied to the generator network of DHGAN. By doing so. DHGAN can capture more global features of the haziness in the training image patches. thus leading to improved dehazing performance. Also. DHGAN is trained based on the largest binary cross entropy loss among the multiple outputs so that the generator network of DHGAN can favorably be trained in accordance with perceptual quality.

The XVFI-Net is based on a recursive multi-scale shared structure that consists of two cascaded modules for bidirectional optical flow learning between two input frames (BiOF-I) and for bidirectional optical flow learning from target to input frames (BiOF-T). The optical flows are stably approximated by a complementary flow reversal (CFR) proposed in BiOF-T module. During inference. the BiOF-I module can start at any scale of input while the BiOF-T module only operates at the original input scale so that the inference can be accelerated while maintaining highly accurate VFI performance. Extensive experimental results show that our XVFI-Net can successfully capture the essential information of objects with extremely large motions and complex textures while the state-of-the-art methods exhibit poor performance. Furthermore. our XVFI-Net framework also performs comparably on the previous lower resolution benchmark dataset. which shows a robustness of our algorithm as well.

1287707,KOALAnet: Blind Super-Resolution using Kernel-Oriented Adaptive Local Adjustment,2020,Soo Ye Kim and Hyeonjun Sim and Munchurl Kim,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.08103,,,,Blind super-resolution (SR) methods aim to generate a high quality high resolution image from a low resolution image containing unknown degradations. However. natural images contain various types and amounts of blur: some may be due to the inherent degradation characteristics of the camera. but some may even be intentional. for aesthetic purposes (eg. Bokeh effect). In the case of the latter. it becomes highly difficult for SR methods to disentangle the blur to remove. and that to leave as is. In this paper. we propose a novel blind SR framework based on kernel-oriented adaptive local adjustment (KOALA) of SR features. called KOALAnet. which jointly learns spatially-variant degradation and restoration kernels in order to adapt to the spatially-variant blur characteristics in real images. Our KOALAnet outperforms recent blind SR methods for synthesized LR images obtained with randomized degradations. and we further show that the proposed KOALAnet produces the most natural results for artistic photographs with intentional blur. which are not over-sharpened. by effectively handling images mixed with in-focus and out-of-focus areas.,True,ThxospwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08103,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08103,0,0,0

To meet the current fashion trend of short product lifetimes and an increasing variety of styles. the company produces limited volumes of a large variety of styles. However. due to the limited volume of each style. some styles may not be distributed to some off-line stores. As a result. this high-variety. low-volume strategy presents another challenge to distribution managers. We collaborated with KOLON F/C. one of the largest fashion business units in South Korea. to develop models and an algorithm to optimally distribute the products to the stores based on the visual images of the products.

Moreover. the team created an optimization model that effectively determines the product mix for each store based on the image representation of clothes. In the past. computers were only considered to be useful for conducting logical calculations. and visual perception and cognition were considered to be difficult computational tasks.

Most methods essentially compute warps from the product image to the model image and combine using image generation methods. However. obtaining a realistic image is challenging because the kinematics of garments is complex and because outline. texture. and shading cues in the image reveal errors to human viewers. The garment must have appropriate drapes; texture must be warped to be consistent with the shape of a draped garment; small details (buttons. collars. lapels. pockets. etc.) must be placed appropriately on the garment. and so on. Evaluation is particularly difficult and is usually qualitative.This paper uses quantitative evaluation on a challenging. novel dataset to demonstrate that (a) for any warping method. one can choose target models automatically to improve results. and (b) learning multiple coordinated specialized warpers offers further improvements on results. Target models are chosen by a learned embedding procedure that predicts a representation of the products the model is wearing. This prediction is used to match products to models. Specialized warpers are trained by a method that encourages a second warper to perform well in locations where the first works poorly. The warps are then combined using a U-Net.

1287722,Similarity modeling on heterogeneous networks via automatic path discovery,2018,Carl Yang and Mengxiong Liu and Frank He and Xikun Zhang and Jian Peng and Jiawei Han,,,,37-54,Springer. Cham,Heterogeneous networks are widely used to model real-world semi-structured data. The key challenge of learning over such networks is the modeling of node similarity under both network structures and contents. To deal with network structures. most existing works assume a given or enumerable set of meta-paths and then leverage them for the computation of meta-path-based proximities or network embeddings. However. expert knowledge for given meta-paths is not always available. and as the length of considered meta-paths increases. the number of possible paths grows exponentially. which makes the path searching process very costly. On the other hand. while there are often rich contents around network nodes. they have hardly been leveraged to further improve similarity modeling. In this work. to properly model node similarity in content-rich heterogeneous networks. we propose to automatically …,True,wfN6SU4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,16,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-10928-8_3,17712627153006127290,/scholar?cites=17712627153006127290,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01448,0,0,0

1287724,Reinforced co-learning for semi-supervised ranking,2018,Shibi He,,,,,,"Learning to rank is vital to information retrieval and recommendation systems. Directly optimizing the listwise evaluation measure such as normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is an advanced way to learn a ranking model. However. this is only suited for training data with effective labels. In real applications. we are more often faced with the semi-supervised setting that only a partial set of data has labels. In this paper. we propose a co-learning strategy for the semi-supervised ranking problem. Our model has two modules: the classifier module and the reinforcement ranker module. Given a query. the classifier module is trained to classify whether a document is relevant or not. The reinforcement ranker module is trained to give relevance scores on the basis of treating ranking problems as Markov decision processes (MDP).  We name our approach ""reinforced co-learning"" because the two modules are iteratively optimized and affect each other while training.  When training the classifier module. we use the reinforcement module to give every candidate a relevance score and sample lower scored documents as irrelevant samples (negative samples). Likewise. in order to train the reinforcement ranker module. we use the classifier module to predict labels in the sequence in order to calculate the combined rewards. The linkage between the two modules is also reflected in the network structure. We add the feature sharing layer. which enables the classifier to distill its intermediate representations to the learning of reinforcement ranker module. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that both our co-learning strategy and feature …",True,wfN6SU4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/102868,,,,,https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/102868/HE-THESIS-2018.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1287725,Supplementary File for “Similarity Modeling on Heterogeneous Networks via Automatic Path Discovery”,,Carl Yang and Mengxiong Liu and Frank He and Xikun Zhang and Jian Peng and Jiawei Han,,,,,,Networks provide a natural and generic way of modeling real-world structured data. Among them. heterogeneous networks have drawn increasing research attention in the past decade. due to its capacity of retaining rich type information [31]. The rich representation of nodes and links facilitates various downstream applications including link prediction [16]. classification [8]. clustering [33]. recommender systems [45]. outlier detection [46]. etc. The modeling of heterogeneous networks is mainly around similarity learning under meta-paths [32. 39. 4. 19. 28. 38]. For example.[32] defines the proximity between two nodes by the normalized count of path instances following a userspecified meta-path. and shows that this measure captures better peer similarity semantics than random walk based similarity measures like SimRank [10] and PPR [11]. Other methods. while leveraging different techniques to combine or generate multiple meta-paths. all assume a given or enumerable set of useful meta-paths up to a certain empirically decided length. and none of them consider node contents.Recently. network embedding algorithms based on the advances in neural network models like Skip-gram models [21] and convolutional neural networks [14] have been extremely popular [25. 36. 6. 23. 13. 7]. They aim to compute distributed representations of nodes that capture their network proximities regarding both neighborhood similarity and structural similarity [40. 26. 18]. The learned embedding vectors can then be leveraged for various network learning tasks including link prediction [44]. node classification [43]. community detection [42]. etc. Following this trend …,True,wfN6SU4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://jiyang3.web.engr.illinois.edu/files/autopath_sup.pdf,,,,,https://jiyang3.web.engr.illinois.edu/files/autopath_sup.pdf,0,0,0

Recently developed probabilistic approaches allow distributing methylation signals at nucleotide resolution from MethylCap-seq data. Standard statistical methods for detecting differential methylation suffer from ‘curse of dimensionality’ and sparsity in signals. resulting in high false-positive rates. Strong correlation of signals between CG sites also yields spurious results. In this article. we review applicability of high-dimensional mean vector tests for detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and compare and contrast such tests with other methods for detecting DMRs. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to highlight the performance of these tests under different settings.

However if the data are dependent. the existing test procedures fail to preserve type I error at a given nominal significance level. We propose a new test for the mean vector when the dimension increases linearly with sample size and the data is a realization of an M-dependent stationary process. The order M is also allowed to increase with the sample size. Asymptotic normality of the test statistic is derived by extending the Central Limit Theorem for M-dependent processes using two-dimensional triangular arrays.

Existing radiation hardening techniques provide partial or no immunity when more than one node are affected. A new latch topology is presented that guarantees soft error tolerance when a single node or any arbitrary combination of node pairs is affected by an SEU.

To reduce the latency. we devised a dataflow architecture with an Allreduce-specific hardware accelerator that performs data aggregation and reduction while data is being transferred.

1287763,DeepConv-DTI: Prediction of drug-target interactions via deep learning with convolution on protein sequences,2019,Ingoo Lee and Jongsoo Keum and Hojung Nam,15,PLoS computational biology,6,e1007129,Public Library of Science,Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a key role in drug discovery. The high cost and labor-intensive nature of in vitro and in vivo experiments have highlighted the importance of in silico-based DTI prediction approaches. In several computational models. conventional protein descriptors have been shown to not be sufficiently informative to predict accurate DTIs. Thus. in this study. we propose a deep learning based DTI prediction model capturing local residue patterns of proteins participating in DTIs. When we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw protein sequences. we perform convolution on various lengths of amino acids subsequences to capture local residue patterns of generalized protein classes. We train our model with large-scale DTI information and demonstrate the performance of the proposed model using an independent dataset that is not seen during the training phase. As a result. our model performs better than previous protein descriptor-based models. Also. our model performs better than the recently developed deep learning models for massive prediction of DTIs. By examining pooled convolution results. we confirmed that our model can detect binding sites of proteins for DTIs.

1287764,Self-blm: Prediction of drug-target interactions via self-training svm,2017,Jongsoo Keum and Hojung Nam,12,PloS one,2,e0171839,Public Library of Science,Predicting drug-target interactions is important for the development of novel drugs and the repositioning of drugs. To predict such interactions. there are a number of methods based on drug and target protein similarity. Although these methods. such as the bipartite local model (BLM). show promise. they often categorize unknown interactions as negative interaction. Therefore. these methods are not ideal for finding potential drug-target interactions that have not yet been validated as positive interactions. Thus. here we propose a method that integrates machine learning techniques. such as self-training support vector machine (SVM) and BLM. to develop a self-training bipartite local model (SELF-BLM) that facilitates the identification of potential interactions. The method first categorizes unlabeled interactions and negative interactions among unknown interactions using a clustering method. Then. using the BLM method and self-training SVM. the unlabeled interactions are self-trained and final local classification models are constructed. When applied to four classes of proteins that include enzymes. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). ion channels. and nuclear receptors. SELF-BLM showed the best performance for predicting not only known interactions but also potential interactions in three protein classes compare to other related studies.

However. this entails a great deal of effort to clarify the interaction throughout in vitro or in vivo experiments. In this light. in silico prediction of the interactions between compounds and target proteins can help ease the efforts.

They learn from normal samples such that they produce high reconstruction errors for anomalous samples. However. AEs can exhibit the over-detection issue because they imperfectly reconstruct not only anomalous samples but also normal ones. To address this issue. we introduce an outlier-exposed style distillation network (OE-SDN) that mimics the mild distortions caused by an AE. which are termed as style translation. We use the difference between the outputs of the OE-SDN and AE as an alternative anomaly score.

Among this equipment. shielded cables. which are widely used in various industrial sectors. require careful and periodic diagnosis. owing to their poor installation environments and potential for creating huge economic losses. Reflectometry is a representative solution to locate the cable faults. However. conventional reflectometry techniques require prior knowledge about the cable under test. such as the reference wave velocity. total length of the cable. etc. Moreover. the degree of failure cannot be determined using conventional methods.

When a fault occurs in a multi-core cable. it not only affects the signals of faulty lines but in fact. disturbs the rest as well due to crosstalk and noise interference. Therefore. this results in C&I signal errors in NPP operation and further leads to a rise in concern regarding the NPP operation. Thus. it is necessary for diagnostic technologies of multi-core C&I cables to classify the faulty line and detect the fault to assure the safety and reliability of NPP operation.

Cham,Gliomas are primary brain tumors of central nervous system. Appropriate resection of gliomas in the early tumor stage is known to increase survival rate. However. the accurate resection of tumor is a challenging problem because the soft tissue shift may occur during the operation. To provide proper guidance to neurosurgery. it is necessary to align magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative ultrasound (iUS). In previous studies. many algorithms tried to find fiducial points that can lead to the appropriate registration.

Moreover. distinguishing ASD from TC using the data obtained from many sites is even more difficult because many factors might negatively affect the classification model leading to unstable results. This difficulty is especially true for existing rs-fMRI analysis methods such as functional connectivity analysis. Recent studies have shown better ASD classification performance using models constructed using recurrent neural network (RNN). However. a blinded application of RNN not considering the multi-site factors is sub-optimal.

The mean streamflow increased after 1994 (AMO phase change). This increase is related to the strengthening of the zonal gradients of the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) between the tropical central Pacific and the tropical Atlantic after 1994 (warm AMO phase). These gradients contributed to strengthen the Walker cell related upward movement over northern and northwestern South America. in particular during November-December (ND). Consistently. the frequency (R20 mm) and intensity (SDII) of extreme daily rainfall events increased during the 1995–2015 period.

The most challenging case is when there are no walls between lighting zones since then there are a significant inter-zone couplings. and the approach here performs especially well under these conditions.

This research project evaluated the performance of the combination of three Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approaches in the forecasting of the monthly rainfall anomalies for Southwestern Colombia. For this purpose. we applied the Non-linear Principal Component Analysis (NLPCA) approach to get the main modes. a Neural Network Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous variables (NNARMAX) as a model. and an Inverse NLPCA approach for reconstructing the monthly rainfall anomalies forecasting in the Andean Region (AR) and the Pacific Region (PR) of Southwestern Colombia. respectively.

1287799,The effect of using different rock failure criteria in wellbore stability analysis,2014,Reza Rahimi,,,,,,""" Determination of the appropriate drilling fluid density by rock failure analysis is an essential step to control wellbore instability. To determine wellbore failure stresses. the rock strength has to be known. an appropriate constitutive model has to be selected. and finally an accurate rock failure criterion must be chosen. Linear-poro elastic modeling of the mechanical wellbore failure is the most common approach to investigate wellbore instability. Numerous failure criteria have been used for the rock failure analysis but there is not any commonly accepted agreement of which failure criteria to use. Rock failure criteria differ in two main characteristics. First. there are linear and non-linear forms of failure criteria. The second characteristic is how different rock failure criteria consider the effect of the intermediate principal stress. Quantitative comparison has been previously studied on some of the failure criteria but few evaluations for the selection of the failure criteria are based on typical petroleum related situations. In this thesis. the thirteen most common rock failure criteria are compared and analyzed. The rock failure criteria were evaluated for three lithologies.

The fracture pressure and re-opening pressure were greatly increased by including LCMs in the fluid compared to the basic drilling fluid. The experimental results indicate that selecting fluids with LCM of certain range will enhance the fracture gradient and widen the available drilling fluid window.,True,1Ol5Y4wAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mortadha_Alsaba/publication/301684389_Can_Particle_Size_Distribution_of_Lost_Circulation_Materials_Affect_the_Fracture_Gradient/links/5721ec3408ae80636185d791/Can-Particle-Size-Distribution-of-Lost-Circulation-Materials-Affect-the-Fracture-Gradient.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mortadha_Alsaba/publication/301684389_Can_Particle_Size_Distribution_of_Lost_Circulation_Materials_Affect_the_Fracture_Gradient/links/5721ec3408ae80636185d791/Can-Particle-Size-Distribution-of-Lost-Circulation-Materials-Affect-the-Fracture-Gradient.pdf,0,0,0

1287807,Object-based saccadic selection during scene perception: Evidence from viewing position effects,2013,Maciej Pajak and Antje Nuthmann,13,Journal of vision,5,2-2,The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology,The goal of the present study was to further test the hypothesis that objects are important units of saccade targeting and. by inference. attentional selection in real-world scene perception. To this end. we investigated where people fixate within objects embedded in natural scenes. Previously. we reported a preferred viewing location (PVL) close to the center of objects (Nuthmann & Henderson. 2010). Here. we qualify this basic finding by showing that the PVL is affected by object size and the distance between the object and the previous fixation (ie. launch site distance). Moreover. we examined how within-object fixation position affected subsequent eye-movement behavior on the object. Unexpectedly. there was no refixation optimal viewing position (OVP) effect for objects in scenes. Where viewers initially placed their eyes on an object did not affect the likelihood of refixating that object. suggesting that some refixations on objects in scenes are made for reasons other than insufficient visual information. A fixation-duration inverted-optimal viewing (IOVP) effect was found for large objects: Fixations located at object center were longer than those falling near the edges of an object. Collectively. these findings lend further support to the notion of object-based saccade targeting in scenes.,True,zrNsBG4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,53,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121580,7244234830971353768,/scholar?cites=7244234830971353768,,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121580,0,0,0

A major goal is to identify changes in miRNA expression underlying protein synthesis-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Previous analyses focused on changes in miRNA levels in total lysate samples. Here. we asked whether changes in total miRNA accurately reflect changes in the amount of miRNA bound to Argonaute protein within the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Ago2 immunoprecipitation was used to isolate RISC-associated miRNAs following high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats. Using locked-nucleic acid-based PCR cards for high-throughput screening and independent validation by quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR. we identified differential regulation of Ago2-associated and total miRNA expression. The ratio of Ago2/total miRNA expression was regulated bi-directionally in a miRNA-specific manner and was largely dependent on NMDA receptor activation during LTP induction. The present results identify miRNA association with Ago2 as a potential control point in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Finally. novel computational analysis for targets of the Ago2-associated miRNAs identifies 21 pathways that are enriched and differentially targeted by the miRNAs including axon guidance. mTOR. MAPK.

Our contribution is an ontological attention mechanism which matches the structure of the ICD ontology. in which shared attention vectors are learned at each level of the hierarchy. and combined into label-dependent ensembles. Analysis of the attention heads shows that shared concepts are learned by the lowest common denominator node. This allows child nodes to focus on the differentiating concepts. leading to efficient learning and memory usage. Visualisation of the multi-level attention on the original text allows explanation of the code predictions according to the semantics of the ICD ontology. On the MIMIC-III dataset we achieve a 2.7\% absolute (11\% relative) improvement from 0.218 to 0.245 macro-F1 score compared to the previous state of the art across 3.912 codes.

An automated digital pathology system could serve as a second reader. perform initial triage in large screening studies. or assist in reporting. However. it is expensive to exhaustively annotate large histology image databases. since medical specialists are a scarce resource. In this paper. we apply the semi-supervised teacher-student knowledge distillation technique proposed by Yalniz et al.(2019) to the task of quantifying prognostic features in colorectal cancer. We obtain accuracy improvements through extending this approach to a chain of students. where each student's predictions are used to train the next student ie the student becomes the teacher. Using the chain approach. and only 0.5% labelled data (the remaining 99.5% in the unlabelled pool). we match the accuracy of training on 100% labelled data. At lower percentages of labelled data. similar gains in accuracy are seen. allowing some recovery of accuracy even from a poor initial choice of labelled training set.

One solution is to automatically extract scan-level labels from radiology reports. Previously. we showed that. by extending BERT with a per-label attention mechanism. we can train a single model to perform automatic extraction of many labels in parallel. However. if we rely on pure data-driven learning. the model sometimes fails to learn critical features or learns the correct answer via simplistic heuristics (eg. that “likely” indicates positivity). and thus fails to generalise to rarer cases which have not been learned or where the heuristics break down (eg.“likely represents prominent VR space or lacunar infarct” which indicates uncertainty over two differential diagnoses). In this work. we propose template creation for data synthesis. which enables us to inject expert knowledge about unseen entities from medical ontologies. and to teach the model rules on how to label difficult cases. by producing relevant training examples. Using this technique alongside domain-specific pre-training for our underlying BERT architecture ie. PubMedBERT. we improve F1 micro from 0.903 to 0.939 and F1 macro from 0.512 to 0.737 on an independent test set for 33 labels in head CT reports for stroke patients.

The aim was to evaluate Ang-2 as a potential new biomarker of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients with or without type 2 DM (T2DM). Material and methods: This was a multi-center. prospective study that included 138 (males: 91/66%) consecutive patients hospitalized due to NSTEMI. T2DM. or different cardiac disorders. The subjects were divided into four study groups: group A: 28 patients with NSTEMI and T2DM; group B: 47 patients with NSTEMI without T2DM; group C: 31 patients with T2DM. without a history of CAD; group D: 32 patients as a control group. Patients with NSTEMI underwent urgent coronarography. Clinical characteristics including biomarkers (hs-CRP. hsTnT. NT-proBNP. VEGF. HbA1c). SYNTAX SCORE. type of intervention (PCI vs. CABG). and number of implanted stents were taken into account in the analysis. Results: Serum Ang-2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with NSTEMI (group A: 1769 pg/ml; group B: 1757 pg/ml) and patients with T2DM (group C: 1993 pg/ml) as compared to the patients without CAD and without T2DM (group D: 866.8 pg/ml; p< 0.05). The prognostic accuracy of Ang-2 in NSTEMI diagnosis was determined with the area under the ROC curve (area under curve (AUC)= 0.63).

1287817,Evolutionary conservation and diversification of complex synaptic function in human proteome,2018,Maciej Pajak,,,,,The University of Edinburgh,The evolution of synapses from early proto-synaptic protein complexes in unicellular eukaryotes to sophisticated machines comprising thousands of proteins parallels the emergence of finely tuned synaptic plasticity. a molecular correlate for memory and learning. Phenotypic change in organisms is ultimately the result of evolution of their genotype at the molecular level. Selection pressure is a measure of how changes in genome sequence that arise though naturally occurring processes in populations are fixed or eliminated in subsequent generations. Inferring phylogenetic information about proteins such as the variation of selection pressure across coding sequences can provide valuable information not only about the origin of proteins. but also the contribution of specific sites within proteins to their current roles within an organism. Recent evolutionary studies of synaptic proteins have generated attractive hypotheses about the emergence of finely-tuned regulatory mechanisms in the post-synaptic proteome related to learning. however. these analyses are relatively superficial. In this thesis. I establish a scalable molecular phylogenetic modelling framework based on three new inference methodologies to investigate temporal and spatial aspects of selection pressure changes for the whole human proteome using protein orthologs from up to 68 taxa. Temporal modelling of evolutionary selection pressure reveals informative features and patterns for the entire human proteome and identifies groups of proteins that share distinct diversification timelines.

1287825,Clustering of Farsi sub-word images for whole-book recognition,2015,Mohammad Reza Soheili and Ehsanollah Kabir and Didier Stricker,9402,,,94020C,International Society for Optics and Photonics,Redundancy of word and sub-word occurrences in large documents can be effectively utilized in an OCR system to improve recognition results. Most OCR systems employ language modeling techniques as a post-processing step; however these techniques do not use important pictorial information that exist in the text image. In case of large-scale recognition of degraded documents. this information is even more valuable. In our previous work. we proposed a subword image clustering method for the applications dealing with large printed documents. In our clustering method. the ideal case is when all equivalent sub-word images lie in one cluster.

It can do many tasks and the advantage is that it is often with us. There are many unsolved problems in document digitalization with smartphones. such as noisy images. blurring. non-uniform light and geometric transforms. The presented methods have tried to fix one or more problems and make it easier or faster to find the document in the image. However. they cannot cover difficult situations such as complicated background. In this paper. we present a new dataset covers almost all the scenarios that may exist on document images that were taken by a smartphone. The collection includes 1111 images. We tested algorithms for finding the documents corners in our dataset and the results also provided.

People prefer to take pictures from documents with smartphones instead of scanning them with a scanner. Due to the limitation of scanners input size. it is difficult to scan everything with them. Resolution and quality of smartphone cameras are not enough to take a picture from large documents like posters. In this paper. we proposed a pipeline to make a high-resolution image of a document from its captured video. We suppose that during the record of the video. the camera was moved slowly all over the surface of the document from a close distance. In the proposed method we find the location of each frame in the document and we use a sharpness criterion to select the highest possible quality for each region of the document among all available frames.

Wavelets exhibit constant-Q property. which is also possessed by the basilar membrane filters in the peripheral auditory system. The basilar membrane filters or auditory filters are often modeled by a Gammatone function. which provides a good approximation to experimentally determined responses. The filterbank derived from these filters is referred to as a Gammatone filterbank. In general. wavelet analysis can be likened to a filterbank analysis and hence the interesting link between standard wavelet analysis and Gammatone filterbank. However. the Gammatone function does not exactly qualify as a wavelet because its time average is not zero. We show how bona fide wavelets can be constructed out of Gammatone functions.

Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper. we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China. and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO. we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries.

The reset action is equivalent to a modulo operation performed on the signal. We consider the problem of recovering the original signal from the measured modulo-operated signal. In our formulation. we assume that the underlying signal is Lipschitz continuous. The modulo-operated signal can be expressed as the sum of the original signal and a piecewise-constant signal that captures the transitions. The reconstruction requires estimating the piecewise-constant signal. We rely on local smoothness of the modulo-operated signal and employ wavelets with sufficient vanishing moments to suppress the polynomial component.

As we overlay the global mobility map with epidemic incidence curves and dates of government interventions. we observe that as case counts rose. mobility fell and has since then seen a slow but steady increase in flows. Further. in order to understand mixing within a region. we propose a new metric to quantify the effect of social distancing on the basis of mobility.Taking two very different countries sampled from the global spectrum. We analyze in detail the mobility patterns of the United States (US) and India. We then carry out a counterfactual analysis of delaying the lockdown and show that a one week delay would have doubled the reported number of cases in the US and India.  Finally. we quantify the effect of college students returning back to school for the fall semester on COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community. We employ the data from a recent university outbreak (reported on August 16. 2020) to infer possible Reff values and mobility flows combined with daily prevalence data and census data to obtain an estimate of new cases that might arrive on a college campus.

With the rapid use of depth sensors. a resurgent need for improving existing state-of-the-art algorithms. integrating depth information as an additional constraint became more ostensible. Current challenges involve combining RGB and depth information for reasoning about location and spatial extent of the object of interest. We make use of an improved deformable part model algorithm. allowing to deform the individual parts across multiple scales. approximating the location of the person in the scene and a conditional random field energy function for specifying the object’s spatial extent. Our proposed energy function models up to pairwise relations defined in the RGBD domain. enforcing label consistency for regions sharing similar unary and pairwise measurements.

Microsoft Kinect is a low cost commodity sensor extensively used by the industry and research community for several indoor applications. Within this framework. an accurate and fastto-implement pipeline is introduced working in two main directions: pure 3D foreground extraction of moving people in the scene and interpretation of the human movement using an ellipsoid as a mathematical reference model. The proposed work is part of an industrial transportation research project whose aim is to monitor the behavior of people and make a distinction between normal and abnormal behaviors in public train wagons.

1287849,A Quality Evaluation of Single and Multiple Camera Calibration Approaches for an Indoor Multi Camera Tracking System.,2014,Michele Adduci and Konstantinos Amplianitis and Ralf Reulke,45,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing & Spatial Information Sciences",,,,Human detection and tracking has been a prominent research area for several scientists around the globe. State of the art algorithms have been implemented. refined and accelerated to significantly improve the detection rate and eliminate false positives. While 2D approaches are well investigated. 3D human detection and tracking is still an unexplored research field. In both 2D/3D cases. introducing a multi camera system could vastly expand the accuracy and confidence of the tracking process. Within this work. a quality evaluation is performed on a multi RGB-D camera indoor tracking system for examining how camera calibration and pose can affect the quality of human tracks in the scene. independently from the detection and tracking approach used. After performing a calibration step on every Kinect sensor. state of the art single camera pose estimators were evaluated for checking how good the quality of the poses is estimated using planar objects such as an ordinate chessboard. With this information. a bundle block adjustment and ICP were performed for verifying the accuracy of the single pose estimators in a multi camera configuration system. Results have shown that single camera estimators provide high accuracy results of less than half a pixel forcing the bundle to converge after very few iterations. In relation to ICP. relative information between cloud pairs is more or less preserved giving a low score of fitting between concatenated pairs. Finally. sensor calibration proved to be an essential step for achieving maximum accuracy in the generated point clouds. and therefore in the accuracy of the produced 3D trajectories. from each sensor.,True,uWc4O0sAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,1,http://kostasamplianitis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/isprsarchives-XL-5-9-2014.pdf,8780459708359858089,/scholar?cites=8780459708359858089,,,http://kostasamplianitis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/isprsarchives-XL-5-9-2014.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper we propose a new algorithm based on cross entropy to learn effective binary descriptors. dubbed CE-Bits. providing an alternative to L-2 and hinge loss learning. Because of the usage of cross entropy. a min-max binary NP-hard problem is raised to optimize the binary code during training. We provide a novel solution by breaking the binary code into independent blocks and optimize them individually. Although sub-optimal. our method converges very fast and outperforms its L-2 and hinge loss counterparts. By conducting extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. we show that CE-Bits efficiently generates effective binary descriptors for both classification and retrieval tasks and outper-forms state-of-the-art supervised hashing algorithms.,True,Ad6gCBQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,17,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7926727/,18233893945766121781,/scholar?cites=18233893945766121781,,,,0,0,0

Making accurate frequency measurement from low voltage distribution systems through the wide deployment of Frequency Disturbance Recorders (FDRs) has been the major innovation for the Frequency monitoring network (FNET). Currently. the frequency calculation algorithm based on the phasor angles (FPA) of the measured voltage signal in the FDR. has achieved high accuracy. However. this algorithm is very sensitive to noise which is inevitable in the signal sampling process.

To perform a tool-using task. a robot acts in a way to manipulate the tool to create a certain effect on the target object. However. different tasks involve different actions to manipulate different tools on different objects to create different effects. Thus. it is not feasible for the robot to learn how to use tools all such a variety of cases. The goal of our research is to enable a robot to learn how to use tools in a way that learning can be generalized for wide variety of actions. tools. and effects. Stoytchev [1] proposed to learn tool affordances. solely grounded in behavioral repertoire of the robot and a color-based tool recognition scheme. The problem is that a representation for one tool could not be generalized to different tools and the previously learned knowledge related to a tool does not help in learning how to use a similar tool. The approach of Sinavpov and Stoytchev [2] requires large number of manipulation trials and does not handle uncertainty of the tool using task.

Various methods are used for the determination of cancer. One of these methods is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. which has the ability to reveal biochemical changes. The most common features used to distinguish patients with cancer and healthy subjects are peak densities. peak height ratios. and peak area ratios. The greatest challenge of studies conducted to distinguish cancer patients from healthy subjects using FTIR signals is that the signals of cancer patients and healthy subjects are similar. In the current study. a method in which the area and height ratios of the FTIR signal. as well as various statistical features. are proposed in order to overcome this difficulty. Blood samples (plasma) were collected from 30 colon cancer patients and 40 healthy subjects. and FTIR measurements were performed. A total of 16 features were obtained. including five height ratios. five area ratios. and six statistical features. from each FTIR signal. The 16 features were classified with a multilayer perceptron neural network and support vector machines using cross-validation and their performances were then compared.

Thus. the question arises whether pupil dilation prompts a subsequent increase in visuocortical activity. In this study. we investigated the extent to which changes in visuocortical activity relate to changes in pupil diameter. The amplitude of the sustained visuocortical response to a flickering stimulus (ie. steady-state visually evoked potential [ssVEP] power) was examined in 39 participants while pupil diameter was measured. To generalize across stimulus conditions. Gabor stimuli varied in brightness and ssVEP driving frequency. As expected. brighter stimuli prompted pupil constriction and larger ssVEP power. To determine whether momentary fluctuations in pupil size contribute to the ssVEP amplitude under conditions of constant luminance and frequency. the single-trial means from each measure were correlated and the shape of the pupil-diameter waveform related to the ssVEP amplitude time course. both within and between participants. Under constant conditions. changes in pupil diameter were not related to changes in ssVEP amplitude. at any luminance level or driving frequency.

Traditionally. such algorithms make decisions. ie. select actions to execute. at every single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper. we propose a novel framework. Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR). which enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating it. FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm which maintains an explicit policy estimate by enabling temporal abstractions in the action space. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600 domain.

1287950,Learning to Multi-Task by Active Sampling,2017,Sahil Sharma and Ashutosh Jha and Parikshit Hedge and Balaraman Ravindran,,,,,,One of the long-standing challenges in Artificial Intelligence for learning goal-directed behavior is to build a single agent which can solve multiple tasks. Recent progress in multi-task learning for goal-directed sequential problems has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a student network learns from multiple task-specific expert networks by mimicking the task-specific policies of the expert networks. While such approaches offer a promising solution to the multi-task learning problem. they require supervision from large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time for training. In this work. we propose an efficient multi-task learning framework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without the need for expert supervision. Our work uses active learning principles to achieve multi-task learning by sampling the harder tasks more than the easier ones. We propose three distinct models under our active sampling framework. An adaptive method with extremely competitive multi-tasking performance. A UCB-based meta-learner which casts the problem of picking the next task to train on as a multi-armed bandit problem. A meta-learning method that casts the next-task picking problem as a full Reinforcement Learning problem and uses actor critic methods for optimizing the multi-tasking performance directly. We demonstrate results in the Atari 2600 domain on seven multi-tasking instances: three 6-task instances. one 8-task instance. two 12-task instances and one 21-task instance.,True,P6l5tBcAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,27,https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06053,7942202814055616408,/scholar?cites=7942202814055616408,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06053,0,0,0

Among all such visual decision making problems. those with discrete action spaces often tend to have underlying compositional structure in the said action space. Such action spaces often contain actions such as go left. go up as well as go diagonally up and left (which is a composition of the former two actions). The representations of control policies in such domains have traditionally been modeled without exploiting this inherent compositional structure in the action spaces. We propose a new learning paradigm. Factored Action space Representations (FAR) wherein we decompose a control policy learned using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into independent components. analogous to decomposing a vector in terms of some orthogonal basis vectors. This architectural modification of the control policy representation allows the agent to learn about multiple actions simultaneously. while executing only one of them. We demonstrate that FAR yields considerable improvements on top of two DRL algorithms in Atari 2600: FARA3C outperforms A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic) in 9 out of 14 tasks and FARAQL outperforms AQL (Asynchronous n-step Q-Learning) in 9 out of 13 tasks.,True,P6l5tBcAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC,9,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07269,11920885852484090929,/scholar?cites=11920885852484090929,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07269,0,0,0

A hallmark of RL algorithms is Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using next state's value function. -returns generalize beyond 1-step returns and strike a balance between Monte Carlo and TD learning methods. While lambda-returns have been extensively studied in RL. they haven't been explored a lot in Deep RL. This paper's first contribution is an exhaustive benchmarking of lambda-returns. Although mathematically tractable. the use of exponentially decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a rather ad-hoc design choice. Our second major contribution is that we propose a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR). wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. This allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants to weigh the n-step returns based targets. In contrast. lambda-returns restrict RL agents to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme. Autodidactic returns can be used for improving any RL algorithm which uses TD learning. We empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the use of n-step returns.

We also demonstrate how our framework can be used to perform land cover classification by modifying the trained cGAN to extract features from overhead imagery. This is interesting because. although we are using this modified cGAN as a feature extractor for overhead imagery. it incorporates knowledge of how locations look from the ground.,True,UGhyv2UAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06923,6918812755063864988,/scholar?cites=6918812755063864988,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06923,0,0,0
1287961,Cross-Time and Orientation-Invariant Overhead Image Geolocalization Using Deep Local Features,2020,Yuxin Tian and Xueqing Deng and Yi Zhu and Shawn Newsam,,,,2512-2520,,Overhead image geolocalization is becoming increasingly important due to the growing collection of drone imagery without location information. In this paper. we perform large-scale overhead image geolocalization by matching a query image to wide-area reference imagery with known location. We use deep local features so that the query image need not align with but only overlap the tiled reference imagery. We further address two key challenges. For when the query and reference imagery are from different dates. we perform cross-time geolocalization using time invariant features learned using a Siamese network. For when the query and reference imagery are oriented differently. we introduce an orientation normalization network. We demonstrate our contributions on two new high-resolution overhead image datasets. Our method significantly outperforms strong baselines on cross-time geolocalization and is shown to exhibit promising orientation invariance.,True,UGhyv2UAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,3,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Tian_Cross-Time_and_Orientation-Invariant_Overhead_Image_Geolocalization_Using_Deep_Local_Features_WACV_2020_paper.html,2611159934387117023,/scholar?cites=2611159934387117023,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/papers/Tian_Cross-Time_and_Orientation-Invariant_Overhead_Image_Geolocalization_Using_Deep_Local_Features_WACV_2020_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1287962,Generalizing Deep Models for Overhead Image Segmentation Through Getis-Ord Gi* Pooling,2019,Xueqing Deng and Yi Zhu and Yuxin Tian and Shawn Newsam,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.10667,,,,That most deep learning models are purely data driven is both a strength and a weakness. Given sufficient training data. the optimal model for a particular problem can be learned. However. this is usually not the case and so instead the model is either learned from scratch from a limited amount of training data or pre-trained on a different problem and then fine-tuned. Both of these situations are potentially suboptimal and limit the generalizability of the model. Inspired by this. we investigate methods to inform or guide deep learning models for geospatial image analysis to increase their performance when a limited amount of training data is available or when they are applied to scenarios other than which they were trained on. In particular. we exploit the fact that there are certain fundamental rules as to how things are distributed on the surface of the Earth and these rules do not vary substantially between locations. Based on this. we develop a novel feature pooling method for convolutional neural networks using Getis-Ord Gi* analysis from geostatistics. Experimental results show our proposed pooling function has significantly better generalization performance compared to a standard data-driven approach when applied to overhead image segmentation.,True,UGhyv2UAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10667,9915440964044676363,/scholar?cites=9915440964044676363,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10667,0,0,0

Ground-level images and videos provide a different perspective than overhead imagery and can be applied to a range of applications such as land use mapping. activity detection. pollution mapping. etc. The sparse and uneven distribution of this data presents a problem. however. for generating dense maps. We therefore investigate the problem of spatially interpolating the high-dimensional features extracted from sparse social media to enable dense labeling using standard classifiers. Further. we show how prior knowledge about region boundaries can be used to improve the interpolation through spatial morphing kernel regression.

The large variability of objects and classes is. however. drastically reduced in most medical applications where images are dominated by repetitive patterns with. at times. subtle differences between the classes. This paper takes the example of finetuning a pretrained convolutional network on a histopathology task. Because of the reduced visual variability in this application domain. the network mostly learns to detect textures and simple patterns. As a result. the complex structures that maximize the channel activations of deep layers in the pretrained network are not present after finetuning. The learned features seem to be used by the network to spot atypical nuclei in the images. as shown by class activation maps.

With feature transfer being a common practice. scale-invariant features implicitly learned from pretraining on ImageNet tend to be preferred over scale-covariant features. The pruning strategy in this paper proposes a way to maintain scale covariance in the transferred features. Deep learning interpretability is used to analyze the layer-wise encoding of scale information for popular architectures such as InceptionV3 and ResNet50. Interestingly. the covariance of scale peaks at central layers and decreases close to softmax. Motivated by these results. our pruning strategy removes the layers where invariance to scale is learned.

1287986,High-order attention models for visual question answering,2017,Idan Schwartz and Alexander G Schwing and Tamir Hazan,,,,,,The quest for algorithms that enable cognitive abilities is an important part of machine learning. A common trait in many recently investigated cognitive-like tasks is that they take into account different data modalities. such as visual and textual input. In this paper we propose a novel and generally applicable form of attention mechanism that learns high-order correlations between various data modalities. We show that high-order correlations effectively direct the appropriate attention to the relevant elements in the different data modalities that are required to solve the joint task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our high-order attention mechanism on the task of visual question answering (VQA). where we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard VQA dataset.,True,5V-yJT4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,68,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04323,13901095197481337133,/scholar?cites=13901095197481337133,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04323,0,0,0

While significant progress has paved a path to address visual dialog with algorithms. details and nuances remain a challenge. Attention mechanisms have demonstrated compelling results to extract details in visual question answering and also provide a convincing framework for visual dialog due to their interpretability and effectiveness. However. the many data utilities that accompany visual dialog challenge existing attention techniques. We address this issue and develop a general attention mechanism for visual dialog which operates on any number of data utilities. To this end. we design a factor graph based attention mechanism which combines any number of utility representations.

1287989,Removing Bias in Multi-modal Classifiers: Regularization by Maximizing Functional Entropies,2020,Itai Gat and Idan Schwartz and Alexander G Schwing and Tamir Hazan,33,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,,,,Many recent datasets contain a variety of different data modalities. for instance. image. question. and answer data in visual question answering (VQA). When training deep net classifiers on those multi-modal datasets. the modalities get exploited at different scales. ie. some modalities can more easily contribute to the classification results than others. This is suboptimal because the classifier is inherently biased towards a subset of the modalities. To alleviate this shortcoming. we propose a novel regularization term based on the functional entropy. Intuitively. this term encourages to balance the contribution of each modality to the classification result. However. regularization with the functional entropy is challenging. To address this. we develop a method based on the log-Sobolev inequality. which bounds the functional entropy with the functional-Fisher-information. Intuitively. this maximizes the amount of information that the modalities contribute. On the two challenging multi-modal datasets VQA-CPv2 and SocialIQ. we obtain state-of-the-art results while more uniformly exploiting the modalities. In addition. we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on Colored MNIST.,True,5V-yJT4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10802,11041773532262485134,/scholar?cites=11041773532262485134,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10802,0,0,0
1287990,Ensemble of MRR and NDCG models for Visual Dialog,2021,Idan Schwartz,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.07511,,,,Assessing an AI agent that can converse in human language and understand visual content is challenging. Generation metrics. such as BLEU scores favor correct syntax over semantics. Hence a discriminative approach is often used. where an agent ranks a set of candidate options. The mean reciprocal rank (MRR) metric evaluates the model performance by taking into account the rank of a single human-derived answer. This approach. however. raises a new challenge: the ambiguity and synonymy of answers. for instance. semantic equivalence (e.g.. `yeah' and `yes'). To address this. the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) metric has been used to capture the relevance of all the correct answers via dense annotations. However. the NDCG metric favors the usually applicable uncertain answers such as `I don't know. Crafting a model that excels on both MRR and NDCG metrics is challenging. Ideally. an AI agent should answer a human-like reply and validate the correctness of any answer. To address this issue. we describe a two-step non-parametric ranking approach that can merge strong MRR and NDCG models. Using our approach. we manage to keep most MRR state-of-the-art performance (70.41% vs. 71.24%) and the NDCG state-of-the-art performance (72.16% vs. 75.35%).

1288014,Paraphrasing complex network: Network compression via factor transfer,2018,Jangho Kim and SeoungUK Park and Nojun Kwak,,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS),,,,Deep neural networks (DNN) have recently shown promising performances in various areas. Although DNNs are very powerful. a large number of network parameters requires substantial storage and memory bandwidth which hinders them from being applied to actual embedded systems. Many researchers have sought ways of model compression to reduce the size of a network with minimal performance degradation. Among them. a method called knowledge transfer is to train the student network with a stronger teacher network. In this paper. we propose a method to overcome the limitations of conventional knowledge transfer methods and improve the performance of a student network. An auto-encoder is used in an unsupervised manner to extract compact factors which are defined as compressed feature maps of the teacher network. When using the factors to train the student network. we observed that the performance of the student network becomes better than the ones with other conventional knowledge transfer methods because factors contain paraphrased compact information of the teacher network that is easy for the student network to understand.,True,mzFEJVIAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,100,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04977,2520473274058783123,/scholar?cites=2520473274058783123,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04977,0,0,0

However. previous online knowledge distillation methods only utilize the class probabilities. Thus in this paper. we propose an online knowledge distillation method that transfers not only the knowledge of the class probabilities but also that of the feature map using the adversarial training framework. We train multiple networks simultaneously by employing discriminators to distinguish the feature map distributions of different networks. Each network has its corresponding discriminator which discriminates the feature map from its own as fake while classifying that of the other network as real. By training a network to fool the corresponding discriminator. it can learn the other network’s feature map distribution. We show that our method performs better than the conventional direct alignment method such as L1 and is more suitable for online distillation. Also. we propose a novel cyclic learning scheme for training more than two networks together. We have applied our method to various network architectures on the classification task and discovered a significant improvement of performance especially in the case of training a pair of a small network and a large one.,True,mzFEJVIAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,14,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chung20a.html,16816599832360988251,/scholar?cites=16816599832360988251,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chung20a/chung20a.pdf,0,0,0
1288016,Feature fusion for online mutual knowledge distillation,2019,Jangho Kim and Minsung Hyun and Inseop Chung and Nojun Kwak,,25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition,,,,We propose a learning framework named Feature Fusion Learning (FFL) that efficiently trains a powerful classifier through a fusion module which combines the feature maps generated from parallel neural networks. Specifically. we train a number of parallel neural networks as sub-networks. then we combine the feature maps from each sub-network using a fusion module to create a more meaningful feature map. The fused feature map is passed into the fused classifier for overall classification. Unlike existing feature fusion methods. in our framework. an ensemble of sub-network classifiers transfers its knowledge to the fused classifier and then the fused classifier delivers its knowledge back to each sub-network. mutually teaching one another in an online-knowledge distillation manner. This mutually teaching system not only improves the performance of the fused classifier but also obtains performance gain in each sub-network. Moreover. our model is more beneficial because different types of network can be used for each sub-network. We have performed a variety of experiments on multiple datasets such as CIFAR-10. CIFAR-100 and ImageNet and proved that our method is more effective than other alternative methods in terms of performance of both sub-networks and the fused classifier.,True,mzFEJVIAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,14,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09058,3354802232969856779,/scholar?cites=3354802232969856779,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09058,0,0,0
1288017,Qkd: Quantization-aware knowledge distillation,2019,Jangho Kim and Yash Bhalgat and Jinwon Lee and Chirag Patel and Nojun Kwak,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.12491,,,,Quantization and Knowledge distillation (KD) methods are widely used to reduce memory and power consumption of deep neural networks (DNNs). especially for resource-constrained edge devices. Although their combination is quite promising to meet these requirements. it may not work as desired. It is mainly because the regularization effect of KD further diminishes the already reduced representation power of a quantized model. To address this short-coming. we propose Quantization-aware Knowledge Distillation (QKD) wherein quantization and KD are care-fully coordinated in three phases. First. Self-studying (SS) phase fine-tunes a quantized low-precision student network without KD to obtain a good initialization. Second. Co-studying (CS) phase tries to train a teacher to make it more quantizaion-friendly and powerful than a fixed teacher. Finally. Tutoring (TU) phase transfers knowledge from the trained teacher to the student. We extensively evaluate our method on ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 datasets and show an ablation study on networks with both standard and depthwise-separable convolutions. The proposed QKD outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods (eg. 1.3% improvement on ResNet-18 with W4A4. 2.6% on MobileNetV2 with W4A4). Additionally. QKD could recover the full-precision accuracy at as low as W3A3 quantization on ResNet and W6A6 quantization on MobilenetV2.,True,mzFEJVIAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,11,https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12491,14630303220790911427,/scholar?cites=14630303220790911427,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12491,0,0,0
1288018,Position-based Scaled Gradient for Model Quantization and Pruning,2020,Jangho Kim and KiYoon Yoo and Nojun Kwak,,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS),,,,We propose the position-based scaled gradient (PSG) that scales the gradient depending on the position of a weight vector to make it more compression-friendly. First. we theoretically show that applying PSG to the standard gradient descent (GD). which is called PSGD. is equivalent to the GD in the warped weight space. a space made by warping the original weight space via an appropriately designed invertible function. Second. we empirically show that PSG acting as a regularizer to the weight vectors is favorable for model compression domains such as quantization and pruning. PSG reduces the gap between the weight distributions of a full-precision model and its compressed counterpart. This enables the versatile deployment of a model either as an uncompressed mode or as a compressed mode depending on the availability of resources. The experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed PSG in both domains of pruning and quantization even for extremely low bits.

However. in the real world. additional data accumulate gradually and the model requires additional training without accessing the old training data. This usually leads to the catastrophic forgetting problem which is inevitable for the traditional training methodology of neural networks. In this paper. we propose a continual learning method that is able to learn additional tasks while retaining the performance of previously learned tasks by stacking parameters. Composed of two complementary components. the index module and the StackNet. our method estimates the index of the corresponding task for an input sample with the index module and utilizes a particular portion of StackNet with this index.

However. traditional personalization methods are not suitable for edge devices because retraining or finetuning is needed with limited personal data. Also. a full model might be too heavy for edge devices with limited resources. Unfortunately. model compression methods which can handle the model complexity issue also require the retraining phase. These multiple training phases generally need huge computational cost during on-device learning which can be a burden to edge devices. In this work. we propose a dynamic personalization method called prototype-based personalized pruning (PPP). PPP considers both ends of personalization and model efficiency. After training a network. PPP can easily prune the network with a prototype representing the characteristics of personal data and it performs well without retraining or finetuning.

Several feature extraction methods with varying memory and computational complexity are presented along with their corresponding classification accuracies. On the N-TIDIGITS18 dataset. we show that a fixed bin size based feature extraction method that votes across both time and spike count features can achieve an accuracy of 95% in software similar to previously report methods that use fixed number of bins per sample while using ~3X less energy and ~25X less memory for feature extraction (~1.5X less overall). Hardware measurements for the same topology show a slightly reduced accuracy of 94% that can be attributed to the extra correlations in hardware random weights.

Many machine learning (ML)-based IDSs have been proposed in the literature for the detection of malicious network traffic. However. recent works have shown that ML models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations through which an adversary can cause IDSs to malfunction by introducing a small impracticable perturbation in the network traffic. In this paper. we propose an adversarial ML attack using generative adversarial networks (GANs) that can successfully evade an ML-based IDS.

1288054,Invertible generative models for inverse problems: mitigating representation error and dataset bias,2020,Muhammad Asim and Ali Ahmed and Paul Hand,,,,,,Trained generative models have shown remarkable performance as priors for inverse problems in imaging–for example. Generative Adversarial Network priors permit recovery of test images from 5-10x fewer measurements than sparsity priors. Unfortunately. these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices. mode collapse. and bias in the training dataset. In this paper. we demonstrate that invertible neural networks. which have zero representation error by design. can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising. compressive sensing. and inpainting. Given a trained generative model. we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization that promotes high likelihood images. either directly by penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing. invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios. and due to their lack of representation error. invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set. including out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance for compressive sensing to unlearned methods. such as the deep decoder. and we establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible model.,True,1K-_ucMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,22,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/asim20a.html,18360186920065669378,/scholar?cites=18360186920065669378,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/asim20a/asim20a.pdf,0,0,0

The downside of multishot MRI is that it is very sensitive to subject motion and even small levels of motion during the scan can produce artifacts in the final magnetic resonance (MR) image. which may result in a misdiagnosis. Numerous efforts have focused on addressing this issue; however. all of these proposals are limited in terms of how much motion they can correct and require excessive computational time.

Taipei city which has been known for its wide variety of cuisines and snacks now offers much convenience for tourists and backpackers. Most tour information providing or scheduling software in the market provides basic query or search functions. but their output is fixed and lack of customized recommendation based on tourists' personal characteristics. If travelers have no prior knowledge of their target destination. they may be flooded by information from guidebooks or the Internet and have trouble in making arrangements. Therefore the study makes a practice on tour scheduling recommendation based on two popular classification models -- Logistic Regression and KNN.

TIPP (Time Invariant Portfolio Protection). when adjusting active assets. only considers the scale of asset of that time regardless of how market trend proceeds. In other words. TIPP is clumsy in evading loss and pursuing profits. This study makes use of the predictability of artificial neural network. via market trend analysis and the learning of historical data. to find out the most optimized Multiplier of TIPP in various situations so as to optimize dynamic portfolio insurance.

The crop plant used in our study is sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. Phenotyping is a set of methodologies for analyzing and obtaining characteristic traits of a plant. In a phenotypic study. leaves are often used to estimate traits such as individual leaf area and Leaf Area Index (LAI).

However. UAVs often provide low spatial resolution images when flying at high altitudes. This can be an issue when extracting individual leaves from these images. Leaf segmentation is even more challenging because of densely overlapping leaves. Segmentation of leaf instances in the UAV images can be used to measure various phenotypic traits such as leaf length. maximum leaf width. and leaf area index. Successful leaf segmentation accurately detects leaf edges. Popular deep neural network approaches have loss functions that do not consider the spatial accuracy of the segmentation near an object's edge. This paper proposes a shape-based leaf segmentation method that segments leaves using continuous functions and produces precise contours for the leaf edges.

Recently. rapid development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and open-sourced high resolution satellite building image datasets have pushed the performance boundary further for automated building extractions. However. CNN approaches often generate imprecise building morphologies including noisy edges and round corners. In this paper. we leverage the performance of CNNs. and propose a module that uses prior knowledge of building corners to create angular and concise building polygons from CNN segmentation outputs.

1288093,Entity-relation extraction as multi-turn question answering,2019,Xiaoya Li and Fan Yin and Zijun Sun and Xiayu Li and Arianna Yuan and Duo Chai and Mingxin Zhou and Jiwei Li,,ACL 2019,,,,In this paper. we propose a new paradigm for the task of entity-relation extraction. We cast the task as a multi-turn question answering problem. ie. the extraction of entities and relations is transformed to the task of identifying answer spans from the context. This multi-turn QA formalization comes with several key advantages: firstly. the question query encodes important information for the entity/relation class we want to identify; secondly. QA provides a natural way of jointly modeling entity and relation; and thirdly. it allows us to exploit the well developed machine reading comprehension (MRC) models. Experiments on the ACE and the CoNLL04 corpora demonstrate that the proposed paradigm significantly outperforms previous best models. We are able to obtain the state-of-the-art results on all of the ACE04. ACE05 and CoNLL04 datasets. increasing the SOTA results on the three datasets to 49.4 (+ 1.0). 60.2 (+ 0.6) and 68.9 (+ 2.1). respectively. Additionally. we construct a newly developed dataset RESUME in Chinese. which requires multi-step reasoning to construct entity dependencies. as opposed to the single-step dependency extraction in the triplet exaction in previous datasets. The proposed multi-turn QA model also achieves the best performance on the RESUME dataset.,True,5mrPuvIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,74,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05529,6894749026775003944,/scholar?cites=6894749026775003944,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05529,0,0,0

In this standard formalization. categories are merely represented as indexes in the label vocabulary. and the model lacks for explicit instructions on what to classify. Inspired by the current trend of formalizing NLP problems as question answering tasks. we propose a new framework for text classification. in which each category label is associated with a category description. Descriptions are generated by hand-crafted templates or using abstractive/extractive models from reinforcement learning. The concatenation of the description and the text is fed to the classifier to decide whether or not the current label should be assigned to the text. The proposed strategy forces the model to attend to the most salient texts with respect to the label. which can be regarded as a hard version of attention. leading to better performances. We observe significant performance boosts over strong baselines on a wide range of text classification tasks including single-label classification. multi-label classification and multi-aspect sentiment analysis.,True,5mrPuvIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,8,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chai20a.html,16433285832703645186,/scholar?cites=16433285832703645186,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chai20a/chai20a.pdf,0,0,0

It is expected that preserving data structure during sparse coding and dictionary learning can enhance the recovery performance. However. many existing dictionary learning methods handle training samples individually. while missing relationships between samples. which result in dictionaries with redundant atoms but poor representation ability. In this paper. we propose a novel sparse representation approach called conformal and low-rank sparse representation (CLRSR) for image restoration problems. To achieve a more compact and representative dictionary. conformal property is introduced by preserving the angles of local geometry formed by neighboring samples in the feature space.

While adversarial learning strengthens the feature transferability which the community focuses on. its impact on the feature discriminability has not been fully explored. In this paper. a series of experiments based on spectral analysis of the feature representations have been conducted. revealing an unexpected deterioration of the discriminability while learning transferable features adversarially. Our key finding is that the eigenvectors with the largest singular values will dominate the feature transferability. As a consequence. the transferability is enhanced at the expense of over penalization of other eigenvectors that embody rich structures crucial for discriminability. Towards this problem. we present Batch Spectral Penalization (BSP). a general approach to penalizing the largest singular values so that other eigenvectors can be relatively strengthened to boost the feature discriminability.

While several methods with explicit attempts to overcome catastrophic forgetting have been proposed. negative transfer is rarely delved into. In this paper. we launch an in-depth empirical investigation into negative transfer in fine-tuning and find that. for the weight parameters and feature representations. transferability of their spectral components is diverse. For safe transfer learning. we present Batch Spectral Shrinkage (BSS). a novel regularization approach to penalizing smaller singular values so that untransferable spectral components are suppressed.

A solution to this problem is applying domain adaptation approaches to fine-grained scenarios. where the key idea is to discover the commonality between existing fine-grained image datasets and massive unlabeled data in the wild. The main technical bottleneck lies in that the large inter-domain variation will deteriorate the subtle boundaries of small inter-class variation during domain alignment. This paper presents the Progressive Adversarial Networks (PAN) to align fine-grained categories across domains with a curriculum-based adversarial learning framework. In particular. throughout the learning process. domain adaptation is carried out through all multi-grained features. progressively exploiting the label hierarchy from coarse to fine. The progressive learning is applied upon both category classification and domain alignment. boosting both the discriminability and the transferability of the fine-grained features.

We introduce the following desiderata for uncertainty calibration:(a) accuracy-preserving.(b) data-efficient. and (c) high expressive power. We show that none of the existing methods satisfy all three requirements. and demonstrate how Mix-n-Match calibration strategies (ie. ensemble and composition) can help achieve remarkably better data-efficiency and expressive power while provably maintaining the classification accuracy of the original classifier. Mix-n-Match strategies are generic in the sense that they can be used to improve the performance of any off-the-shelf calibrator. We also reveal potential issues in standard evaluation practices. Popular approaches (eg. histogram-based expected calibration error (ECE)) may provide misleading results especially in small-data regime. Therefore. we propose an alternative data-efficient kernel density-based estimator for a reliable evaluation of the calibration performance and prove its asymptotically unbiasedness and consistency.

Frequently such approximation is performed in a sequential manner. using a series of intermediate densities that converge to the target density and may require a large number of evaluations of the system response. which for applications involving complex numerical models creates a significant computational burden. To alleviate this burden an adaptive Kriging stochastic sampling and density approximation framework (AK-SSD) is developed in this work.

1288118,Bayesian posterior sampling using a metamodel‐based sequential approach,2018,J Zhang and A Taflanidis,,Reliability and Optimization of Structural Systems,,,,The use of stochastic simulation techniques for Bayesian inference of engineering systems requires sampling from the posterior distribution of the system model parameters. This stochastic sampling is often sequentially performed. using a series of intermediate auxiliary densities that gradually converge to the posterior target density. To alleviate the computational burden in this setting. which can be prohibitive for applications with complex numerical models. the use of metamodeling techniques has been suggested for approximating the system likelihood function. This work investigates the implementation of the adaptive Kriging stochastic sampling and density approximation algorithm. proposed recently by the authors. for such Bayesian posterior sampling applications. Adaptive characteristics are established in an iterative implementation: at each iteration. the posterior distribution is approximated using the current metamodel. and posterior samples are obtained by transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). using parallel independent chains to fully exploit Kriging’s computational efficiency for providing predictions through vectorized manipulations. The iterative procedure stops when posterior densities approximated in consecutive iterations become similar. using the Hellinger distance a comparison metric. If no convergence is established. the metamodel is refined by sample-based design of experiments such that its prediction accuracy is improved both globally (intermediate auxiliary densities) and locally (target posterior density).

1288135,Neural Networks with Activation Networks,2018,Jinhyeok Jang and Jaehong Kim and Jaeyeon Lee and Seungjoon Yang,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08618,,,,This work presents an adaptive activation method for neural networks that exploits the interdependency of features. Each pixel. node. and layer is assigned with a polynomial activation function. whose coefficients are provided by an auxiliary activation network. The activation of a feature depends on the features of neighboring pixels in a convolutional layer and other nodes in a dense layer. The dependency is learned from data by the activation networks. In our experiments. networks with activation networks provide significant performance improvement compared to the baseline networks on which they are built. The proposed method can be used to improve the network performance as an alternative to increasing the number of nodes and layers.,True,VyOx3aAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08618,5412859065761065361,/scholar?cites=5412859065761065361,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08618,0,0,0
1288136,Efficient architecture for deep neural networks with heterogeneous sensitivity,2021,Hyunjoong Cho and Jinhyeok Jang and Chanhyeok Lee and Seungjoon Yang,134,Neural Networks,,95-106,Pergamon,In this study. we present a neural network that consists of nodes with heterogeneous sensitivity. Each node in a network is assigned a variable that determines the sensitivity with which it learns to perform a given task. The network is trained via a constrained optimization that maximizes the sparsity of the sensitivity variables while ensuring optimal network performance. As a result. the network learns to perform a given task using only a few sensitive nodes. Insensitive nodes. which are nodes with zero sensitivity. can be removed from a trained network to obtain a computationally efficient network. Removing zero-sensitivity nodes has no effect on the performance of the network because the network has already been trained to perform the task without them. The regularization parameter used to solve the optimization problem was simultaneously found during the training of the networks.

However. the ECG signal is prone to contamination by different kinds of noise. Such noise may cause deformation on the ECG heartbeat waveform. leading to cardiologists’ mislabeling or misinterpreting heartbeats due to varying types of artifacts and interference. To address this problem. some previous studies propose a computerized technique based on machine learning (ML) to distinguish between normal and abnormal heartbeats. Unfortunately. ML works on a handcrafted. feature-based approach and lacks feature representation. To overcome such drawbacks. deep learning (DL) is proposed in the pre-training and fine-tuning phases to produce an automated feature representation for multi-class classification of arrhythmia conditions. In the pre-training phase. stacked denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and autoencoders (AEs) are used for feature learning; in the fine-tuning phase. deep neural networks (DNNs) are implemented as a classifier.

The proposed DL architecture is divided into Deep Auto-Encoders (DAEs) as an unsupervised form of feature learning and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as a classifier. The objective of this study is to improve on the previous machine learning technique that consists of several data processing steps such as feature extraction and feature selection or feature reduction. It is also noticed that the previously used machine learning technique required human interference and expertise in determining robust features. yet was time-consuming in the labeling and data processing steps. In contrast. DL enables an embedded feature extraction and feature selection in DAEs pre-training and DNNs fine-tuning process directly from raw data. Hence. DAEs is able to extract high-level of features not only from the training data but also from unseen data. The proposed model uses 10 classes of imbalanced data from ECG signals.

However. available methodologies have drawbacks including limited categorisation and reliance on fixation. staining or transformation. Multispectral analysis of endogenous cell autofluorescence has been shown to be sensitive to changes in cell status and could be applied to the discrimination of cell cycle without these steps. Cells from the MIA-PaCa-2. PANC-1. and HeLa cell lines were plated on gridded dishes and imaged using a multispectral fluorescence microscope. They were then stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and DNA intensity as a reference standard for their cell cycle position (G1. S. G2. M). The multispectral data was split into training and testing datasets and models were generated to discriminate between G1. S. and G2 + M phase cells. A standard decision tree classification approach was taken. and a two-step system was generated for each line. Across cancer cell lines accuracy ranged from 68.3% (MIA-PaCa-2) to 73.3% (HeLa) for distinguishing G1 from S and G2 + M. and 69.0% (MIA-PaCa-2) to 78.0% (PANC1) for distinguishing S from G2 + M.

By constructing a high-order gradient computation graph. we update the surrogate model to approximate the victim model in both forward and backward pass. The SimBA++ and HOGA result in Learnable Black-Box Attack (LeBA). which surpasses previous state of the art by considerable margins: the proposed LeBA significantly reduces queries. while keeping higher attack success rates close to 100% in extensive ImageNet experiments. including attacking vision benchmarks and defensive models.

To defend adversarial attacks. we develop a novel defense paradigm via embedding scatter and feature alignment to enhance model's robustness. We first propose a margin constraint loss to encourage better discriminative representations of samples. ie. increasing interclass distance and reducing intra-class distance simultaneously. Then a novel method is introduced to seek the representation anchors channel-wisely. which quantizes the learned representations into different scatters. During the inference stage. we first align the extracted representation from the input data onto the most similar anchors and use these anchors replace the representations.

While traditional job title analysis has been focused on studying the responsibilities of job titles. this paper attempts to reveal the rank of job titles. Specifically. we propose to extract job title hierarchy from employees’ career trajectories. Along this line. we first quantify the Difficulty of Promotion (DOP) from one job title to another by a monotonic transformation of the length of tenure based on the assumption that a longer tenure usually implies a greater difficulty to be promoted. Then. the difference of two job title ranks is defined as a mapping of the DOP observed from job transitions. A Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) is adopted to model the joint distribution of the job title ranks and the DOPs in a career trajectory. Furthermore. a stochastic algorithm is developed for inferring the posterior job title rank by a given collection of DOPs in the GBN.

Although the artificial pancreas and continuous glucose monitoring have been proven to be effective in achieving closed-loop control. significant challenges still remain due to the high complexity of glucose dynamics and limitations in the technology. In this work. we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning model for single-hormone (insulin) and dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) delivery.

Accurate blood glucose prediction can reduce this risk and enhance early interventions to improve diabetes management. However. due to the complex nature of glucose metabolism and the various lifestyle related factors which can disrupt this. diabetes management still remains challenging. In this work we propose a novel deep learning model to predict future BG levels based on the historical continuous glucose monitoring measurements. meal ingestion. and insulin delivery. We adopt a modified architecture of the generative adversarial network that comprises of a generator and a discriminator. The generator computes the BG predictions by a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units. and the auxiliary discriminator employs a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to distinguish between the predictive and real BG values. Two modules are trained in an adversarial process with a combination of loss. The experiments were conducted using the OhioT1DM dataset that contains the data of six T1D contributors over 40 days. The proposed algorithm achieves an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 18.34 ± 0.17 mg/dL with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.37 ± 0.18 mg/dL for the 30-minute prediction horizon (PH) and an average RMSE of 32.31 ± 0.46 mg/dL with a MAE of 24.20 ± 0.42 for the 60-minute PH.

An empirical characterization of the semantic content of the thematic roles for a group of Italian verbs,2015,Gianluca Lebani and Alessandro Bondielli and Alessandro Lenci,16,,4,401-430,,The nature of thematic roles is a central. yet controversial. issue both for models of linguistic competence as well as for models of sentence processing. McRae et al (1997b) proposed to treat thematic roles as verb-specific prototypes that can be empirically described by resorting to a modified version of the traditional feature norm paradigm. In this paper. we present the results of two norming experiments in which we extended this approach to incorporate the distinction between filler-inherent and verb-entailed features. the latter being further characterized on the basis of their association with one or more phases of the time course of the event. In the first experiment. we asked to a group of speakers to list the prototypical characteristics of the fillers of two semantic roles. agent and patient. for a set of 20 Italian transitive verbs. We then manually annotated the collected features according to our classification of feature types. In the second experiment. we encouraged participants to list as many properties as possible to describe the verb roles with respect to three different time slots: before. during and after the event described by the verb takes place. The collected data supports the claim in McRae et al (1997b) that thematic roles can be also treated as verb-specific concepts. The first experiment reveals differences between the agent and the patient roles. which instead disappears in the second experiment.

The system is based on two main assumptions: a claim that verifies a tweet is expected i) to mention the same entities and keyphrases. and ii) to have a similar meaning. The former assumption has been addressed by exploiting an Information Extraction module capable of determining the pairs in which the tweet and the claim share at least a named entity or a relevant keyword. To address the latter. we exploited Deep Learning to refine the computation of the text similarity between a tweet and a claim. and to actually classify the pairs as correct matches or not. In particular. the system has been built starting from a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model. on which two cascade fine-tuning steps have been applied in order to i) assign a higher cosine similarity to gold pairs. and ii) classify a pair as correct or not. The final ranking produced by the system is the probability of the pair labelled as correct.

At the same time a word distributional properties deeply influence its affective content. For instance a word may become negatively loaded because it tends to co-occur with other negative expressions. Lexical affective values are used as features in sentiment analysis systems and are typically estimated with hand-made resources (e.g. WordNet Affect). which have a limited coverage.

Besides. fast processing speed is another crucial criterion. Towards these ends. several methods have been proposed through out this thesis. Firstly. based on the orientation characteristics of the facial information and important features. like the eyes and mouth. a novel variant of LBP. referred as ELBP. is designed for encoding micro patterns with the usage of an horizontal ellipse sample. Secondly. ELBP is exploited to extract local features from oriented edge magnitudes images. By this. the Elliptical Patterns of Oriented Edge Magnitudes (EPOEM) description is built.

This paper provides a methodology for decomposing the state space of scalable dynamical systems with strong interstate coupling. The outlined approach intends to make rigorous Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) of the high-dimension problem feasible by partitioning the overall high-dimensional state space problem into multiple lower-dimensional state space problems. This approach will work quicker with a lesser memory space requirement than existing methods. To enable accelerated and scalable UQ in high-dimensional complex physical system models. the proposed decomposition process leverages an overlapping community detection to detect state variables participating in more than one subsystems (clusters).

The expected energy usage of a building can be reliably simulated using a Building Energy Model (BEM). Many of the numerous input parameters in a BEM are uncertain. To ensure that the building simulation is sufficiently accurate. and to better understand the impact of imprecisions in the input parameters and calculation methods. it is desirable to quantify uncertainty in the BEM throughout the modeling process. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) typically requires a large number of simulations to produce meaningful data. which. due to the vast number of input parameters and the dynamic nature of building simulation. is computationally expensive. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in BEM domain is thus intractable due to the size of the problem and parameters involved and hence it needs an advanced methodology for analysis. The current paper outlines a novel Weakly-Connected-Systems (WCSs) identification-based UQ framework developed to propagate the quantifiable uncertainty in the BEM.

One subclass. called convolutional SPNs (CSPNs). can be implemented using tensors. but also can suffer from being too shallow. Fortunately. tensors can be augmented while maintaining valid SPNs. This yields a larger subclass of CNNs. which we call deep convolutional SPNs (DCSPNs). where the convolutional and sum-pooling layers form rich directed acyclic graph structures. One salient feature of DCSPNs is that they are a rigorous probabilistic model. As such. they can exploit multiple kinds of probabilistic reasoning. including marginal inference and most probable explanation (MPE) inference. This allows an alternative method for learning DCSPNs using vectorized differentiable MPE. which plays a similar role to the generator in generative adversarial networks (GANs). Image sampling is yet another application demonstrating the robustness of DCSPNs. Our preliminary results on image sampling are encouraging. since the DCSPN sampled images exhibit variability.

Heidelberg,Anomaly detection is the problem of identifying objects appearing to be inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data. Detecting such samples is useful on various applications such as fault detection. fraud detection and diagnostic systems. Partially supervised methods for anomaly detection are interesting because they only need data labeled as one of the classes (normal or abnormal). In this paper. we propose a partially supervised framework for anomaly detection based on convex hulls in a parameter space. assuming a given probability distribution.

Lately. features from pre-trained models have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in several machine vision problems. Those models are usually employed when the problem of interest does not have enough supervised examples to support the network training from scratch. Most applications use networks pre-trained on noise-free RGB image datasets. what is observed even when the target domain counts on grayscale images or when data is degraded by noise. In this paper. we evaluate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on such transfer learning scenarios and the impact of using RGB trained networks on grayscale image tasks.

Heidelberg,The green coverage region is a relevant information to be extracted from remote sensing agriculture images. Automatic methods based on threshold and vegetation indices are often applied to address this task. However. sub-orbital remote sensing images have elements that can hinder the automatic analysis. Also. supervised methods can suffer from imbalance since there is often many more green coverage samples available than regions of gaps. weed and degraded areas. We propose an anomaly detection approach to deal with these challenges.

Na prática.esses exemplos podem representar doenças em um indivíduo ou em uma população. além de outros eventos como fraudes em operações bancárias e falhas em sistemas. Diversas técnicas existentes buscam identificar essas anomalias. incluindo adaptações de métodos de classificação e métodos estatísticos. Os principais desafios são o desbalanceamento do número de exemplos em cada uma das classes e a definição do comportamento normal associada à formalização de um modelo para esse comportamento.

Many lab-on-a-chip devices require the ability to manipulate the transport of cells or DNA chains in the fluid flow. Microchannel surfaces coated with combinations of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials have been found useful for this purpose. In this work we study numerically the hydrodynamics of a steady nonuniform developing flow between two infinite parallel plates with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces using the DPD.

We use dissipative particle dynamics to study DNA transport as a function of chain length and the Reynolds number in two dimensional parallel plate channels.

The hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are modeled using partial-slip and no-slip boundary conditions. respectively. We first consider channels with symmetric hydrophobic strips on both walls. It was observed that the volume flow rate through the channel is nonlinearly dependent on the area fraction of the hydrophobic strips. Next. we study flow in an antisymmetric channel in which the hydrophobic strips on the two channel walls are staggered with an axial offset.

Three training conditions were evaluated called Clean. 1-IR and 33-IR. With Clean training. the DNN-HMM system was trained using the Aurora-4 clean training database. With 1-IR training. the same training data were convolved with an impulse response estimated at one meter from the source with no rotation of the robot head. With 33-IR training. the Aurora-4 training data were convolved with impulse responses estimated at one. two and three meters from the source and 11 angular positions of the robot head. The 33-IR training method produced reductions in WER greater than 50% when compared with Clean training using both LNFB and conventional Mel filterbank features. Nevertheless. LNFB features provided a WER 23% lower than MelFB using 33-IR training. The use of 33-IR training and LNFB features reduced WER by 64% compared to Clean training and MelFB features.,True,CHdUOaQAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,5,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2bed/a4bb9b72b15fb23453c25ebaf68ceab4e846.pdf,3253021969536418256,/scholar?cites=3253021969536418256,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2bed/a4bb9b72b15fb23453c25ebaf68ceab4e846.pdf,0,0,0

Locally Normalized Cepstral Coefficients (LNCC) is evaluated for a speaker verification task with short testing utterances in additive noise. The results presented here show that LNCC outperforms baseline MFCC features when SNR is lower than 15 dB. The average relative reduction in EER achieved by LNCC is 33%. The use of LNCC in combination with spectral subtraction provides a reduction in EER averaging 18% when compared to MFCC features also with spectral subtraction. In addition. sub-band LNCC is proposed to improve the estimation of noise energy and hence the effectiveness of spectral subtraction. When compared with MFCC features. the use of sub-band LNCC led to greater reductions in EER than LNCC with non-stationary noise.,True,CHdUOaQAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,5,https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/i15_3011.html,3614439061880296977,/scholar?cites=3614439061880296977,,,https://188.166.204.102/archive/interspeech_2015/papers/i15_3011.pdf,0,0,0

For the polished surface (steady state) we study the probability distribution of slips and find an exponential behavior for all the physically relevant asperity interaction-distance thresholds. In addition. we characterize the time evolution of the sample by its spatial fractal dimension and by its entropy content. Starting from an unpolished surface. the entropy decreases during the Robin Hood process. until it reaches a plateau; thereafter the system fluctuates above the critical height. This validates the notion that friction increases information in the neighborhood of the contacting surface at the expense of losing information in remote regions.

Much research has been done in identifying the receptive fields of nonlinear neurons whose firing rate is determined by the nonlinear interactions of a small number of linear filters. Despite more advanced methods that have been proposed. spike-triggered covariance (STC) continues to be the most widely used method in such situations due to its simplicity and intuitiveness. Although the connection between STC and Wiener/Volterra kernels has often been mentioned in the literature. this relationship has never been explicitly derived. Here we derive this relationship and show that the STC matrix is actually a modified version of the second-order Wiener kernel. which incorporates the input autocorrelation and mixes first-and second-order dynamics. It is then shown how. with little modification of the STC method. the Wiener kernels may be obtained and. from them. the principal dynamic modes. a set of compact and efficient linear filters that essentially combine the spike-triggered average and STC matrix and generalize to systems with both continuous and point-process outputs. Finally. using Wiener theory. we show how these obtained filters may be corrected when they were estimated using correlated inputs. Our correction technique is shown to be superior to those commonly used in the literature for both correlated Gaussian images and natural images.,True,cI4h1s0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,15,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2422730,17829198526069738183,/scholar?cites=17829198526069738183,,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2422730,0,0,0

However. the effects of CBs on the dynamics of neural circuits remains poorly understood. This study aims to disentangle the effects of CBs on the functional dynamics of the hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapse by using data-driven nonparametric modeling. Multi-unit activity was recorded from rats doing an working memory task in control sessions and under the influence of exogenously administered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). the primary CB found in marijuana. It was found that THC left firing rate unaltered and only slightly reduced theta oscillations. Multivariate autoregressive models. estimated from spontaneous spiking activity. were then used to describe the dynamical transformation from CA3 to CA1. They revealed that THC served to functionally isolate CA1 from CA3 by reducing feedforward excitation and theta information flow. The functional isolation was compensated by increased feedback excitation within CA1. thus leading to unaltered firing rates. Finally. both of these effects were shown to be correlated with memory impairments in the working memory task.

Dynamic patterns of hippocampal spike trains are known to exhibit multifractal properties during working memory processing; however. it is unclear whether the multifractal properties inherent to hippocampal spike trains reflect active cognitive processing. To examine this possibility. hippocampal neuronal ensembles were recorded from rats before. during and after a spatial working memory task following administration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). a memory-impairing component of cannabis. Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis was performed on hippocampal interspike interval sequences to determine characteristics of monofractal long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). quantified by the Hurst exponent. and the degree/magnitude of multifractal complexity. quantified by the width of the singularity spectrum. Our results demonstrate that multifractal firing patterns of hippocampal spike trains are a marker of functional memory processing. as they are more complex during the working memory task and significantly reduced following administration of memory impairing THC doses. Conversely. LRTCs are largest during resting state recordings. therefore reflecting different information compared to multifractality. In order to deepen conceptual understanding of multifractal complexity and LRTCs. these measures were compared to classical methods using hippocampal frequency content and firing variability measures.

The advent of multielectrode arrays which can record large amounts of data simultaneously from several neurons has made this task more urgent. This task. however. is made difficult by the inherent complexity of neural systems which are highly nonlinear. interconnected. dynamic. and subject to stochastic variations. Furthermore. while several methods exist which offer good predictive performance for spike train modeling. their adoption in the broader neuroscience community has been limited due to their mathematical complexity and lack of interpretability. Here we present a novel and intuitive methodology of modeling nonlinear dynamic systems with point process inputs and outputs. such as interconnected neuronal ensembles. The method relies on the expression of the nonlinearity in the form of Volterra-like kernels. termed the Probability-Based Volterra (PBV) kernels. The nth order PBV kernel. PBVn. is derived in two steps. First. we calculate the conditional probability of an output spike given n input spikes at various lags. Second. we subtract lower order effects to isolate the nth order nonlinearity. Thus. the first PBV kernel. PBV1 (τ). is the conditional probability of an output spike given a spike in the input spike train at time τ. minus the probability that there will be a spike in the output. ie:,True,cI4h1s0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-15-S1-P102,13665058153386918803,/scholar?cites=13665058153386918803,,,https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-15-S1-P102,0,0,0

1288305,An Automated Framework for Multi-label Brain Tumor Segmentation based on Kernel Sparse Representation,2017,Xuan Chen and Binh P Nguyen and Chee-Kong Chui and Sim-Heng Ong,14,Acta Polytechnica Hungarica,1,,,A novel automated framework is proposed in this paper to address the significant but challenging task of multi-label brain tumor segmentation. Kernel sparse representation. which produces discriminative sparse codes to represent features in a high-dimensional feature space. is the key component of the proposed framework. The graph-cut method is integrated into the framework to make a segmentation decision based on both the kernel sparse representation and the topological information of brain structures. A splitting technique based on principal component analysis (PCA) is adopted as an initialization component for the dictionary learning procedure. which significantly reduces the processing time without sacrificing performance. The proposed framework is evaluated on the multi-label Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) Benchmark. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to achieve compatible performance and better generalization ability compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.,True,dQtJII8AAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC,17,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Binh_Nguyen35/publication/317026520_An_Automated_Framework_for_Multi-label_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_based_onKernel_Sparse_Representation/links/5aa5f0b745851543e641362d/An-Automated-Framework-for-Multi-label-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-based-onKernel-Sparse-Representation.pdf,845651352931553004,/scholar?cites=845651352931553004,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Binh_Nguyen35/publication/317026520_An_Automated_Framework_for_Multi-label_Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_based_onKernel_Sparse_Representation/links/5aa5f0b745851543e641362d/An-Automated-Framework-for-Multi-label-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-based-onKernel-Sparse-Representation.pdf,0,0,0
1288306,Unsupervised image noise modeling with self-consistent gan,2019,Hanshu Yan and Xuan Chen and Vincent YF Tan and Wenhan Yang and Joe Wu and Jiashi Feng,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.05762,,,,Noise modeling lies in the heart of many image processing tasks. However. existing deep learning methods for noise modeling generally require clean and noisy image pairs for model training; these image pairs are difficult to obtain in many realistic scenarios. To ameliorate this problem. we propose a self-consistent GAN (SCGAN). that can directly extract noise maps from noisy images. thus enabling unsupervised noise modeling. In particular. the SCGAN introduces three novel self-consistent constraints that are complementary to one another. viz.: the noise model should produce a zero response over a clean input; the noise model should return the same output when fed with a specific pure noise input; and the noise model also should re-extract a pure noise map if the map is added to a clean image. These three constraints are simple yet effective. They jointly facilitate unsupervised learning of a noise model for various noise types. To demonstrate its wide applicability. we deploy the SCGAN on three image processing tasks including blind image denoising. rain streak removal. and noisy image super-resolution. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art methods on a variety of benchmark datasets. even though the noise types vary significantly and paired clean images are not available.,True,dQtJII8AAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC,6,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05762,8990660249411659382,/scholar?cites=8990660249411659382,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05762,0,0,0

1288326,A novel technique for speech recognition and visualization based mobile application to support two-way communication between deaf-mute and normal peoples,2018,Kanwal Yousaf and Zahid Mehmood and Tanzila Saba and Amjad Rehman and Muhammad Rashid and Muhammad Altaf and Zhang Shuguang,2018,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,,,Hindawi,Mobile technology is very fast growing and incredible. yet there are not much technology development and improvement for Deaf-mute peoples. Existing mobile applications use sign language as the only option for communication with them. Before our article. no such application (app) that uses the disrupted speech of Deaf-mutes for the purpose of social connectivity exists in the mobile market. The proposed application. named as vocalizer to mute (V2M). uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) methodology to recognize the speech of Deaf-mute and convert it into a recognizable form of speech for a normal person. In this work mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) based features are extracted for each training and testing sample of Deaf-mute speech. The hidden Markov model toolkit (HTK) is used for the process of speech recognition. The application is also integrated with a 3D avatar for providing visualization support. The avatar is responsible for performing the sign language on behalf of a person with no awareness of Deaf-mute culture. The prototype application was piloted in social welfare institute for Deaf-mute children. Participants were 15 children aged between 7 and 13 years. The experimental results show the accuracy of the proposed application as 97.9%. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of results also revealed that face-to-face socialization of Deaf-mute is improved by the intervention of mobile technology. The participants also suggested that the proposed mobile application can act as a voice for them and they can socialize with friends and family by using this app.,True,gM1FF9cAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,12,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2018/1013234/abs/,6022240741653465410,/scholar?cites=6022240741653465410,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2018/1013234/abs/,0,0,0

In addition to the well-known visual CAPTCHAs. most Internet services also provide an audio-based scheme. e.g.. To enable access for visually impaired users. Recent research has shown that most CAPTCHAs are vulnerable as they can be broken by machine learning techniques. However. such automated attacks come at a relatively high cost as they require human experts to create labels for the unlabeled CAPTCHA samples collected from a website in order to train an attacking system.

Investigations are conducted for Track 1 of the 2nd CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge. posing a small-vocabulary task that requires the recognition of a short keyword control sequence. In order to cope with the severely noisy recordings. we extend our beamforming approach with observation uncertainties from the first CHiME challenge by adding a second. parallel feature extraction based on a binaural timefrequency mask. The output signals of both front-ends. the beamformer and the binaural speech enhancement. are fed to separately trained recognition models. Finally. a late fusion by recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER) is applied to combine the separate recognition outputs into a jointly optimal transcription.

Most websites provide an audio CAPTCHA - in addition to a conventional visual scheme - to facilitate access for a wider range of users. These audio CAPTCHAs are generally based on distorted speech. rendering the task difficult for untrained or non-native listeners. while still being vulnerable against attacks that make use of automatic speech recognition techniques.

1288350,Blind Non-Intrusive Speech Intelligibility Prediction Using Twin-HMMs,2016,Mahdie Karbasi and Ahmed Hussen Abdelaziz and Hendrik Meutzner and Dorothea Kolossa,,,,625-629,,Automatic prediction of speech intelligibility is highly desirable in the speech research community. since listening tests are timeconsuming and can not be used online. Most of the available objective speech intelligibility measures are intrusive methods. as they require a clean reference signal in addition to the corresponding noisy/processed signal at hand. In order to overcome the problem of predicting the speech intelligibility in the absence of the clean reference signal. we have proposed in [1] to employ a recognition/synthesis framework called twin hidden Markov model (THMM) for synthesizing the clean features. required inside an intrusive intelligibility prediction method. The new framework can predict the speech intelligibility equally well as well-known intrusive methods like the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI). The original THMM. however. requires the correct transcription for synthesizing the clean reference features. which is not always available. In this paper. we go one step further and investigate the use of the recognized transcription instead of the oracle transcription for obtaining a more widely applicable speech intelligibility prediction. We show that the output of the newly-proposed blind approach is highly correlated with the human speech recognition results. collected via crowdsourcing in different noise conditions.,True,-rS2Uj8Ni1wC:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,4,https://188.166.204.102/archive/Interspeech_2016/pdfs/0155.PDF,5410875410086845890,/scholar?cites=5410875410086845890,,,https://188.166.204.102/archive/Interspeech_2016/pdfs/0155.PDF,0,0,0

Using these models for speech enhancement is desirable and has been the target of past research efforts. In such model-based speech enhancement systems. a powerful ASR is imperative. To increase the recognition rates especially in low-SNR conditions. we suggest the use of the additional visual modality. which is mostly unaffected by degradations in the acoustic channel. An optimal integration of acoustic and visual information is achievable by joint inference in both modalities within the turbo-decoding framework. Thus combining turbo-decoding with Twin-HMMs for speech enhancement. notable improvements can be achieved. not only in terms of instrumental estimates of speech quality. but also in actual speech intelligibility.

To build the data sieve. a designer supplies a list of filters. Each filter consists of a filter unit and category for each dimension. The filter unit specifies a pattern (a regular expression) to match as the data stream is filtered. The filter category is the system of measurement in which occurrences of that pattern are counted or otherwise aggregated. Since filtering discards some of the data. incomplete regions within the MDB are created. The missing data complicates querying.

1288388,Facilitating an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to solve an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model with fully correlated latent variables,2017,Dasol Chae and Jaeyoung Jung and Keemin Sohn,,Journal of Choice Modelling,,,Elsevier,It is well known that estimating the parameters of an integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model is not a trivial undertaking. The log-likelihood of an ICLV model cannot be evaluated analytically. and can only be evaluated by a simulation that requires large numbers of sample draws. While conducting simulation-based model estimations. researchers often encounter an estimation failure. Sohn (2017) suggests a novel estimation method to circumvent the problem by using an expectation-maximization algorithm (EM). However. a drawback of this method continues to be the requirement of a huge amount of computer memory to deal with an augmented covariance matrix.

1288391,Multiclass Common Spatial Pattern for EEG based Brain Computer Interface with Adaptive Learning Classifier,2018,Hardik Meisheri and Nagraj Ramrao and Suman Mitra,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.09046,,,,In Brain Computer Interface (BCI). data generated from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is non-stationary with low signal to noise ratio and contaminated with artifacts. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm has been proved to be effective in BCI for extracting features in motor imagery tasks. but it is prone to overfitting. Many algorithms have been devised to regularize CSP for two class problem. however they have not been effective when applied to multiclass CSP. Outliers present in data affect extracted CSP features and reduces performance of the system. In addition to this non-stationarity present in the features extracted from the CSP present a challenge in classification. We propose a method to identify and remove artifact present in the data during pre-processing stage. this helps in calculating eigenvectors which in turn generates better CSP features. To handle the non-stationarity. Self-Regulated Interval Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SRIT2NFIS) was proposed in the literature for two class EEG classification problem.

A key aspect of using RL in the real world is to train the agent before deployment. so as to minimise experimentation in live operation. While this is feasible for online gameplay (where the rules of the game are known) and robotics (where the dynamics are predictable). it is much more difficult for complex systems due to associated complexities. such as uncertainty. adaptability and emergent behaviour.

We focus on the 22 team version of Pommerman. developed for a competition at NeurIPS 2018. Our methodology involves training an agent initially through imitation learning on a noisy expert policy. followed by a proximal-policy optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm. The basic PPO approach is modified for stable transition from the imitation learning phase through reward shaping. action filters based on heuristics. and curriculum learning. The proposed methodology is able to beat heuristic and pure reinforcement learning baselines with a combined 100.000 training games. significantly faster than other non-tree-search methods in literature.

As a consequence. grapevine breeders have to select seedlings and new cultivars with regard to appropriate bunch traits. Bunch architecture is a mosaic of different single traits which makes phenotyping labor-intensive and time-consuming. In the present study. a fast and high-precision phenotyping pipeline was developed. The optical sensor Artec Spider 3D scanner (Artec 3D. L-1466. Luxembourg) was used to generate dense 3D point clouds of grapevine bunches under lab conditions and an automated analysis software called 3D-Bunch-Tool was developed to extract different single 3D bunch traits. ie. the number of berries. berry diameter. single berry volume. total volume of berries. convex hull volume of grapes. bunch width and bunch length. The method was validated on whole bunches of different grapevine cultivars and phenotypic variable breeding material. Reliable phenotypic data were obtained which show high significant correlations (up to r 2= 0.95 for berry number) compared to ground truth data. Moreover. it was shown that the Artec Spider can be used directly in the field where achieved data show comparable precision with regard to the lab application.

Grape bunch architecture is mainly influenced by the berry number. berry size. the total berry volume. and bunch width and length. For an objective. precise. and high-throughput assessment of these architectural traits. the 3D imaging sensor Artec® Spider was applied to gather dense point clouds of the visible side of grape bunches directly in the field. Data acquisition in the field is much faster and non-destructive in comparison to lab applications but results in incomplete point clouds and. thus. mostly incomplete phenotypic values. Therefore. lab scans of whole bunches (360) were used as ground truth. We observed strong correlations between field and lab data but also shifts in mean and max values. especially for the berry number and total berry volume. For this reason. the present study is focused on the training and validation of different predictive regression models using 3D data from approximately 2000 different grape bunches in order to predict incomplete bunch traits from field data.

Many approaches for RUL estimation based on sensor data make assumptions about how machines degrade.

The common approach of training one model in an offline manner using historical data is likely to fail under dynamically changing and non-stationary environments where the definition of normal behavior changes over time making the model irrelevant and ineffective. In this paper. we describe a temporal model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series anomaly detection to address challenges posed by sudden or regular changes in normal behavior. The model is trained incrementally as new data becomes available. and is capable of adapting to the changes in the data distribution. RNN is used to make multi-step predictions of the time series. and the prediction errors are used to update the RNN model as well as detect anomalies and change points.

1288413,Sparse Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series,2018,Narendhar Gugulothu and Pankaj Malhotra and Lovekesh Vig and Gautam Shroff,,,,,,Online anomaly detection in time series is an important component for automated monitoring. In many applications. time series are highdimensional with tens or even hundreds of variables being monitored simultaneously. We note that existing anomaly detection approaches based on recurrent autoencoders may not be very effective for high-dimensional time series. In this work. we propose a simple. yet effective. extension to such approaches for high-dimensional time series. Our approach combines the advantages of non-temporal dimensionality reduction techniques and recurrent autoencoders for time series modeling through an end-to-end learning framework. The recurrent encoder gets sparse access to the input dimensions via a feedforward layer while the recurrent decoder is forced to reconstruct all the input dimensions. thereby leading to better regularization and a robust temporal model. The autoencoder thus trained on normal time series is likely to give a high reconstruction error. and a corresponding high anomaly score. for any anomalous time series pattern. We prove the efficacy of the proposed approach through experiments on a public dataset and two real-world datasets with significant improvement in anomaly detection performance over several baselines. We observe that the proposed approach is able to perform well even without knowledge of relevant dimensions carrying the anomalous signature in a high-dimensional setting.,True,WUIyA6wAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pankaj_Malhotra3/publication/326305246_Sparse_Neural_Networks_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_High-Dimensional_Time_Series/links/5b59f633aca272a2d66cbb98/Sparse-Neural-Networks-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-High-Dimensional-Time-Series.pdf,17786127738746916022,/scholar?cites=17786127738746916022,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pankaj_Malhotra3/publication/326305246_Sparse_Neural_Networks_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_High-Dimensional_Time_Series/links/5b59f633aca272a2d66cbb98/Sparse-Neural-Networks-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-High-Dimensional-Time-Series.pdf,0,0,0

It is difficult for engineers to diagnose the faults when multiple sensors are being monitored at once. The faults detected by RNNs can be better understood if the sensors carrying the faulty signature are known. To achieve this. we propose a sensor relevance scoring (SRS) approach that scores each sensor based on its contribution to the classification decision by leveraging the hidden layer activations of RNNs. Secondly. lack of labeled training data due to infrequent faults (or otherwise) makes it difficult to train RNNs in a supervised manner.

The time series data collected from these sensors is then used to monitor the health of machines. We consider the situation where health monitoring of machines by engineers using raw time series visualizations is augmented by a machine learning and visual analytics based system. Machine learning models such as deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been utilized to provide health index (HI) based on sensor data. which is a measure of the degree of degradation of the health of a machine. Such an HI is often opaque and does not explain the intrinsic patterns in the multi-variate time series which form the basis of the model used to detect health degradation. In practice. such an explanation is of great importance to the machine health monitoring engineers. For example. it can provide further insights into the operational behavior of complex machines. and in turn. help the engineers diagnose the root cause of the approaching failure. In this paper. we make an attempt to mitigate this problem. and propose an approach where-in an HI Estimator module is followed by an HI Descriptor module. The HI Descriptor module is based on Bayesian Networks and visual analytics. and uses the sensor readings and the HI given by HI Estimator to provide an explanation for the cause of poor health.

Most often forecasts of such time series depend on many factors ranging from weather to socio-economic attributes such as GDP or average income. Dependence on such features can cause the underlying time series to be highly variable in nature and possess non-stationary shifts.

A critical challenge in the field is to generate animations which accurately reflect the state of the animated characters. without looking repetitive or unnatural. In this work. we investigate the problem of procedurally generating a diverse variety of facial animations that express a given semantic quality (eg. very happy). To that end. we introduce a new learning heuristic called Precision Variety Learning (PVL) which actively identifies and exploits the fundamental trade-off between precision (how accurate positive labels are) and variety (how diverse the set of positive labels is). We both identify conditions where important theoretical properties can be guaranteed. and show good empirical performance in variety of conditions.

1288431,An information-theoretic law governing human multi-task navigation decisions,2021,Nicholas Sohre and Alisdair OG Wallis and Stephen J Guy,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.00057,,,,To better understand the process by which humans make navigation decisions when tasked with multiple stopovers. we analyze motion data captured from shoppers in a grocery store. We discover several trends in the data that are consistent with a noisy decision making process for the order of item retrieval. and decompose a shopping trip into a sequence of discrete choices about the next item to retrieve. Our analysis reveals that the likelihood of inverting any two items in the order is monotonically bound to the entropy of the pair-wise ordering task. Based on this analysis. we propose a noisy distance estimation model for predicting the order of item retrieval given a shopping list. We show that our model theoretically reproduces the entropy law seen in the data with high accuracy. and in practice matches the trends in the data when used to simulate the same shopping lists. Our approach has direct applications to improving simulations of human navigation in retail and other settings.,True,DFjNvf0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00057,9376397460247208076,/scholar?cites=9376397460247208076,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00057,0,0,0

The identification of such conflicts is often made by humans. which makes the task time consuming and error-prone. In order to automate such identification. in this work we propose an approach to identify potential conflicts between norms in contracts written in natural language. We build a two-phase approach that extracts norms and norm elements from contracts. creating a norm representation that we use to compare norms and identify potential conflicts. We evaluated the approach using a corpus of contracts with norm conflicts inserted. and we measured the accuracy for different cases of conflict. which resulted on values higher than 70%.,True,7or-TpUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,http://tede2.pucrs.br/tede2/handle/tede/6599,17776538104669798120,/scholar?cites=17776538104669798120,,,http://tede2.pucrs.br/tede2/bitstream/tede/6599/2/DIS_JOAO_PAULO_DE_SOUZA_AIRES_COMPLETO.pdf,0,0,0

Recent studies have shown the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when dealing with the texture classification task in the spatial domain. In this article. we try combining both approaches in different domains for more abundant information and proposed a novel network architecture named contourlet CNN (C-CNN). The network aims to learn sparse and effective feature representations for images. First. the contourlet transform is applied to get the spectral features from an image.

More recently. a two-stage detector Faster R-CNN is proposed and demonstrated to be a promising tool for object detection in optical remote sensing images. while the sparse and dense characteristic of objects in remote sensing images is complexity. It is unreasonable to treat all images with the same region proposal strategy. and this treatment limits the performance of two-stage detectors. In this paper. we propose a novel and effective approach. named deep adaptive proposal network (DAPNet). address this complexity characteristic of object by learning a new category prior network (CPN) on the basis of the existing Faster R-CNN architecture. Moreover. the candidate regions produced by DAPNet model are different from the traditional region proposal network (RPN). DAPNet predicts the detail category of each candidate region. And these candidate regions combine the object number. which generated by the category prior network to achieve a suitable number of candidate boxes for each image. These candidate boxes can satisfy detection tasks in sparse and dense scenes. The performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated on the challenging NWPU VHR-10 data set.

1288498,Post-classification and spatial reasoning: new approach to change detection for updating GIS database,2008,Ahed Alboody and Florence Sedes and Jordi Inglada,,,,1-7,IEEE,Demand for up-to-date geographic data is increasing due to the fast growth of Geographic Information System (GIS). The process of updating GIS database can be subdivided into three steps. In the first step. changes of the landscape must be detected. In the second step. different data sources must be used to add further attributes. In the last step. the changes with all additional information have to be stored into a GIS database. In this paper. a new approach of change detection for updating GIS database by using remote sensing image is presented. This approach of change detection is based on post-classification comparison and spatial reasoning. Firstly. two different classification methods of satellite imagery. one of pixel-based classification and other of object-oriented classification. have been used. The already existing GIS data are used for deriving the training areas for the classification.

These eight relations are written in the traditional form of the spatial reasoning system RCC8: DC. EC. EQ. PO. TPP. TPPi. NTPP and NTPPi. Because of the complexity of topological relations between geographic regions. it is difficult for these models to describe in detail the topological relations by defining the separation number of lines and points that characterize these relations. and which is very important to enrich the spatial relations of system RCC8.

1288500,Fuzzy Intersection and Difference Model for Topological Relations.,2009,Ahed Alboody and Florence Sedes and Jordi Inglada,,,,1079-1084,,Topological relations have played important roles in spatial query. analysis and reasoning in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial databases. The topological relations between crisp and fuzzy spatial objects based upon the 9-intersections topological model have been identified. However the formalization of the topological relations between fuzzy regions needs more investigation. The paper provides a theoretical framework for modelling topological relations between fuzzy regions based upon a new fuzzy topological model called the Fuzzy Intersection and Difference (FID) Model. A novel topological model is formalized based on Fuzzy Topological Space (FTS). In order to derive all fuzzy topological relations between two fuzzy spatial objects. the fuzzy spatial object (A) is decomposed in four components: the Interior. the Interior’s Boundary. the Object’s Boundary. and the Exterior’s Boundary of A. By use of this definition of fuzzy spatial object. new 4* 4-Intersection and Fuzzy Intersection and Difference (FID) models are proposed as a qualitative model for the identification of all topological relations between two simple fuzzy regions. These two new models are compared with other fuzzy models studied in the literature.

In our work. we introduce the first computational model aimed at Pictionary. the popular word-guessing social game. We first introduce Sketch-QA. a guessing task. Styled after Pictionary. Sketch-QA uses incrementally accumulated sketch stroke sequences as visual data. Sketch-QA involves asking a fixed question (“What object is being drawn?”) and gathering open-ended guess-words from human guessers. We analyze the resulting dataset and present many interesting findings therein. To mimic Pictionary-style guessing. we propose a deep neural model which generates guess-words in response to temporally evolving human-drawn object sketches.

Recent contributions to deep learning techniques have focused on architectural modifications to improve parameter efficiency and performance. In this paper. we derive a continuous and differentiable error functional for a neural network that minimizes its empirical error as well as a measure of the model complexity. The latter measure is obtained by deriving a differentiable upper bound on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the classifier layer of a class of deep networks. Using standard backpropagation. we realize a training rule that tries to minimize the error on training samples. while improving generalization by keeping the model complexity low. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formulation (the Low Complexity Neural Network-LCNN) across several deep learning algorithms. and a variety of large benchmark datasets. We show that hidden layer neurons in the resultant networks learn features that are crisp. and in the case of image datasets. quantitatively sharper.

This method uses 3-D printing technology along with image analysis approaches based on 3-D CT image data. which consists of two important aspects: facial model construction and facial features recognition.

Compliance control has the further advantage that it is applicable for a variety of motor tasks. and is both more robust and simple than alternative control strategies.

To design IST methods and tools to tackle the problem of improving automatically generated transcripts. 2. To assess the designed IST methods and tools on real-life tasks of transcription in large educational repositories of video lectures. 3. To improve the reliability of the IST by improving the underlying (CM).  Abstracts: The {Automatic Speech Recognition} (ASR) is a crucial task in a broad range of important applications which could not accomplished by means of manual transcription. The ASR can provide cost-effective transcripts  in scenarios of increasing social impact such as  the {Massive Open Online Courses} (MOOC). for which the availability of accurate enough is crucial even if they are not flawless. The transcripts enable search-ability. summarisation. recommendation. translation; they make the contents accessible to non-native speakers and users with impairments. etc. The usefulness is such that students improve their academic performance when learning from subtitled video lectures even when transcript is not perfect.  Unfortunately. the current ASR technology is still far from the necessary accuracy.  The imperfect transcripts resulting from ASR can be manually supervised and corrected. but the effort can  be  even higher than manual transcription.

However. to date. multilayer feed-forward networks of spiking neurons are either only partially trained using STDP or pre-trained using traditional deep neural networks which are converted to deep spiking neural networks or a two-layer network where STDP learnt features are manually labelled.

Artificial neural networks (ANN). however. have the backpropagation algorithm which can utilize gradient descent to train networks which are locally robust universal function approximators.

1288590,Exploiting neuron and synapse filter dynamics in spatial temporal learning of deep spiking neural network,2020,Haowen Fang and Amar Shrestha and Ziyi Zhao and Qinru Qiu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.02944,,,,The recent discovered spatial-temporal information processing capability of bio-inspired Spiking neural networks (SNN) has enabled some interesting models and applications. However designing large-scale and high-performance model is yet a challenge due to the lack of robust training algorithms. A bio-plausible SNN model with spatial-temporal property is a complex dynamic system. Each synapse and neuron behave as filters capable of preserving temporal information. As such neuron dynamics and filter effects are ignored in existing training algorithms. the SNN downgrades into a memoryless system and loses the ability of temporal signal processing. Furthermore. spike timing plays an important role in information representation. but conventional rate-based spike coding models only consider spike trains statistically. and discard information carried by its temporal structures. To address the above issues. and exploit the temporal dynamics of SNNs. we formulate SNN as a network of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters with neuron nonlinearity. We proposed a training algorithm that is capable to learn spatial-temporal patterns by searching for the optimal synapse filter kernels and weights. The proposed model and training algorithm are applied to construct associative memories and classifiers for synthetic and public datasets including MNIST. NMNIST.

However. in real-world scenarios. due to the limited accessible training pairs. large models exhibit undesirable behaviors such as overfitting and memorization. To suppress model overfitting and further enjoy the merits of large model capacity. we thoroughly investigate generic approaches for supplying additional training data pairs. In particular. we introduce a simple learning principle MixUp to train networks on interpolations of sample pairs. which encourages networks to support linear behavior in-between training samples. In addition. we propose a data synthesis method with learned degradation. enabling models to use extra high-quality images with higher content diversity. This strategy proves to be successful in reducing the biases of data. By combining these components--MixUp and synthetic training data. large models can be trained without overfitting under very limited data samples and achieve satisfactory generalization performance.

In a typical UDC system. the microstructure of the semi-transparent organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixel array attenuates and diffracts the incident light on the camera. resulting in significant image quality degradation. Oftentimes. noise. flare. haze. and blur can be observed in UDC images. In this work. we aim to analyze and tackle the aforementioned degradation problems. We define a physics-based image formation model to better understand the degradation. In addition. we utilize one of the world's first commodity UDC smartphone prototypes to measure the real-world Point Spread Function (PSF) of the UDC system. and provide a model-based data synthesis pipeline to generate realistically degraded images. We specially design a new domain knowledge-enabled Dynamic Skip Connection Network (DISCNet) to restore the UDC images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real UDC data.

1288620,Solving parametric PDEs with neural networks: unfavorable structure vs. expressive power,2021,Mones Raslan,,,,,,This cumulative dissertation extends the theory of neural networks (NNs). In the first part of this thesis. [PRV20] in Appendix A. we provide a general analysis of the hypothesis class of NNs from a structural point of view. Here. we examine the algebraic and topological properties of the set of NNs with fixed architecture. We establish that this set is never convex. hardly ever closed in classical function spaces and that the parametrization of NNs is not inverse stable. These observations could. in practice. lead to highly undesirable phenomena such as diverging weights or slow convergence of the underlying training algorithm. The second part of this thesis deals with the concrete application of solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) by NNs. In typical modeling tasks. it is required to solve some PDE for different characterizing parameters such as the shape of the domain. the boundary conditions. or the right-hand side. In this context. the development of algorithms that are able to efficiently and accurately compute  the solution for a new input is imperative. A large variety of reduced order models. taking into account the low-dimensionality of the solution set. have been developed in the past. Moving away from model-based techniques and motivated by their success in applications. in this thesis we focus on a data-driven approach based on NNs for the solution of parametric PDEs.

Many studies have taken those opportunities to accelerate lookup operations of key-value stores. Meanwhile. there is a lack of researches that utilize them for improving range query performance. This paper reports a detailed performance analysis of range query execution of in-memory stores. Our findings show that in modern architecture. copying/serialization data for transmission over network is the major overhead of range query processing. To solve this issue. several methods could be considered. such as parallelism. caching. and utilizing RDMA Read.

We are interested in estimating and tracking the VFOAs associated with multi-party social interactions. We note that in this type of situations the participants either look at each other or at an object of interest; therefore their eyes are not always visible. Consequently both gaze and VFOA estimation cannot be based on eye detection and tracking. We propose a method that exploits the correlation between eye gaze and head movements. Both VFOA and gaze are modeled as latent variables in a Bayesian switching state-space model (also referred switching Kalman filter). The proposed formulation leads to a tractable learning method and to an efficient online inference procedure that simultaneously tracks gaze and visual focus. The method is tested and benchmarked using two publicly available datasets.

Our approach enables a robot to learn and to adapt its gaze control strategy for human–robot interaction neither with the use of external sensors nor with human supervision. The robot learns to focus its attention onto groups of people from its own audio-visual experiences. independently of the number of people. of their positions and of their physical appearances. In particular. we use a recurrent neural network architecture in combination with Q-learning to find an optimal action-selection policy; we pre-train the network using a simulated environment that mimics realistic scenarios that involve speaking/silent participants. thus avoiding the need of tedious sessions of a robot interacting with people.

This is of particular interest in human-robot interactive scenarios. e.g. when the task requires to identify targets of interest over time. The paper makes the following contributions. We propose a Bayesian temporal model that connects VFOA to gaze direction and to head pose. Model inference is then cast into a switching Kalman filter formulation. which makes it tractable. The model parameters are estimated via training based on manual annotations. The method is tested and benchmarked using a publicly available dataset.

They are required notonly to share physical space with humans but also to interact with them. Inthis context. the robot is expected to understand some verbal and non-verbalambiguous cues. constantly used in a natural human interaction. In particular.knowing who or what people are looking at is a very valuable information tounderstand each individual mental state as well as the interaction dynamics. Itis called Visual Focus of Attention or VFOA. In this thesis. we are interestedin using the inputs from an active humanoid robot – participating in a socialinteraction – to estimate who is looking at whom or what.On the one hand. we want the robot to look at people. so it can extractmeaningful visual information from its video camera.

This study explores the feasibility of obtaining alternative measures of loudness. brightness. and attendance (number of people) using 10-second video clips of real-life drinking occasions rated by human annotators and computer algorithms. and explores the associations of these measures with participants’ choice to drink alcohol or not.   Methods Using a custom-built smartphone application. 215 16-25-year-olds documented characteristics of 2.380 weekend night drinking events using questionnaires and videos. Ratings of loudness. brightness. and attendance were obtained from three sources. namely in-situ participants’ ratings. video-based annotator ratings. and video-based computer algorithm ratings. Bivariate statistics explored differences in ratings across sources. Multilevel logistic regressions assessed the associations of contextual characteristics with alcohol use.

The methods are an echo state network (ESN. which is a type of reservoir computing; hereafter RC–ESN). a deep feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN). and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM; hereafter RNN–LSTM). This Lorenz 96 system has three tiers of nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/large-scale (X). intermediate (Y). and fast/small-scale (Z) processes. For training or testing. only X is available; Y and Z are never known or used. We show that RC–ESN substantially outperforms ANN and RNN–LSTM for short-term predictions. e.g.. accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds of numerical solver's time steps equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales. The RNN–LSTM outperforms ANN. and both methods show some prediction skills too. Furthermore. even after losing the trajectory. data predicted by RC–ESN and RNN–LSTM have probability density functions (pdf's) that closely match the true pdf – even at the tails. The pdf of the data predicted using ANN. however. deviates from the true pdf.

This leads to a reduction of communication by an order of magnitude compared to periodically communicating state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover. we derive a communication bound that scales well with the hardness of the serialized learning problem. The reduction in communication comes at almost no cost. as the predictive performance remains virtually unchanged. Indeed. the proposed protocol retains loss bounds of periodically averaging schemes.

Using the WKB and worldline instanton method. we find that this enhancement mechanism strongly depends on the shape of the fast pulse. For the Sauter profile 1/cosh 2 (ω t) considered previously. the threshold frequency ω crit (where the enhancement mechanism sets in) is basically independent of the magnitude E weak of the weak pulse—whereas for a Gaussian pulse exp (− ω 2 t 2). an oscillating profile cos (ω t) or a standing wave cos (ω t) cos (k x). the value of ω crit does depend (logarithmically) on E weak/E strong.,True,LHzr4p4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,48,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.085009,16104621071750782507,/scholar?cites=16104621071750782507,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05685,0,0,0

In order to explore the full statistical dependence structure of such portfolio losses. we estimate their empirical pairwise copulas. Instead of a Gaussian dependence. we typically find a strong asymmetry in the copulas. Concurrent large portfolio losses are much more likely than small ones. Studying the dependences of these losses as a function of portfolio size. we moreover reveal that not only large portfolios of thousands of contracts. but also medium-sized and small ones with only a few dozens of contracts exhibit notable portfolio loss correlations. Anticipated idiosyncratic effects turn out to be negligible.

An ubiquitous class of safety risks are learned shortcuts. i.e. spurious correlations a network exploits for its decisions that have no semantic connection to the actual task. Networks relying on such shortcuts bear the risk of not generalizing well to unseen inputs. Explainability methods help to uncover such network vulnerabilities. However. many of these techniques are not directly applicable if access to the network is constrained. in so-called black-box setups. These setups are prevalent when using third-party ML components. To address this constraint. we present an approach to detect learned shortcuts using an interpretable-by-design network as a proxy to the black-box model of interest. Leveraging the proxy's guarantees on introspection we automatically extract candidates for learned shortcuts. Their transferability to the black box is validated in a systematic fashion. Concretely. as proxy model we choose a BagNet. which bases its decisions purely on local image patches. We demonstrate on the autonomous driving dataset A2D2 that extracted patch shortcuts significantly influence the black box model. By efficiently identifying such patch-based vulnerabilities. we contribute to safer ML models.,True,LHzr4p4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11691,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11691,0,0,0

Compared to the standard HMM. transition probabilities are not atomic but composed of these representations via kernelization. Our approach enables constraint-free and gradient-based optimization. We propose two optimization schemes that make use of this: a modification of the Baum-Welch algorithm and a direct co-occurrence optimization. The latter one is highly scalable and comes empirically without loss of performance compared to standard HMMs. We show that the non-linearity of the kernelization is crucial for the expressiveness of the representations.

It has been interpreted as approximately performing Bayesian inference. Based on previous work on the approximation of Gaussian processes by wide and deep neural networks with random weights. we study the limiting distribution of wide untrained NNs under dropout more rigorously and prove that they as well converge to Gaussian processes for fixed sets of weights and biases. We sketch an argument that this property might also hold for infinitely wide feed-forward networks that are trained with (full-batch) gradient descent. The theory is contrasted by an empirical analysis in which we find correlations and non-Gaussian behaviour for the pre-activations of finite width NNs.

There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to information retrieval tools. In this paper. we present a novel approach to document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process the low-level PDF data representation directly. instead of relying on a visual re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page. as has been proposed in previous literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each printing command according to its structural function in the page. This approach has three advantages: First. it can distinguish among more fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual methods). which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure resolution. Second. it can take into account the text flow across pages more naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing commands of sequential pages. Last. our proposed method needs less memory and it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature engineering. we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average F1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels.

Several neural network-based methods have been proposed to recognize group activities from video sequences. However. there are still several challenges that are related to multiple groups with different activities within a scene. The strong correlation that exists among individual motion. groups and activities can be utilized to detect groups and recognize their concurrent activities. Motivated by these observations. we propose a unified deep learning framework for detecting multiple groups and recognizing their corresponding collective activity based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.

PMF depends on the classical maximum a posteriori estimator for estimating model parameters; however. these approaches are vulnerable to overfitting because of the nature of a single point estimation that is pursued by these models. An alternative approach to PMF is a Bayesian PMF model that suggests the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm as a full estimation for approximate intractable posterior over model parameters. However. despite its success in increasing prediction. it has a high computational cost. To this end. we proposed a novel Bayesian deep learning-based model treatment. namely. variational autoencoder Bayesian matrix factorization (VABMF).

During their long evolutionary history they maintained a unique body plan with two pairs of large wing-like flippers. but their locomotion has been a topic of debate for almost 200 years. Key areas of controversy have concerned the most efficient biologically possible limb stroke. e.g. whether it consisted of rowing. underwater flight. or modified underwater flight. and how the four limbs moved in relation to each other: did they move in or out of phase? Previous studies have investigated plesiosaur swimming using a variety of methods. including skeletal analysis. human swimmers. and robotics. We adopt a novel approach using a digital. three-dimensional. articulated. free-swimming plesiosaur in a simulated fluid. We generated a large number of simulations under various joint degrees of freedom to investigate how the locomotory repertoire changes under different parameters. Within the biologically possible range of limb motion. the simulated plesiosaur swims primarily with its forelimbs using an unmodified underwater flight stroke. essentially the same as turtles and penguins. In contrast. the hindlimbs provide relatively weak thrust in all simulations. We conclude that plesiosaurs were forelimb-dominated swimmers that used their hind limbs mainly for maneuverability and stability.,True,MIFr3doAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,24,"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004605&xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700283",5876887710598360196,/scholar?cites=5876887710598360196,,,"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004605&xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700256,15700259,15700262,15700265,15700271,15700283",0,0,0

Thus. they often simply enlarge the input texture. rather than perform reasonable synthesis. As a compromise. many recent methods sacrifice generalizability by training and testing on the same single (or fixed set of) texture image (s). resulting in huge re-training time costs for unseen images. In this work. based on the discovery that the assembling/stitching operation in traditional texture synthesis is analogous to a transposed convolution operation. we propose a novel way of using transposed convolution operation. Specifically. we directly treat the whole encoded feature map of the input texture as transposed convolution filters and the features' self-similarity map. which captures the auto-correlation information. as input to the transposed convolution. Such a design allows our framework. once trained. to be generalizable to perform synthesis of unseen textures with a single forward pass in nearly real-time. Our method achieves state-of-the-art texture synthesis quality based on various metrics. While self-similarity helps preserve the input textures' regular structural patterns. our framework can also take random noise maps for irregular input textures instead of self-similarity maps as transposed convolution inputs. It allows to get more diverse results as well as generate arbitrarily large texture outputs by directly sampling large noise maps in a single pass as well.,True,MIFr3doAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07243,1146040393281921502,/scholar?cites=1146040393281921502,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07243,0,0,0

1288694,Prediction and shaping of visual cortex activity for retinal prostheses,2017,Kerry Halupka,,,,,,Retinal prostheses are a promising treatment for blindness caused by photoreceptor degeneration. Electrodes implanted in the retina deliver electrical stimuli in the form of current pulses that activate surviving neurons to restore a sense of vision. Clinical trials for such devices have shown that the visual percepts evoked are informative. and can improve the day-to-day life of recipients. However. the spatial resolution of retinal prostheses is a limiting factor. with those who have the highest reported acuity measures still classified as legally blind. Simultaneous stimulation of multiple electrodes is a possible strategy to improve device resolution without increasing the number of physical electrodes. However. electrode interactions that occur during simultaneous stimulation are not well understood. This thesis investigates the characteristics of cortical responses to simultaneous stimulation of multiple electrodes.  We formulated a quantitative model to characterise the responses of visual cortex neurons to multi-electrode stimulation of the retina to understand how simultaneous stimulation can improve resolution.

Patient-specific boundary conditions are an important aspect of this approach and while most efforts make use of lumped parameter models to capture key phenomena. they lack the ability to specify the associated parameters on a patient-specific basis.

Adequate test coverage can require millions of test cases. and the cost of equipment prototypes combined with the real-time constraints of testing with them makes it infeasible to sample more than a small number of these tests. Model based testing seeks to avoid this problem by allowing for large numbers of relatively inexpensive virtual prototypes that operate in simulation time at a speed limited only by the available computing resources. In this report. we describe how a computer system emulator can be used as part of a model based testing environment; specifically. we show that a complete software stackincluding operating system and application software-can be deployed within a simulated environment. and that these simulations can proceed as fast as possible. To illustrate this approach to model based testing. we describe how it is being used to test several building control systems that act to coordinate air conditioning loads for the purpose of reducing peak demand. These tests involve the use of A Discrete Event System Simulator (ADEVS) and Quick Emulator (QEMU) to host the operational software within the simulation. and a building model developed with the MODELICA programming language using Buildings Library and packaged as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) that serves as the virtual test environment.,True,mlXdmJ8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,5,https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub72642.pdf,9856532362923249578,/scholar?cites=9856532362923249578,,,https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub72642.pdf,0,0,0

In this work. we propose a method to process zip-code level POC datasets and apply these processed data to calibrate an epidemiological model. We specifically develop a calibration algorithm using simulated annealing and calibrate a parsimonious equation-based model of modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics. The results show that parsimonious models are remarkably effective in predicting the dynamics observed in the number of infected patients and our calibration algorithm is sufficiently capable of predicting peak loads observed in POC diagnostics data while staying within reasonable and empirical parameter ranges reported in the literature. Additionally. we explore the future use of the calibrated values by testing the correlation between peak load and population density from Census data. Our results show that linearity assumptions for the relationships among various factors can be misleading. therefore further data sources and analysis are needed to identify relationships between additional parameters and existing calibrated ones.

In this paper. we propose a spatial-temporal trajectory prediction approach that is able to learn the strategy of a team with multiple coordinated agents. In particular. we use graph-based attention model to learn the dependency of the agents. In addition. instead of utilizing the recurrent networks (eg. VRNN.

1288717,DISPERSE: A Decentralized Architecture for Content Replication Resilient to Node Failures,2019,Santhanakrishnan Anand and Ding Ding and Paolo Gasti and Mike O’Neal and Mauro Conti and Kiran S Balagani,17,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,1,201-212,IEEE,This paper introduces DISPERSE. a distributed scalable architecture for delivery of content and services that provides resilience against node failure through location-independent storage and replication of content. Current content delivery networks (CDNs) have. at least to some degree. a centralized structure thus susceptible to a single point of failure. DISPERSE addresses this limitation by implementing a fully de-centralized structure. DISPERSE is a two-layer architecture: the first layer (front-end layer) exposes services (e.g.. Web. SFTP) to clients; the second layer (back-end layer) provides reliable distributed storage of content and application state. Content in DISPERSE’s back-end layer is stored and exchanged as Named Data Network (NDN) content objects. This allows DISPERSE to implement fine-grained. location-independent. fully decentralized content replication mechanisms. We validate the performance of …,True,6glC_iEAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8807300/,,,,,,0,0,0
1288718,Social Relations to Improve Network Resiliency against Failures and Censorships,2017,Ding Ding,,,,,,During the last decade. the Internet have penetrated our life. An increasing number of people relies on the Internet and its applications. Many client/server based Internet services. such as e-commerce (e.g.. Amazon) and social networking (e.g.. Facebook). are carefully provisioned and managed to deliver high availability. However. in the recent years. there have been situations where country-scale network fraction of Internet users have been disconnected from the rest of the network. In particular. because of national censorships. natural hazards. misconfiguration or DDoS attacks on links. the network is splitted into two or more areas. and consequently. web services/applications may become unavailable to users. This severely undermine the ability of people to communicate and organize. since many of the services used to discover and relay messages to other users (e.g.. Twitter. Facebook) were unavailable. For example. because of a censorship. people in the censored area were not able to use microblogging service (i.e.. Twitter). However. owing to the news media property of microblogging. under this situation (i.e.. governments performing censorship). people are more willing to rely on this service. in order to spread information. Therefore. these web services/applications. need to be carefully provisioned to maintain high availability. against network failures or censorships. This dissertation focuses on improving the network resiliency against the network failures/partitions. More precisely. the contribution of this thesis is twofold: (i) we present our design of a social-aware P2P overlay that is able to provide better connectivity comparing with …,True,6glC_iEAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,0,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/10323/,,,,,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/10323/,0,0,0

The model combines a temperature and strain rate dependent flow stress with a criterion for brittle fracture and is suitable for metallic materials undergoing high strain rate loadings. First. the well documented Kalthoff–Winkler experiment was used to validate our approach. A series of simulations was then conducted to model the behaviour of a 4340 steel at 223 K (−50 °C) under different impact speeds to investigate the simultaneous effect of temperature and impact velocity towards the failure of the material. In some cases a lower temperature brought about failure for the same impact velocity. highlighting the role of combining factors in failure analysis.

In contrast. this work describes a device. which traps particles along the length of the channel and hence at different locations along the direction of fluid flow. Actuation is achieved using a single piezoelectric transducer bonded to a borosilicate glass capillary. which defines the fluidic channel. Modes of operation have been found experimentally and through use of finite element simulation methods in which the particles can be trapped at locations away from the piezoelectric transducer allowing optimal visual access to the clumps of particles. These locations are separated by distances significantly greater than half the acoustic wavelength. When flow is introduced. a single clump is formed and optical access is unhindered by the opaque transducer allowing a …,True,9F5p1yQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,24,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4863645,10546045534029842009,/scholar?cites=10546045534029842009,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Gralinski/publication/260520774_Continuous_flow_ultrasonic_particle_trapping_in_a_glass_capillary/links/0f3175327ef4177184000000.pdf,0,0,0
1288721,A strategy to couple the material point method (MPM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) computational techniques,2016,Samuel J Raymond and Bruce Jones and John R Williams,,Computational Particle Mechanics,,1-10,Springer International Publishing,A strategy is introduced to allow coupling of the material point method (MPM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for numerical simulations. This new strategy partitions the domain into SPH and MPM regions. particles carry all state variables and as such no special treatment is required for the transition between regions. The aim of this work is to derive and validate the coupling methodology between MPM and SPH. Such coupling allows for general boundary conditions to be used in an SPH simulation without further augmentation. Additionally. as SPH is a purely particle method. and MPM is a combination of particles and a mesh. This coupling also permits a smooth transition from particle methods to mesh methods. where further coupling to mesh methods could in future provide an effective farfield boundary treatment for the SPH method.

Thin wafers fail largely due to breakage during solar cell processing and handling. One of the root causes for breakage is sub-mm edge cracks in the silicon wafer. and these cracks cannot be reliably detected by most commercially-available crack detection tools. In this work. we first investigate the correlation between wafer thickness and critical crack length. and explain the importance of detecting sub-500-μm edge cracks as the wafer thickness is reduced. Secondly. we extend our previous work of micro-crack detection to demonstrate an edge illumination technique using a near-infrared laser to image edge cracks less than 500 μm in length in multicrystalline silicon.

This allows the simulation of both simple brittle failure and more complex. multi-mode failure cases. The meshfree method.

Even though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain deformation based on impact kinematics. the clinical application of these FE head models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This work aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature engineering. and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a combination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in less than 0.001 s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025. and with a standard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and model initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive power of the model were investigated. and it was noted that the features based on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features based on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head impacts. this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of brain strain with accuracy. and its applicability can even further be extended by incorporating data from other types of head …,True,9F5p1yQAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08527,17040528216272351785,/scholar?cites=17040528216272351785,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08527,0,0,0

1288756,Improving deep reinforcement learning via transfer,2019,Yunshu Du,,,,2405-2407,,While achieving the state-of-the-art performance in complex sequential tasks. deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) remains extremely data inefficient. Many approaches have been studied to improve the data efficiency of deep RL algorithms. This dissertation focuses on leveraging various transfer learning techniques to tackle this problem. We first show that positive transfer can be achieved cross-domains via direct weight transfer if the two agents share a certain amount of similarities. Then we look into how could the similarity between cross-domain tasks be quantified. such that we only transfer useful information from one task to another while blocking information that might have a negative effect. The third direction we studied is the human-agent transfer mechanism. which we integrate human knowledge via supervised pre-training on a set of demonstration data collected from a human then transfer to an agent. Lastly. several future directions are proposed for the remainder of this dissertation.,True,j48cBXYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,4,http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2019/pdfs/p2405.pdf,6743050576979718216,/scholar?cites=6743050576979718216,,,http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2019/pdfs/p2405.pdf,0,0,0

While many techniques have been proposed to enhance ER by biasing how experiences are sampled from the buffer. thus far they have not considered strategies for refreshing experiences inside the buffer. In this work. we introduce Lucid Dreaming for Experience Replay (LiDER). a conceptually new framework that allows replay experiences to be refreshed by leveraging the agent's current policy. LiDER 1) moves an agent back to a past state; 2) lets the agent try following its current policy to execute different actions---as if the agent were"" dreaming"" about the past. but is aware of the situation and can control the dream to encounter new experiences; and 3) stores and reuses the new experience if it turned out better than what the agent previously experienced. ie. to refresh its memories. LiDER is designed to be easily incorporated into off-policy. multi-worker RL algorithms that use ER; we present in this work a case study of applying LiDER to an actor-critic based algorithm. Results show LiDER consistently improves performance over the baseline in four Atari 2600 games.

Spatial domain tracking techniques are not accurate as well as they are slow and this is a major reason why wavelet domain tracking methods are getting popular. Real-valued wavelet transform suffers from shift sensitivity producing inaccurate object tracking. In this paper. we proposed a novel object tracking method using Daubechies Complex Wavelet transform (DaubCxWT). Use of this transform is suitable to track the object from video sequences because of its approximate shift-invariance nature. Tracking of object in the first frame is done by computing the Daubechies complex wavelet coefficients corresponding to the object of interest and then matching energy of these coefficients to the object neighborhood. in Daubechies complex wavelet domain. to perform the tracking in the next consecutive frames. The proposed method needs only complex wavelet coefficients for tracking and hence it is simple in implementation and tracks object efficiently.,True,TnpC4K0AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manish_Khare4/publication/234052451_Moving_object_tracking_in_video_sequences_based_on_energy_of_Daubechies_Complex_Wavelet_Transform/links/0912f50e9a626537a3000000.pdf,5755707057959099922,/scholar?cites=5755707057959099922,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manish_Khare4/publication/234052451_Moving_object_tracking_in_video_sequences_based_on_energy_of_Daubechies_Complex_Wavelet_Transform/links/0912f50e9a626537a3000000.pdf,0,0,0

Feature selection is commonly employed to deal with high dimensional data. Recently. Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS) has been shown to outperform many of the existing feature selection methods for a variety of datasets. In this paper. we propose a Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) based framework for QPFS. This helps in reducing the cubic computational time (in terms of data dimension) of the standard QPFS to quadratic time in practice.

Feature selection is typically employed to select a subset of features which improves generalization accuracy as well as reduces the computational cost of learning the model. One of the criteria used for feature selection is to jointly minimize the redundancy and maximize the relevance of the selected features. In this paper. we formulate the task of feature selection as a one class SVM problem in a space where features correspond to the data points and instances correspond to the dimensions. The goal is to look for a representative subset of the features (support vectors) which describes the boundary for the region where the set of the features (data points) exists.

In this paper. we present an altogether new perspective on feature selection. We pose feature selection as a one class SVM problem of modeling the space in which features can be represented. We show that finding the support vectors in our one class formulation is tantamount to performing feature selection. Further. we show that our formulation reduces to the standard QPFS formulation in the dual problem space.

The diversity of such information sources and the increasing amounts of medical data produced by healthcare institutes annually. pose significant challenges in data mining. In this paper we present a novel semantic model that describes knowledge extracted from the lowest-level of a data mining process. where information is represented by multiple features ie measurements or numerical descriptors extracted from measurements. images. texts or other medical data. forming multidimensional feature spaces. Knowledge collected by manual annotation or extracted by unsupervised data mining from one or more feature spaces is modeled through generalized qualitative spatial semantics. This model enables a unified representation of knowledge across multimodal data repositories. It contributes to bridging the semantic gap. by enabling direct links between lowlevel features and higher-level concepts eg describing body parts. anatomies and pathological findings.

1288821,Curriculum audiovisual learning,2020,Di Hu and Zheng Wang and Haoyi Xiong and Dong Wang and Feiping Nie and Dejing Dou,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.09414,,,,Associating sound and its producer in complex audiovisual scene is a challenging task. especially when we are lack of annotated training data. In this paper. we present a flexible audiovisual model that introduces a soft-clustering module as the audio and visual content detector. and regards the pervasive property of audiovisual concurrency as the latent supervision for inferring the correlation among detected contents. To ease the difficulty of audiovisual learning. we propose a novel curriculum learning strategy that trains the model from simple to complex scene. We show that such ordered learning procedure rewards the model the merits of easy training and fast convergence. Meanwhile. our audiovisual model can also provide effective unimodal representation and cross-modal alignment performance. We further deploy the well-trained model into practical audiovisual sound localization and separation task. We show that our localization model significantly outperforms existing methods. based on which we show comparable performance in sound separation without referring external visual supervision.

1288822,Memory-augmented temporal dynamic learning for action recognition,2019,Yuan Yuan and Dong Wang and Qi Wang,33,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,01,9167-9175,,Human actions captured in video sequences contain two crucial factors for action recognition. ie. visual appearance and motion dynamics. To model these two aspects. Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs) are adopted in most existing successful methods for recognizing actions. However. CNN based methods are limited in modeling long-term motion dynamics. RNNs are able to learn temporal motion dynamics but lack effective ways to tackle unsteady dynamics in long-duration motion. In this work. we propose a memory-augmented temporal dynamic learning network. which learns to write the most evident information into an external memory module and ignore irrelevant ones. In particular. we present a differential memory controller to make a discrete decision on whether the external memory module should be updated with current feature. The discrete memory controller takes in the memory history. context embedding and current feature as inputs and controls information flow into the external memory module. Additionally. we train this discrete memory controller using straight-through estimator. We evaluate this end-to-end system on benchmark datasets (UCF101 and HMDB51) of human action recognition.

To improve the translation quality. the task performances of the blind are usually employed to evaluate different encoding schemes. In contrast to the toilsome human-based assessment. we argue that machine model can be also developed for evaluation. and more efficient. To this end. we firstly propose two distinct cross-modal perception model wrt the late-blind and congenitally-blind cases. which aim to generate concrete visual contents based on the translated sound. To validate the functionality of proposed models. two novel optimization strategies wrt the primary encoding scheme are presented. Further. we conduct sets of human-based experiments to evaluate and compare them with the conducted machine-based assessments in the cross-modal generation task. Their highly consistent results wrt different encoding schemes indicate that using machine model to accelerate optimization evaluation and reduce experimental cost is feasible to some extent. which could dramatically promote the upgrading of encoding scheme then help the blind to improve their visual perception ability.,True,dasL9V4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Hu_Listen_to_the_Image_CVPR_2019_paper.html,2686937423290293569,/scholar?cites=2686937423290293569,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Hu_Listen_to_the_Image_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1288824,Temporal Relational Modeling with Self-Supervision for Action Segmentation,2020,Dong Wang and Di Hu and Xingjian Li and Dejing Dou,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.07508,,,,Temporal relational modeling in video is essential for human action understanding. such as action recognition and action segmentation. Although Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have shown promising advantages in relation reasoning on many tasks. it is still a challenge to apply graph convolution networks on long video sequences effectively. The main reason is that large number of nodes (ie. video frames) makes GCNs hard to capture and model temporal relations in videos. To tackle this problem. in this paper. we introduce an effective GCN module. Dilated Temporal Graph Reasoning Module (DTGRM). designed to model temporal relations and dependencies between video frames at various time spans. In particular. we capture and model temporal relations via constructing multi-level dilated temporal graphs where the nodes represent frames from different moments in video. Moreover. to enhance temporal reasoning ability of the proposed model. an auxiliary self-supervised task is proposed to encourage the dilated temporal graph reasoning module to find and correct wrong temporal relations in videos. Our DTGRM model outperforms state-of-the-art action segmentation models on three challenging datasets: 50Salads. Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA). and the Breakfast dataset.

However. there are limits to generate high quality predictions due to ambiguous information in the video frames.

1288827,Heterogeneous Scene Analysis via Self-supervised Audiovisual Learning,,Zheng Wang Di Hu and Haoyi Xiong and Dong Wang and Feiping Nie and Dejing Dou,,,,,,Audiovisual concurrency provides potential cues for perceiving and understanding the outside world. Such concurrency comes from the simple phenomena of “Sound is produced by the oscillation of object”. and exists through our daily life. such as the talking crowd. the barking dog. the roaring machine. etc. These inherent and pervasive correspondences provide us the reference to distinguish and correlate different audiovisual messages. then contribute to learning diversified visual appearances from their produced sounds. or perceiving various acoustic signals from their diversified sound-makers.Previous work [6] has proved that machine intelligence is able to take advantage of the inherent audiovisual concurrency for possessing human-like audiovisual processing ability. However. the learning capacity of these self-supervised models is pervasively limited by the heterogeneous complexity of audiovisual scene. ie. the scenes with different number of sound-sources. as shown in Fig. 1. Concretely. it is easy to align sound and its visual source in the simple scene with single sound. whereas more difficult for the complex one with multiple sounds as lack of one-to-one audiovisual alignment annotations. Besides. many works indiscriminately deal with these simple and complex audiovisual data via identical model. which could confuse the models when analyzing and aligning diversified audiovisual content without auxiliary annotations. even degrade the learning performance when more data is available for training [10. 3].,True,dasL9V4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,http://sightsound.org/papers/2020/Di_Hu_Heterogeneous_Scene_Analysis_via_Self-supervised_Audiovisual_Learning.pdf,,,,,http://sightsound.org/papers/2020/Di_Hu_Heterogeneous_Scene_Analysis_via_Self-supervised_Audiovisual_Learning.pdf,0,0,0

Thus. we propose a novel approach for cloud detection using machine learning and multi-feature fusion based on a comparative analysis of typical spectral. textural. and other feature differences between clouds and backgrounds. To validate this method. we tested it on 102 Gao Fen-1 (GF-1) and Gao Fen-2 (GF-2) satellite images. The overall accuracy of our multi-feature fusion method for cloud detection was more than 91.45%. and the Kappa coefficient for all the tested images was greater than 80%. The producer and user accuracy were also higher at 93.67% and 95.67%. respectively; both of these values were higher than the values for the other tested feature fusion methods. Our results show that this novel multi-feature approach yields better accuracy than other feature fusion methods. In post-processing. we applied an object-oriented method to remove the influence of highly reflective ground objects and further improved the accuracy. Compared to traditional methods. our new method for cloud detection is accurate. exhibits good scalability. and produces consistent results when mapping clouds of different types and sizes over various land surfaces that contain natural vegetation. agriculture land. built-up areas. and water bodies.

However. the large view angles of the panchromatic multispectral sensor (PMS) aboard the GF-4 satellite pose challenges for cross-calibration due to the effects of atmospheric radiation transfer and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To address this problem. this paper introduces a novel cross-calibration method based on data assimilation considering cross-calibration as an optimal approximation problem. The GF-4 PMS was cross-calibrated with the well-calibrated Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) as the reference sensor. In order to correct unequal bidirectional reflection effects. an adjustment factor for the BRDF was established. making complex models unnecessary. The proposed method employed the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm to find the optimal calibration coefficients and BRDF adjustment factor through an iterative process. The validation results revealed a surface reflectance error of< 5% for the new cross-calibration coefficients. The accuracy of calibration coefficients were significantly improved when compared to the officially published coefficients as well as those derived using conventional methods. The uncertainty produced by the proposed method was less than 7%. meeting the demands for future quantitative applications and research. This method is also applicable to other sensors with large view angles.

1288841,A new approach to performing bundle adjustment for time series UAV images 3D building change detection,2017,Wenzhuo Li and Kaimin Sun and Deren Li and Ting Bai and Haigang Sui,9,Remote sensing,6,625,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Successful change detection in multi-temporal images relies on high spatial co-registration accuracy. However. co-registration accuracy alone cannot meet the needs of change detection when using several ground control points to separately geo-reference multi-temporal images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This letter reports on a new approach to perform bundle adjustment—named united bundle adjustment (UBA)—to solve this co-registration problem for change detection in multi-temporal UAV images. In UBA. multi-temporal UAV images are matched with each other to construct a unified tie point net. One single bundle adjustment process is performed on the unified tie point net. placing every image into the same coordinate system and thus automatically accomplishing spatial co-registration. We then perform change detection using both orthophotos and three-dimensional height information derived from dense image matching techniques. Experimental results show that UBA co-registration accuracy is higher than the accuracy of commonly-used approaches for multi-temporal UAV images. Our proposed preprocessing method extends the capacities of consumer-level UAVs so they can eventually meet the growing need for automatic building change detection and dynamic monitoring using only RGB band images.

Most LAI/FPAR products are retrieved from non-geostationary satellite observations. Long revisit times and cloud/cloud shadow contamination lead to temporal and spatial gaps in such LAI/FPAR products. For more effective use in monitoring of vegetation phenology. climate change impacts. disaster trend etc.. in a timely manner. it is critical to generate LAI/FPAR with less cloud/cloud shadow contamination and at higher temporal resolution—something that is feasible with geostationary satellite data. In this paper. we estimate the geostationary Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) LAI/FPAR fields by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with Himawari-8 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI/FPAR products for each biome type. Daily cycles of the estimated AHI LAI/FPAR products indicate that these are stable at 10-min frequency during the day. Comprehensive evaluations were carried out for the different biome types at different spatial and temporal scales by utilizing the MODIS LAI/FPAR products and the available field measurements. These suggest that the generated Himawari-8 AHI LAI/FPAR fields were spatially and temporally consistent with the benchmark MODIS LAI/FPAR products.

O-PCA has been successfully applied within a gradientbased history matching framework. with gradients provided using the adjoint procedure in Stanford’s Automatic-Differentiation-based General Purpose Research Simulator. AD-GPRS. However. the gradient of the mismatch function with respect to uncertain model parameters may not always be well defined or available. and this can limit the use of gradient-based history matching methods. Thus. in this study we explore the use of derivative-free optimization for O-PCA-based history matching. We apply the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) optimization algorithm in our history matching procedure. MADS is a pattern search method that parallelizes naturally and converges relatively quickly to a local minimum (when fully parallelized). In each MADS iteration. a local exploration of the objective function is performed by evaluating a set of trial points in the neighborhood of the current best point. The number of trial points is proportional to the number of optimization variables. Therefore. the dimension-reducing feature of O-PCA acts to significantly decrease the number of simulations required for history matching. To further reduce the computational cost. we develop a multilevel strategy that exploits the multiscale character of O-PCA.

1288858,Reparameterization of Complex Geological Models Using Neural Style Transfer,,Yimin Liu and Wenyue Sun and Yuanlin Wen,,,,,,In the field of reservoir engineering. lower dimensional reparameterization for complex geological models is an important but challenging problem. Properties for complex geological models such as facies are non-Gaussian. characterized by multipoint spatial statistics. Traditional reparameterization method such as principal component analysis (PCA) only works well for Gaussian models that can be characterized by two-point spatial statistics [8]. The recently developed optimization-based PCA (O-PCA) is shown to provide better performance for non-Gaussian models [9]. However. O-PCA relies on hard data at well locations. The performance of O-PCA for unconditional models is not satisfactory. In this study. we explore the application of neural style transfer [1] for the reparameterization of non-Gaussian geological models. The neural style transfer algorithm is firstly introduced for transferring photographs to new images that resembles the styles of famous artworks. and extended to more applications such as video style transfer [4]. Our idea is to use the neural style transfer algorithm as a post-processing step after traditional PCA transformation. PCA transforms the original non-Gaussian model into Gaussian-like models. The purpose is to apply the neural style transfer algorithm to transfer the Gaussian-like PCA model to match the style of the original non-Gaussian model. We will perform both O-PCA and neural style transfer to preprocess same PCA models. Visual inspection will be performed to evaluate the results. in terms of matching style of the original model and geological realism.,True,UvOkN5MAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/960.pdf,,,,,http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/960.pdf,0,0,0

We collect 7200 depth images covering the most common finger articulation for playing piano. and train a random regression forest using depth context features of randomly sampled pixels in training images. In the online tracking stage. we firstly segment the hand from the plane in contact by fusing the information from both color and depth images.

Nevertheless. neither academic researches nor existing industrial practices seem to provide a satisfactory solution or implementation. In this paper. we propose WOLoc (WiFi-only Outdoor Localization) as a learning-based outdoor localization solution using only WiFi hotspots labeled by crowdsensing.

However. two main limitations are still preventing it from large-scale deployments: high power consumption. and the lack of high-volume and diverse labeled data. In order to reduce power consumption. existing approaches are sampling using fewer sensors and with lower frequency. which however lead to a lower accuracy. A common way to obtain labeled data is recording the ground truth while collecting data. but such method cannot apply to large-scale deployment due to its inefficiency. To address these issues. we adopt a new low-frequency sampling manner with a hierarchical transportation mode identification algorithm and propose an offline data labeling approach with its manual and automatic implementations. Through a real-world large-scale experiment and comparison with related works. our sampling manner and algorithm are proved to consume much less energy while achieving a competitive accuracy around 85%.

While such a mismatch causes complications in human-computer interactions and thus potentially reduces the usability and friendliness of a localization service. it is partially entailed by the need for low-cost/effort sensing with resource-limited mobile devices. Fortunately. recent developments in smart glasses (e.g.. Google Glasses) signal a trend toward realistic visual sensing and hence make the sensing ability of mobile devices more compatible to that of human users. Leveraging such front-end developments. we propose VisioMap as a natural indoor localization system that intentionally mimics the human skills in visual localization.

Previous NQG models suffer from a problem that a significant proportion of the generated questions include words in the question target. resulting in the generation of unintended questions.

By replacing the target answer in the original passage with a special token. our model learns to identify which interrogative word should be used. We also propose a new module termed keyword-net. which helps the model better capture the key information in the target answer and generate an appropriate question.

One line of research resolves this issue by employing reinforcement learning (RL) and optimizing the next-word sampling policy directly in a discrete action space.

We propose a user-centric remote radio head (RRH) clustering mechanism. which: 1) provides significant improvement in the received signal-to-interference-ratio through selection diversity; 2) enables efficient interference protection by inducing repulsion among scheduled user-centric RRH clusters; and 3) can self-organize the cluster radius to deal with spatio-temporal variations in user densities. It is shown that under the proposed user-centric clustering mechanism. the ASE (bits/s/Hz/m 2 ) maximizes at an optimal cluster size.

1288913,Geometry-Aware Symmetric Domain Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation,2019,Shanshan Zhao and Huan Fu and Mingming Gong and Dacheng Tao,,,,,,Supervised depth estimation has achieved high accuracy due to the advanced deep network architectures. Since the groundtruth depth labels are hard to obtain. recent methods try to learn depth estimation networks in an unsupervised way by exploring unsupervised cues. which are effective but less reliable than true labels. An emerging way to resolve this dilemma is to transfer knowledge from synthetic images with ground truth depth via domain adaptation techniques. However. these approaches overlook specific geometric structure of the natural images in the target domain (ie. real data). which is important for high-performing depth prediction. Motivated by the observation. we propose a geometry-aware symmetric domain adaptation framework (GASDA) to explore the labels in the synthetic data and epipolar geometry in the real data jointly.

Therefore. a key issue to solve in this area is how to effectively model the multi-scale correspondence structure properties in an adaptive end-to-end learning fashion. Motivated by this observation. we propose an end-to-end multi-scale correspondence structure learning (MSCSL) approach for optical flow estimation. In principle. the proposed MSCSL approach is capable of effectively capturing the multi-scale inter-image-correlation correspondence structures within a multi-level feature space from deep learning. Moreover. the proposed MSCSL approach builds a spatial Conv-GRU neural network model to adaptively model the intrinsic dependency relationships among these multi-scale correspondence structures.

1288917,Adaptive context-aware multi-modal network for depth completion,2020,Shanshan Zhao and Mingming Gong and Huan Fu and Dacheng Tao,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.10833,,,,Depth completion aims to recover a dense depth map from the sparse depth data and the corresponding single RGB image. The observed pixels provide the significant guidance for the recovery of the unobserved pixels' depth. However. due to the sparsity of the depth data. the standard convolution operation. exploited by most of existing methods. is not effective to model the observed contexts with depth values. To address this issue. we propose to adopt the graph propagation to capture the observed spatial contexts. Specifically. we first construct multiple graphs at different scales from observed pixels. Since the graph structure varies from sample to sample. we then apply the attention mechanism on the propagation. which encourages the network to model the contextual information adaptively. Furthermore. considering the mutli-modality of input data. we exploit the graph propagation on the two modalities respectively to extract multi-modal representations. Finally. we introduce the symmetric gated fusion strategy to exploit the extracted multi-modal features effectively. The proposed strategy preserves the original information for one modality and also absorbs complementary information from the other through learning the adaptive gating weights. Our model. named Adaptive Context-Aware Multi-Modal Network (ACMNet). achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks.{\it ie}.

One essential problem in domain generalization is to learn discriminative domain-invariant features. To arrive at this. some methods introduce a domain discriminator through adversarial learning to match the feature distributions in multiple source domains. However. adversarial training can only guarantee that the learned features have invariant marginal distributions. while the invariance of conditional distributions is more important for prediction in new domains. To ensure the conditional invariance of learned features. we propose an entropy regularization term that measures the dependency between the learned features and the class labels.

However. the traditional deep learning methods assume that training data and test data have the same distributions. which causes certain limitations in real‐world histopathological applications. However. it is costly to recollect a large amount of labeled histology data to train a new neural network for each specified image acquisition procedure even for similar tasks. In this paper. an unsupervised domain adaptation is introduced into a typical deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to mitigate the repeating of the labels.

However. VHR remote sensing images usually lead to a large amount of noises in spectra. thereby reducing the reliability of the detected results. To solve this problem. this study proposes an object-based expectation maximization (OBEM) post-processing approach for enhancing raw LCCD results. OBEM defines a refinement of the labeling in a detected map to enhance its raw detection accuracies. Current mainstream change detection (preprocessing) techniques concentrate on proposing a change magnitude measurement or considering image spatial features to obtain a change detection map. The proposed OBEM approach is a new solution to enhance change detection accuracy by refining the raw result. Post-processing approaches can achieve competitive accuracies to the preprocessing methods. but in a direct and succinct manner. The proposed OBEM post-processing method synthetically considers multi-scale segmentation and expectation maximum algorithms to refine the raw change detection result. Then. the influence of the scale of segmentation on the LCCD accuracy of the proposed OBEM is investigated. Four pairs of remote sensing images. one of two pairs (aerial image with 0.5 m/pixel resolution) which depict two landslide sites on Landtau Island. Hong Kong.

Due to the benefit of having spatial dependency properties within the image space while using remote sensing images for detecting land cover change. many contextual information-based change detection methods have been proposed in past decades. However. there is still a space for improvement in accuracies and usability of LCCD. In this paper. a LCCD method based on adaptive contextual information is proposed. First. an adaptive region is constructed by gradually detecting the spectral similarity surrounding a central pixel. Second. the Euclidean distance between pairwise extended regions is calculated to measure the change magnitude between the pairwise central pixels of bi-temporal images. All the bi-temporal images are scanned pixel by pixel so the change magnitude image (CMI) can be generated. Then. the Otsu or a manual threshold is employed to acquire the binary change detection map (BCDM). The detection accuracies of the proposed approach are investigated by three land cover change cases with Landsat bi-temporal remote sensing images and aerial images with very high spatial resolution (0.5 m/pixel).

It proposes a novel multi-scale object histogram distance (MOHD) to measure the change magnitude between bi-temporal remote sensing images. Three major steps are related to the proposed MOHD. Firstly. multi-scale objects for the post-event image are extracted through a widely used algorithm called the fractional net evaluation approach. The pixels within a segmental object are taken to construct the pairwise frequency distribution histograms. An arithmetic frequency-mean feature is then defined from the red. green and blue band histogram. Secondly. bin-to-bin distance is adapted to measure the change magnitude between the pairwise objects of bi-temporal images. The change magnitude image (CMI) of the bi-temporal images can be generated through object-by-object. Finally. the classical binary method Otsu is used to divide the CMI to a binary change detection map. Experimental results based on two real datasets with different land-cover change scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MOHD approach in detecting land-cover change compared with three widely used existing approaches.

Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper. we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence. they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation). We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In particular. we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.,True,V5NWZc8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,87,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04893,18424751369468482821,/scholar?cites=18424751369468482821,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04893,0,0,0
