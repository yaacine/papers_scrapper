The core of each enzyme is similar: an α/β sheet. not barrel. of eight β-sheets connected by α-helices. These enzymes have diverged from a common ancestor so as to preserve the arrangement of the catalytic residues. not the binding site. They all have a catalytic triad. the elements of which are borne on loops which are the best-conserved structural features in the fold. Only the histidine in the nucleophile-histidine-acid catalytic triad is completely conserved. with the nucleophile and acid loops accommodating more than one type of amino acid. The unique topological and sequence arrangement of the triad residues produces a catalytic triad which is. in a sense. a mirror-image of the serine protease catalytic triad.

99450,Bacterial biocatalysts: molecular biology. three-dimensional structures. and biotechnological applications of lipases,1999,KE Jaeger and BW Dijkstra and MT Reetz,53,,1,315-351,Annual Reviews,Bacteria produce and secrete lipases. which can catalyze both the hydrolysis and the synthesis of long-chain acylglycerols. These reactions usually proceed with high regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. and. therefore. lipases have become very important stereoselective biocatalysts used in organic chemistry. High-level production of these biocatalysts requires the understanding of the mechanisms underlying gene expression. folding. and secretion. Transcription of lipase genes may be regulated by quorum sensing and two-component systems; secretion can proceed either via the Sec-dependent general secretory pathway or via ABC transporters. In addition. some lipases need folding catalysts such as the lipase-specific foldases and disulfide-bond–forming proteins to achieve a secretion-competent conformation.

99451,Bacterial lipases,1994,Karl-Erich Jaeger and Stéphane Ransac and Bauke W Dijkstra and Charles Colson and Margreet van Heuvel and Onno Misset,15,,1,29-63,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Many different bacterial species produce lipases which hydrolyze esters of glycerol with preferably long-chain fatty acids. They act at the interface generated by a hydrophobic lipid substrate in a hydrophilic aqueous medium. A characteristic property of lipases is called interfacial activation. meaning a sharp increase in lipase activity observed when the substrate starts to form an emulsion. thereby presenting to the enzyme an interfacial area. As a consequence. the kinetics of a lipase reaction do not follow the classical Michaelis-Menten model. With only a few exceptions. bacterial lipases are able to completely hydrolyze a triacylglycerol substrate although a certain preference for primary ester bonds has been observed. Numerous lipase assay methods are available using coloured or fluorescent substrates which allow spectroscopic and fluorimetric detection of lipase activitiy.

The strong similarity in their backbone conformations forms the basis of a common numbering system for the amino acid sequence. The three common major helices and much of the extended chain form a nearly identical “homologous core” structure. The variations in conformation usually arise from deletions/insertions or en bloc shifts of structural units. The exception to this is part of the highly conserved calcium-binding loop; however. this is to be expected as 1) there is no calcium ion sequestered in the venom dimer as there is in the case of the bovine enzyme and 2) two side chains in that segment form dimer-stabilizing interactions between the subunits of the C. atrox enzyme.

Ltd,Haloalcohol dehalogenases are bacterial enzymes that catalyze the cofactor-independent dehalogenation of vicinal haloalcohols such as the genotoxic environmental pollutant 1. 3-dichloro-2-propanol. thereby producing an epoxide. a chloride ion and a proton. Here we present X-ray structures of the haloalcohol dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1. and complexes of the enzyme with an epoxide product and chloride ion. and with a bound haloalcohol substrate mimic. These structures support a catalytic mechanism in which Tyr145 of a Ser-Tyr-Arg catalytic triad deprotonates the haloalcohol hydroxyl function to generate an intramolecular nucleophile that substitutes the vicinal halogen. Haloalcohol dehalogenases are related to the widespread family of NAD (P) H-dependent short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR family). which use a similar Ser-Tyr-Lys/Arg catalytic triad to catalyze …,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,125,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/cdg479,7102262581309552075,/scholar?cites=7102262581309552075,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/cdg479,0,0,0

These muramidases play an important role in the metabolism of the bacterial cell wall and might therefore be potential targets for the rational design of antibacterial drugs. One of the lytic transglycosylases is Slt35. a naturally occurring soluble fragment of the outer membrane bound lytic transglycosylase B (MltB) from Escherichia coli. Results: The crystal structure of Slt35 has been determined at 1.7 Å resolution. The structure reveals an ellipsoid molecule with three domains called the alpha. beta and core domains. The core domain is sandwiched between the alpha and beta domains.

The epoxide hydrolase from A. radiobacter AD18 belongs to the R/β-hydrolase fold family and contains a catalytic triad in the active site. 9 The catalytic mechanism involves two discrete chemical steps. The first is an SN2 nucleophilic attack by an Asp107 carboxylate oxygen on the least-hindered carbon atom of the epoxide. resulting in a covalent ester intermediate (Figure 1). In the second step. the ester intermediate is hydrolyzed by a water molecule that is activated by the Asp246-His275 pair. 8 The chemical opening of an epoxide is facilitated by an acidic functional group that interacts with the ring oxygen.

In both cases. reasonable correlations are observed in logarithmic plots relating the Ki value for acarbose with each mutant and both kcat/Km and Km for the hydrolysis of either substrate by the corresponding mutants.

Where do these compounds come from? Apart from natural resources. two synthetic strategies are available: asymmetric chemical catalysis using transition metal catalysts and biocatalysis using enzymes. In the latter case. screening programs have identified a number of enzymes. However. their enantioselectivity is often not high enough for a desired reaction. This problem can be solved by applying directed evolution to create enantioselective enzymes as shown here for a lipase from Bacillus subtilis. The reaction studied was the asymmetric hydrolysis of meso-1.4-diacetoxy-2-cyclopentene with the formation of chiral alcohols which were detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

Its application. however. is hampered by the limited cyclodextrin product specificity and the strong inhibitory effect of cyclodextrins on CGTase activity. Recent structural studies have identified Arg47 in the Bacillus circulans strain 251 CGTase as an active‐site residue interacting with cyclodextrins. but not with linear oligosaccharides. Arg47 thus may specifically affect CGTase reactions with cyclic substrates or products.Here we show that mutations in Arg47 (to Leu or Gln) indeed have a negative effect on the cyclization and coupling activities; Arg47 specifically stabilizes the oligosaccharide chain in the transition state for these reactions. As a result. the mutant proteins display a shift in product specificity towards formation of larger cyclodextrins.

It requires the cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) to catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone.

We have determined the crystal structure of a ternary complex of s-GDH with PQQ and methylhydrazine. a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. This complex. refined at 1.5-Å resolution to an R factor of 16.7%. affords a detailed view of a cofactor-binding site of s-GDH.

This study compares the extent to which young and older adults can improve. retain. and generalize postural compensatory steps in response to external perturbations. Centre of mass displacement. step characteristics and lower leg muscle activation latencies were measured during one training session of compensatory stepping in response to large surface translations in 13 young and 12 older adults.

Older adults decreased their centre of mass displacements over repeated exposure to large surface translations in both the anterior and posterior directions and retained these improvements. In contrast. young adults only showed adaptation and retention of forward stepping responses. Neither group was able to generalize improvements in stepping responses across directions.

AcmC. AcmA and AcmD. The latter two have three C-terminal LysM repeats for peptidoglycan binding. AcmD has much shorter intervening sequences separating the LysM repeats and a lower iso-electric point (4.3) than AcmA (10.3). Under standard laboratory conditions AcmD was mainly secreted into the culture supernatant. An L. lactis acmAacmD double mutant formed longer chains than the acmA single mutant. indicating that AcmD contributes to cell separation. This phenotype could be complemented by plasmid-encoded expression of AcmD in the double mutant. No clear difference in cellular lysis and protein secretion was observed between both mutants. Nevertheless. overexpression of AcmD resulted in increased autolysis when AcmA was present (as in the wild type strain) or when AcmA was added to the culture medium of an AcmA-minus strain. Possibly. AcmD is mainly active within the cell wall. at places where proper conditions are present for its binding and catalytic activity. Various fusion proteins carrying either the three LysM repeats of AcmA or AcmD were used to study and compare their cell wall binding characteristics.

Although the natural role of these enzymes is in the dehalogenation of halogenated xenobiotics such as epichlorohydrin [2]. they can also be used for the preparation of enantiopure haloalcohols and epoxides [3]. The halohydrin dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 can be recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli in high yields. and this has allowed detailed biochemical and mechanistic investigation [4]. as well as engineering studies [4‐5]. The enzyme is active as a homotetramer [6] and belongs. together with other halohydrin dehalogenases. to the short‐chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzyme superfamily [7].Halohydrin dehalogenases each possess a proton‐abstracting catalytic triad (Ser‐Tyr‐Arg). which has a function similar to that of the commonly observed catalytic triad in SDR enzymes (Ser‐Tyr‐Lys). Halohydrin dehalogenases also exhibit the Rossmann‐fold structural unit present in dehydrogenases. but lack the typical Gly‐rich motif required for nucleotide cofactor binding [6]. Instead. halohydrin dehalogenases each contain a spacious anion binding pocket formed by a loop that—in SDR proteins—participates in substrate and cofactor binding.

OMPLA is active as a homodimer and requires calcium as a cofactor. The crystal structures of the monomeric and the inhibited dimeric enzymes were recently determined [Snijder. H. J.. et al.

However. instead of an Asp or Glu that normally is present in the triad of serine hydrolases. a neutral asparagine (Asn156) was found in OMPLA.

Mutations in its encoding gene cause Oculocutaneous Albinism type I (OCA1). the most severe form of albinism. which is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by reduced or absent production of melanin in skin. hair and eyes. Despite extensive structural and characterization studies of its homologues in lower eukaryotic organisms. the catalytic mechanism of human TYR and the molecular basis of OCA1 are largely unknown.

Catalytic promiscuity was proven to be a useful starting point for protein engineering to extend the application of enzymes for organic synthesis.[2] In the case of PAM. high concentrations of ammonia can be used to catalyze the reverse asymmetric amination reaction of (E)-cinnamic acid producing a 1: 1 mixture of optically pure (S)-α-and (R)-β-phenylalanine.[3] We have recently reported that the β-regioselectivity of PAM could be increased up to a production of 88% β-phenylalanine. based on mechanistic investigations of PAM.[3a] The enzyme may therefore be used to synthesize enantiopure β-amino acids in an asymmetric manner. which is of high interest because of their occurrence in many bioactive compounds.[4] Unfortunately. the activity of PAM is much lower than that of the homologous phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Petroselinum crispum (PAL). which shows an up to 1000-fold higher reaction rate in the deamination of α-phenylalanine.[5] The major limitation of phenylalanine ammonia lyases is that they hardly accept or produce β-amino acids. Owing to the low reaction rates of PAM and the strict α-regioselectivity of PAL. a highly active ammonia lyase accepting β-amino acids is desirable to produce optically pure β-amino acids. Therefore. we decided to use …,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,31,https://www.academia.edu/download/52057166/Bartsch_13_ChemCatChem_redesign_of_PAM_into_PAL.pdf,1341823869370721389,/scholar?cites=1341823869370721389,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52057166/Bartsch_13_ChemCatChem_redesign_of_PAM_into_PAL.pdf,0,0,0

The rate-limiting step in the reaction of DhlA is the release of the halide ion. The kinetics of halide release have been analyzed by measuring halide binding with stopped-flow fluorescence experiments. At high halide concentrations. halide import occurs predominantly via the rapid formation of a weak initial collision complex. followed by transport of the ion to the active site. To obtain more insight in this collision complex. we determined the X-ray structure of DhlA in the presence of bromide and investigated the kinetics of mutants that were constructed on the basis of this structure.

However. this has proved to be a major challenge that involves understanding the factors that influence their activity and regioselectivity differences. Herein. we report evidence of a structural determinant that dictates the activity differences between a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and aminomutase (PAM). An inner loop region that closes the active sites of both PAM and PAL was mutated within PAM (PAM residues 77–97) in a stepwise approach to study the effects when the equivalent residue(s) found in the PAL loop were introduced into the PAM loop.

Following that hypothesis. we demonstrated that LSMT is indeed capable of penetrating out from a dialysis tube of the mice intestine origin.

In this study. the crystal structure of recombinant MtaL is reported at 1.35 Å resolution. Comparison of its structure with that of the truncated and cleaved MtaL present in the complex with tyrosinase directly isolated from mushroom shows that the general β-trefoil fold is conserved. However. differences are detected in the loop regions. particularly in the β2–β3 loop. which is intact and not cleaved in the recombinant MtaL. Furthermore. the N-terminal tail is rotated inwards. covering the tyrosinase-binding interface. Thus. MtaL must undergo conformational changes in order to bind mature mushroom tyrosinase.

In vitro studies have shown that OMPLA is only active as a dimer. The structures of monomeric and dimeric OMPLA provided possible clues to the activation process. In the inhibited dimeric species calcium ions are located at the dimer interface ideally suited to stabilise the oxyanion intermediates formed during catalysis. The side chain hydroxyl function of Ser152 is one of the ligands of this interfacial calcium. In the crystal structure of monomeric OMPLA the interfacial calcium site is lacking. but calcium was found to bind at a site involving the carboxylates of Asp149 and Asp184. In the current study the relevance of the identified calcium sites has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis.

For the enzyme cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase). this mechanism is believed to be irreversible unfolding. To reduce the enzyme’s inactivation rate. a sensible engineering strategy would be to stabilize flexible loops near the active site. These loops can be detected using the atomic B factors in any of the five CGTase X-ray structures. A comparison of thermolabile and thermostable CGTases shows that Nature has indeed chosen a strategy of stabilizing flexible loops near the active site.

To assure the availability of cane supplies. rattan plantations and seed nurseries have been initiated. Sex determination of rattan at a young stage is very important for a successful seed nursery to produce more female trees. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated in order to identify genes found in the inflorescence tissues of C. manan especially floral-related genes that may be used in sex determination. A total of 2304 cDNA clones were partially sequenced from 5’end to produce 1179 good quality ESTs with an average size of 400 nucleotides.

The currently implemented production processes mostly rely on non-renewable resources. they suffer from high energy consumption. and generate waste that often has a negative environmental impact. Eco-friendly production methods are therefore intensely searched for. Among them. enzyme-based processes are appealing. because of their high substrate and reaction specificity and the relatively mild operation conditions required by these catalysts.

Enzymologists are always worried about protons: where are they. where can they move. how do they facilitate catalysis? Until very recently. structural biologists could say very little about protons. They could infer the positions of hydrogen bonds by the proximity of heavy atoms. but protons were themselves invisible. To make matters worse. nitrogen and oxygen were indistinguishable. so the orientation of sidechains such as the amide of asparagine could only be inferred indirectly. With the breakthrough in the determination of structures at atomic resolution. at which selected hydrogens become visible in the difference electron density maps and nitrogen may even be distinguished from oxygen. structural biologists can begin to say a lot about protons. Such long-standing controversies as whether short strong hydrogen bonds exist in proteins. and under what circumstances. can now be addressed by crystallography at sub-angstrom resolution. In the contribution from Vrielink and Sampson. the impact of atomic-resolution crystallography on our understanding of enzyme mechanisms is discussed.

Catalysis in the.-amylase family proceeds via a covalently linked intermediate (Uitdehaag et al. 1999b). which basically divides the reaction in two steps. In the first step the donor substrate (starch or oligosaccharide) is processed. yielding the covalent intermediate (donor reaction). In the second step the acceptor reacts with this intermediate. resulting in product formation (acceptor reaction). Whereas.-amylases usually catalyze the hydrolysis reaction using water as acceptor. CGTases mainly catalyze transglycosylation reactions in which the acceptor is either the non-reducing end glucose of another oligosaccharide (disproportionation) or the non-reducing end glucose of the covalently linked oligosaccharide intermediate. resulting in formation of a cyclodextrin (cyclization). Also the reverse of cyclization. in which a cyclodextrin is cleaved and transferred to an accepting oligosaccharide (coupling) is catalyzed by CGTase (van der Veen et al. 2000c). The main determinants that cause the difference in reaction specificity between.-amylases and CGTases are likely to be found at the acceptor binding sites.

Halide binding was much stronger at pH 6.0 than at pH 8.2. Assuming ligand binding to Trp-125 and Trp-175 as the sole cause of fluorescence quenching. dissociation constants at pH 6.0 with chloride and iodide were calculated to be 0.49 f 0.04 and 0.074 f 0.007 mM. respectively.

Clinical trials to alleviate FOG are hampered by a lack of reliable and responsive outcome measures. The New Freezing of gait questionnaire (NFOG-Q) is currently a widely used and validated tool to quantify FOG severity over the past month. It is fast and easy to administer and does not require additional equipment. However. to properly interpret NFOG-Q scores. the reliability and minimal detectable change estimates (MDC) are crucial. but still unknown. Therefore. this study determined the test-retest reliability and responsiveness of the NFOG-Q. METHODS As part of the Duality clinical trial. 117 PD patients completed the NFOG-Q at two baseline assessments (T1 and T2). separated by an interval of six weeks without intermediate intervention. Freezers were identified at T1 based on a NFOG-Q score≥ 1. A T-test was used to detect systematic differences in NFOG-Q scores between T1 and T2 in freezers only. Reliability of NFOG-Q scores was calculated using an ICC two-way mixed effects model with absolute agreement for single measures.

The underlying neural underpinnings of these deficits remain largely unknown. Motor imagery (MI) in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a proxy method to unravel the neural mechanisms of postural control. Hence. the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of PD on the neural correlates of postural control via MI of a dynamic mediolateral (ML) weight-shifting task. As previous study showed reduced activation in the supplementary motor areas (SMA) in PD during MI of locomotion. we hypothesized that PD patients would also show reduced activation during ML weight-shifting compared to age-matched controls. Methods: Twenty-nine people with PD and 14 age-matched controls first completed MI and visual imagery (VI) training (day 1). Following training. participants who scored average VI was used as the first-level contrast of interest. In the second level. a control> PD group comparison was analyzed.

People with freezing of gait (FOG; freezers) exhibit more postural instability than non-freezers especially during dynamic tasks. sometimes expressing itself as a freezing-like weight-shifting deficit. To date. dynamic balance control in freezers and non-freezers has only been studied for gait-like tasks. such as stepping-in-place and turning. Therefore. we investigated the influence of FOG on patients' mediolateral (ML) weight-shifting during a task which imposed increasing speed and accuracy demands. We hypothesized that performance would drop below a set threshold at lower speeds in freezers than in non-freezers. Methods: Seventeen freezers. 15 non-freezers and 15 age-matched controls performed the ML balance assessment (MELBA). MELBA was found to be more sensitive to age-related balance deficits than standard tools. In this study. we adapted the MELBA to accommodate for PD. Participants were instructed to follow a visual target with their center of mass (CoM) by shifting their weight from one leg to the other. The target and CoM were displayed in real-time on a projector screen in front of the participant. Target oscillations started at 0.1 Hz and increased with steps of 0.1 Hz to a final frequency of 1.2 Hz. Participants performed one practice trial and 3 actual ones.

99743,Effect of dopamine on mediolateral dynamic balance in Parkinson's disease and freezing of gait,2019,Moran Gilat and Bauke Dijkstra and Alice Nieuwboer,,,,,,BACKGROUND AND AIM: Postural instability and freezing of gait (FOG) are common features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that lead to frequent falls. Both problems respond poorly to dopaminergic treatment suggesting shared underlying pathophysiology. Converging evidence indicates that dynamic balance tasks. specifically those involving weight-shifting in the mediolateral (ML) direction. are particularly affected in patients with FOG. Yet to date. no study has assessed the differential effect of dopamine on ML weight-shifting in PD with and without FOG. We hypothesized that if FOG and dynamic balance control coincide neurologically. dopaminergic treatment would have less impact on ML weight-shifting in PD patients with FOG (freezers) as compared to those without (non-freezers) and this irrespective of disease severity. METHODS: Fourteen freezers and 13 non-freezers performed the MELBA assessment twice: once while on their regular dopaminergic medications and once following overnight withdrawal (ie in'off'). The order of test moments was counterbalanced. During the MELBA-task. subjects followed a visual target from side to side with their center of mass (CoM) by shifting their weight from one leg to the other. Both the target and the CoM were presented on a large screen in real time. Target oscillations started at 0.1 Hz and increased to 1.2 Hz in 0.1 Hz intervals.

Here. we propose a novel method to study the neural underpinnings of FOG combining motor imagery and action observation of an actual episode in the MRI scanner. Participants watched a sequence of two different videos alternated with rest periods. showing a normal gait episode and a real life FOG episode in a patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Circumstances and durations of the footage were otherwise exactly the same. Participants were asked to imagine that they were going through the same experience as the person in the video.

Freezing is een complex symptoom dat ontstaat in de hersenen maar waarvan de precieze pathofysiologie nog onbekend is. Dit maakt freezing een enorme uitdaging om adequaat te behandelen en tot hiertoe kan geen enkele behandeling freezing compleet verhelpen. In de laatste jaren is er echter steeds meer onderzoek gedaan naar de gedragsmatige kenmerken en onderliggende neurale circuits van freezing. Hier bespreken wij hoe de verkregen inzichten kunnen leiden tot een verbeterde aanpak voor freezing.Ruim de helft van de patiënten met de ziekte van Parkinson (PD) ervaart freezing tijdens het stappen. wat leidt tot herhaaldelijk vallen. verminderde mobiliteit en een uiteindelijke opname in een verzorgingstehuis (1).

Dual-tasks (DT) can be used to assess the load on attentional processes needed for task execution. Previous research has shown that balance and gait deteriorate more under DT conditions in people with PD compared to healthy elderly. and this is associated with falls. However. the effect of a cognitive DT on reactive postural control is yet unknown. Therefore. this pilot study aimed to determine the effect of a cognitive task on the quality of reactive postural control in PD. Methods: Reactive postural control was assessed in 16 patients with PD ON-medication and 12 age-matched healthy elderly in a single task (ST) and a DT. Participants were instructed to maintain their balance while standing on a moveable platform. which was translated in forward. backward and lateral (ie left and right) directions (3 perturbations in each direction). Surface translations were applied in two conditions: 1) quiet standing (ST) and 2) quiet standing while performing the Forward Digit Span (FDS) delivered by headphones (DT). Subjects were asked to divide attention equally over both tasks. The FDS was also performed in sitting. Postural task performance was measured by center of pressure (CoP) displacement in the perturbation direction (ie anteroposterior for forward and backward translations and mediolateral for lateral translations). Results: In all directions. CoP displacement in response to a surface translation was not significantly different between people with PD and healthy elderly.

99750,The use of clinical balance scales to detect balance differences between freezers and non-freezers,2017,Esther MJ Bekkers and Bauke W Dijkstra and Kimberly Dockx and Elke Heremans and Sabine MP Verschueren and Alice Nieuwboer,,,,,,BACKGROUND AND AIM: Postural instability and freezing of gait (FoG) are key features of Parkinson's disease (PD) which are closely related to falls. Although postural instability and FoG often co-occur. it is still unclear whether and how both symptoms overlap. To tackle this question. studies have investigated balance differences between PD patients with and without FoG using two different approaches. ie clinical balance scales and posturography. The results from studies using posturography techniques are so far inconclusive. The effectiveness of clinical balance scales to distinguish between both groups has not yet been closely examined. Therefore. the current literature was reviewed to investigate whether clinical balance scales have sufficient discriminative power to detect balance differences between freezers (FR) and non-freezers (NF). METHODS: PubMed was used to search for literature. based on the following search terms mentioned in the title and/or abstract:'freezing of gait'or'freezers' in combination with'posture'.'postural'.'balance'.'stability'. Relevant articles were identified based on screening of titles. abstracts and full-texts. The search strategy was independently performed by two authors and ended on November 15th 2016. A meta-analysis on balance scores of different clinical balance scales was conducted. RESULTS: Nine studies including 570 PD patients (247 FR. 223 NF) reported outcomes of clinical balance scales. A moderate amount of heterogeneity existed (I²= 37%) between studies. Overall clinical balance scores were significantly lower in FR compared to NF (standardized mean difference (SMD)= 0.68; 95 …,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1688025?limo=0,,,,,0,0,0

The predicted esterase (EstA) was cloned. functionally expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. EstA is a thermostable esterase that showed optimal hydrolysis of esters with short acyl chains (C2-C8). The monomeric enzyme has a molecular mass of 43 kDa and optimal activity around 90 C and at pH 8.5. Analysis using mass-spectrometry and dynamic light scattering showed that EstA exists as hexamer. The crystal structure has been determined at 2.5 Å resolution using multiple anomalous dispersion data. The crystal structure showed a classical alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing the catalytic triad consisting of a serine. aspartate and histidine. and a new immunoglobulin-like domain. EstA was found to be inhibited by the organophosphate paraoxon. The structure of EstA with paraoxon bound was determined at 3.0 Å resolution and revealed that the inhibitor binds covalently to the catalytic serine residue. The structural information for EstA provides insight into the molecular basis of substrate recognition and catalysis by this enzyme. thereby contributing to the development of novel thermostable esterases to be used in industry.,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC,0,https://sim.confex.com/sim/2007/techprogram/P4025.HTM,,,,,0,0,0

Enzymes from this family have the ability to hydrolyse and synthesize a-glycosidic bonds in poly-or oligosaccharides in various linkage types. such as ((1-> 1). a (1-> 4) and a (1-> 6). 2 Several of them are very suitable catalysts for the synthesis of aglycosidically linked oligosaccharides. To further improve their applicability it is often desirable to adjust the properties of these enzymes. for instance by protein engineering. which approach is greatly facilitated if the enzyme's interactions with substrates and products are understood in molecular detail. For one member of the A-amylase family. cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase). an extraordinary amount of detail about its catalytic mechanism has been elucidated.

NY: Cambridge University Press. 1992-,The structural origin of the decrease in system volume upon protein denaturation by pressure has remained a puzzle for decades. This negative volume change upon unfolding is assumed to arise globally from more intimate interactions between the polypeptide chain and water. including electrostriction of buried charges that become exposed upon unfolding. hydration of the polypeptide backbone and amino acid side chains and elimination of packing defects and internal void volumes upon unfolding of  the chain. However. the relative signs and magnitudes of each of these contributing factors have not been experimentally determined. Our laboratory has probed the fundamental basis for the volume change upon unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease (Snase) using variable solution conditions and point mutants of Snase (Royer CA et al.. 1993.

Mol. Biol,,611-622,,The Netherlands calcium ions is caused by the reduced exchange of calcium from the protein to the solvent. rendering it less susceptible to unfolding. The 50% decrease in cyclization activity of the T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 CGTase compared with that of B. circulans strain 251 appears to be caused by the changes in the conformation and amino acid composition of the 88–95 loop. In the T. thermosulfurigenes EM1 CGTase there is no residue homologous to Tyr89. which was observed to take part in stacking interactions with bound substrate in the case of the B. circulans strain 251 CGTase. The lack of this interaction in the enzyme-substrate complex is expected to destabilize bound substrates prior to cyclization. Apparently. some catalytic functionality of CGTase has been sacrificed for the sake of structural stability by modifying loop regions near the active site. 7 1996 Academic Press Limited,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/191181384.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/191181384.pdf,0,0,0

If one for example reacts the essential His 48 in phospholipase A2 with an acylating reagent such as p-bromophenacyl-bromide all activity is lost. However the activity of phospholipase A2 towards phospholipid micelles depends not only on the integrity of the active site itself. but also on the mobility of parts of the polypeptide chain which do not immediately belong to the active site. This became apparent from a comparison of the structure of native pancreatic phospholipase A2 and its precursor.

The crystals obtained yielded only extremely weak diffraction patterns: the maximal resolution observed was in the best case 6 Å. Electron microscopy of thin sections indicated that most crystals showed lattice defects which might explain the poor diffraction patterns: most surprising was the appearance of large holes interrupting an otherwise regular lattice in one of the crystal forms examined. Our results indicate that transmission electron microscopy is a suitable tool for the inspection of crystals to be used in X-ray crystallography.

The asymmetric addition of ammonia to cinnamic acid and its derivatives catalyzed by phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) is an attractive route to enantiopure aromatic β-amino acids. because the substrates are readily available and PAM exhibits excellent enantioselectivity.[5] However. the final product mixture consists of both α-and β-amino acids owing to low regioselectivity.[6] Although selective separation procedures have been developed.[6] a much better option would be to employ a highly β-regioselective enzyme. Unfortunately. no such enzyme has been discovered to date. Herein we describe the successful alteration of Taxus chinensis PAM into a selective β-lyase through structure-and mechanism-based protein engineering. The activity of PAM relies on the internal cofactor 4-methylideneimidazole-5-one (MIO).[7] The role of MIO has been debated.[8] but most recent evidence. including X-ray structures of aminomutases in complex with substrate analogues.[9] suggests that in the mutase reaction MIO reacts with the amine group of the substrate. Kinetic studies of PAM with different cinnamates indicated that the regioselectivity is dominated by electronic effects.[5c. d] with either the aromatic ring or the …,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/52057134/Wu_12_AngChem_mech_inspired_eng_of_PAM_for_enh_beta_regio.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52057134/Wu_12_AngChem_mech_inspired_eng_of_PAM_for_enh_beta_regio.pdf,0,0,0

99833,from Pseudomonas aeruginosa,,Eswar Reddy Reddem and Bauke W Dijkstra and AndySMark WH Thunnissen,,,,,,Bacterial lytic transglycosylases are peptidoglycanSdegrading enzymes with roles in bacterial cell wall remodeling and turnover during cell growth and division. Here we report the crystal structure of a truncated but active form of the lytic transglycosylase MltF from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (paMltFΔC). which lacks the 29 CSterminal amino acid residues. The structure reveals the presence of two domains. The NSterminal domain has a periplasmic solute binding protein (SBP) fold. which is closely similar to that of SBPs of ABC transporters that bind polar and charged amino acids. although the sequence identity is low (15S24%). Structures of paMltFDC complexed with leucine. isoleucine. valine or cysteine confirm that the NSterminal domain has the ability to bind amino acids. However. only part of the binding interactions typically observed in amino acid specific SBPs is present in the paMltFDC/amino acid structures. and the affinity of paMltFDC for these amino acids is very low. The CSterminal domain of paMltFDC has a lysozymeSlike fold and resembles the catalytic domain found in other lytic transglycosylases. eg Slt70. MltC and MltE. A crystal structure of a ternary complex of paMltFΔC with a small peptidoglycan fragment and the glycopeptide inhibitor bulgecin identifies the interactions relevant for peptidoglycan binding and cleavage. pointing out Glu316 as the general acid/base in the lytic transglycosylase catalytic mechanism.,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC,0,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/26627421/Chapter_3.pdf,,,,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/26627421/Chapter_3.pdf,0,0,0

99836,Trapping the covalent intermediate in an α-retaining glycosyl hydrolase,,JCM Uitdehaag and R Mosi and SG Withers and BW Dijkstra,,,,,,Glycosyl hydrolases are enzymes involved in the processing of oligosaccharides. Despite the many varieties of carbohydrates put to use by Nature the similarity of their chemical building blocks has led to glycosyl hydrolases employing very similar enzymatic mechanisms. The best known glycosyl hydrolase mechanism is that of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). in which two bond cleavage events separated by an intermediate give rise to a product with an anomeric configuration (ie β or α) identical to the substrate. This retaining mechanism has been extrapolated to other glycosyl hydrolases that process either β-glycosidic bonds (β-retainers. like HEWL). or α-glycosidic bonds (α-retainers). eg the α-amylase family of which the enzyme we study. cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is a member.The chemical nature of the intermediate in the lysozyme mechanism is one of the most fascinating controversies in enzymology. Most textbooks claim a charged oxocarbenium ion. stabilized by the carboxylate of a catalytic residue. Alternatively. the intermediate can be covalently bound to that catalytic residue. In the last few years. this latter theory has gained much support by both crystallographic and mass-spectroscopy experiments on different β-retaining enzymes [1. 2].

99843,Structure of quercetinase: a copper containing dioxygenase,,Fabrizia Fusetti and Klaus H Schröter and Roberto Steiner and Tjaard Pijning and Bauke Dijkstra,,,,,,Oxidation reactions in living organisms are catalyzed by several enzymes like oxidases. monooxygenases. dioxygenases and peroxidases which play an important role in the biosynthesis and catabolism of various types of metabolites and in detoxification mechanisms. Dioxygenases catalyze the incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the reaction product while monoxygenases transfer only one oxygen atom and require a hydrogen donor as cofactor. Most of these oxidizing enzymes contain a transition metal ion which activates molecular oxygen and/or the substrate. The elucidation of the catalytic properties of oxygenases is of particular importance since they act as key enzymes in many biological systems involving the oxidation of aromatic compounds. Quercetinase is a copper-dependent dioxygenase capable of transferring both oxygen atoms from a dioxygen molecule to the heterocyclic ring of quercetin (1). The oxygenolysis of 3-hydroxyflavones catalyzed by quercetinase is one of the most studied reactions and it is regarded as a model system for the mechanism of biological oxygenation using copper as a catalytic centre. The enzyme only needs Cu 2+ and O2 for activity. but no external cofactor. The reaction catalyzed by dioxygenases has been proposed to involve a first step in which the activation of the oxygen or the substrate occurs. followed by the formation of a reactive peroxide intermediate which is then transformed into product in the final step. The nature of the peroxide intermediate. the oxygen activation mechanisms and the role of the copper ion are still unclear.

This important role is threatened by the emergence of multiple drug resistant bacteria. Efforts have therefore been made to understand the biosynthetic route of penicillin biosynthesis and the catalytic action of enzymes used in semi-synthetic β-lactam production (eg 1. 2. 3). In our laboratory we have been focussing on structural aspects of two enzymes. which play an important role in the above mentioned processes. The last enzyme in the penicillin biosynthetic route: acyl CoA: isopenicillin N acyltransferase from Penicillium chrysogenum and penicillin G acylase from Escherichia coli.Acyl CoA: isopenicillin N acyltransferase (AT) is responsible for the production of penicillin G. which is used as source for 6-aminopenicillanic acid. the prime building block for semi-synthetic penicillins. AT is translated as an inactive pro-enzyme consisting of a single polypeptide of 40 kDa. The active form of the enzyme. which performs its activity in the microbody of the fungus. is a hetero dimer with subunits of 29 kDa and 11 kDa. An autocatalytic cleavage reaction is responsible for the maturation of the pro-enzyme to the native form. The structure of the pro-enzyme has been solved (Hensgens and Dijkstra. unpublished results) and the research is now focussing on the structure elucidation of the native processed form of AT and of soaking studies with substrates and substrate analogues in the pro-enzyme to detect binding sites.,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC,0,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2000_report/part2/contrib/72/4088.pdf,,,,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2000_report/part2/contrib/72/4088.pdf,0,0,0

Consequently. there is a need for efficient methods to obtain the desired (R) S or (S) Senantiomers in optically pure form. Initially. chiral amines were synthesized either chemically or by chemicalSenzymatic methods. However. fully enzymatic systems offer clear advantages over chemical synthesis. since they are highly enantioselective and regioselective. and produce little waste (Patel. 2000; Pollard & Woodley. 2007; Park et al.. 2012).During the last 15 years transaminases (TAs) have gained considerable attention for the production of various chiral amines. ɑSamino acids. and drugs (Shin & Kim. 1999; Kim et al.. 2007; Yun & Kim. 2008; Savile et al.. 2010; Midelfort et al.. 2013).

99852,Acyl CoA: isopenicillin N acyltransferase; an important enzyme in penicillin biosynthesis which undergoes post-translational processing,,CMH Hensgens and BW Dijkstra,,,,,,The enzyme Acyl CoA: isopenicillin N acyltransferase (AT) is the last enzyme in the biosynthesis route in the fungus Penicillium Chrysogenum which leads to the formation of the βlactam antibiotic penicillin G (Figure 1). The enzyme is functional as a heterodimer with subunits of 29 and 11 kDa in the microbody of the fungus. AT is translated from the mRNA as a single polypeptide which undergoes post-translational processing. This process of post-translational processing is an intermolecular autocatalytic event as is suggested by biochemical data [1. 2]. The enzyme has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli [3]. Apart from the wild-type enzyme also a non-processesable mutant (C103A) has been cloned and overexpressed. The behaviour of the wild-type and the non-processed mutant during protein purification is quite different. in such a way that the mutant is more stable than the wild-type which is notorious of being difficult to purify [eg 4. 5]. This and biochemical data suggest that during the processing of the AT large conformational changes occur in the enzyme with a big role for subunit interactions in the maturation of the enzyme [2]. The nature of the reactions which AT can catalyse also implies that there are multiple bindingsites available within the enzyme for both hydrophobic (phenylacetic acid) and polar residues (α-aminoadipic acid) which makes the formation of penicillin G (a hydrophobic product) from the isopenicillin N (a polar substrate) a very interesting reaction. The object of this research is to clarify the above mentioned conformational changes and to understand how AT is changed from an unprocessed. not active 40 …,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,0,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/1998/part2/contrib/47/px-98-83.pdf,,,,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/1998/part2/contrib/47/px-98-83.pdf,0,0,0
99853,Structure determination of the bacterial lytic transglycosylase Slt35 using wARP,,EJ van Asselt and A Perrakis and KH Kalk and VS Lamzin and BW Dijkstra,,,,,,Lytic transglycosylases are bacterial muramidases that catalyse the cleavage of the β-1. 4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in peptidoglycan. Subsequently. an intramolecular glycosyltransferase reaction takes place. which results in the formation of 1. 6-anhydromuropeptide products. Beside one soluble lytic transglycosylase (Slt70). four membrane-bound lytic transglycosylases (MltA-D) have been identified in Escherichia coli. These Mlt's are attached to the outer membrane via a lipid anchor covalently linked to a cysteine residue at the N-terminal domain of the peptide chain. In MltB. a proteolysis susceptible spacer separates the lipid anchor from the main protein and cleavage of this spacer results in the release of a 36 kDa soluble form of MltB. called Slt35. The primary structure of Slt35 is completely different from Slt70. the only lytic transglycosylase of which an X-ray structure was known so far. Lytic transglycosylases are considered to be potential targets for antibiotics. Inhibition of Slt70 by the glycopeptide bulgecin enhances the letal effect of certain βlactam antibiotics. Slt35 is not inhibited by bulgecin. To increase our knowledge on lytic transglycosylases and to make Slt35 amenable for rational design of inhibitors. a large amount of Slt35 was overexpressed. purified and crystallised to determine its X-ray structure.

99855,S tudies on the Domain Architecture of the Soluble Lytic Transglycosylase of Escherichia coli,,Arnoud J Dijkstra and Andy-Mark HW Thunnissen and Bauke W Dijkstra and Wolfgang Keck,,,,,,Although a large number of enzymes that are involved in the bacterial peptidoglycan metabolism have been identified and their properties have been wellstudied. structural information is lacking for almost all of them. As all these enzymes are potential antibacterial targets. the absence of structural information poses a barrier to the design of new inhibitors. For one of the enzymes that is involved in the hydrolytic part of this metabolism. the structure has recently become available. This enzyme. the 70 kDa soluble lytic transglycosylase (Slt70) of Escherichia coli. is the target of bulgecin. a glycopeptide that has been identified as an enhancer of the effect of certain β-lactam antibiotics. In this study. the structural information on Slt70 is used to get a better insight into the architecture and mechanism of this enzyme. Using site-directed mutagenesis the importance of two active site residues. Glu478 and Glu583. was investigated. Furthermore. it could be shown that the active-site domain of Slt70. which structurally resembles the goose-type lysozymes. cannot be separately expressed in an active form. Therefore an attempt was made to separate an active domain from the native protein by limited proteolysis.The function of the ring-domain of Slt70 and in particular the issue of whether it opens during enzymatic action. was studied by the introduction of two cysteines. These cysteines were introduced at positions that would allow the formation of a disulfide bridge. thereby locking the ring in a closed conformation. The results of this approach indicate that ring-opening is not needed for hydrolase activity.,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC,0,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/14536073/c2.pdf,,,,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/14536073/c2.pdf,0,0,0

This enzyme has been identified as a very reliable marker for the diagnosis of Gaucher disease. a genetic disorder of glucocerebroside metabolism occuring in infancy characterized by mental retardation and very often asymptomatic in early stage (1). Chitotriosidase contains several regions with high homology to those present in chitinases from different species belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 18. Since it displays chitinolytic activity towards chitin (as well as to artificial substrates) it can be considered a chitinase. In various mammals. enzymatically active and inactive members of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases have been identified. In man. chitotriosidase is the functional chitinolytic enzyme. while the homologous human cartilage 39 kDa glycoprotein (HC gp39) does not show chitinolytic activity. and its function is unknown. A single amino acid substitution in chitotriosidase generating a sequence similar to HC gp39 results in the loss of hydrolytic activity (2). Other proteins related to chitinases are the oviductins. They also lack the catalytic residues and they are speculated to cause association of these proteins witht he ovulated oocyte in order to form a protective shield. The physiological role fo chitotriosidase. and of human chitinases in general. is still unknown.

Most of these oxidizing enzymes contain a transition metal ion which activates molecular oxygen and/or the substrate. The elucidation of the catalytic properties of oxygenases is of particular importance since they act as key enzymes in many biological systems involving the oxidation of aromatic compounds.Quercetinase is a copper-dependent dioxygenase capable of transferring both oxygen atoms from a dioxygen molecule to the heterocyclic ring of quercetin (1).

A major constituent of biofilms are extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) synthesized by glucansucrase (GS) enzymes from sucrose (yielding α-glucans). Since sucrose is a relative recent addition to the human diet. the evolutionary origin of GS is intriguing and may help to understand the origin of caries. GS are classified in glycoside hydrolase family 70 (GH70); it has been proposed that they evolved from GH13 α-amylases. If true. evolutionary events would have had to involve changes in reaction-and substrate specificity; however the details of such changes. and which factors would trigger them. are unclear. Interestingly. a GH70 subfamily with 4. 6-α-glucanotransferase (4. 6-α-GTase) activity “intermediate” of α-amylases and GS has been discovered. In this study we provide 3D structural. genomic and phylogenetic data supporting the evolution of α-amylases to GS via 4. 6-α-GTases. The crystal structure of the4. 6-α-GTase GtfB-ΔNΔV from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 reveals how the αamylase substrate binding scaffold is retained. but different enough to favor transglycosylation instead of degradation. It also explains how GS could have evolved further towards sucrose utilization instead of starch. In vivo. 4. 6-α-GTase and GS gene products within the same Lactobacillus strain complement each other in EPS synthesis. depending on the available carbon source.

They catalyze the reversible conversion of a vicinal haloalcohol such as 2. 3-dichloro-1-propanol to its corresponding epoxide by the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of the halogen by the vicinal hydroxyl group. thereby releasing a proton and a halide ion. Substrates include both chlorinated and brominated C2 and C3 alcohols such as 2-chloroethanol. 1. 3-dichloro-2-propanol and 2. 3-dichloro-1-propanol and their brominated analogues. but also aromatic halohydrins such as 1-chloro-2-phenylethanol. The observation that the dehalogenation of chiral halohydrins can proceed with high enantioselectivity. has attracted the broad interest in these enzymes [2]. Furthermore. the enzyme has the ability to use several different nucleophiles in the reverse reaction. the enantioselective ring-opening of epoxides. which include azide and cyanide [3].

They are used for the synthesis of esters and transesterification reactions. and therefore they have become biotechnologically important enzymes used for food refinement. as additives in washing detergents and even as diagnostic enzymes [1]. The lipases used are usually of fungal or bacterial origin. with Pseudomonas being the most important bacterial genus [2]. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of lipases from different Pseudomonas strains suggests the classification of them into three distinct groups [3. 4] based on structural homology and their molecular weights. Amongst these groups. the subgroup II with the 33 kDa Pseudomonas cepacia lipase has intensively been studied in the past with respect to structure/function relationships. Nowadays. the subgroup I of Pseudomonas lipases with its prototype. the 29 kDa Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase (PAL). attracts industrial attention. since the enzyme has a broad substrate specificity accepting triglyceride substrates with fatty acyl chain lengths varying from C6 to C18. and reacts 100% stereoselective for the sn-1 position of the substrate trioctanoin [5].To analyse the enzyme’s conformational properties. 3D models of PAL have been built in the past. based on either the closed conformation of Pseudomonas glumae lipase [6. 7] or the open conformation of Pseudomonas cepacia lipase [8. 9].

We have recently explored a strategy termed FRESCO. which uses computational library design. for rapidly increasing the thermostability of enzymes. It was applied to obtain highly thermostable multi‐site mutants of limonene epoxide hydrolase (LEH)[1] from Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14 [2]. and to obtain thermostable and solvent‐resistant mutants of a haloalkane dehalogenase [3]. LEH catalyzes the enantioconvergent production of (1S. 2S. 4R)‐limonene‐1. 2‐diol [2a. 4] from (4R)‐limonene‐1. 2‐epoxide. Furthermore. the enzyme has been engineered for the enantioselective production of both enantiomers of several other industrially relevant alicyclic diols [5]. Stabilizing mutations of LEH were computationally designed by the FRESCO approach [1]. using the programs Rosetta [6]. FoldX [7]. and Dynamic Disulfide Discovery (DDD)[1]. Promising mutations that were expected to stabilize limonene epoxide hydrolase were screened in a small library. which resulted in the discovery of eleven stabilizing point mutations and ten stabilizing disulfide bonds [1].

These enzymes are present in nearly all organisms where they catalyze essential reactions related to steroid hormone metabolism and xenobiotic biotransformations [1]. Since P450s generally show a broad substrate and reaction specificity. they are considered as powerful ‘green’tools for the synthesis of pharmaceutically and biotechnologically desired compounds. offering an alternative to difficult and environmentally unfriendly chemo-synthetic routes. For such applications. microbial cytochromes P450 are of special interest. as they are generally more soluble and stable than their eukaryotic counterparts. In particular. the potential of microbial P450s to produce pharmaceutically important steroid derivatives is being explored intensively [2-4].Chemical synthesis of steroidal compounds in a regio/stereo-selective manner is challenging and usually requires several steps. limiting cost-effectiveness and final yields.

Levan synthesizing FTFs (levansucrases) have been most extensively investigated. and 3D structures in apo-and substrate-bound form are available. In contrast. inulosucrases. from the same glycoside hydrolase family GH68. have received much less attention. and the molecular basis of their different product specificity is not fully understood.We have elucidated the first 3D structure of an inulosucrase. InuJ of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533. which produces prebiotic β-2. 1 linked fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin polymer. A truncated form of the enzyme (InuJ145-708His) was crystallized. and its structure was determined at 1.75 Å resolution. The structure shows the typical five-fold βpropeller topology of the catalytic core domain (residues 210-662) present in levansucrases. High structural conservation is observed for the fructosyl binding pocket (subsite-1). The structure of an inactive nucleophilic mutant (D272N) with a bound ethylene glycolfructoside shows how the sugar unit in the terminal acceptor binding site (subsite+ 1) adopts a different orientation compared to that in levansucrase.,True,u0cOVgEAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/14663063/04_c4.pdf,,,,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/14663063/04_c4.pdf,0,0,0

Using biochemical and proteomic approaches. we have found that Vpx protein of the pathogenic SIVmac 239 strain associates with a ternary protein complex comprising DDB1 and VprBP subunits of Cullin 4–based E3 ubiquitin ligase. and DDA1. which has been implicated in the regulation of E3 catalytic activity. and that Vpx participates in the Cullin 4 E3 complex comprising VprBP. We further demonstrate that the ability of SIVmac as well as HIV-2 Vpx to interact with VprBP and its associated Cullin 4 complex is required for efficient reverse transcription of SIVmac RNA genome in primary macrophages. Strikingly. macrophages in which VprBP levels are depleted by RNA interference resist SIVmac infection. Thus. our observations reveal that Vpx interacts with both catalytic and regulatory components of the ubiquitin proteasome system and demonstrate that these interactions are critical for Vpx ability to enable efficient SIVmac replication in primary macrophages. Furthermore. they identify VprBP/DCAF1 substrate receptor for Cullin 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and its associated protein complex as immediate downstream effector of Vpx for this function. Together. our findings suggest a model in which Vpx usurps VprBP-associated Cullin 4 ubiquitin ligase to enable efficient reverse …,True,DmRJGiMAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,229,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000059,2694551995681054885,/scholar?cites=2694551995681054885,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000059,0,0,0

We have discovered an E3 ubiquitin ligase. called Psh1. which controls the cellular level of Cse4 via ubiquitylation and proteolysis. The activity of Psh1 is dependent on both its RING and zinc finger domains. We demonstrate the specificity of the ubiquitylation activity of Psh1 toward Cse4 in vitro and map the sites of ubiquitylation. Mutation of key lysines prevents ubiquitylation of Cse4 by Psh1 in vitro and stabilizes Cse4 in vivo.

Yet. there are instances when application of a non-specific protease is desirable to obtain sufficient sequence coverage of otherwise poorly accessible proteins or structural domains. Using the non-specific protease. proteinase K. we analyzed Saccharomyces cerevisiae preparations grown in 14N rich media and 15N minimal media and obtained relative quantitation from the dataset using normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAFs). A critical step in using a spectral counting based approach for quantitative proteomics is ensuring the inclusion of high quality spectra in the dataset. One way to do this is to minimize the false discovery rate. which can be accomplished by applying different filters to a searched dataset.

The absence of a tight regulatory network for transcription in the human malaria parasite suggests that gene expression may largely be controlled at post-transcriptional and translational levels. In this study. we compare steady-state mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA levels of Plasmodium falciparum at different time points during its asexual cell cycle. For more than 30% of its genes. we observe a delay in peak transcript abundance in the polysomal fraction as compared to the steady-state mRNA fraction. suggestive of strong translational control. Our data show that key regulatory mechanisms could include inhibitory activity of upstream open reading frames and translational repression of the major virulence gene family by intronic transcripts. In addition. we observe polysomal mRNA-specific alternative splicing events and widespread transcription of non-coding transcripts.

However. the mechanisms by which a meiotic cell can arrest for long periods of time (decades in human females) have remained a mystery. The Drosophila Matrimony (Mtrm) protein is expressed from the end of pachytene until the completion of meiosis I. Loss-of-function mtrm mutants result in precocious NEB. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that Mtrm physically interacts with Polo kinase (Polo) in vivo. and multidimensional protein identification technology mass spectrometry analysis reveals that Mtrm binds to Polo with an approximate stoichiometry of 1:1. Mutation of a Polo-Box Domain (PBD) binding site in Mtrm ablates the function of Mtrm and the physical interaction of Mtrm with Polo. The meiotic defects observed in mtrm/+ heterozygotes are fully suppressed by reducing the dose of polo+. demonstrating that Mtrm acts as an inhibitor of Polo. Mtrm acts as a negative regulator of Polo during the later stages of G2 arrest. Indeed. both the repression of Polo expression until stage 11 and the inactivation of newly synthesized Polo by Mtrm until stage 13 play critical roles in maintaining and properly terminating G2 arrest.

In Drosophila. the amyloidogenic (prion-like) state of the RNA binding protein Orb2 has been implicated in long-term memory. but how conformational conversion of Orb2 promotes memory formation is unclear. Combining in vitro and in vivo studies. we find that the monomeric form of Orb2 represses translation and removes mRNA poly(A) tails. while the oligomeric form enhances translation and elongates the poly(A) tails and imparts its translational state to the monomer. The CG13928 protein. which binds only to monomeric Orb2. promotes deadenylation. whereas the putative poly(A) binding protein CG4612 promotes oligomeric Orb2-dependent translation.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A fraction derived from presynaptic specializations (presynaptic particle fraction; PPF) can be separated from postsynaptic densities (PSD) by adjusting the pH of Triton X‐100 (TX‐100) extraction of isolated transsynaptic scaffolds. Solubilization of the PPF corresponds to disruption of the presynaptic specialization. We show that the PPF is insoluble to repeated TX‐100 extraction at pH 6.0 but becomes soluble in detergent at pH 8.0. By immunolocalization. we find that the major proteins of the PPF. clathrin and dynamin. are concentrated in the presynaptic compartment. By using multidimensional protein identification technology. we compared the protein compositions of the PPF and the PSD fraction.

RNAs. proteins. and viruses. towards microtubule minus ends. To understand how a single motor achieves cargo specificity. we identified the human dynein interactome by attaching a promiscuous biotin ligase (‘BioID’) to seven components of the dynein machinery. including a subunit of the essential cofactor dynactin. This method reported spatial information about the large cytosolic dynein/dynactin complex in living cells. To achieve maximal motile activity and to bind its cargos. human dynein/dynactin requires ‘activators’. of which only five have been described. We developed methods to identify new activators in our BioID data. and discovered that ninein and ninein-like are a new family of dynein activators. Analysis of the protein interactomes for six activators. including ninein and ninein-like. suggests that each dynein activator has multiple cargos.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28257.001,True,DmRJGiMAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,60,https://elifesciences.org/articles/28257,7749670677491964894,/scholar?cites=7749670677491964894,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/28257.pdf,0,0,0

The presence of several oxidoreduction centers in the same molecule raises the question of their coupling. To investigate this mechanism. four single mutations were introduced in cytochrome c3 by site-directed mutagenesis. leading to the replacement of each histidine. the sixth axial ligand of the heme iron atom. by a methionine residue. Characterization of the new set of molecules using biochemical and biophysical techniques was carried out. The novel methionine was correctly coordinated to the iron atom of hemes 3 and 4 in H25M and H70M cytochromes c3. respectively. and this coordination induced a large increase in the oxidoreduction potential of the mutated heme. In contrast. in the case of H22M and H35M cytochromes c3. in which the corresponding …,True,DmRJGiMAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC,59,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817373775,11465223974566311687,/scholar?cites=11465223974566311687,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817373775,0,0,0

Over the years. it has become apparent that Plasmodium falciparum exerts limited transcriptional control of gene expression. while at least part of Plasmodium’s genome is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. To generate insights into the mechanisms that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. we undertook complementary computational. comparative genomics. and experimental approaches to identify and characterize mRNA-binding proteins (mRBPs) in P. falciparum. Close to 1000 RNA-binding proteins are identified by hidden Markov model searches. of which mRBPs encompass a relatively large proportion of the parasite proteome as compared to other eukaryotes. Several abundant mRNA-binding domains are enriched in apicomplexan parasites. while strong depletion of mRNA-binding domains involved in RNA degradation is observed. Next. we experimentally capture 199 proteins that interact with mRNA during the blood stages. 64 of which with high confidence. These captured mRBPs show a significant overlap with the in silico identified candidate RBPs (p < 0.0001). Among the experimentally validated mRBPs are many known translational regulators active in other stages of the parasite’s life cycle. such as DOZI. CITH. PfCELF2. Musashi. and PfAlba1–4. Finally. we also detect several proteins with an RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexans (RAP domain) that is almost exclusively found in apicomplexan parasites.

Recombination in meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae relies on two Escherichia coli recA homologs. Rad51 and Dmc1. as well as the more recently discovered heterodimer Mnd1/Hop2.

It functions to alter nucleosome positions by either sliding nucleosomes on DNA or evicting histones. Interestingly. 20% of all human cancers carry mutations in subunits of the Swi/Snf complex. Many of these mutations cause protein instability and loss. resulting in partial Swi/Snf complexes. Although several studies have shown that histone acetylation and activator-dependent recruitment of Swi/Snf regulate its function. it is less well understood how subunits regulate stability and function of the complex. Using functional proteomic and genomic approaches. we have assembled the network architecture of yeast Swi/Snf.

COMPASS can mono-. di-. and trimethylate H3K4. but transitioning to di- and trimethylation requires prior H2B monoubiquitination followed by recruitment of the Cps35 (Swd2) subunit of COMPASS. Another subunit. Cps40 (Spp1). interacts directly with Set1 and is only required for transitioning to trimethylation. To investigate how the Set1 and COMPASS subunits establish the methylation states of H3K4. we generated a homology model of the catalytic domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast Set1 and identified several key residues within the Set1 catalytic pocket that are capable of regulating COMPASS9s activity.
