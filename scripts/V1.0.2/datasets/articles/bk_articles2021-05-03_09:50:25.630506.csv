These images are provided by the novel 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF) camera which has been implemented in our research center (ZESS). Using modulated infrared lighting. this camera generates an intensity image with the range information for each pixel of a Photonic Mixer Device (PMD) sensor. The intensity and range data are fused to be used as the input information for the segmentation algorithm. Our proposed segmentation technique is based on the combination of two unsupervised clustering approaches: K-Means and Expectation Maximization (EM).

Vision based techniques are usually used to provide such a system. This paper presents a new solution using 2D/3D images for real time hand detection. tracking and classification which is used as an interface for sending the commands to an industrial robot. 2D/3D images. including low resolution range data and high resolution color information. are provided by a novel monocular hybrid vision system. called MultiCam. at video frame rates. After region extraction and applying some preprocessing techniques. the range data are segmented using an unsupervised clustering approach. The segmented range image is then mapped to the corresponding 2D color image. Due to the monocular setup of the vision system. mapping 3D range data to the 2D color information is trivial and does not need any complicated calibration and registration techniques. Consequently. the segmentation of 2D color image becomes simple and fast. Haar-like features are then extracted from the segmented color image and used as the input features for an AdaBoost classifier to find the region of the hand in the image and track it in each frame. The hand region found by AdaBoost is improved through postprocessing techniques and finally the hand posture (palm and fist) is classified based on a very fast heuristic method.

In this paper previous approaches towards background modeling are extended to handle videos accompanied by information gained from a novel 2D/3D camera. This camera contains a color and a PMD chip which operates on the Time-of-Flight operating principle. The background is estimated using the widely spread Gaussian mixture model in color as well as in depth and amplitude modulation. A new matching function is presented that allows for better treatment of shadows and noise and reduces block artifacts.

However. there is also a need for developing techniques to identify general content-preserved manipulations. which are employed to conceal tampering trails frequently.

The probability of zero values on the first order difference map in texture regions can serve as MF statistical fingerprint. which distinguishes MF from other operations.

Gradient aberration of the gray histogram generated from unsaturated luminance regions of an image. is measured and employed to capture trails of sharpening operation. Ringing artifacts around step edges are exploited to provide another complementary clue. especially useful when the histogram-based features are not available.

It is urgent and significant to assess the reliability of such techniques applied in practical scenarios. In this paper. we investigate the security of existing digital image contrast enhancement (CE) forensic algorithms. From the standpoint of attackers. we propose two types of attacks. CE trace hiding attack and CE trace forging attack. which could invalidate the forensic detector and fabricate two types of forensic errors. respectively. The CE trace hiding attack is implemented by integrating local random dithering into the design of pixel value mapping. The CE trace forging attack is proposed by modifying the gray level histogram of a target pixel region to counterfeit peak/gap artifacts. Such trace forging attack is typically applied to create sophisticated composite images which could deceive the prior CE-based …,True,Q-6PRPcAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC,17,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11432-013-4928-0.pdf,6526456762747056852,/scholar?cites=6526456762747056852,,,http://mepro.bjtu.edu.cn/res/papers/2014/Attacking%20contrast%20enhancement%20forensics%20in%20digital%20images.pdf,0,0,0

Instead of commonly used Harris detector or Mexican hat wavelet method. a more robust corner detector named multi-scale curvature product (MSCP) is adopted to extract salient features in this paper. Based on such features. disk-like GIRs are found. which consists of three steps. First. robust edge contours are extracted. Then. MSCP is utilized to detect the centers for GIRs. Third. the characteristic scale selection is performed to calculate the radius of each GIR.

Thus. the contribution of longitudinal velocity gradients remains understudied. In this work. we propose a 3D finite-element method for the quantification of WSS and OSI from 3D-CINE PC-MRI that accounts for both in-plane and longitudinal velocity gradients. We demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the method on cylindrical geometries using a synthetic phantom based on the Poiseuille flow equation. We also show that. in the presence of noise. the method is both stable and accurate.

The present study proposes a new method for real-time pattern classification and neurofeedback of brain states from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. It involves the creation of a fused classification model based on the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) from data of several healthy individuals. The subject-independent model is then used to classify EEG data in real-time and provide feedback to new individuals. In a series of offline experiments involving training and testing of the classifier with individual data from 27 healthy subjects. a mean classification accuracy of 75.30% was achieved. demonstrating that the classification system at hand can reliably decode two types of imagery used in our experiments. i.e. happy emotional imagery and motor imagery. In a subsequent experiment it is shown that the classifier can be used to provide neurofeedback to new subjects. and that these subjects learn to “match” their brain pattern to that of the fused classification model in a few days of neurofeedback training. This finding can have important implications for future studies on neurofeedback and its clinical applications on neuropsychiatric disorders.,True,TCz_FngAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,31,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00269/full,5216976649434118519,/scholar?cites=5216976649434118519,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00269/full,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The classic paradigm for MRI requires a homogeneous B0 field in combination with linear encoding gradients. Distortions are produced when the B0 is not homogeneous. and several postprocessing techniques have been developed to correct them. Field homogeneity is difficult to achieve. particularly for short‐bore magnets and higher B0 fields. Nonlinear magnetic components can also arise from concomitant fields. particularly in low‐field imaging. or intentionally used for nonlinear encoding. In any of these situations. the second‐order component is key. because it constitutes the first step to approximate higher‐order fields. We propose to use the fractional Fourier transform for analyzing and reconstructing the object's magnetization under the presence of quadratic fields.

Our algorithm consists of two modes: detection and tracking. In the detection mode. background motion is estimated and compensated using an affine transformation. The resultant motionrectified image is used for detection of the target location using split and merge algorithm. We also checked other features for precise detection of the target location. When the target is identified. algorithm switches to the tracking mode. Modified Moravec operator is applied to the target to identify feature points. The feature points are matched with points in the region of interest in the current frame. The corresponding points are further refined using disparity vectors. The tracking system is capable of target shape recovery and therefore it can successfully track targets with varying distance from camera or while the camera is zooming. Local and regional computations have made the algorithm suitable for real-time applications. The refined points define the new position of the target in the current frame.

The cluster serves a variety range of services from Web Service to File Service. Some of them are CPU-Intensive while others are RAM-Intensive and so on. Virtualization has many advantages such as less hardware cost. cooling cost. more manageability. One of the key benefits is better load balancing by using of VM migration between hosts. To migrate. we must know which virtual machine needs to be migrated and when this relocation has to be done and. moreover. which host must be destined. To relocate VMs from overloaded servers to underloaded ones. we need to sort nodes from the highest volume to the lowest. There are some models to finding the most overloaded node. but they have some shortcomings. The focus of this paper is to present a new method to migrate VMs between cluster nodes using TOPSIS algorithm-one of the most efficient Multi Criteria Decision Making techniques-to make more effective decision over whole active servers of the Cluster and find the most loaded serversTo evaluate the performance improvement resulted from this model. we used cluster Response time and Unbalanced Factor.,True,dE_BwesAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,68,https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3329,15676204413591756179,/scholar?cites=15676204413591756179,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3329,0,0,0

This increasing trend continues as dynamic contents are changing traditional web environments. Increasing utilization of cluster web servers through effective and fair load balancing is a crucial task specifically when it comes to advent of dynamic contents and database-driven applications on the internet. The proposed load-balancing algorithm classifies requests into different classes. The algorithm dynamically selects a request from a class and assigns the request to a server. For both the scheduling and dispatching. new probabilistic algorithms are proposed. To avoid using unreliable measured utilization in the face of fluctuating loads the proposed load-balancing algorithm benefits from a queuing model to predict the utilization of each server.

The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). its ligand transforming growth factor-α (TGF α). the downstream enzyme phospholipaseC-γ (PLC γ) and a mitosis-associated response pathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGF α secretion. and the EGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers. as well as modulated by an extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action kinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment. we analyse both the emergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell …,True,Volq2gEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,123,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304004977,10881591636135444219,/scholar?cites=10881591636135444219,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0408001,0,0,0
1283462,The effects of EGF-receptor density on multiscale tumor growth patterns,2006,Chaitanya A Athale and Thomas S Deisboeck,238,Journal of theoretical biology,4,771-779,Academic Press,We studied the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) density on tumor growth dynamics. both on the sub- and the multi-cellular level using our previously developed model. This algorithm simulates the growth of a brain tumor using a multi-scale two-dimensional agent-based approach with an integrated transforming growth factor α (TGFα) induced EGFR-gene–protein interaction network. The results confirm that increasing cell receptor density correlates with an acceleration of the tumor system's spatio-temporal expansion dynamics. This multicellular behavior cannot be explained solely on the basis of spatial sub-cellular dynamics. which remain qualitatively similar amongst the three glioma cell lines investigated here in silico. Rather. we find that cells with higher EGFR density show an early increase in the phenotypic switching activity between proliferative and migratory traits. linked to a higher level of …,True,Volq2gEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,91,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519305002870,18349615072243005641,/scholar?cites=18349615072243005641,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0502002,0,0,0

We measured the spatial distribution of microtubule aster asymmetry around chromosomes by incubating centrosomes and micropatterned chromatin patches in frog egg extracts. We then screened for microtubule stabilization gradient shapes that would generate such spatial distributions with the use of computer simulations. Only a long-range. sharply decaying microtubule stabilization gradient could generate aster asymmetries fitting the experimental data.

Here. we estimate the effect of Escherichia coli growth rate (r) on population cell size distributions by estimating the coefficient of variation of cell lengths (CVL) from image analysis of fixed cells in DIC microscopy. We find that the CVL is constant at growth rates less than one division per hour. whereas above this threshold. CVL increases with an increase in the growth rate. We hypothesize that stochastic inhibition of cell division owing to replication stalling by a RecA-dependent mechanism. combined with the growth rate threshold of multi-fork replication (according to Cooper and Helmstetter). could form the basis of such a threshold effect. We proceed to test our hypothesis by increasing the frequency of stochastic stalling of replication forks with hydroxyurea (HU) treatment and find that cell length variability increases only when the growth rate …,True,Volq2gEAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C,27,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsos.160417,18093819179642478161,/scholar?cites=18093819179642478161,,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.160417,0,0,0

Aster motility and dynamics is vital for genome stability. cell division. polarization and differentiation. Asters move either toward the cell center or away from it. Here. we focus on the centering mechanism in a membrane independent system of Xenopus cytoplasmic egg extracts. Using live microscopy and single particle tracking. we find that asters move toward chromatinized DNA structures. The velocity and directionality profiles suggest a random-walk with drift directed toward DNA. We have developed a theoretical model that can explain this movement as a result of a gradient of MT length dynamics and MT gliding on immobilized dynein motors.

In bacteria like Escherichia coli. the machinery that determines cell length is complex and interconnected. spanning extracellular cues. biosynthesis and cell division. Few tools exist to study cell lengths in a population. We have developed and tested three automated image analysis routines on growing E.coli cultures to simultaneously measure cell lengths and nucleoid numbers in populations of bacteria. We find population profiles changing with culture density—higher density of culture leads to fewer long cells. Additionally. lab strains mutant for recA show a correlation between the number of nucleoids and cell length.

These iterative algorithms can be useful in variational approaches to image deblurring that lead to minimized convex nonlinear functions subject to non-negativity constraints and. in some cases. to an additional flux conservation constraint. A special gradient projection method is introduced that exploits effective scaling strategies and steplength updating rules. appropriately designed for improving the convergence rate.

Some of them. such as total variation (TV) and wavelet thresholding. are based on the assumption of additive Gaussian noise. Recently the TV approach has been extended to the case of Poisson noise. a model describing the effect of photon counting in applications such as emission tomography. microscopy and astronomy. For the removal of this kind of noise we consider an approach based on a constrained optimization problem. with an objective function describing TV and other edge-preserving regularizations of the Kullback–Leibler divergence.

Fluctuations in the emission-counting process can be described by modeling the data as realizations of Poisson random variables (Poisson data). A maximum-likelihood approach for image reconstruction from Poisson data was proposed in the mid-1980s. Since the consequent maximization problem is. in general. ill-conditioned. various kinds of regularizations were introduced in the framework of the so-called Bayesian paradigm. A modification of the well-known Tikhonov regularization strategy results in the data-fidelity function being a generalized Kullback–Leibler divergence.

The level of detail in the map allows docking of the tubulin structure previously determined by electron crystallography. with very strong constraints. providing several important insights not previously available through docking tubulin into lower-resolution maps. This work provides an improved picture of the interactions between adjacent protofilaments. which are responsible for microtubule stability. and also suggests that some structural features are different in microtubules from those in the zinc sheets with which the tubulin structure was determined.,True,nt3AiE8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,460,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212602008274,2564711658543406310,/scholar?cites=2564711658543406310,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212602008274,0,0,0
1283504,Automatic particle detection in electron microscopy,2001,William V Nicholson and Robert M Glaeser,133,,2-3,90-101,Academic Press,Advances in cryoEM and single-particle reconstruction have led to results at increasingly high resolutions. However. to sustain continuing improvements in resolution it will be necessary to increase the number of particles included in performing the reconstructions. Manual selection of particles. even when assisted by computer preselection. is a bottleneck that will become significant as single-particle reconstructions are scaled up to achieve near-atomic resolutions. This review describes various approaches that have been developed to address the problem of automatic particle selection. The principal conclusions that have been drawn from the results so far are: (1) cross-correlation with a reference image (“matched filtering”) is an effective way to identify candidate particles. but it is inherently unable to avoid also selecting false particles; (2) false positives can be eliminated efficiently on the basis of estimates of …,True,nt3AiE8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,128,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847701943485,16019864002746218085,/scholar?cites=16019864002746218085,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.443.1536&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1283523,A multiresolution directional filter bank for image applications,2004,Truong T Nguyen and Soontorn Oraintara,3,,,iii-37,IEEE,We propose a new formulation of directional filter banks (DFBs). By using a non-uniform and non-separable filter bank. a critically sampled multiresolution directional image representation can be obtained efficiently. The resulting DFB yields non-uniform frequency division which is composed of one lowpass channel with a decimation factor of one-fourth and six highpass directional channels with a decimation factor of one-eighth. It overcomes the limited directional selectivity of separable wavelets and the limited resolution of the conventional DFB.

These rates represent a major technical challenge for ultrasound systems because a compromise between spatial and temporal resolution must be made in conventional approaches. Consequently. ultrasound scanners can either provide full quantitative Doppler information on a limited sample volume (spectral Doppler). or averaged Doppler velocity and/or power estimation on a large region of interest (Doppler flow imaging). In this work. we investigate a different strategy for acquiring Doppler information that can overcome the limitations of the existing Doppler modes by significantly reducing the required acquisition time. This technique is called ultrafast compound Doppler imaging and is based on the following concept: instead of successively insonifying the medium with focused beams. several …,True,hkE9KxwAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC,340,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5688407/,401586055170778192,/scholar?cites=401586055170778192,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44998921/Ultrafast_Compound_Doppler_Imaging_Provi20160422-30574-1hqeiwi.pdf,0,0,0

Ultrasound-based temperature imaging recently was proposed as a means to measure noninvasively the deposition of heat by tracking the echo arrival time shifts in the ultrasound backscatter caused by changes in speed of sound and tissue thermal expansion. However. the clinical applicability of these techniques has been hampered by the two-dimensional (2-D) nature of traditional ultrasound imaging. and the complexity of the temperature dependence of sound speed for biological tissues.

Characterization of the level of red blood cell (RBC) aggregation is one of the proposed application. In the current paper. it is hypothesized that the microstructure of the RBCs is a main determinant of the US backscattered power. A simulation model was developed to study the effect of various RBC configurations on the backscattered power. It is an iterative dynamical model that considers the effect of the adhesive and repulsive forces between RBCs. and the effect of the flow. The method is shown to be efficient to model polydispersity in size. shape. and orientation of the aggregates due to the flow. and to relate these variations to the US backscattering properties.

However. the relation that exists among the variables describing the aggregation level and the backscattering coefficient needs to be better clarified. To achieve this purpose. a three-dimensional random model. the Neyman–Scott point process. is proposed to simulate red cell clustering in aggregative conditions at a low hematocrit (H<5%). The frequency dependence of the backscattering coefficient of blood. in non-Rayleigh conditions. is analytically derived from the model. as a function of the size distribution of the aggregates and of their mass fractal dimension.

The formation of red blood cell (RBC) aggregates that also alters blood viscosity is the microscopic mechanism explaining this acoustical phenomenon. In this study.

The vena contracta corresponds to the location where the cross-sectional area of the flow jet is minimal. The maximal transvalvular pressure gradient (TPGmax) is the difference between the static pressure in the left ventricle and that in the vena contracta. TPGmax is highly time-dependent over systole and is known to depend upon the transvalvular flow rate. the effective orifice area (EOA) of the aortic valve and the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract. However. it is still unclear how these parameters modify the TPGmax waveform. We thus derived an explicit analytical model to describe the instantaneous TPGmax across the aortic valve during systole.

By assuming the first-order Born approximation and by modeling the shape of a RBC by a realistic biconcave volume. different scattering behaviors were identified for increasing frequencies. For frequencies below 18MHz. a RBC can be considered a Rayleigh scatterer. For frequencies less than 39MHz. the general concept of acoustic inertia tensor is introduced to describe the variation of the BCS with the frequency and the incidence direction. For frequencies below 90MHz. ultrasound backscattering by a RBC is equivalent to backscattering by a cylinder of height 2μm and diameter 7.8μm.

However. it suffers a major drawback: the high memory and time complexity of the training which constrains the application of SVM to large size classification tasks. To accelerate the SVM training. a new ensemble margin-based data selection approach is proposed. It relies on a simple and efficient heuristic to provide support vector candidates: selecting lowest margin instances. This technique significantly reduces the SVM training task complexity while maintaining the accuracy of the SVM classification.

In addition to multi-echo laser scanner systems. full-waveform systems are able to record the whole backscattered signal for each emitted laser pulse. These data provide more information about the structure and the physical properties of the surface. This paper is focused on the classification of full-waveform lidar and airborne image data on urban scenes. Random forests are used since they provide an accurate classification and run efficiently on large datasets. Moreover. they provide measures of variable importance for each class. This is crucial to analyze the relevance of each feature for the classification of urban scenes. Random Forests provide more accurate results than Support Vector Machines with an overall accuracy of 95.75%.

The codebook mapping represents the internal relationship between low-and high-frequency image components. and is used for the estimation of highfrequency image components lost in the sampling process. In the proposed method. codebooks are first generated by the low-and high-frequency image components of the original image itself that is to be processed.

However. color information cannot always be perceived uniformly by all people. People with a color vision deficiency. such as dichromacy. cannot recognize and distinguish certain color combinations.

The estimation of high-frequency image components is performed by a codebook built by a decomposition of the given image. i.e. a self-decomposed codebook.

As a distance measure for matching from the codebook. we employ the Mahalanobis distance which is a local distance measure incorporating pixel correlation.

DRAM chips become more vulnerable to disturbance. a phenomenon in which different DRAM cells interfere with each other's operation. For the first time in academic literature. our ISCA paper exposes the existence of disturbance errors in commodity DRAM chips that are sold and used today. We show that repeatedly reading from the same address could corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically: When a DRAM row is opened (ie. activated) and closed (ie. precharged) repeatedly (ie. hammered). it can induce disturbance errors in adjacent DRAM rows. This failure mode is popularly called RowHammer. We tested 129 DRAM modules manufactured within the past six years (2008-2014) and found 110 of them to exhibit RowHammer disturbance errors. the earliest of which dates back to 2010. In particular. all modules from the past two years (2012-2013) were vulnerable. which implies that the errors are a recent phenomenon affecting more advanced generations of process technology. Importantly. disturbance errors pose an easily-exploitable security threat since they are a breach of memory protection. wherein accesses to one page (mapped to one row) modifies the data stored in another page (mapped to an adjacent row).,True,9KRcr3QAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,13,https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00747,12999580534155315755,/scholar?cites=12999580534155315755,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00747,0,0,0

Here. we propose a key generation algorithm and a double image encryption scheme with combined compression and encryption.

1284985,Efficient and secure routing protocol for wireless sensor networks through optimal power control and optimal handoff-based recovery mechanism,2012,Subramanian Ganesh and Ramachandran Amutha,2012,Journal of Computer Networks and Communications,,,Hindawi,Advances in wireless sensor network (WSN) technology have provided the availability of small and low-cost sensor with capability of sensing various types of physical and environmental conditions. data processing. and wireless communication. In WSN. the sensor nodes have a limited transmission range. and their processing and storage capabilities as well as their energy resources are also limited. Modified triple umpiring system (MTUS) has already proved its better performance in Wireless Sensor Networks. In this paper. we extended the MTUS by incorporating optimal signal to noise ratio (SNR)-based power control mechanism and optimal handoff-based self-recovery features to form an efficient and secure routing for WSN.

To ensure confidentiality. authenticated encryption supplies legal validity for the image data. We propose a novel modified logistic map with an expanded key space. an integer-based key generation algorithm and an authenticated image encryption algorithm for block ciphers using a modified logistic map and a butterfly-like structure. The key that is used to encrypt images also aids in detecting content tampering of the images. The performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed encryption method is fast and invulnerable to attacks and has a large key space.

Site-specific weed management is a promising way to reach this objective but requires efficient weed detection methods. In this paper. an automatic image processing has been developed to discriminate between crop and weed pixels combining spatial and spectral information extracted from four-band multispectral images. Image data was captured at 3 m above ground. with a camera (multiSPEC 4C. AIRINOV. Paris) mounted on a pole kept manually. For each image. the field of view was approximately 4 m× 3 m and the resolution was 6 mm/pix. The row crop arrangement was first used to discriminate between some crop and weed pixels depending on their location inside or outside of crop rows. Then. these pixels were used to automatically build the training dataset concerning the multispectral features of crop and weed pixel classes. For each image. a specific training dataset was used by a supervised classifier (Support Vector Machine) to classify pixels that cannot be correctly discriminated using only the initial spatial approach. Finally. inter-row pixels were classified as weed and in-row pixels were classified as crop or weed depending on their spectral characteristics. The method was assessed on 14 images captured on maize and sugar beet fields. The contribution of the spatial. spectral and combined information was studied with respect to the classification quality.

An alternative approach consists of measuring the initial conditions of the ballistic flight of the fertiliser particles as they leave the disc. thus avoiding the use of on-spinner dynamic models. Measurement methods need to be developed to determine the outlet velocity vector of the particles in three dimensions. Using kinematic analysis of the mechanical system. this paper establishes that the three-dimensional velocity components of the particles are functions of the horizontal outlet angle. the disc configuration and the rotational speed.

In Europe. over 90% of fertilizer is distributed using spinning disc spreaders. The popularity of spinning disc spreaders lies with their relative low cost. However. the performance of these machines is highly dependent on the particle properties (e.g. friction coefficients. shape). This results in large differences in spread patterns depending on the fertilizer type as well as the prevailing weather conditions (e.g. air humidity).

First. to reduce the number of region of interests (ROIs) and the computation time. the lung regions of the CTs were segmented using Genetic Cellular Neural Networks (G-CNN). Then. for each lung region. ROIs were specified with using the 8 directional search;+ 1 or-1 values were assigned to each voxel. The 3D ROI image was obtained by combining all the 2-Dimensional (2D) ROI images. A 3D template was created to find the nodule-like structures on the 3D ROI image.

Activation of SFKs requires depletion of tyrosine phosphatases from the area of particle engagement. We investigated how the major phosphatase CD45 is excluded from contact sites. using single-molecule tracking. The mobility of CD45 increased markedly upon engagement of Fcγ receptors. While individual CD45 molecules moved randomly. they were displaced from the advancing phagocytic cup by an expanding diffusional barrier. By micropatterning IgG. the ligand of Fcγ receptors. we found that the barrier extended well beyond the perimeter of the receptor-ligand engagement zone.

Particle trajectories are the result of multiple phenomena. and new methods for revealing changes in molecular processes are needed. We have developed a practical technique that is capable of identifying multiple states of diffusion within experimental trajectories. We model single particle tracks for a membrane-associated protein interacting with a homogeneously distributed binding partner and show that. with certain simplifying assumptions. particle trajectories can be regarded as the outcome of a two-state hidden Markov model. Using simulated trajectories. we demonstrate that this model can be used to identify the key biophysical parameters for such a system. namely the diffusion coefficients of the underlying states. and the rates of transition between them. We use a stochastic optimization scheme to compute maximum likelihood estimates of these parameters. We have applied this analysis to single-particle trajectories of the integrin receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on live T cells.

We show that the Toll-like receptor ligands lipopolysaccharide and CpG DNA. which are conserved microbial molecules. enhance signalling by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) by activating the actin-severing protein cofilin. Single-particle tracking reveals that increased severing of actin filaments reduces the spatial confinement of the BCR within the plasma membrane and increases BCR mobility. This allows more frequent collisions between BCRs and greater signalling in response to low densities of membrane-bound antigen.

These antigenic molecules are presented among thousands of chemically similar endogenous peptides. raising the question of how T cells can reliably make a decision to respond to certain antigens but not others within minutes of encountering an antigen presenting cell. In this theoretical study. we investigate the role of localized rebinding between a T cell receptor and an antigen. We show that by allowing the signaling state of individual receptors to persist during brief unbinding events. T cells are able to discriminate antigens based on both their unbinding and rebinding rates. We demonstrate that T cell receptor coreceptors. but not receptor clustering. are important in promoting localized rebinding. and show that requiring rebinding for productive signaling reduces signals from a high concentration of endogenous pMHC. In developing our main results. we use a relatively simple model based on kinetic proofreading.

Using conditional mutants to alter the tensile force on MTJs. we found that the proportion of IAC components undergoing turnover inversely correlated with the force applied on MTJs.

Targeting of PRC1 to chromatin is thought to be mediated by the Cbx family proteins (Cbx2/4/6/7/8) binding to histone H3 with a K27me3 modification (H3K27me3). Despite this prevailing view. the molecular mechanisms of targeting remain poorly understood. Here. by combining live-cell single-molecule tracking (SMT) and genetic engineering. we reveal that H3K27me3 contributes significantly to the targeting of Cbx7 and Cbx8 to chromatin. but less to Cbx2. Cbx4. and Cbx6. Genetic disruption of the complex formation of PRC1 facilitates the targeting of Cbx7 to chromatin. Biochemical analyses uncover that the CD and AT-hook-like (ATL) motif of Cbx7 constitute a functional DNA-binding unit. Live-cell SMT of Cbx7 mutants demonstrates that Cbx7 is targeted to chromatin by co-recognizing of H3K27me3 and DNA.

During the pursuit of reward. critical associations are formed between the reward and cues that predict its availability. Conditioned by these experiences. dopamine neurons begin to fire upon the earliest presentation of a cue. and again at the receipt of reward. The resulting dopamine concentration scales proportionally to the value of the reward. In this study. we used a behavioral economics approach to quantify how transient dopamine release events scale with price and causally alter price sensitivity. We presented sucrose to rats across a range of prices and modeled the resulting demand curves to estimate price sensitivity.

In this study. we used quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to gain mechanistic insight into how integrin-based adhesions respond to increased and decreased mechanical forces. A critical means of regulating integrin-based adhesion is provided by modulating the turnover of integrin and its adhesion complex (integrin adhesion complex [IAC]). The turnover of the IAC component Talin. a known mechanosensor. was analyzed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.

It contains a strong spatial–temporal correlation between the regions of consecutive frames. The most important characteristic of videos is the perceived motion foreground objects across the frames. The motion of foreground objects dramatically changes the importance of the objects in a scene and leads to a different saliency map of the frame representing the scene. This makes the saliency analysis of videos much more complicated than that of still images. In this paper. we investigate saliency in video sequences and propose a novel spatiotemporal saliency model devoted for video surveillance applications. Compared to classical saliency models based on still images. such as Itti’s model. and space–time saliency models. the proposed model is more correlated to visual saliency perception of surveillance videos.

In this article. the contribution of any region to the global quality measure of an image is weighted with variable weights computed as a function of its saliency. In salient regions. the differences between distorted and original images are emphasized as if the authors are observing the difference image with a magnifying glass. Here a mixed saliency map model based on Itti's model and face detection is proposed. Both low-level features including intensity. color. orientation. and high-level features such as face are used in the mixed model. Differences in salient regions are then given more importance and thus contribute more to the image quality score.

Usually pain is reported and recorded manually and thus carry lot of subjectivity. Manual monitoring of pain makes difficult for the medical practitioners to respond quickly in critical situations. Thus. it is desirable to design such a system that can automate this task. With our proposed model pain monitoring can be done in real-time without any human intervention.

The model is based on the Navier–Stokes equations. which provide the dynamics of velocity and pressure. These equations form the basis for the model to balance erosion and deposition that determine changes in the layers between water and erosion material. The eroded material is captured and relocated by water according to a material transport equation. The resulting model is fully 3D and is able to simulate a variety of phenomena including river meanders. low hill sediment wash. natural water springs and receding waterfalls.

1285045,Selection of search terms based on user profile,1992,Sanjiv K Bhatia,,,,224-233,,A number of researchers have addressed the problem of selecting additional search terms for a query using term dependency information. Some other techniques rely on the construction of user profiles and the identification of individual users with a class of users having known backgrounds. In other words. these latter techniques for the construction of user profiles do not consider user preferences at the level of individual users. In this paper. we present a new technique for the construction of a user profile in the form of a concept (construct) dependence tree. This technique makes use of personal construct theory that involves active user participation. The user profile captures the user preferences and may be used to select additional search terms.

A 2D string can be readily converted to a set of triples which can be used to generate a perfect hash table for indexing the image database. The perfect hash table allows for O(1) retrieval in image database but the computation of the hash table itself. by the fastest heuristic algorithm. is of exponential time complexity. Every time the database is modified. the hash table needs to be recomputed. This limits the use of the hash table to applications where the image database is relatively fixed. such as the ones found on a CD-ROM. In this paper. we present an enhancement of the perfect hash table to allow for insertion and deletion in the hash table. The new hash table allows for a relatively small number of collisions and is called near-perfect hash table.

Indeed. these techniques share the same objective of inferring a latent sharp image from one or several corresponding blurry images. while the blind deblurring techniques are also required to derive an accurate blur kernel. Considering the critical role of image restoration in modern imaging systems to provide high-quality images under complex environments such as motion. undesirable lighting conditions. and imperfect system components. image deblurring has attracted growing attention in recent years. From the viewpoint of how to handle the ill-posedness which is a crucial issue in deblurring tasks. existing methods can be grouped into five categories: Bayesian inference framework. variational methods. sparse representation-based methods. homography-based modeling. and region-based methods. In spite of achieving a certain level of development. image deblurring. especially the blind case. is limited in its success by complex application conditions which make the blur kernel hard to obtain and be spatially variant.

From a neuroscience perspective. the layerwise abstraction of knowledge in a deep neural network can. to some extent. reveal the mechanisms of how visual cues are processed in human brain.

The top performers in this field include deep or wide convolutional neural networks. or recurrent neural networks. However. the methods enforce a single model to process all kinds of textures and structures. A typical operation is that a certain layer restores the textures based on the ones recovered by the preceding layers. ignoring the characteristics of image textures. In this paper. we believe that the lower-frequency and higher-frequency information in images have different levels of complexity and should be restored by models of different representational capacity. Inspired by this. we propose a novel embedded block residual network (EBRN) which is an incremental recovering progress for texture super-resolution. Specifically. different modules in the model restores information of different frequencies.

Identity-specific information is often overlooked. leading to unsatisfactory identity verification and recognition performance. In this paper. we discuss the reasons why conventional methods fail to recover identity-specific information. Then. we propose a novel dual-transfer face sketch-photo synthesis framework composed of an inter-domain transfer process and an intra-domain transfer process.

1285091,FPGA-GPU architecture for kernel SVM pedestrian detection,2010,Sebastian Bauer and Sebastian Köhler and Konrad Doll and Ulrich Brunsmann,,,,61-68,IEEE,We present a real-time multi-sensor architecture for video-based pedestrian detection used within a road side unit for intersection assistance. The entire system is implemented on available PC hardware. combining a frame grabber board with embedded FPGA and a graphics card into a powerful processing network. Giving classification performance top priority. we use HOG descriptors with a Gaussian kernel support vector machine. In order to achieve real-time performance. we propose a hardware architecture that incorporates FPGA-based feature extraction and GPU-based classification.

MPC-Workshop,,49-58,,With respect to road crash statistics. on-board pedestrian detection is a key task for future advanced driver assistance systems. In this paper. we describe the implementation of a realtime pedestrian recognition system that combines FPGA-based extraction of image features with a CPU-based object localization and classification framework. In terms of features. we have implemented the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor that is state-of-the-art in the field of human detection from a moving camera. While past HOG-related publications presented simplified FPGA-based HOG variants. often sacrificing classification performance. we implemented the original descriptor with minor modifications on dedicated hardware. Evaluation on the INRIA pedestrian database shows potential for deploying the system in practice.

Instead. the desired state is heralded by a macroscopic quantum jump. Macroscopic quantum jumps manifest themselves as a random telegraph signal with long intervals of intense fluorescence (light periods) interrupted by the complete absence of photons (dark periods). Here we show that a system of two atoms trapped inside an optical cavity can be designed such that a dark period prepares the atoms in a maximally entangled ground state. Achieving fidelities above 0.9 is possible even when the single-atom cooperativity parameter C is as low as 10 and when using a photon detector with an efficiency as low as η= 0.2.,True,x2d4gB4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,68,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.040503,13574660449139740814,/scholar?cites=13574660449139740814,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0510051,0,0,0

Persister and viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells are two important clonal bacterial subpopulations that can survive antibiotic treatment. Both persister and VBNC cells pose a serious threat to human health. However. unlike persister cells. which quickly resume growth following drug removal. VBNC cells can remain non-growing for prolonged periods of time. thus eluding detection via traditional microbiological assays. Therefore. understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of VBNC cells requires the characterization of the clonal population with single-cell resolution. A combination of microfluidics. time-lapse microscopy. and fluorescent reporter strains offers the perfect platform for investigating individual cells while manipulating their environment. Here. we report a novel single-cell approach to investigate VBNC cells. We perform drug treatment. bacterial culturing. and live/dead staining in series by using transcriptional reporter strains and novel adaptations to the mother machine technology. Since we track each cell throughout the experiment. we are able to quantify the size. morphology and fluorescence that each VBNC cell displayed before. during and after drug treatment. We show that VBNC cells are not dead or dying cells but share similar phenotypic features with persister cells. suggesting a link between these two subpopulations. at least in the Escherichia coli strain under investigation.

These movements require ATP and involve bidirectional early endosome motility. indicating that microtubule-associated membrane trafficking enhances diffusion of organelles. When early endosome transport is abolished. POs and LDs drift slowly towards the growing cell end. This pole-ward drift is facilitated by anterograde delivery of secretory cargo to the cell tip by myosin-5.

Using near-infrared optical tweezers combined with TIRF microscopy. we were able to trap peroxisomes and approximate the forces involved in chloroplast association in vivo in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and observed weaker tethering to additional unknown structures within the cell.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 97. 040503 (2006)]. Here we analyze the dynamics underlying this effect in detail and show its robustness against parameter fluctuations. Whenever the fluorescence of the system stops. a macroscopic dark period occurs and the atoms are shelved in a maximally entangled ground state. The described setup can therefore be used for the controlled generation of entanglement. Finite photon detector efficiencies do not affect the success rate of the state preparation. which is triggered upon the observation of a macroscopic fluorescence signal.

This problem is very challenging due to the large diversity of fashion items and the absence of pixel-level tags. which make the traditional fully supervised algorithms inapplicable.

Recovering the parameters of such transformations is a fundamental problem in computer vision with various applications. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the parameters of a homography that aligns two binary images. It is obtained by solving a system of nonlinear equations generated by integrating linearly independent functions over the domains determined by the shapes. The advantage of the proposed solution is that it is easy to implement. less sensitive to the strength of the deformation. works without established correspondences and robust against segmentation errors.

In this paper. we address semantic segmentation assuming that object bounding boxes are provided by object detectors. but no training data with annotated segments are available. Based on a set of segment hypotheses. we introduce a simple voting scheme to estimate shape guidance for each bounding box. The derived shape guidance is used in the subsequent graph-cut-based figure-ground segmentation. The final segmentation result is obtained by merging the segmentation results in the bounding boxes.

This scheme follows retrospective study design protocol where patients were selected at random in the clinic. The scheme consists of two main stages - firstly artefacts reduction. and secondly fuzzy divergence based segmentation of P. vivax infected region(s) from erythrocytes. Here. malaria parasite segmentation is done using divergence based threshold selection. Fuzzy approach is chosen to minimize ambiguity inherent in the microscopic images.

1285201,Using mathematical morphology for the anatomical labeling of vertebrae from 3D CT-scan images,2007,Benoit Naegel,31,Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,3,141-156,Pergamon,In this article we propose an original method for the anatomical labeling of vertebrae from 3D CT-scan images. The primary purpose of this work is to obtain a robust referential of the abdomen. This referential can be used to locate anatomical structures like organs or blood vessels. The main problematic concerns the separation of the vertebrae. which are structures that are very close from each other. In order to detect the intervertebral spaces. we use a morphological operator which detects the dark spaces corresponding to intervertebral discs in combination with an analysis of the shape of the vertebrae in the axial plane. To reconstruct the vertebrae we use the paradigm of mathematical morphology. which consists in finding markers inside the vertebrae and compute the watershed from markers. Then we label the vertebrae according to their anatomical names. To do this. we automatically detect T12 vertebrae.

Recently a multiplication-free 1BT (MF-1BT) has been proposed to facilitate 1BT to be carried out with integer arithmetic using addition and shifts only. Thresholding schemes are typically used in order to construct the lower bit depth representations utilized in 1BT and 2BT. In our experience we have observed that one problem with such schemes is that pixel values that lie on directly opposite sides of the threshold are categorized into separate classes and are. therefore. counted as a nonmatch in the search process even if they are close in value.

A robust hard-cut detection system based on modified phase correlation is presented. Phase-correlation-based hard-cut detection is carried out using spatially sub-sampled video frames. and a candidate hard-cut is indicated in the case of low correlation. A double thresholding approach consisting of a global threshold used in conjunction with an adaptive local threshold is used to detect candidate hard-cuts.

The desired noiseless image u(x). in a Partial Differential Equation based model. can be viewed as the solution of an evolutionary differential equation u t(x) = F(u xx. u x. u. x. t) which means that the true solution will be reached when t ® ¥. In practical applications we should stop the time ''t'' at some moment during this evolutionary process. This work presents a sufficient condition. related to time t and to the standard deviation s of the noise we desire to remove. which gives a constant T such that u(x. T) is a good approximation of u(x). The approach here focused on edge preservation during the noise elimination process as its main characteristic.

The retrieval process is based on local similarity patterns. The goal of the genetic algorithm is to infer weights for regions and features that better translate the user's requirements producing better quality rankings. The genetic algorithm used has as its main innovation an order-based fitness function. which is appropriate to the ranking requirements of a majority of the users. This fitness function will quickly drive the genetic algorithm in the process of searching for an optimal solution.

The procedure allows for the denoising and inpainting of images simultaneously. The denoising is performed by the smoothing equation working inside and outside of the inpainting domain but in completely different ways. Inside the inpainting domain the smoothing is carried out by the mean curvature flow. while the smoothing of the outside of the inpainting domain is carried out in a way to encourage smoothing within a region and discourage smoothing across boundaries. Besides smoothing. the approach here presented permits the transportation of available information from the outside towards the inside of the inpainting domain.

It is a combination of a local multiscale denoising by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoiser and a nonlocal denoising based on a nonlocal filter (NLF). exploiting the mutual similarities between groups of patches. CNN models are leveraged with noise levels that progressively decrease at every iteration of our framework. while their output is regularized by a nonlocal prior implicit within the NLF. Unlike complicated neural networks that embed the nonlocality prior within the layers of the network. our framework is modular. and it uses standard pretrained CNNs together with standard nonlocal filters.

The recent availability of the low-cost Kinect sensor provides a valid alternative to other available sensors. namely laser-range finders. This paper presents the first results of the application of a Kinect sensor on a wheeled indoor service robot for elderly assistance. The robot makes use of a metric map of the environment’s walls and uses the depth information of the Kinect camera to detect the walls and localize itself in the environment. In our approach an error minimization method is used providing realtime efficient robot pose estimation. Furthermore. the depth camera provides information about the obstacles surrounding the robot. allowing the application of path-finding algorithms such as D* Lite achieving safe and robust navigation.

Current state-of-the-art SISR methods are patch-based. They use either external data or internal self-similarity to learn a prior for an HR image. External data-based methods utilize a large number of patches from the training data. while self-similarity-based approaches leverage one or more similar patches from the input image.

At the same time. the statistical methodology for microarray analysis has progressed from simple visual assessments of results to novel algorithms for analyzing changes in expression profiles. In a micro-RNA (miRNA) or gene-expression profiling experiment. the expression levels of thousands of genes/miRNAs are simultaneously monitored to study the effects of certain treatments. diseases. and developmental stages on their expressions. Microarray-based gene expression profiling can be used to identify genes. whose expressions are changed in response to pathogens or other organisms by comparing gene expression in infected to that in uninfected cells or tissues. Recent studies have revealed that patterns of altered microarray expression profiles in cancer can serve as molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis …,True,-ckyqDEAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,31,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6971078/,9349203567836504559,/scholar?cites=9349203567836504559,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6221039/6563131/06971078.pdf,0,0,0

The ensemble of statistics and mathematics has increased the accuracy of forecasting of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) up to some extent. But due to the nonlinear nature of ISMR. its forecasting accuracy is still below the satisfactory level. Mathematical and statistical models require complex computing power. Therefore. many researchers have paid attention to apply artificial neural network in ISMR forecasting. In this study. we have used feed-forward back-propagation neural network algorithm for ISMR forecasting.

First. the pixels in the mammogram images were scanned in 8 directions. and regions of interest (ROI) were identified using various thresholds. Then. a mass template was used to categorize the ROI as true masses or non-masses based on their morphologies. Each pixel of a ROI was scanned with a mass template to determine whether there was a shape (part of a ROI) similar to the mass in the template. The similarity was controlled using two thresholds. If a shape was detected. then the coordinates of the shape were recorded as part of a true mass.

In the developed stage of the evolution. the wave trains have a characteristic quasi-periodic signature. The quasi-periodicity results from the geometrical dispersion of the guided fast modes. determined by the transverse profile of the loop. A typical feature of the signature is a tadpole wavelet spectrum: a narrow-spectrum tail precedes a broad-band head. The instantaneous period of the oscillations in the wave train decreases gradually with time.

Robotics research over the past decade has demonstrated that many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a strong interest in robots and robot toys and can connect with a robot significantly better than with a human. Despite showing great promise. research in this direction has made minimal progress in advancing robots as clinically useful for ASD intervention. Moreover. the clinicians are generally not convinced about the potential of robots. A major reason behind this is that a vast majority of HRI studies on robot-mediated intervention (RMI) do not follow any standard research design and. consequently. the data produced by these studies is minimally appealing to the clinical community.

The core of the proposed SLAM algorithm is based on an island model GA (IGA) which searches for the most probable map(s) such that the associated pose(s) provides the robot with the best localization information. Prior knowledge about the problem domain is transferred to GA in order to speed up the convergence. Fuzzy logic is employed to serve this purpose and allows the IGA to conduct the search starting from a potential region of the pose space. The underlying fuzzy mapping rules infer the uncertainty in the robot's location after executing a motion command and generate a sample-based prediction of its current position. This sample set is used as the initial population for the proposed IGA.

The robotic visual attention is mostly concerned with overt attention which accompanies head and eye movements of a robot. In this case. each movement of the camera head triggers a number of events. namely transformation of the camera and the image coordinate systems. change of content of the visual field. and partial appearance of the stimuli. All of these events contribute to the reduction in probability of meaningful identification of the next focus of attention. These events are specific to overt attention with head movement and. therefore. their effects are not addressed in the classical models of covert visual attention.

Using multiscale registration. the shape of the acinus at an elevated inflation pressure of 25 cmH2O is estimated. Changes in the alveolar geometry suggest that the deformation within the acinus is not isotropic. In particular. the expansion of the acinus (from 20 to 25 cmH2O) is accompanied by an increase in both surface area …,True,xfsgpOcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,41,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.01136.2012,4451520711232675927,/scholar?cites=4451520711232675927,,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.01136.2012,0,0,0

Micro computed tomography (µCT) has previously been used to elucidate lung 3D histology and morphometry in fixed samples that have been stained with contrast agents or air inflated and dried. However. non-destructive microstructural 3D imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues would facilitate retrospective analysis of extensive tissue archives of lung FFPE lung samples with linked clinical data.   Methods FFPE human lung tissue samples (n = 4) were scanned using a Nikon metrology µCT scanner. Semi-automatic techniques were used to segment the 3D structure of airways and blood vessels. Airspace size (mean linear intercept. Lm) was measured on µCT images and on matched histological sections from the same FFPE samples imaged by light microscopy to validate µCT imaging.   Results The µCT imaging protocol provided contrast between tissue and paraffin in FFPE samples (15mm x 7mm). Resolution (voxel size 6.7 µm) in the reconstructed images was sufficient for semi-automatic image segmentation of airways and blood vessels as well as quantitative airspace analysis. The scans were also used to scout for regions of interest. enabling time-efficient preparation of conventional histological sections. The Lm measurements from µCT images were not significantly different to those from matched histological sections.

Due to different imaging conditions and sensor parameters. 2-D information delivered by satellite images from different dates is often not sufficient when dealing with building changes. Moreover. due to the similar spectral characteristics. it is often difficult to distinguish buildings from other man-made constructions. like roads and bridges. during the change detection procedure. Therefore. stereo imagery is of importance to provide the height component which is very helpful in analyzing 3-D building changes. In this paper. we propose a change detection method based on stereo imagery and digital surface models (DSMs) generated with stereo matching methodology and provide a solution by the joint use of height changes and Kullback-Leibler divergence similarity measure between the original images.

In the second step. mean-shift segmentation is applied on the orthorectified images of two dates to obtain initial regions. A region intersection following a merging strategy is proposed to get minimum change regions and multi-level change vectors are extracted for these regions.

The detection accuracy is usually limited by spectral ambiguities and the uncertainties of the available height information. Feature extraction and training sampling collection for supervised methods are other sources of uncertainty. Most widely used VHR sensors have shorter revisit cycles (IKONOS/GeoEye-1/2. 3 days; WorldView 1/2. 1.1 days) due to large off-nadir viewing angles and hence are able to perform consistent acquisition of mono or stereo images.

We particularly focus on quadratic TFDs (QTFDs). We demonstrate how these distributions can be properly integrated with the spatial dimension to enhance individual source signal recovery and angular estimation. The framework that enables such integration is referred to as spatial TFD (STFD). We present the important milestones of STFDs that have been reached during the last 15 years. Most importantly. we show that array processing creates new perspectives of QTFDs and defines new roles to the autoterms and cross-terms in both problem formulation and solution.

We exploit the high correlation between 2D trajectories of different points on the same non-rigid surface by assuming that the displacement of any point throughout the sequence can be expressed in a compact way as a linear combination of a low-rank motion basis. This subspace constraint effectively acts as a trajectory regularization term leading to temporally consistent optical flow. We formulate it as a robust soft constraint within a variational framework by penalizing flow fields that lie outside the low-rank manifold. The resulting energy functional can be decoupled into the optimization of the brightness constancy and spatial regularization terms. leading to an efficient optimization scheme …,True,SXHb84wAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,140,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11263-012-0607-7.pdf,12644570259717749275,/scholar?cites=12644570259717749275,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11263-012-0607-7.pdf,0,0,0

Recovering the lost dimension in this process has been the goal of classic shape-from-X methods. but often the assumptions made in those works are quite limiting to be useful for general 3-D objects. This problem has been recently addressed with deep learning methods containing a 2-D (convolution) encoder followed by a 3-D (deconvolution) decoder. These methods have been reasonably successful. but memory and run time constraints impose a strong limitation in terms of the resolution of the reconstructed 3-D shapes. In particular. state-of-the-art methods are able to reconstruct 3-D shapes represented by volumes of at most 32^ 3 voxels using state-of-the-art desktop computers. In this work. we present a scalable 2-D single view to 3-D volume reconstruction deep learning method. where the 3-D (deconvolution) decoder is replaced by a simple inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) decoder. Our simpler architecture has an order of magnitude faster inference when reconstructing 3-D volumes compared to the convolution-deconvolutional model. an exponentially smaller memory complexity while training and testing. and a sub-linear runtime training complexity with respect to the output volume size.

This paper presents a system for liberating useful information from physical collections by bringing specimens into the digital domain so they can be more readily shared. analyzed. annotated and compared. It focuses on insects and is strongly motivated by the desire to accelerate and augment current practices in insect taxonomy which predominantly use text. 2D diagrams and images to describe and characterize species. While these traditional kinds of descriptions are informative and useful. they cannot cover insect specimens “from all angles” and precious specimens are still exchanged between researchers and collections for this reason. Furthermore. insects can be complex in structure and pose many challenges to computer vision systems. We present a new prototype for a practical. cost-effective system of off-the-shelf components to acquire natural-colour 3D models of insects from around 3 mm to 30 mm in length.

The method is based on decomposing the cross-correlation function into various contributions at different depths. Because the technique is based on 3D decomposition of the correlation function and not reconstruction of particle images. there is no limit to particle seeding density as experienced by 3D particle tracking algorithms such as defocusing PIV and tomographic PIV.

1285413,Improvement of measurement accuracy in micro PIV by image overlapping,2010,Chuong Vinh Nguyen and Andreas Fouras and Josie Carberry,49,Experiments in fluids,3,701-712,Springer-Verlag,Micro PIV uses volume illumination; therefore. the velocity measured at the focal plane is a weighted average of the velocities within the measurement volume. The contribution of out-of-focus particles to the PIV correlation can generate significant measurement errors particularly in near wall regions. We present a new application of image overlapping. which is shown to be very effective in improving the accuracy of time-averaged velocity measurements by effectively reducing the measurement depth. The performance of image overlapping and correlation averaging were studied using synthetic and experimental images of micro channel flow. both with and without image pre-processing.

Cellular automata (CA). which consist of an array of locally connected processing elements. are a basic form of a cellular-based architecture. The use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for implementing CA accelerators has shown promising results. This paper investigates the design of CA-based pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) using an FPGA platform. To improve the quality of the random numbers that are generated. the basic CA structure is enhanced in two ways. First. the addition of a superrule to each CA cell is considered. The resulting self-programmable CA (SPCA) uses the superrule to determine when to make a dynamic rule change in each CA cell. The superrule takes its inputs from neighboring cells and can be considered itself a second CA working in parallel with the main CA. When implemented on an FPGA. the use of lookup tables in each logic cell removes any restrictions on how the super-rules should be defined. Second. a hybrid configuration is formed by combining a CA with a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). This is advantageous for FPGA designs due to the compactness of the LFSR implementations. A standard software package for statistically evaluating the quality of random number sequences known as Diehard is used to validate the results. Both the SPCA and the hybrid CA/LFSR were found to pass all the Diehard tests.,True,0LHIXCgAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,20,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijrc/2012/219028/abs/,17066079052405857859,/scholar?cites=17066079052405857859,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijrc/2012/219028/abs/,0,0,0

1285433,Online distance metric learning for object tracking,2011,Grigorios Tsagkatakis and Andreas Savakis,21,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,12,1810-1821,IEEE,Tracking an object without any prior information regarding its appearance is a challenging problem. Modern tracking algorithms treat tracking as a binary classification problem between the object class and the background class. The binary classifier can be learned offline. if a specific object model is available. or online. if there is no prior information about the object's appearance. In this paper. we propose the use of online distance metric learning in combination with nearest neighbor classification for object tracking.

In remote sensing. a large body of research has been devoted to the application of deep learning for typical supervised learning tasks such as classification. Less yet equally important effort has also been allocated to addressing the challenges associated with the enhancement of low-quality observations from remote sensing platforms. Addressing such channels is of paramount importance. both in itself. since high-altitude imaging. environmental conditions. and imaging systems trade-offs lead to low-quality observation. as well as to facilitate subsequent analysis. such as classification and detection. In this paper. we provide a comprehensive review of deep-learning methods for the enhancement of remote sensing observations. focusing on critical tasks including single and multi-band super-resolution. denoising. restoration. pan-sharpening. and fusion. among others.

This work proposes a novel approach for enhancing images captured under low illumination conditions based on the mathematical framework of Sparse Representations. In our model. we utilize the sparse representation of low light image patches in an appropriate dictionary to approximate the corresponding day-time images. We consider two dictionaries; a night dictionary for low light conditions and a day dictionary for well illuminated conditions.

The agents are proxies for communication-and computation-intensive techniques and respond to the situation at hand by determining an appropriate constellation of techniques. It is critical that the system have a repertoire of classifiers with different characteristics so that a combination appropriate for the situation at hand can generally be found. We use unsupervised learning for identifying the existence and location of damage but supervised learning for identifying the type and severity of damage. The supervised learning techniques investigated are support vector machines (SVM). naive Bayes classifiers. and feed-forward neural networks (FNN).

Our technique chooses all required parameters in a principled way. relating them to the noise model. We also discuss our motivation for adopting the HOSVD as an appropriate transform for image denoising. We experimentally demonstrate the excellent performance of the technique on grayscale as well as color images.

An important and distinguishing feature of the proposed framework is that all dictionary blocks are trained simultaneously with respect to each data group while the intra-block coherence being explicitly minimized as an important objective. We provide both empirical evidence and heuristic support for this feature that can be considered as a direct consequence of incorporating both the group structure for the input data and the block structure for the dictionary in the learning process. The optimization problems for both the dictionary learning and sparse coding can be solved efficiently using block-gradient descent. and the details of the optimization algorithms are presented.

Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and combinatorial group testing with a novel noise model for PCR. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms. the input is a quantitative readout from each test. and the output is a list of viral loads for each sample. While other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay. Tapestry obtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing. When testing  samples with  tests. as many as  infected samples can be identified at clinically-acceptable false positive and false negative rates. This makes Tapestry viable even at prevalence rates as high as 10\%. Tapestry has been validated in simulations as well as in wet lab experiments with oligomers.

The usual methods consider a limited number of X- and γ-ray peaks. and require calibrated instrumentation for each sample.

Conf. on Biomedical Engineering (BioMed 2004), Innsbruck, Austria",,244-249,,Obstetricians were asking the engineering support to study more extensively any technical possibility to electronically get some useful information from the whole PQRST complex of the fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) in order to identify eventual sign of fetal distress (FD). The latter should indeed be found as a more reliable information for the clinician with the potential benefit of increasing the sensibility as well as the specificity of the diagnosis of FD. A way to achieve this goal is Blind Source Separation. In this case. the extraction of an estimation of the fetal PQRST complex can be solved using Independent Component Analysis on signals recorded through electrodes located on the pregnant woman abdomen. Today. neither theoretical nor simulation considerations were investigated to determine an optimal number and location of these electrodes. despite possible important consequences on the extraction performances. We propose here a method to identify the location of electrodes (depending of the position of the fetus) that drive electrical components due to the fetus by analyzing the (joint and marginal) density functions of the recorded signals. This result allows to evaluate the ‘interesting’sensors. therefore allowing electrode selection when many sensors are involved in the measure.

The context of interval observer in the cooperative framework is adopted. Thus. lower and upper bounds of the state and UI are provided. No assumption is made on the UI. The approach is based on a rank condition allowing to decouple the UI from the state estimation errors (so that the state estimation is guaranteed. regardless of the variation of the UI). The convergence of the proposed interval observer is studied by Lyapunov theory and stability conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities which ease the design of the gain matrices of the observer.

Depth fusion is an extension of common sensor-fusion techniques for landmine detection. The difference lies within the fact that fusion of sensor data is performed in different physical depth layers. In order to do so. it requires a sensor that provides depth information for object detections. Our ground-penetrating radar fulfills this requirement. Depth fusion is then taken as the combination of the output of sensor fusion of all layers. The underlying idea is that sensor fusion for the surface layer has a different weighing of the sensors when compared with the sensor fusion in the deep layers because of apparent sensor characteristics. For example. a thermal IR sensor hardly adds information to the sensor fusion in the deep layers. Furthermore. GPR has difficulties suppressing clutter in the surface layer.

This paper considers computer self-efficacy and its relationship to gender and educational background. Self-efficacy is based on self-perception and is defined as the belief an individual has about their ability to perform a particular task. Self-efficacy is important as it influences the choice of activities by an individual. the amount of effort they will expend on a task and how long they will persevere in stressful situations to complete the task. Self-efficacy beliefs about computing may be a factor in whether people choose to get involved in computing. Therefore. self-efficacy is linked to participation rates and hence important to consider in our attempts to understand why people choose to become involved in information technology.,True,fsnRRkIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,53,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1237471/,15566299675387801920,/scholar?cites=15566299675387801920,,,,0,0,0

However there has been concern regarding whether viable trace mental models of recursion show students' true understanding of recursion. We have conducted an investigation to further examine the understanding of recursion of students with viable trace mental models. The investigation looked at students' understanding of the termination of a recursive function. their descriptive mental models and their ability to generate a recursive function. This research provides evidence to show that trace methods are essentially mechanical processes that can allow students with little understanding of recursion to correctly evaluate a recursive function but that students do not fully understand recursion and in particular have difficulties with the passive flow.

Currently. the segmentation of OCT images and identification of the composition of plaque are mainly performed manually by expert observers. However. this process is laborious and time consuming and its accuracy relies on the expertise of the observer. To address these limitations. we present a methodology that is able to process the OCT data in a fully automated fashion.

The acquired data were used for 3-D reconstruction using a conventional method and a new methodology that utilised the luminal 3-D centreline to place the detected IVUS borders and anatomical landmarks to estimate their orientation. The local ESS distribution was assessed by computational fluid dynamics.

The rationale is to fuse the information about the curvature of the artery. derived from biplane angiographies. with the information regarding the lumen wall. which is produced from the FD-OCT examination. The method is based on a three step approach. In the first step the lumen borders in FD-OCT images are detected. In the second step a 3D curve is produced using the center line of the vessel from the two biplane projections. Finally in the third step the detected lumen borders are placed perpendicularly onto the path based on the centroid of each lumen border.

FD-OCT and IVUS examination during the same procedure were studied. The FD-OCT and IVUS lumen borders were placed onto the 3D luminal centreline derived from angiographic data. Three-dimensional geometry algorithms and anatomical landmarks were used to estimate the orientation of the borders appropriately. ESS was calculated using computational fluid dynamics. In 188 corresponding consecutive 3-mm segments. FD-OCT-and IVUS-derived models were highly correlated for lumen area (r= 0.96) and local ESS (r= 0.89) measurements. FD-OCT-based 3D reconstructions had a high diagnostic accuracy for detecting regions exposed to proatherogenic low ESS identified on the IVUS-based 3D models. considered as the gold standard (receiver operator characteristic area under the curve: 94.9%).Conclusions: FD-OCT-based 3D coronary reconstruction provides anatomically correct models and permits reliable ESS computation.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) accumulation in the subendothelial layer is one of the hallmarks of atherosclerosis onset and ignites plaque development and progression. Blood flow-induced endothelial shear stress (ESS) is causally related to the heterogenic distribution of atherosclerotic lesions and critically affects LDL deposition in the vessel wall. In this work we modeled blood flow and LDL transport in the coronary arterial wall and investigated the influence of several hemodynamic and biological factors that may regulate LDL accumulation.

Our aim was to compare the computed distal coronary pressure values with the measured values using a pressure wire. while testing the effect of different boundary conditions for the simulation. Eight coronary arteries (lumen and outer vessel wall) from six patients were reconstructed in three-dimensional (3D) space using intravascular ultrasound and biplane angiographic images. Pressure values at the distal and proximal end of the vessel and flow velocity values at the distal end were acquired with the use of a combo pressure-flow wire. The 3D lumen and wall models were discretized into finite elements; fluid structure interaction (FSI) and rigid wall simulations were performed for one cardiac cycle both with pulsatile and steady flow in separate simulations. The results showed a high correlation between the measured and the computed coronary pressure values (coefficient of determination [r2] ranging between 0.8902 and 0.9961). while the less demanding simulations using steady flow and rigid walls resulted in very small relative error.

1285540,A unified approach to gradual shot transition detection,2000,Jesus Bescos and José M Menendez and Guillermo Cisneros and Julián Cabrera and JM Martinez,3,,,949-952,IEEE,Nowadays. content-based retrieval of video material is based on the availability of meta-data linked to it. Current approaches to automatically extract these data start from a temporal segmentation of the audio-visual material. that is. a location of the camera shot transitions. Although abrupt transition detection is a problem almost solved. success on gradual transition detection is still very low. We present a detector for all types of gradual transitions (chromatic. geometric. and mixed). based on in depth modelling of the patterns that these transitions generate on a specific frame distance. Results are presented over a representative sample of more than 250 gradual transitions. which belong to a significant part (200') of the MPEG-7 testing material. achieving a recall (percentage of effects correctly detected) and a precision (percentage of non-false positives in the set of detection) notably higher than the ones reported so far.,True,eoIaFg8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/899614/,13427768754718324102,/scholar?cites=13427768754718324102,,,,0,0,0

The methodology is based on the measurement of 3D trajectories of fiduciary points marked on the face of a real speaker during the speech production of CVCV non-sense words. The trajectories are measured from standard video sequences using stereo vision photogrammetric techniques. The first stationary point of each trajectory associated with a phonetic segment is selected as its articulatory target. By clustering according to geometric similarity all articulatory targets of a same segment in different phonetic contexts. a set of phonetic context-dependent visemes accounting for coarticulation is identified.

In computer science. programs that provide accessibility are those that enable people with disabilities to use computing resources efficiently. Since virtual environment relies primarily on the visual mode. usually using writing content. it may seem that access for deaf people is not an issue. However. for prelingually deaf individuals. those who were deaf since before learn any language. written information is often of limited accessibility than if presented in signing. Further. for this community. signing is their language of choice. and reading text in a spoken language is akin to using a foreign language. Sign language uses gestures and facial expressions and is widely used by deaf communities. The aim of this work is to develop a 3D virtual agent for presenting sign language information. The avatar consists of an articulated model. representing a human character. which is able to articulate signs. The virtual agent control is done through text scripts that describe the signs in particular notation developed in the context of this work.

As sensor networks are usually deployed with a number of redundant nodes (to overcome the problem of node failures which is common in such networks). many nodes may have almost the same information which can be aggregated in intermediate nodes. and hence reduce the number of transmitted packets. Aggregation ratio is maximized if data packets of all nodes having almost the same information are aggregated together. For this to occur. each node should forward its packets along a path on which maximum number of nodes with almost the same information as the information of the sending node exist.

However. in the HSI case. the  n -mode ranks are close to the  n -mode dimensions. Thus. the signal subspace dimension can be underestimated. This leads to a loss of spatial resolution-edge blurring-and artifacts in the restored HSI. To cope with the underestimation while preserving edges. a new method is proposed.

1285622,DeepRebirth: Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices,2018,Dawei Li and Xiaolong Wang and Kong Deguang,,,,,,"Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is a challenging task. Current model compression methods such as matrix decomposition effectively reduce the deployed model size. but still cannot satisfy real-time processing requirement. This paper first discovers that the major obstacle is the excessive execution time of non-tensor layers such as pooling and normalization without tensor-like trainable parameters. This motivates us to design a novel acceleration framework: DeepRebirth through"" slimming"" existing consecutive and parallel non-tensor and tensor layers. The layer slimming is executed at different substructures:(a) streamline slimming by merging the consecutive non-tensor and tensor layer vertically;(b) branch slimming by merging non-tensor and tensor branches horizontally. The proposed optimization operations significantly accelerate the model execution and also greatly reduce the run-time memory cost since the slimmed model architecture contains less hidden layers. To maximally avoid accuracy loss. the parameters in new generated layers are learned with layer-wise fine-tuning based on both theoretical analysis and empirical verification. As observed in the experiment. DeepRebirth achieves more than 3x speed-up and 2.5 x run-time memory saving on GoogLeNet with only 0.4% drop on top-5 accuracy in ImageNet. Furthermore. by combining with other model compression techniques. DeepRebirth offers an average of 106.3 ms inference time on the CPU of Samsung Galaxy S5 with 86.5% top-5 accuracy. 14% faster than SqueezeNet which only has a top-5 accuracy of 80.5%.",True,O5owaKwAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,68,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11876,6010915076887119844,/scholar?cites=6010915076887119844,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/11876/11735,0,0,0
1285623,LCANet: End-to-End Lipreading with Cascaded Attention-CTC,2018,Kai Xu and Dawei Li and Nick Cassimatis and Xiaolong Wang,,FG,,,,Machine lipreading is a special type of automatic speech recognition (ASR) which transcribes human speech by visually interpreting the movement of related face regions including lips. face. and tongue. Recently. deep neural network based lipreading methods show great potential and have exceeded the accuracy of experienced human lipreaders in some benchmark datasets. However. lipreading is still far from being solved. and existing methods tend to have high error rates on the wild data.

1285624,Talking Face Generation by Conditional Recurrent Adversarial Network,2018,Yang Song and Jingwen Zhu and Xiaolong Wang and Hairong Qi,,IJCAI 2019,,,IJCAI,Given an arbitrary face image and an arbitrary speech clip. the proposed work attempts to generating the talking face video with accurate lip synchronization while maintaining smooth transition of both lip and facial movement over the entire video clip. Existing works either do not consider temporal dependency on face images across different video frames thus easily yielding noticeable/abrupt facial and lip movement or are only limited to the generation of talking face video for a specific person thus lacking generalization capacity. We propose a novel conditional video generation network where the audio input is treated as a condition for the recurrent adversarial network such that temporal dependency is incorporated to realize smooth transition for the lip and facial movement. In addition. we deploy a multi-task adversarial training scheme in the context of video generation to improve both photo-realism and the accuracy for lip synchronization. Finally. based on the phoneme distribution information extracted from the audio clip. we develop a sample selection method that effectively reduces the size of the training dataset without sacrificing the quality of the generated video. Extensive experiments on both controlled and uncontrolled datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of visual quality. lip sync accuracy. and smooth transition of lip and facial movement. as compared to the state-of-the-art.,True,O5owaKwAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,47,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04786,12140523484173890649,/scholar?cites=12140523484173890649,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04786,0,0,0

Although many advancements have been made by researchers. there are still many challenges: such as age estimation across different image acquisition methods. different expressions. gender and races.

Therefore. the proposed anisotropic coupled diffusion filter method can avoid blur of the fringe edge and protect the useful information of the fringe patterns. The anisotropic coupled diffusion binarization. which can repair the image boundary anisotropically. is able to avoid the redundant burr.

1285669,A simplified extension of the area under the ROC to the multiclass domain,2006,Thomas Landgrebe and R Duin,1,Seventeenth annual symposium of the pattern recognition association of South Africa,,,,The Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) plot allows a classifier to be evaluated and optimised over all possible operating points. The Area Under the ROC (AUC) has become a standard performance evaluation criterion in two-class pattern recognition problems. used to compare different classification algorithms independently of operating points. priors. and costs. Extending the AUC to the multiclass case is considered in this paper. called the volume under the ROC hypersurface (VUS). A simplified VUS measure is derived that ignores specific intraclass dimensions. and regards inter-class performances only. It is shown that the VUS measure generalises from the 2-class case. but the bounds between random and perfect classification differ. with the lower bound tending towards zero as the dimensionality increases. A number of experiments with known distributions are used to verify the bounds. and to investigate a numerical integration approach to estimating the VUS. Experiments on real data compare several competing classifiers in terms of both error-rate and VUS. It was found that some classifiers compete in terms of error-rate. but have significantly different VUS scores. illustrating the importance of the VUS approach.,True,zNImWKsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,39,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Duin/publication/228659656_A_simplified_extension_of_the_area_under_the_ROC_to_the_multiclass_domain/links/0c960518124d9a849c000000.pdf,17288198547910670401,/scholar?cites=17288198547910670401,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Duin/publication/228659656_A_simplified_extension_of_the_area_under_the_ROC_to_the_multiclass_domain/links/0c960518124d9a849c000000.pdf,0,0,0
1285670,The link between great earthquakes and the subduction of oceanic fracture zones,2012,RD Müller and TCW Landgrebe,3,Solid Earth,2,447-465,Copernicus GmbH, Giant subduction earthquakes are known to occur in areas not previously identified as prone to high seismic risk. This highlights the need to better identify subduction zone segments potentially dominated by relatively long (up to 1000 yr and more) recurrence times of giant earthquakes. We construct a model for the geometry of subduction coupling zones and combine it with global geophysical data sets to demonstrate that the occurrence of great (magnitude ≥ 8) subduction earthquakes is strongly biased towards regions associated with intersections of oceanic fracture zones and subduction zones. We use a computational recommendation technology. a type of information filtering system technique widely used in searching. sorting. classifying. and filtering very large. statistically skewed data sets on the Internet. to demonstrate a robust association and rule out a random effect. Fracture zone–subduction zone intersection regions. representing only 25% of the global subduction coupling zone. are linked with 13 of the 15 largest (magnitude Mw ≥ 8.6) and half of the 50 largest (magnitude Mw ≥ 8.4) earthquakes. In contrast. subducting volcanic ridges and chains are only biased towards smaller earthquakes (magnitude < 8). The associations captured by our statistical analysis can be conceptually related to physical differences between subducting fracture zones and volcanic chains/ridges. Fracture zones are characterised by laterally continuous. uplifted ridges that represent normal ocean crust with a high degree of structural integrity. causing strong. persistent coupling in the subduction interface.

All these data represent a 3-D spatial and 1-D temporal framework. a formalism which is not exploited by traditional spatial analysis tools. This is arguably a fundamental limit in both the rigour and sophistication in which datasets can be combined for geological deep time analysis. and often confines the extent of data analyses to the present-day configurations of geological objects.

Heidelberg,A typical recognition system consists of a sequential combination of two experts. called a detector and classifier respectively. The two stages are usually designed independently. but we show that this may be suboptimal due to interaction between the stages. In this paper we consider the two stages holistically. as components of a multiple classifier system. This allows for an optimal design that accounts for such interaction. An ROC-based analysis is developed that facilitates the study of the inter-stage interaction. and an analytic example is then used to compare independently designing each stage to a holistically optimised system. based on cost.

Heidelberg,A common assumption made in the field of Pattern Recognition is that the priors inherent to the class distributions in the training set are representative of the true class distributions. However this assumption does not always hold. since the true class-distributions may be different. and in fact may vary significantly. The implication of this is that the effect on cost for a given classifier may be worse than expected. In this paper we address this issue. discussing a theoretical framework and methodology to assess the effect on cost for a classifier in imbalanced conditions. The methodology can be applied to many different types of costs. Some artificial experiments show how the methodology can be used to assess and compare classifiers.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is subject to random noise yielding measures that are different from their real values. and thus biasing the subsequently estimated tensors. The Non-Local Means (NLMeans) filter has recently been proposed to denoise MRI with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This filter has been shown to allow the best restoration of image intensities for the estimation of diffusion tensors (DT) compared to state-of-the-art methods. However. for DW-MR images with high b-values (and thus low SNR). the noise. which is strictly Rician-distributed. can no longer be approximated as additive white Gaussian. as implicitly assumed in the classical formulation of the NLMeans. High b-values are typically used in high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) or q-space imaging (QSI). for which an optimal restoration is critical.

We first show that NLMr filtering improves robustness of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and orientation distribution function (ODF) reconstructions from synthetic HARDI datasets. Our results suggest that the NLMr filtering improve the quality of anisotropy maps computed from ADC and ODF and improve the coherence of q-ball ODFs with the underlying anatomy while not degrading angular resolution. These results are shown on a biological phantom with known ground truth and on a real human brain dataset.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI) is very sensitive to corrupting noise due to the non linear relationship between the diffusion-weighted image intensities (DW-MRI) and the resulting diffusion tensor. Denoising is a crucial step to increase the quality of the estimated tensor field. This enhanced quality allows for a better quantification and a better image interpretation. The methods proposed in this paper are based on the Non-Local (NL) means algorithm. This approach uses the natural redundancy of information in images to remove the noise. We introduce three variations of the NL-means algorithms adapted to DW-MRI and to DT-MRI. Experiments were carried out on a set of 12 diffusion-weighted images (DW-MRI) of the same subject. The results show that the intensity based NL-means approaches give better results in the context of DT-MRI than other classical denoising methods. such as Gaussian …,True,LS54J0EAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,90,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75759-7_42,12431289647763707153,/scholar?cites=12431289647763707153,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-75759-7_42.pdf,0,0,0

The classical algorithm first matches points of both images by maximizing the iconic similarity of blocks of voxels around them. then estimates the rigid-body transformation best superposing these matched pairs of points. and iterates these two steps until convergence. In this formulation. only discrete translations are investigated in the block-matching step. which is likely to cause several problems. most notably a difficulty to tackle large rotations and to recover subvoxel transformations.

Determining the order in which these operations were applied. however. remains an open challenge. Understanding this order is important because it not only provides greater insight into a signal's processing history. but it can also be used to determine a forger's behavior patterns or provide insight into who manipulated a signal.

In order to differentiate between these challenging visual categories. it is helpful to leverage additional information. Geolocation is a rich source of additional information that can be used to improve fine-grained classification accuracy. but has been understudied. Our contributions to this field are twofold. First. to the best of our knowledge. this is the first paper which systematically examined various ways of incorporating geolocation information into fine-grained image classification through the use of geolocation priors. post-processing or feature modulation. Secondly. to overcome the situation where no fine-grained dataset has complete geolocation information. we release two fine-grained datasets with geolocation by providing complementary information to existing popular datasets-iNaturalist and YFCC100M. By leveraging geolocation information we improve top-1 accuracy in iNaturalist from 70.1% to 79.0% for a strong baseline image-only model. Comparing several models. we found that best performance was achieved by a post-processing model that consumed the output of the image-only baseline alongside geolocation. However. for a resource-constrained model (MobileNetV2). performance was better with a feature modulation model that trains jointly over pixels and geolocation: accuracy increased from 59.6% to 72.2%.

While forensic techniques currently exist to determine a signal's acquisition history. these techniques do not account for the possibility that a signal could be compressively sensed. This is an important problem since compressive sensing techniques have seen increased popularity in recent years. In this paper. we propose a set of forensic techniques to identify signals acquired by compressive sensing. We do this by first identifying the fingerprints left in a signal by compressive sensing. We then propose two compressive sensing detection techniques that can operate on a broad class of signals. Since compressive sensing fingerprints can be confused with fingerprints left by traditional image compression techniques. we propose a forensic technique specifically designed to identify compressive sensing in digital images.

Because of this. antiforensic techniques have been developed that allow a forger to conceal manipulation fingerprints. However. when antiforensic techniques are applied to multimedia content. distortion may be introduced. or the data size may be increased. Furthermore. when compressing an antiforensically modified forgery. a tradeoff between the rate and distortion is introduced into the system. As a result. a forger must balance three factors. such as how much the fingerprints can be forensically concealed. the data rate. and the distortion. are interrelated to form a 3D tradeoff. In this paper. we characterize this tradeoff by defining concealability and using it to measure the effectiveness of an antiforensic attack.

While there are many forensic techniques developed to identify the use of a single manipulation operation. a few has considered the cases where multiple operations may be involved. In these cases. investigators not only need to identify the use of each operation. but also need to detect the order of these operations. However. due to the interplay among operations. the order of operations may not always be detectable. This leads to a fundamental question of when we can and cannot detect the order of operations.

These data-driven services contribute to mitigate major problems arising from the ever growing need of transport in our daily lives. Despite the progress. there is still need for an enhanced and distributed solution that can exploit the data from the available systems and provide an appropriate and real-time reaction on transportation systems. Therefore. in this paper. we present a new architecture where the intelligence is distributed and the decisions are decentralized. The proposed architecture is scalable since the incremental addition of new peripheral subsystems is supported by the introduction of gateways which requires no reengineering of the communication infrastructure. The proposed architecture is deployed to tackle the problem of traffic management inefficiency in urban areas. where traffic load is substantially increased. by vehicles moving around unnecessarily. to find a free parking space. This can be significantly reduced through the availability and diffusion of local information regarding vacant parking slots to drivers in a given area.

Most importantly. the assessment of damaged aerial power lines and rusted conductors is of extreme importance for public safety; hence. power lines and associated components must be periodically inspected to ensure a continuous supply and to identify any fault and defect. To achieve these objectives. recently. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used; in fact. they provide a safe way to bring sensors close to the power transmission lines and their associated components without halting the equipment during the inspection. and reducing operational cost and risk. In this work. a drone. equipped with multi-modal sensors. captures images in the visible and infrared domain and transmits them to the ground station. We used state-of-the-art computer vision methods to highlight expected faults (ie. hot spots) or damaged components of the electrical infrastructure (ie. damaged insulators). Infrared imaging. which is invariant to large scale and illumination changes in the real operating environment. supported the identification of faults in power transmission lines; while a neural network is adapted and trained to detect and classify insulators from an optical video stream.

Intelligent video analytics deployed directly on board embedded sensors offers great opportunities to gather highly informative data about traffic and transport. allowing reconstruction of a real-time neat picture of urban mobility patterns. In this paper. we present a visual sensor network in which each node embeds computer vision logics for analyzing in real time urban traffic. The nodes in the network share their perceptions and build a global and comprehensive interpretation of the analyzed scenes in a cooperative and adaptive fashion. This is possible thanks to an especially designed Internet of Things (IoT) compliant middleware which encompasses in-network event composition as well as full support of Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication mechanism. The potential of the proposed cooperative visual sensor network is shown with two sample applications in urban mobility connected to the estimation of vehicular flows and parking management. Besides providing detailed results of each key component of the proposed solution. the validity of the approach is demonstrated by extensive field tests that proved the suitability of the system in providing a scalable. adaptable and extensible data collection layer for managing and understanding mobility in smart cities.

Even with this user supplied data. colorized images may appear unnatural as a result of limited user skill or inaccurate transfer of colors. To address these problems. we propose a colorization system that leverages the rich image content on the internet.

Given a video sequence of depth images. we segment humans from the depth images and represent these segmented bodies as a sequence of codewords. We exploit unique poses of an activity and the temporal ordering of these poses to learn subsequences of codewords which are strongly discriminative for the activity.

These descriptors are constructed from two types of image primitives: quadrangles and ellipses. The primitives are extracted from an image based on human cognitive psychology and model local parts of objects. Experiments reveal that these primitives densely cover objects in images. In this regard. structural information of an object can be comprehensively described by these primitives. It is found that a combination of simple spatial relationships between primitives plus a small set of geometrical attributes provide rich and accurate local structural descriptions of objects.

Such images comprise repetitive and symmetric patterns. which render popular algorithms e.g.. SIFT to be ineffective. Feature descriptors such as SIFT that are based on region patches are also unstable under large viewing angle variations. In this paper. we integrate both the appearance and geometric properties of an image to find unique matches. First we extract hypotheses of building facades based on a robust line fitting algorithm.

Our work is inspired by Reid's multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm which is an optimal solution to the motion correspondence that occurs in multi-object tracking. Unfortunately. the exponential growth of the hypotheses tree precludes practical applications. To restrict this growth. many approximations relying on a series of clustering and pruning operations have been proposed. The decisions for these operations are based solely on previous observations and are not guided by observations in later frames. We show that due to multiple splits and merges. relying solely on previous observations to guide these operations may inadvertently eliminate the correct hypothesis. Consequently. this leads to poor tracking performance.

While capable of distinguishing between real and recaptured images. a key weakness of these methods is their reliance on an appropriate choice of the model used.

Since an ECG may be of different lengths and as being a non-stationary signal. the irregularity may not be periodic instead it can be shown up at any interval of the signal. it is difficult for physician to analyze ECG manually. In the present study an algorithm has been developed to preprocess and to automatically determine the RR interval of ECG signal based on Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT). The developed algorithm initially performs preprocessing of a signal in order to remove Baseline Drift (De-trending) and noise (De-noising) from the signal and then it uses the preprocessed signal for finding RR interval of the ECG signal automatically. By using developed algorithm. the accuracy of the analysis can be increased and the analysis time can be reduced.,True,_eR6E_QAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,23,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.301.986,2177102992840962071,/scholar?cites=2177102992840962071,,,,0,0,0

Recent research works achieved the goal of predicting the structural failure of the RC structure with the assistance of machine learning techniques. Previously. the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been trained supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to classify RC structures with reasonable accuracy. Though. keeping in mind the sensitivity in predicting the structural failure. more accurate models are still absent in the context of Machine Learning. Since the efficiency of multiobjective optimization over single objective optimization techniques is well established. Thus. the motivation of the current work is to employ a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to train the Neural Network (NN) based model. In the present work. the NN has been trained with MOGA to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Maximum Error (ME) toward optimizing the weight vector of the NN.

Hargraves and Ashwin Belle and Ou,2013,The Scientific World Journal,doi:10.1155/2013/896056,10 pages,Hindawi Publishing Corporation,Noise can compromise the extraction of some fundamental and important features from biomedical signals and hence prohibit accurate analysis of these signals. Baseline wander in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is one such example. which can be caused by factors such as respiration. variations in electrode impedance. and excessive body movements. Unless baseline wander is effectively removed. the accuracy of any feature extracted from the ECG. such as timing and duration of the ST-segment. is compromised. This paper approaches this filtering task from a novel standpoint by assuming that the ECG baseline wander comes from an independent and unknown source. The technique utilizes a hierarchical method including a blind source separation (BSS) step. in particular independent component analysis. to eliminate the effect of the baseline wander.

Accurate results of cell nuclei segmentation are often adapted to a variety of applications such as the detection of cancerous cell nuclei and the observation of overlapping cellular events occurring during wound healing process in the human body. In this paper. an automated entropy-based thresholding system for segmentation and quantification of cell nuclei from histologically stained images has been presented. The proposed translational computation system aims to integrate clinical insight and computational analysis by identifying and segmenting objects of interest within histological images. Objects of interest and background regions are automatically distinguished by dynamically determining 3 optimal threshold values for the 3 color components of an input image. The threshold values are determined by means of entropy computations that are based on probability distributions of the color intensities of pixels and the spatial similarity of pixel intensities within neighborhoods. The effectiveness of the proposed system was tested over 21 histologically stained images containing approximately 1800 cell nuclei. and the overall performance of the algorithm was found to be promising. with high accuracy and precision values.,True,DKZh4FoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,18,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2013/592790/abs/,8083347820900696780,/scholar?cites=8083347820900696780,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2013/592790/abs/,0,0,0

Most of the previous methods model the line pattern noise in original image domain. which fail to explicitly exploit the directional characteristic. thus resulting in a redundant subspace with poor representation ability for those line pattern noise. To achieve a compact subspace for the line pattern structure. in this work. we incorporate a transformation into the image decomposition model so that maps the input image to a domain where the line pattern streak/stripe appearance has an extremely distinct low-rank structure. which naturally allows us to enforce a low-rank prior to extract the line pattern streak/stripe from the noisy image. Moreover. the random noise is usually mixed up with the line pattern noise. which makes the challenging problem much more difficult. While previous methods resort to the spectral or temporal correlation of the multi-images. we give a detailed analysis between the noisy and clean image in both local gradient and nonlocal domain. and propose a compositional directional total variational and low-rank prior for the image layer. thus to simultaneously accommodate both types of noise.

Meanwhile. the spectral correlation can be depicted by the multiple channels of the learned 2-D filters. namely. the number of filters in each layer. The consequent advantages of our CNN-based HSI denoising method (HSI-DeNet) over previous methods are threefold. First. the proposed HSI-DeNet can be regarded as a tensor-based method by directly learning the filters in each layer without damaging the spectral-spatial structures.

1285789,Hyper-Laplacian regularized unidirectional low-rank tensor recovery for multispectral image denoising,2017,Yi Chang and Luxin Yan and Sheng Zhong,,,,,,Recent low-rank based matrix/tensor recovery methods have been widely explored in multispectral images (MSI) denoising. These methods. however. ignore the difference of the intrinsic structure correlation along spatial sparsity. spectral correlation and non-local self-similarity mode. In this paper. we go further by giving a detailed analysis about the rank properties both in matrix and tensor cases. and figure out the non-local self-similarity is the key ingredient. while the low-rank assumption of others may not hold. This motivates us to design a simple yet effective unidirectional low-rank tensor recovery model that is capable of truthfully capturing the intrinsic structure correlation with reduced computational burden. However. the low-rank models suffer from the ringing artifacts. due to the aggregation of overlapped patches/cubics. While previous methods resort to spatial information. we offer a new perspective by utilizing the exclusively spectral information in MSIs to address the issue. The analysis-based hyper-Laplacian prior is introduced to model the global spectral structures. so as to indirectly alleviate the ringing artifacts in spatial domain. The advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones are multi-fold: more reasonably structure correlation representability. less processing time. and less artifacts in the overlapped regions. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on several benchmarks. and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MSI denoising methods.,True,I1nZ67YAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,65,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Chang_Hyper-Laplacian_Regularized_Unidirectional_CVPR_2017_paper.html,9858411494642709449,/scholar?cites=9858411494642709449,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Chang_Hyper-Laplacian_Regularized_Unidirectional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf,0,0,0

All the elements captured in the depth scene are recognized by means of an Ad-Hoc segmentation algorithm. which analyzes the raw depth data directly provided by the sensor. The system extracts the elements. and implements a solution to classify all the blobs in the scene. Anthropometric relationships and features are exploited to recognize one or more human subjects among the blobs. Once a person is detected. he is followed by a tracking algorithm between different frames. The use of a reference depth frame. containing the set-up of the scene. allows one to extract a human subject. even when he/she is interacting with other objects. such as chairs or desks. In addition. the problem of blob fusion is taken into account and efficiently solved through an inter-frame processing algorithm. A fall is detected if the depth blob associated to a person is near to the floor. Experimental tests show the effectiveness of the proposed solution. even in complex scenarios.

1285810,Kinect as a Tool for Gait Analysis: Validation of a Real-Time Joint Extraction Algorithm Working in Side View,2015,Enea Cippitelli and Samuele Gasparrini and Susanna Spinsante and Ennio Gambi,15,Sensors,1,1417-1434,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The Microsoft Kinect sensor has gained attention as a tool for gait analysis for several years. Despite the many advantages the sensor provides. however. the lack of a native capability to extract joints from the side view of a human body still limits the adoption of the device to a number of relevant applications. This paper presents an algorithm to locate and estimate the trajectories of up to six joints extracted from the side depth view of a human body captured by the Kinect device. The algorithm is then applied to extract data that can be exploited to provide an objective score for the “Get Up and Go Test”. which is typically adopted for gait analysis in rehabilitation fields. Starting from the depth-data stream provided by the Microsoft Kinect sensor. the proposed algorithm relies on anthropometric models only. to locate and identify the positions of the joints. Differently from machine learning approaches. this solution avoids complex computations. which usually require significant resources. The reliability of the information about the joint position output by the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to a marker-based system. Tests show that the trajectories extracted by the proposed algorithm adhere to the reference curves better than the ones obtained from the skeleton generated by the native applications provided within the Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corporation. Redmond. WA. USA. 2013) and OpenNI (OpenNI organization. Tel Aviv. Israel. 2013) Software Development Kits.

Compared to conventional methods for Heart Rate (HR) detection that employ expensive and/or uncomfortable devices. such as the Electrocardiograph (ECG) or pulse oximeter. contactless HR detection offers fast and continuous monitoring of heart activities and provides support for clinical analysis without the need for the user to wear a device. This paper presents a validation study for a contactless HR estimation method exploiting RGB (Red. Green. Blue) data from a Microsoft Kinect v2 device. This method. based on Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM). Photoplethysmography (PPG) and Videoplethysmography (VPG). can achieve performance comparable to classical approaches exploiting wearable systems. under specific test conditions. The output given by a Holter. which represents the gold-standard device used in the test for ECG extraction. is considered as the ground-truth. while a comparison with a commercial smartwatch is also included. The validation process is conducted with two modalities that differ for the availability of a priori knowledge about the subjects’ normal HR. The two test modalities provide different results. In particular. the HR estimation differs from the ground-truth by 2% when the knowledge about the subject’s lifestyle and his/her HR is considered and by 3.4% if no information about the person is taken into account.

In particular. by use of a double-exposure approach. simultaneous determination of vibration mode shape and mean static state deformation during a vibration cycle are obtained. The subtraction of two numerically reconstructed digital holograms recorded at the same resonant frequency but with a small difference in amplitude shows the mixing of Bessel-type time-averaged fringes owing to vibration and of the double-exposure fringes owing to differences in the mean deformation of the object. It is shown that separation of these fringe patterns can be readily accomplished numerically. An experimental demonstration of this effect by use of in-line digital holography for relatively small membranes is demonstrated.,True,mLuLQtoAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,46,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-45-11-2391,17162178047606022027,/scholar?cites=17162178047606022027,,,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10220/7025/1/paper.pdf,0,0,0

Although HR is mostly error free. inherent or environmental conditions that either suppress or induce HR cause genomic instability. Despite its importance in carcinogenesis. due to limitations in our ability to detect HR in vivo. little is known about HR in mammalian tissues. Here. we describe a mouse model in which a direct repeat HR substrate is targeted to the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 locus. In the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-GFP (RaDR-GFP) mice. HR between two truncated EGFP expression cassettes can yield a fluorescent signal. In-house image analysis software provides a rapid method for quantifying recombination events within intact tissues. and the frequency of recombinant cells can be evaluated by flow cytometry. A comparison among 11 tissues shows that the frequency of recombinant cells varies by more than two orders of magnitude among tissues. wherein HR in the brain is the lowest. Additionally. de novo recombination events accumulate with age in the colon. showing that this mouse model can be used to study the impact of chronic exposures on genomic stability. Exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. an alkylating agent similar to the cancer chemotherapeutic temozolomide. shows that the colon. liver and pancreas are susceptible to DNA damage-induced HR. Finally. histological analysis of the underlying cell types reveals that pancreatic acinar cells and liver hepatocytes undergo HR and also that HR can be specifically detected in colonic somatic stem cells.

This is particularly useful for dynamic characterization of microelectromechanical systems devices. To achieve this. there is a need to magnify the object wave. which is done using a diverging beam. It is observed that an increase in the object-to-CCD distance increases the sensitivity of the amplitude-modulated time-average fringes. At the same time the effect on phase information that represents the mean static deformation of a vibrating object is studied. It is also observed that a reduction in the object-to-CCD distance increases the phase sensitivity as evidenced by the double-exposure time-average fringes.

It was found that the degeneracy of the modes with at least one nodal diameter is broken. even though it was expected that these orthogonal modes are degenerated in frequency (Meirovitch 1967 Analytical Methods in Vibrations (New York: Macmillan)). These non-degenerated modes are correlated to the lack of symmetry of the PCM. mainly imposed by the top electrode configuration.

Materials and Methods After a first MRI (MRI1). 29 ALS patients were clinically followed during 12 months; 14/29 patients underwent a second MRI (MRI2) at 11±3 months. Cross-sectional area (CSA) that has been shown to be a marker of lower motor neuron degeneration was measured in cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord from T2-weighted images. Fractional anisotropy (FA). axial/radial/mean diffusivities (λ⊥. λ//. MD) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were measured within the lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical region. Imaging metrics were compared with clinical scales: Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and manual muscle testing (MMT) score.  Results At MRI1. CSA correlated significantly (P<0.05) with MMT and arm ALSFRS-R scores. FA correlated significantly with leg ALFSRS-R scores. One year after MRI1. CSA predicted (P<0.01) arm ALSFSR-R subscore and FA predicted (P<0.01) leg ALSFRS-R subscore. From MRI1 to MRI2. significant changes (P<0.01) were detected for CSA and MTR.

However. these endpoints are general. variable and late-stage measures of the ALS disease process and thus require the long-term assessment of large cohorts.

Advanced MRI methods can detect changes related to the degeneration of upper motor neurons but have also demonstrated the participation of other systems such as the sensory system or basal ganglia. demonstrating in vivo that ALS is a multisystem disorder. Structural and functional imaging also allows studying dysfunction of brain areas associated with cognitive signs. From a biomarker perspective. numerous studies using diffusion tensor imaging showed a decrease of fractional anisotropy in the intracranial portion of the corticospinal tract but its diagnostic value at the individual level remains limited. A multiparametric approach will be required to use MRI in the diagnostic workup of ALS. A promising avenue is the new methodological developments of spinal cord imaging that has the advantage to investigate the two motor system components that are involved in ALS. that is. the lower and upper motor neuron.

1285855,Feature selection using Haar wavelet power spectrum,2006,Prabakaran Subramani and Rajendra Sahu and Shekhar Verma,7,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-11,BioMed Central,Feature selection is an approach to overcome the 'curse of dimensionality' in complex researches like disease classification using microarrays. Statistical methods are utilized more in this domain. Most of them do not fit for a wide range of datasets. The transform oriented signal processing domains are not probed much when other fields like image and video processing utilize them well. Wavelets. one of such techniques. have the potential to be utilized in feature selection method. The aim of this paper is to assess the capability of Haar wavelet power spectrum in the problem of clustering and gene selection based on expression data in the context of disease classification and to propose a method based on Haar wavelet power spectrum. Haar wavelet power spectra of genes were analysed and it was observed to be different in different diagnostic categories. This difference in trend and magnitude of the spectrum may be utilized in gene selection. Most of the genes selected by earlier complex methods were selected by the very simple present method. Each earlier works proved only few genes are quite enough to approach the classification problem [1]. Hence the present method may be tried in conjunction with other classification methods. The technique was applied without removing the noise in data to validate the robustness of the method against the noise or outliers in the data. No special softwares or complex implementation is needed. The qualities of the genes selected by the present method were analysed through their gene expression data.

Weather condition is the state of atmosphere at a given time in terms of weather variables like rainfall. cloud conditions. temperature. etc.. the existing models use data mining techniques to predict the rainfall. The main disadvantage of these systems is that it doesn’t provide an estimate of the predicted rainfall. The system calculates average of values and understand the state of atmosphere. which doesn’t yield estimate results. This paper represents a mathematical method called Linear Regression to predict the rainfall in various districts in southern states of India. The Linear Regression method is modified in order to obtain the most optimum error percentage by iterating and adding some percentage of error to the input values. This method provides an estimate of rainfall using different atmospheric parameters like average temperature and cloud cover to predict the rainfall. The linear regression is applied on the set of data and the coefficients are used to predict the rainfall based on the corresponding values of the parameters. The main advantage of this model is that this model estimates the rainfall based on the previous correlation between the different atmospheric parameters.

The protocol is inspired by the natural behaviour of ants and a cognitive component provides the capabilities to dynamically allocate resources. in accordance with the emergency degree of each patient. The intra-cluster emergency reporting is inspired by the different capabilities of leg-manipulated ants. The inter-cluster reporting is aided by the cooperative modulation diversity with spectrum sensing. which can detect new emergency reporting requests and forward them. Simulations results show the decrease of average delay time as the probability of opportunistic access increases. which privileges the emergency reporting related to the patients with higher priority of resources’ usage.

They can also be represented by saliency maps or minimum spanning trees. In this article. we precisely study the links between these three representations. In particular. we provide a new bijection between saliency maps and hierarchies based on quasi-flat zones as often used in image processing and we characterize saliency maps and minimum spanning trees as solutions to constrained minimization problems where the constraint is quasi-flat zones preservation. In practice. these results make up a toolkit for designing new hierarchical methods where one can choose the most convenient representation. They also invite us to process non-image data with morphological hierarchies. More precisely. we show the practical interest of the proposed framework for: (i) hierarchical watershed image segmentations.

Heidelberg,Hierarchical image segmentation provides a region-oriented scale-space. i.e.. a set of image segmentations at different detail levels in which the segmentations at finer levels are nested with respect to those at coarser levels. Most image segmentation algorithms. such as region merging algorithms. rely on a criterion for merging that does not lead to a hierarchy. In addition. for image segmentation. the tuning of the parameters can be difficult. In this work. we propose a hierarchical graph based image segmentation relying on a criterion popularized by Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher.

The reason for this is given by the fact that such content is often prohibited in certain environments (e.g.. schools and workplaces) or for certain publics (e.g.. children). In recent years. many works have been mainly focused on detecting pornographic images and videos based on visual content. particularly on the detection of skin color. Although these approaches provide good results. they generally have the disadvantage of a high false positive rate since not all images with large areas of skin exposure are necessarily pornographic images. such as people wearing swimsuits or images related to sports. Local feature based approaches with Bag-of-Words models (BoW) have been successfully applied to visual recognition tasks in the context of pornography detection.

We propose a novel evaluation framework for the hierarchies of partitions designed to capture various aspects of those representations: precision of their regions and contours. possibility to extract high quality horizontal cuts and optimal non-horizontal cuts for image segmentation. and the ease of finding a set of regions representing a semantic object. This framework is used to assess and to optimize hierarchies with respect to the possible pre- and post-processing steps.

The introduction of this hierarchization problem in the form of an optimization problem. as well as the proposed tools to tackle it. is an important contribution of the present article. Indeed. with the hierarchized version of a segmentation method. the user can just select the level in the hierarchy. controlling the desired number of regions or can leverage on any of the tools introduced in hierarchical analysis.

These characteristics are exploited to first calculate the homogeneous texture of images followed by the rearrangement of features as a two-dimensional matrix (scale and orientation). where scaling and rotation of images correspond to shifting in this matrix. The shift invariance property of discrete fourier transform is used to propose rotation and scale invariant image features. The performance of the proposed feature set is evaluated on Brodatz texture album. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed descriptor as compared to other methods considered in this letter.,True,f95xkdgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,90,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6507262/,5112270764126710625,/scholar?cites=5112270764126710625,,,,0,0,0

Such challenges demand that automatic systems are able to give robust characterizations of tissues irrespective of camera rotation. zoom. and illumination gradients when viewing the inner surface of the gastrointestinal tract.

It is time-consuming to manually perform this process. Thus. efficient computer-assisted approaches are preferable. In this paper. we present an innovative method for the tracing and reconstruction of 3D neuronal morphology from light microscopy images. The method uses a prediction and refinement strategy that is based on exploration of local neuron structural features. We extended the rayburst sampling algorithm to a marching fashion. which starts from a single or a few seed points and marches recursively forward along neurite branches to trace and reconstruct the whole tree-like structure. A local radius-related but size-independent hemispherical sampling was used to predict the neurite centerline and detect branches. Iterative rayburst sampling was performed in the orthogonal plane. to refine the centerline location and to estimate the local radius.

We present the largest map of connectivity to date between cortical neurons of a defined type (L2/3 pyramidal cells). which was enabled by automated analysis of serial section electron microscopy images with improved handling of image defects. We used the map to identify constraints on the learning algorithms employed by the cortex. Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes (Arellano et al.. 2007) by a log-normal distribution (Loewenstein. Kuras and Rumpel. 2011; de Vivo et al.. 2017; Santuy et al.. 2018). A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning. in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here we show that synapse size. when restricted to synapses between L2/3 pyramidal cells. is well-modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size (Sorra and Harris. 1993; Koester and Johnston. 2005; Bartol et al.. 2015; Kasthuri et al.. 2015; Dvorkin and Ziv. 2016; Bloss et al.. 2018; Motta et al.. 2019). We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated. while the analog variables are not. Binary variation could be the outcome of a Hebbian or other synaptic plasticity rule depending on activity signals that are relatively uniform across neuronal arbors. while analog variation may be dominated by other influences.

Here. we show that a subset of Doublesex+ pC1 neurons in the Drosophila female brain. called pC1d/e. can drive minutes-long changes in female behavior in the presence of males. Using automated reconstruction of a volume electron microscopic (EM) image of the female brain. we map all inputs and outputs to both pC1d and pC1e. This reveals strong recurrent connectivity between. in particular. pC1d/e neurons and a specific subset of Fruitless+ neurons called aIPg. We additionally find that pC1d/e activation drives long-lasting persistent neural activity in brain areas and cells overlapping with the pC1d/e neural network. including both Doublesex+ and Fruitless+ neurons.

This scheme generates a set of n shared images from a set of n secret images using the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and Boolean exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. This scheme works well if the number of secret images n is even number. However. the former scheme has a slight problem while the number of secret images n is an odd number.

1285995,A-lamp: Adaptive layout-aware multi-patch deep convolutional neural network for photo aesthetic assessment,2017,Shuang Ma and Jing Liu and Chang Wen Chen,,,,4535-4544,,Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been shown to generate promising results for aesthetics assessment. However. the performance of these deep CNN methods is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement. input images need to be transformed via cropping. warping. or padding. which often alter image composition. reduce image resolution. or cause image distortion. Thus the aesthetics of the original images is impaired because of potential loss of fine grained details and holistic image layout. However. such fine grained details and holistic image layout is critical for evaluating an image's aesthetics. In this paper. we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Convolutional Neural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This novel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images. and learn from both fined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously. To enable training on these hybrid inputs. we extend the method by developing a dedicated double-subnet neural network structure. ie a Multi-Patch subnet and a Layout-Aware subnet. We further construct an aggregation layer to effectively combine the hybrid features from these two subnets.

However. a prominent problem is the inconsistency between existing low bit-depth (LBD) images and HBD monitors. When LBD images are simply de-quantized to HBD ones. there will be severe false contour artifacts in smooth gradient areas. degrading image visual quality. Therefore. bit-depth enhancement plays a key role in viewing LBD images on HBD monitors. In this paper. motivated by the promising results of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in generating realistic high-quality images. we proposed a novel algorithm to recover photo-realistic HBD images. To the best of our knowledge. CNN is introduced to bit-depth enhancement task for the first time.

1286005,Quaternion color texture segmentation,2007,Lilong Shi and Brian Funt,107,Computer Vision and image understanding,1-2,88-96,Academic Press,The quaternion representation of color is shown here to be effective in the context of segmenting color images into regions of similar color texture. The advantage of using quaternion arithmetic is that a color can be represented and analyzed as a single entity. A low-dimensional basis for the color textures found in a given image is derived via quaternion principal component analysis (QPCA) of a training set of color texture samples. A color texture sample is then projected onto this basis to obtain a concise (single quaternion) description of the texture. To handle the large amount of training data. QPCA is extended to incremental QPCA. The power of the proposed quaternion color texture representation is demonstrated by its use in an unsupervised segmentation algorithm that successfully divides an image into regions on basis of texture.,True,U1cYF-IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,107,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314206002153,2028588715826392628,/scholar?cites=2028588715826392628,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.269.7147&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Given the image of a scene under unknown illumination. the chromaticity of the scene illumination can be found from the interpolated function. The resulting illumination-estimation method can be used to provide color constancy under changing illumination conditions and automatic white balancing for digital cameras. A thin-plate spline interpolates over a nonuniformly sampled input space. which in this case is a training set of image thumbnails and associated illumination chromaticities. To reduce the size of the training set. incremental k medians are applied. Tests on real images demonstrate that the thin-plate spline method can estimate the color of the incident illumination quite accurately. and the proposed training set pruning significantly decreases the computation.,True,U1cYF-IAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,32,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-28-5-940,3006942344423509706,/scholar?cites=3006942344423509706,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c318/28db553b51fbd607c6ec2449b227892bea1a.pdf,0,0,0

MaxRGB has usually been tested on images of only 8-bits per channel. The question arises as to whether the method itself is inadequate. or rather whether it has simply been tested on data of inadequate dynamic range. To address this question. a database of sets of exposure-bracketed images was created. The image sets include exposures ranging from very underexposed to slightly overexposed. The color of the scene illumination was determined by taking an extra image of the scene containing 4 Gretag Macbeth mini Colorcheckers placed at an angle to one another.

This approach generalizes the existing scalar-image curvature approach which makes use of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix [1]. In the case of vector-valued images. the Hessian is no longer a 2D matrix but rather a rank 3 tensor. We use quaternion curvature to derive vesselness measure for tubular structures in color or vector-valued images by extending Frangi's [1] vesselness measure for scalar images.

To wit. this dataset has at least 3 different sets of ground-truths. Typically. for a single algorithm a single ground-truth is used. But then different algorithms. whose performance is measured with respect to different ground-truths. are compared against each other and then ranked. This makes no sense. We show in this paper that there are also errors in how each ground-truth set was calculated. As a result. all performance rankings based on the ColorChecker dataset – and there are scores of these – are inaccurate.

Many institutions and organizations are working in this field to lead to a possible solution of the problem or to lead to more understanding of the problem. Many previous researches were studied for better understanding of the problem and the work done already to remove redundancy and contribute to the field. Wisconsin-Madison prognostic Breast cancer (WPBC) data set from the UCI machine learning repository was used for training of 198 individual cases by selecting best features out of 34 predictors. Feature selection algorithms were used with machine learning algorithms for feature reduction and for better classification. Different feature selection and generation algorithms were used to improve the accuracy of classification. Many improvements in accuracies were found out by using different approaches than the earlier studies conducted in the same field. The Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms showed 8.28-12.32% and 0.82-1.52% accuracy via 10 fold cross validation analysis improvement accordingly by using different feature selection and generation algorithms with these classifiers and gave better result than the best results known for these classification algorithms.,True,lyi9AhwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,15,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.403.7440&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16643877190677744774,/scholar?cites=16643877190677744774,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.403.7440&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Can we go further and adapt the gesturing style to follow a specific speaker? Gestures that are naturally timed with corresponding speech during human communication are called co-speech gestures. A key challenge. called gesture style transfer. is to learn a model that generates these gestures for a speaking agent ‘A’in the gesturing style of a target speaker ‘B’. A secondary goal is to simultaneously learn to generate co-speech gestures for multiple speakers while remembering what is unique about each speaker. We call this challenge style preservation. In this paper. we propose a new model. named Mix-StAGE. which trains a single model for multiple speakers while learning unique style embeddings for each speaker’s gestures in an end-to-end manner.

However it is time consuming and complicated for both the subject and the developer. Obtaining the spectral notches which are the most prominent features of HRTF is very important to reconstruct the head related impulse response (HRIR) accurately. In this paper. a method suitable for fast computation of the frequencies of spectral notches is proposed. The linear prediction residual cepstrum is used to compute the spectral notches with a high degree of accuracy in this work. Subsequent use of Batteaus Reflection model to overlay the spectral notches on the pinna images indicate that the proposed method is able to provide finer contours.

However low resource situations still adversely affect the generalizability of these models. We introduce a new family of models. called Lattice Recurrent Units (LRU). to address the challenge of learning deep multi-layer recurrent models with limited resources. LRU models achieve this goal by creating distinct (but coupled) flow of information inside the units: a first flow along time dimension and a second flow along depth dimension. It also offers a symmetry in how information can flow horizontally and vertically. We analyze the effects of decoupling three different components of our LRU model: Reset Gate. Update Gate and Projected State. We evaluate this family of new LRU models on computational convergence rates and statistical efficiency. Our experiments are performed on four publicly-available datasets. comparing with Grid-LSTM and Recurrent Highway networks.

Spectral Phase is not included in the decomposition process of these methods. However. phase of the speech mixture is generally used in reconstructing the target speech signal. This results in undesired traces of interfering sources in the target signal. In this paper the spectral phase is incorporated in the decomposition process itself. Additionally. the complex matrix factorization problem is reduced to an NMF problem using simple transformations. This results in effective separation of speech mixtures since both magnitude and phase are utilized jointly in the separation process.

In general. PSN can be extracted from the Head Related Impulse Response (HRIR) measured by a spherical array of microphones. However. the PSN extracted herein are computationally complex and also not accurate at lower elevation angles. This work proposes a novel approach to reconstruct the HRIR using microphones over the median plane of a virtual spherical array. The virtual spherical array itself is simulated using the Fourier Bessel series (FBS). Subsequently. these HRIRs are used to extract the PSN. This method is computationally efficient since it is done over the median plane rather than over the complete sphere.

Specifically. we exploit the probabilistic distribution of smooth graph signals defined with respect to the graph topology. This allows us to derive an explicit expression of the Wasserstein distance between graph signal distributions in terms of the graph Laplacian matrices. This leads to a structurally meaningful measure for comparing graphs. which is able to take into account the global structure of graphs. while most other measures merely observe local changes independently. Our measure is then used for formulating a new graph alignment problem. whose objective is to estimate the permutation that minimizes the distance between two graphs. We further propose an efficient stochastic algorithm based on Bayesian exploration to accommodate for the non-convexity of the graph alignment problem. We finally demonstrate the performance of our novel framework on different tasks like graph alignment. graph classification and graph signal prediction. and we show that our method leads to significant improvement with respect to the-state-of-art algorithms.,True,4znhuFcAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,21,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02085,5421392722747791030,/scholar?cites=5421392722747791030,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02085,0,0,0

For this purpose. various NDT were implemented to evaluate the mechanical and physical properties of concretes whose porosity is ranging from 12.5 to 18%. With regard to the mechanical waves. a technique founded on surface wave propagation detected by laser interferometry makes it possible to measure the phase velocity as a function of frequency. related to the concrete density and moduli. The results obtained are compared to those measured by impact echo. This method integrates the mechanical properties on all the thickness of the concrete slabs.

The attacker disrupts the security parameters by launching attacks at different layers of the WSN. In this paper. a protocol layer trust-based intrusion detection system (LB-IDS) is proposed to secure the WSN by detecting the attackers at different layers. The trust value of a sensor node is calculated using the deviation of trust metrics at each layer with respect to the attacks. Mainly. we consider trustworthiness in the three layers such as physical layer trust. media access control (MAC) layer trust. and network layer trust. The trust of a sensor node at a particular layer is calculated by taking key trust metrics of that layer. Finally. the overall trust value of the sensor node is estimated by combining the individual trust values of each layer. By applying the trust threshold. a sensor node is detected as trusted or malicious. The performance of LB-IDS is evaluated by comparing the results of the three performance parameters such as detection accuracy. false-positive rate. and false-negative rate. with the results of Wang’s scheme. We have implemented jamming attack at the physical layer. back-off manipulation attack at the MAC layer. and sinkhole attack at the network layer using simulations. We have also implemented a cross-layer attack using the simulation where an attacker simultaneously attacks the MAC layer and network layer.

The mapping is insensitive to similarity transformation; that is. the image of the polygon under the transformation is not affected by rotation. scaling or translations. Each polygon is associated with an essentially unique complex number. We perform an exhaustive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm using synthetic data generated from the star catalog with uniformly-distributed positional noise introduced to each star.

Multimodal interaction is part of this research. It allows conveying to the users information through different sensory channels. The use of more modalities than touch and vision augments the sense of presence in the virtual environment and can be useful to present the same information in various ways. In addition. multimodal interaction can sometimes be used to augment the perception of the user by transferring information that is not generally perceived in the real world. but which can be emulated by the virtual environment.

Consequently. validating dMRI's ability to assess the underlying fiber orientation in each voxel is critical for its use as a biomedical tool.

DTI computations are fundamentally estimation processes and are sensitive to noise and artifacts. Despite widespread adoption in the neuroimaging community. maintaining consistent DTI data quality remains challenging given the propensity for patient motion. artifacts associated with fast imaging techniques. and the possibility of hardware changes/failures. Furthermore. the quantity of data acquired per voxel. the non-linear estimation process. and numerous potential use cases complicate traditional visual data inspection approaches. Currently. quality inspection of DTI data has relied on visual inspection and individual processing in DTI analysis software programs (e.g. DTIPrep. DTI-studio).

This paper presents a real-time non-intrusive fatigue monitoring system which exploits the driver's facial expression to detect and alert fatigued drivers. The presented approach adopts the Viola-Jones classifier to detect the driver's facial features. The correlation coefficient template matching method is then applied to derive the state of each feature on a frame by frame basis. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is finally integrated within the system to classify the facial appearance as either fatigued or otherwise.

A homography-based approximation method is proposed which jointly searches for homographies to align the different views of the light field together with the low rank approximation matrices. We first consider a global homography per view and show that depending on the variance of the disparity across views. the global homography is not sufficient to well-align the entire images. In a second step. we thus consider multiple homographies. one per region. the region being extracted using depth information. We first show the benefit of the joint optimization of the homographies together with the low-rank approximation.

Unlike single-image deblurring. video-based approaches can take advantage of the abundant information that exists across neighboring frames. As a result the best performing methods rely on the alignment of nearby frames. However. aligning images is a computationally expensive and fragile procedure. and methods that aggregate information must therefore be able to identify which regions have been accurately aligned and which have not. a task that requires high level scene understanding. In this work. we introduce a deep learning solution to video deblurring. where a CNN is trained end-to-end to learn how to accumulate information across frames. To train this network. we collected a dataset of real videos recorded with a high frame rate camera. which we use to generate synthetic motion blur for supervision.

For this purpose. the Bernoulli (0.5) random noise calibration pattern introduced in a previous article is used. This leads to a well-posed near-optimal accurate estimation. First the pattern position and its illumination conditions are accurately estimated. This allows for accurate geometric registration and radiometric correction. Once these procedures are performed. the local PSF can be directly computed by inverting a linear system. This system is well-posed and consequently its inversion does not require any regularization or prior model.

1286156,Film grain noise modeling in advanced video coding,2007,Byung Tae Oh and C-C Jay Kuo and Shijun Sun and Shawmin Lei,6508,,,650811,International Society for Optics and Photonics,A new technique for film grain noise extraction. modeling and synthesis is proposed and applied to the coding of high definition video in this work. The film grain noise is viewed as a part of artistic presentation by people in the movie industry. On one hand. since the film grain noise can boost the natural appearance of pictures in high definition video. it should be preserved in high-fidelity video processing systems. On the other hand. video coding with film grain noise is expensive. It is desirable to extract film grain noise from the input video as a pre-processing step at the encoder and re-synthesize the film grain noise and add it back to the decoded video as a post-processing step at the decoder. Under this framework. the coding gain of the denoised video is higher while the quality of the final reconstructed video can still be well preserved.

Stanford University,Three-dimensional volumetric data are becoming increasingly available in a wide range of scientific and technical disciplines. With the right tools. we can expect such data to yield valuable insights about many important systems in our three-dimensional world. In this paper. we develop tools for the analysis of 3-D data which may contain structures built from lines. line segments. and filaments. These tools come in two main forms:(a) Monoscale: the X-ray transform. offering the collection of line integrals along a wide range of lines running through the image–at all different orientations and positions; and (b) Multiscale: the (3-D) beamlet transform. offering the collection of line integrals along line segments which. in addition to ranging through a wide collection of locations and positions. also occupy a wide range of scales. We describe three principles for computing these transforms: exact (slow) evaluation. approximate. recursive evaluation based on a multiscale divide-and-conquer approach. and fast exact evaluation based on the use of the two-dimensional Fast Slant Stack algorithm (Averbuch et al. 2001) applied to slices of sheared arrays.We compare these different computational strategies from the viewpoint of analysing the small 3-D datasets available currently. and the larger 3-D datasets surely to become available in the near future. as storage and processing power continue their exponential growth.

These tools rapidly compute multiscale X-ray transforms of the data volume. Subcubes of varying locations and scales are extracted from the data volume and each is analyzed by integrating along a strategically chosen set of line segments covering all different orientations. The underlying motivation is that point clouds with different degrees of filamentarity will lead to multiscale X-ray coefficients having different distributions when viewed at the right scale.

Nucleophilic addition of the Gly67 amide nitrogen to the Ser65 carbonyl carbon is catalyzed by the protein fold and leads to a heterocyclic intermediate. To investigate this mechanism. we substituted the highly conserved residues Arg96 and Glu222 in enhanced GFP (EGFP). In the R96M variant. the rate of chromophore formation is greatly reduced (time constant = 7.5 × 103 h. pH 7) and exhibits pH dependence. In the E222Q variant. the rate is also attenuated at physiological pH (32 h. pH 7) but is accelerated severalfold beyond that of EGFP at pH 9–10. In contrast. EGFP maturation is pH-independent and proceeds with a time constant of 1 h (pH 7–10).

In this paper. automatic segmentation and yield calculation of fruit based on shape analysis is presented. Color and shape analysis was utilized to segment the images of different fruits like apple. pomegranate. oranges. peach. litchi and plum obtained under different lighting conditions. First the input sectional tree image was converted from RGB colour space into the L* a* b colour space. The resultant image was then applied to the algorithm for fruit segmentation. The Edge detection and combination of a circular fitting algorithm was used for the automatic segmentation of fruit in the image. The resultant edge points were then used for fitting the approximate circular shape. The resultant fitted circles were used as a count of total number of fruits in an image. Hundred sectional tree images of different fruits were used for the segmentation and yield measurement.

1286198,Efficient focus sampling through depth-of-field calibration,2015,Said Pertuz and Miguel Angel Garcia and Domenec Puig,112,International Journal of Computer Vision,3,342-353,Springer US,Due to the limited depth-of-field (DOF) of conventional digital cameras. only the objects within a certain distance range from the camera are in focus. Objects outside the DOF are observed with different amounts of defocus depending on their position. Focus sampling consists of capturing different images of the same scene by changing the focus configuration of the camera in order to alternately bring objects at different depths into focus. Focus sampling is an important part of different focus-related applications such as autofocus. focus stacking and depth estimation. This work proposes a calibration procedure for modeling the depth-of-field of conventional cameras in order to perform an efficient focus sampling. The method is simple in terms of repeatability and can be easily implemented in different imaging devices.

1286199,Improving shape-from-focus by compensating for image magnification shift,2010,Said Pertuz and Domenec Puig and Miguel Angel Garcia,,,,802-805,IEEE,Images taken with different focus settings are used in shape-from-focus to reconstruct the depth map of a scene. A problem when acquiring images with different focus settings is the shift of image features due to changes in magnification. This paper shows that those changes affect the shape-from-focus performance and that the final reconstruction can be improved by compensating for that shift. The proposed scheme takes into account the effects due to magnification changes between near and far focused images and it is able to determine the depth of the scene points with higher accuracy than traditional techniques.

However. most of the metric depth estimation methods in the state-of-the-art leverage pixel disparity only. In this paper. we tackle the problem of focus-based metric depth estimation in standard plenoptic cameras. For this purpose we propose a closed-form model that relates the refocusing parameter with the focus distance of a plenoptic camera in order to allow for metric depth estimation. Based on the proposed model. we develop a calibration procedure that allows finding the parameters of the model. Using measurements of a time-of-flight sensor as ground-truth. experimental validation in a distance range of 0.2–1.6 m shows that focus-based depth estimation is feasible with a root-mean-squared error of less than 5 cm.,True,HYQ3AhMAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271618301837,2711328917213369755,/scholar?cites=2711328917213369755,,,,0,0,0

However. those strategies can only generate shallow appearance features with limited representative ability for classes with high interclass similarity and spatial diversity and therefore reduce the classification accuracy. To this end. we present a novel HSIC framework. named deep multiscale spatial-spectral feature extraction algorithm. which focuses on learning effective discriminant features for HSIC.

However. it is still a challenging task to fuse and classify these VHR images. Generally. there are two ways for the fusion and classification of panchromatic and MS images. One way is to use a panchromatic image to sharpen an MS image. and then classify a pan-sharpened MS image. Another way is to extract features from panchromatic and MS images. respectively. and then combine these features for classification. In this paper. we propose a superpixel-based multiple local convolution neural network (SML-CNN) model for panchromatic and MS images classification.

Salient areas of an image always are discriminative and different from other areas. which make them easily noticed. The strong visual contrast of local areas makes saliency suitable to guide the change detection of SAR images. where exists a difference between the two images.

It is a challenge to classify the hybrid terrain types as semantic homogeneous regions for unsupervised polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image classification. since there are sharp bright-dark variations in intensity. In this paper. a hierarchical semantic model (HSM) is proposed for PolSAR images. which overcomes the above shortcoming by constructing the primal-level and middle-level semantics. The primal-level semantic is a polarimetric sketch map consisting of sketch segments. which is the sparse representation of a PolSAR image. The middle-level semantic is a region map which can extract hybrid terrain types as semantic homogeneous regions from the sketch map.

For instance. it directs vesicle delivery. and modulates membrane adhesions pivotal for cell movement as well as mitosis. Abnormal function of the microtubules is involved in cancer. An effective method to observe microtubule function adjacent to the cortex is TIRFM. To date most analysis of TIRFM images has been done by visual inspection and manual tracing.

These lead to non-biological intensity non-uniformities across the image. They can complicate further image analysis such as registration and tissue segmentation. Existing methods for intensity uniformity restoration have been optimized for 1.5 T. but they are less effective for 3.0 T MRI. and not at all satisfactory for higher fields. Also. many of the existing restoration algorithms require a brain template or use a prior atlas. which can restrict their practicalities. In this study an effective intensity uniformity restoration algorithm has been developed based on non-parametric statistics of high order local intensity co-occurrences.

1286227,Robust video stabilization to outlier motion using adaptive RANSAC,2009,Sunglok Choi and Taemin Kim and Wonpil Yu,,,,1897-1902,IEEE,The core step of video stabilization is to estimate global motion from locally extracted motion clues. Outlier motion clues are generated from moving objects in image sequence. which cause incorrect global motion estimates. Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is popularly used to solve such outlier problem. RANSAC needs to tune parameters with respect to the given motion clues. so it sometimes fail when outlier clues are increased than before. Adaptive RANSAC is proposed to solve this problem. which is based on maximum likelihood sample consensus (MLESAC). It estimates the ratio of outliers through expectation maximization (EM). which entails the necessary number of iteration for each frame. The adaptation sustains high accuracy in varying ratio of outliers and faster than RANSAC when fewer iteration is enough.

Randomization procedures do not balance residual effects that possibly exist in Latin square experiments. A spreadsheet-based program is available for making Latin square designs balanced for the first-order residual effects. The balance of remote residual effects may also be very important to consider when a relatively long latent period exists after a treatment. We have developed a spreadsheet-based program. the Completely Balanced Latin Square Designer (CBLSD). to facilitate the generation of Latin squares (n= prime number–1) balanced for immediate and remote carryover effects. The program allows a user to choose the number of treatments that is equal to the number of animals and periods in a square. A user may also input the number of squares. Then. the CBLSD instantly generates a Latin square balanced for the multi-order as well as first-order carryover effects. Also provided is a schedule table for an experiment sorted by period and animal.

The electrostatic and magnetic potentials modulate the electron wavefront phase. The error in measurement of the phase therefore determines the smallest observable changes in electric and magnetic properties. Here we explore the summation of a hologram series to reduce the phase error and thereby improve the sensitivity of electron holography.

Modifications of the usual Fourier reconstruction procedure have been used to combine series of holograms for sensitivity improvement with a phase-shifting method for doubling the spatial resolution.

In this approach we also use density minimum support so that we reduce the execution time. A frequent superset means it contains more transactions then the minimum support. It utilize the concept that if the item set is not frequent but the superset may be frequent which is consider for the further data mining task. By this approach we can store the transaction on the daily basis. then we provide three different density zone based on the transaction and minimum support which is low (L). Medium (M). High (H). Based on this approach we categorize the item set for pruning. Our approach is based on apriori algorithm but provides better reduction in time because of the prior separation in the data. which is useful for selecting according to the density wise distribution in India.

LiteFlowNet2 is built on the foundation laid by conventional methods and resembles the corresponding roles as data fidelity and regularization in variational methods. We compute optical flow in a spatial-pyramid formulation as SPyNet but through a novel lightweight cascaded flow inference. It provides high flow estimation accuracy through early correction with seamless incorporation of descriptor matching. Flow regularization is used to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow boundaries through feature-driven local convolutions. Our network also owns an effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2 and SPyNet. Comparing to LiteFlowNet. LiteFlowNet2 improves the optical flow accuracy on Sintel Clean by 23.3%. Sintel Final by 12.8%. KITTI 2012 by 19.6%. and KITTI 2015 by 18.8%. while being 2.2 times faster.

1286261,Solder Paste Inspection Using Region-Based Defect Detection,2009,Tak-Wai Hui and Grantham Kwok-Hung Pang,42,The International journal of advanced manufacturing technology,7-8,725,Springer-Verlag,This paper introduces a new method to detect for solder paste defects on printed circuit board. This method not only recognizes volumetric defect but also shape deformity. It involves the use of the region-based classification technique. The 3D profile of solder paste block is first reconstructed using phase shift profilometry. The reconstructed 3D profile is then divided into several regions by geometric segmentation. The resulted regions include edges and top surface. Several features which represent their regions most are extracted and analyzed from the solder paste blocks. Regional classifiers are applied to process these feature spaces. The classifier outputs are then combined to form final detection result for each solder paste block. The performance of the region-based defect detection method is evaluated using 150 and 200 μm solder paste blocks.,True,U210xGIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,29,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00170-008-1639-6.pdf,2830617595178923613,/scholar?cites=2830617595178923613,,,,0,0,0

Two sinusoidal patterns which are pi-out-of-phase are used in the 3-D reconstruction. The new method uses only two fringe patterns rather than four as the four-step phase shift profilometry (4-step PSP). In Fourier transform profilometry (FTP). a bandpass filter is required to extract the fundamental spectrum from the background and higher order harmonics due to camera noise and imperfectness of the pattern projector. By using two pi-out-of-phase sinusoidal fringe patterns. the background term can be eliminated directly by taking the average of the two fringe patterns. The fringe pattern which is close to its ideal form can also be recovered from the averaging process. Prefiltering is utilized in filtering raw images to remove noise causing higher order harmonics …,True,U210xGIAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,26,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4634597/,2808620108056087524,/scholar?cites=2808620108056087524,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37894549.pdf,0,0,0

We have designed an imaging system that has a wide field of view by fixating a number of cameras together to form an approximate spherical eye. With a substantially widened visual field. we discover that estimating the directions of translation and rotation components of the motion separately are possible and particularly efficient. In addition. the inherent ambiguities between translation and rotation also disappear. Magnitude of rotation is recovered subsequently. Experimental results on synthetic and real image data are provided.

1286264,Inter-Region Affinity Distillation for Road Marking Segmentation,2020,Yuenan Hou and Zheng Ma and Chunxiao Liu and Tak-Wai Hui and Chen Change Loy,,,,,,We study the problem of distilling knowledge from a large deep teacher network to a much smaller student network for the task of road marking segmentation. In this work. we explore a novel knowledge distillation (KD) approach that can transfer'knowledge'on scene structure more effectively from a teacher to a student model. Our method is known as Inter-Region Affinity KD (IntRA-KD). It decomposes a given road scene image into different regions and represents each region as a node in a graph. An inter-region affinity graph is then formed by establishing pairwise relationships between nodes based on their similarity in feature distribution. To learn structural knowledge from the teacher network. the student is required to match the graph generated by the teacher. The proposed method shows promising results on three large-scale road marking segmentation benchmarks. ie. ApolloScape. CULane and LLAMAS. by taking various lightweight models as students and ResNet-101 as the teacher. IntRA-KD consistently brings higher performance gains on all lightweight models. compared to previous distillation methods.

1286265,Depth Enhancement Using RGB-D Guided Filtering,2014,Tak-Wai Hui and King Ngi Ngan,,,,3832-3836,IEEE,Depth maps from low-cost RGB-D system are generally noisy and not accurate enough. Holes often exist in the depth maps. Bilateral filter is commonly utilized to perform depth enhancement. However. it requires high computational time. Its texture transferring property also makes those boundaries between textured and homogeneous regions in the filtered depth map far from satisfactory. In this paper. we present a method to filter raw depth maps using a RGB-D guided filtering in a two-stage framework.

However. RGB-D system generally suffers from two main problems. The spatial resolution of the depth image is low. The depth image often contains numerous holes where no depth measurements are available. This can be due to bad infra-red reflectance properties of some objects in the scene. Since the spatial resolution of the color image is generally higher than that of the depth image. this paper introduces a new method to enhance the depth images captured by a moving RGB-D system using the depth cues from the induced optical flow. We not only fill the holes in the raw depth images. but also recover fine details of the imaged scene. We address the problem of depth image enhancement by minimizing an energy functional. In order to reduce the computational complexity. we have treated the textured and homogeneous regions in the color images differently.

1286267,3D Profile Reconstruction of Solder Paste Based on Phase Shift Profilometry,2007,Tak-Wai Hui and Grantham Kwok-Hung Pang,,,,165-170,,Phase profilometry is an effective and efficient way to reconstruct 3D profile of objects through an optical method. It requires a pattern generator to project sinusoidal pattern onto objects. The deformed pattern is then captured by camera. However. noise from camera. distortion of lens. and imperfectness of projector cause trouble to the 3D profile reconstruction. It is necessary to filter the images before applying phase profilometry. In this paper. a 4-step phase shift profilometry (PSP) is used to reconstruct the 3D profile of solder paste. A 2D median and ID non-linear filters (pre-filtering) are proposed to filter the raw images. A 2D median and 2D non-linear filters (post-filtering) are used to filter out any parts which may be wrongly formed due to incorrect phase increment and non-ideal sinusoidal characteristic of projected pattern.,True,U210xGIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,11,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4384750/,6616198536512924065,/scholar?cites=6616198536512924065,,,,0,0,0

The system enables the observation of the tanks at all times. with the use of a web publishing tool. while it allows the remote control of the acquisition to eliminate behavioral variations that might otherwise be caused by human presence. Evaluation of the system was achieved by measuring fish interaction (inspection and biting) on three different net conditions.

1286282,Slice imaging and velocity mapping using a single field,2006,Vassilios Papadakis and Theofanis N Kitsopoulos,77,Review of scientific instruments,8,083101,American Institute of Physics,In this study we demonstrate that it is possible to perform velocity mapping and slice imaging of charged particle products using a single field (two electrodes) improving on the multielectrode geometries of the past. The performance of this new geometry is competitive to the multielectrode ones. presently limited by detector “spot” resolution. For imaging both photoelectrons and photofragments a resolution of ∼1% in velocity is achieved without further software manipulation such as event counting. The advantages of this new design are its ability to focus large volumes. its achromaticity (very little sensitivity on photofragment velocities). independence of the laser beam position in the field perpendicular to the extraction field. and compactness. Using this new design we have studied the photodissociation dynamics of pyrrole at 243nm and show that internal conversion of electronically excited state molecules to the …,True,H1YwCsEAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C,84,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2222084,13916386775086923906,/scholar?cites=13916386775086923906,,,http://www.mmlab.uoc.gr/my_cv/cv_from_mmlab/cv_files/386/CopyRSI_0_1.pdf,0,0,0

A major shortcoming of WES is uneven coverage of sequence reads over the exome targets contributing to many low coverage regions. which hinders accurate variant calling. In this study. we devised two novel metrics. Cohort Coverage Sparseness (CCS) and Unevenness (U E) Scores for a detailed assessment of the distribution of coverage of sequence reads.

1286306,Evaluating Multiple Sequence Alignments Using ENCODE Data,2013,Qingyu Wang,,,,,,As a key aspect of decoding genomic sequences. comparative genomic research has become increasingly prominent during the last decade. A crucial prerequisite for comparative genomics is multiple genomic sequence alignments. especially whole-genome multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Various downstream analyses rely implicitly on whole-genome MSAs. Unfortunately. whole-genome MSAs still suffer from inadequate reliability and the research on assessing their quality has not been fully addressed yet. Regardless of whether we seek better alignment methods or want to select the most reliable available MSAs. a practical evaluation method for MSAs is imperative. Therefore. we propose a new method. MSAME (MSA Motif-based Evaluation). to quantify the reliability of MSAs based on the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE project. Our method is one of the first MSA evaluation methods based on experimental data. Instead of using simulations relying on evolutionary models. we define a biological criterion inferred from different scenarios of motif shifting in ChIP-seq peak regions. and evaluate MSAs from such a functional perspective. Our method efficiently identifies two types of MSA errors. and it is robust to noises introduced by parameter changes. By applying our method to evaluate high coverage 11-way eutherian MultiZ and EPO alignments. we identify 7.9% and 6.7% of alignments in specific ChIP-seq bound regions as unreliable MSAs respectively. This allows us to identify putative evolutionary motif shifting as a by-product.

Ltd,Plants respond to stress by releasing biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Green leaf volatiles (GLVs). which are abundantly produced across the plant kingdom. comprise an important group within the BVOCs. They can repel or attract herbivores and their natural enemies; and they can induce plant defences or prime plants for enhanced defence against herbivores and pathogens and can have direct toxic effects on bacteria and fungi. Unlike other volatiles. GLVs are released almost instantly upon mechanical damage and (a) biotic stress and could thus function as an immediate and informative signal for many organisms in the plant's environment.

Objects exhibit in that sense a degree of membership to several classes. In a similar setting. models are developed here for classification problems where an order relation is specified on the classes (i.e.. non-crisp ordinal regression problems). As for traditional (crisp) ordinal regression problems. it is argued that the order relation on the classes should be reflected by the model structure as well as the performance measure used to evaluate the model.

Web-based organizations are keen to analyze the on-line browsing behavior of the users in their web site and learn (identify) their interest instantly in a session. The analysis of the user’s current interest based on the navigational behaviour may help the organizations to guide the users in their browsing activity and obtain relevant information in a shorter span of time. However. the resulting patterns obtained through data mining techniques did not perform well in predicting the future browsing patterns due to the low matching rate of the resulting rules and users’ browsing behavior. This paper focuses on recommender systems based on the user’s navigational patterns and provides suitable recommendations to cater to the current needs of the user.

1286326,An automated technique using Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier to classify breast cancer,2016,BM Gayathri and CP Sumathi,148,International Journal of Computer Application,6,16-21,,Objectives: The proposed work is to classify breast cancer with few attributes. Reducing the attributes reduces the time. so that the patient need not wait for result for a long time. For classification. the user friendly environment is created. The user can enter the details of the patient such as Clumpthickness. Uniformity in cell size etc.. and the result is classified as benign or malignant. Statistical analysis: Variable selection is done by one of the variable reduction algorithm called Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). LDA is one of the statistical method. The dataset is passed to LDA function repeatedly and the combination of variables which gave the good accuracy is selected. The variables that are selected by using LDA are used in classifying breast cancer. Findings: This application is created to find whether the given record is benign or malignant tumor. In this proposed work. the dataset from UCI repository for breast cancer detection is used. There are many other works done for finding breast cancer risk. diagnosing breast cancer etc.. and there may be at least ten variables used for classification which may be time consuming. But in this proposed work. only four are used and it gave the accuracy of up to 96%. Hence this may be the first step or idea for detecting breast cancer with lesser variables. so that this may be helpful for the doctors. Improvements: The proposed work is done based on the UCI machine learning repository dataset. which was uploaded by Wisconsin Hospitals. Madrid. Some changes can be made in the coding and this methodology can also be implemented in other dataset also by reducing the attributes.,True,E4k2NB0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,28,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=780042171605397560&hl=en&oi=scholarr,780042171605397560,/scholar?cites=780042171605397560,,,,0,0,0

One of the major outstanding challenges has been to achieve robust performance with spontaneous expressions. Systems that performed well on highly controlled datasets often performed poorly when tested on a different dataset with different image conditions. and especially had trouble generalizing to spontaneous expressions. which tend to have much greater noise from numerous causes. A major milestone in recent years is that automatic facial expression recognition systems are now able to measure spontaneous expressions with some success. This chapter describes one such system. the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT). CERT will soon be available to the research community.(See http://mplab. ucsd. edu). This system was employed in some of the earliest experiments in which spontaneous behavior was analyzed with automated expression recognition to extract new information about facial expression that was previously unknown (Bartlett et al.. 2008). These experiments are summarized in this chapter. The experiments measured facial behavior associated with faked versus genuine expressions of pain. driver drowsiness. and perceived difficulty of a video lecture.

The sensitivity of the flow field is sought with respect to geometry reconstruction procedure and mathematical model choice in numerical simulations.Taking as example a patient specific intracranial aneurysm located on an outer bend under steady state simulations. it is found that the sensitivity to geometry variability is greater. but comparable. to the one of the rheological model. These sensitivities are not quantifiable a priori.

The near-wall region is the interface for biologic and pathophysiologic processes such as thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Most computational and experimental investigations of blood flow implicitly or explicitly seek to quantify hemodynamics at the vessel wall (or lumen surface). with wall shear stress (WSS) quantities being the most common descriptors. Most WSS measures are meant to quantify the frictional force of blood flow on the vessel lumen. However. WSS also provides an approximation to the near-wall blood flow velocity.

The near-wall flow field governs mass transfer problems in convection-dominated open flows with high Schmidt number. in which case a flux at the wall will lead to a thin concentration boundary layer. Such near-wall transport is of particular interest in cardiovascular flows whereby haemodynamics can initiate and progress biological events at the vessel wall. In this study we consider mass transfer processes in pulsatile blood flow of abdominal aortic aneurysms resulting from complex WSS patterns. Specifically. the Lagrangian surface transport of a species released at the vessel wall was advected in forward and backward time based on the near-wall velocity field. Exposure time and residence time measures were defined to quantify accumulation of trajectories. as well as the time required to escape the near-wall domain. The effect of diffusion and normal velocity was investigated. The trajectories induced by the WSS vector field were observed to form attracting and repelling coherent structures that delineated species distribution inside the boundary layer consistent with exposure and residence time measures.

Trust is the estimation of the ability of cloud resources in completing a task based on some criteria such as availability. reliability. and resource processing power. In this paper. an enhanced QoS-based model for evaluating the trustworthiness of the cloud provider is introduced. The proposed model calculates the accumulative trust value which is updated dynamically at each transaction and reflects the current or latest transaction of the provider in the cloud. The trustworthiness of a cloud resource is evaluated based on its provider reputation history from user feedback ratings based on the covariance mathematical technique to evaluate the credibility of the user’s feedback.

The development of fully automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection algorithms. The detection of local fabric defects is one of the most intriguing problems in computer vision. Texture analysis plays an important role in the automated visual inspection of texture images to detect their defects. Various approaches for fabric defect detection have been proposed in past and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and describe these algorithms. This paper attempts to present the survey on fabric defect detection techniques. with a comprehensive list of references to some recent works. The aim is to review the state-of-the-art techniques for the purposes of visual inspection and decision making schemes that are able to discriminate the features extracted from normal and defective regions. Therefore. on the basis of nature of features from the fabric surfaces. the proposed approaches have been characterized into three categories; statistical. spectral and model-based.,True,YvCFU9QAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,100,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satish_Kolhe/publication/47372876_A_review_of_automatic_fabric_defect_detection_techniques/links/00463536882f5163fa000000/A-review-of-automatic-fabric-defect-detection-techniques.pdf,10917223180840604509,/scholar?cites=10917223180840604509,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satish_Kolhe/publication/47372876_A_review_of_automatic_fabric_defect_detection_techniques/links/00463536882f5163fa000000/A-review-of-automatic-fabric-defect-detection-techniques.pdf,0,0,0

As an individual signs only a few times on the forms for opening an account with any bank or for insurance related purposes. the number of genuine signature templates available in banking and insurance applications is limited. a new approach of static handwritten signature verification based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) by using only five genuine signatures for training is proposed in this paper. Initially the genuine and test signatures belonging to an individual are normalized after calculating the aspect ratios of the genuine signatures. The horizontal and vertical projection features of a signature are extracted using discrete Radon transform and the two vectors are combined to form a combined projection feature vector. The feature vectors of two signatures are matched using DTW algorithm. The closed area formed by the matching path around the diagonal of the DTW-grid is computed and is multiplied with the difference cost between the feature vectors. A threshold is calculated for each genuine sample during the training. The test signature is compared with each genuine sample and a matching score is calculated. A decision to accept or reject is made on the average of such scores. The entire experimentations were performed on a global signature database (GPDS-Signature Database) of 2106 signatures with 936 genuine signatures and 1170 skilled forgeries.

Recently. they have been linked to aging of Escherichia coli (E. coli) where protein aggregates accumulate at the old pole region of the aging bacterium. Because of the potential of E. coli as a model organism. elucidating aging and protein aggregation in this bacterium may pave the way to significant advances in our global understanding of aging. A first obstacle along this path is to decipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific intercellular locations. Here. using an integrated approach based on individual-based modeling. time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis. we show that the movement of aging-related protein aggregates in E. coli is purely diffusive (Brownian). Using single-particle tracking of protein aggregates in live E. coli cells. we estimated the average size and diffusion constant of the aggregates. Our results provide evidence that the aggregates passively diffuse within the cell. with diffusion constants that depend on their size in agreement with the Stokes-Einstein law. However. the aggregate displacements along the cell long axis are confined to a region that roughly corresponds to the nucleoid-free space in the cell pole. thus confirming the importance of increased macromolecular crowding in the nucleoids. We thus used 3D individual-based modeling to show that these three ingredients (diffusion. aggregation and diffusion hindrance in the nucleoids) are sufficient and necessary to reproduce the available experimental data on aggregate localization in the cells.

An automated solution for this task can be divided into shape based matching techniques (apictorial) or techniques that analyze additionally the visual content of the fragments (pictorial). In the case of visual content techniques like texture based analysis are used. Depending on the application. shape matching techniques are suitable for entities of the puzzle problem with small numbers of pieces (e.g. up to 20). Also artefacts like broken and lost pieces or overlapping parts of fragments increase the error rate of shape based techniques since the matching of adjacent boundaries can fail.

Hand gestures are more powerful means of communication for hearing impaired when they communicate to the normal people everywhere in day to day life. As the normal people find little difficulty in recognizing and interpreting the meaning of sign language expressed by the hearing impaired. it is inevitable to have an interpreter for translation of sign language. To overcome this difficulty. an automatic hand gesture recognition system which translates the sign language into text needs to be developed. In this paper. a static hand gesture recognition system for American Sign Language using Edge Oriented Histogram (EOH) features and multiclass SVM is proposed. The edge histogram count of input sign language alphabets is extracted as the features and applied to a multiclass SVM for classification.

1286493,Automatic identification and elimination of pectoral muscle in digital mammograms,2013,K Vaidehi and TS Subashini,75,International Journal of Computer Applications,14,,Foundation of Computer Science,Computer aided detection/diagnosis aims at assisting radiologist in the analysis of digital mammograms. Digital mammogram has emerged as the most popular screening technique for early detection of breast cancer and other abnormalities in human breast tissue. The pectoral muscle represents a predominant density region in most mammograms and can affect/bias the results of image processing methods. This paper addresses the problem of eliminating the pectoral muscles from the mammogram so that further processing for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer is confined to the breast region alone. The proposed work is done in three steps. In the first step. the mammogram is oriented to the left to minimize computations.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,The proposed system detects text using connect component labelling and a set of selection/rejection criteria which helps to retain the text region alone. The detected text region is then inpainted using fast marching algorithm which uses the pixel information that is present in the non-text region of the image for inpainting the detected text region. This work is done in two steps. The first step detects the text region from the image without the user manually marking it and in the second step the text is de-occluded from the image using the existing fast marching inpainting algorithm.,True,rmr4oTcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,19,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.303.4665&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1348311783401969933,/scholar?cites=1348311783401969933,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.303.4665&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

It follows the structure of the block-matching 3-D algorithm. recently proposed for additive white Gaussian noise denoising. but modifies its major processing steps in order to take into account the peculiarities of SAR images. A probabilistic similarity measure is used for the block-matching step. while the wavelet shrinkage is developed using an additive signal-dependent noise model and looking for the optimum local linear minimum-mean-square-error estimator in the wavelet domain. The proposed technique compares favorably w.r.t. several state-of-the-art reference techniques. with better results both in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (on simulated speckled images) and of perceived image quality.,True,9rXPLfEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,504,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5989862/,4603181950455638464,/scholar?cites=4603181950455638464,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51079382/A_Nonlocal_SAR_Image_Denoising_Algorithm20161227-1277-1fof96g.pdf,0,0,0

Standard video coding systems currently employed in UAV applications do not rely on some peculiarities in terms of scene 3D model and correlation among successive frames. In particular. the observed scene is static. i.e. the camera movement is dominant. and it can often be well approximated with a plane. Moreover. camera position and orientation can be obtained from the navigation system. Therefore. correspondent points on two video frames are linked by a simple homography. The encoder employs a new motion estimation scheme which make use of the global motion information provided by the onboard navigation system.

The focus was set on denoising. The statistics of natural images are consistent with the Markov random field principles. Therefore. a restoration process should preserve the correlation between adjacent pixels. The proposed approach minimizes the conditional entropy of a pixel knowing its neighborhood. The conditional aspect helps preserving local image structures such as edges and textures. The statistical properties of the degraded image are estimated using a novel. adaptive weighted k-th nearest neighbor (kNN) strategy.

Then. we propose a patch-based denoising process accounting for the quality of denoising of each individual patch. characterized by a confidence.

Recent attacks by hackers on the databases of large commercial and financial companies have demonstrated that more research and development of advanced approaches are necessary to deny unauthorized access to critical data. Free space optical technology has been investigated by many researchers in information security. encryption. and authentication. The main motivation for using optics and photonics for information security is that optical waveforms possess many complex degrees of freedom such as amplitude. phase. polarization. large bandwidth. nonlinear transformations. quantum properties of photons. and multiplexing that can be combined in many ways to make information encryption more secure and more difficult to attack.

By combining the full phase double-random-phase encryption with photon-counting imaging method and applying an iterative Huffman coding technique. we are able to encrypt and compress an image containing primary information about the object. This data can then be stored inside of an optically phase encoded QR code for robust read out. decryption. and authentication. The optically encoded QR code is verified by examining the speckle signature of the optical masks using statistical analysis.

This is achieved by capturing multiple two-dimensional images. known as elemental images (EI). of a scene with each image having a unique perspective of the 3D objects. Moreover. LWIR imaging performs well in photon-limited environments due to detection of thermal radiation from an object rather than the reflected light. Once the EIs have been captured. image restoration is performed on the captured images. A 3D scene is then reconstructed and object detection using correlation filters and support vector machines is performed. Our experiments with human face detection show that 2D imaging may fail to detect occluded humans. whereas passive 3D imaging with LWIR could be successful.

Medical images come from different acquisition systems (such as PET. CT. MRI) and. in many situations. automated processing of these images can greatly aid physicians and make their jobs easier. In medical imaging and its applications. 2D segmentation (with its different approaches such as FCM. k-means. MRFM and NN) is the first step which is used to extract ROI. This helps in extracting ROI in each slice (2D medical image) separately regardless of its relation to the next and the previous slices.

The heat transfer process in a solid material (beam) can be described by an integer order partial differential equation.

1286613,Modelling and control of systems with ultracapacitors using fractional order calculus,2013,Grzegorz Sarwas,,,,,,In this thesis modelling and control of the system with ultracapacitor using the fractional order calculus is presented. To introduce the subject of the fractional orders calculus some basic definitions and dependencies are shown.  Next. the internal structure of the ultracapacitor is described. Based on this description the appropriateness of using fractional order calculus to ultracapacitors modelling is proofed. Also an analytical derivation of a new ultracapacitor. more precise model based on the anomalous diffusion is presented. Additionally. some other ways of the ultracapacitor dynamics modelling are discussed.  Some of presented models are examined and their properties are discussed. Next. the explanation of the phenomenon of capacity decrease with frequency. based on the fractional order model. is shown. For the Davidson-Cole (Quintana) ultracapacitor model the step response in time domain is derived. Also derivation of the step response for the system with ultracapacitor is shown. Achieved results are validated and compared with the physical devices. In this case two designed and built experimental setups for ultracapacitor examination are shown. It is also highlighted that. although. ultracapacitor dynamics can be described precisely for zero initial conditions in fact they have some non--linearity.

Cham,In this paper different variance filters for rejecting image regions that do not contain interesting object are tested. In our case the processed scenes have equally depth of focus. which makes difficult to distinguish objects from the background. In order to locate the object. the algorithm based on the sliding windows approach has been used. In case of using this type of algorithm a cascade of filters designed to reject windows that do not contain searched objects are applied. In this paper the authors put emphasis on elimination of redundant windows. from equally depth colour scenes. using various variance filters. Also a formula. based on the integral images. which can improve the efficiency of using directional variance filters. is proposed.

This relies on the idea that a group of features matching over a local region in an image is more discriminative than a single feature match. In this paper. we evolve this concept further and apply it to the more challenging task of landmark recognition. We propose a novel combination of dense sampling of SIFT features with interest regions which represent the more salient parts of the image in greater detail. In place of conventional dense sampling used in category recognition that computes features on a regular grid at a number of fixed scales. we allow the sampling density and scale to vary based on the scale of the interest region. We develop new techniques for exploring stronger geometric constraints inside the feature groups and computing the match score.

Typecasting is a fundamental concept in C++(and object-oriented programming in general) to convert a pointer from one object type into another.

Due to missing type safety in C++. a downcasted pointer can violate a programmer's intended pointer semantics. allowing an attacker to corrupt the underlying memory in a type-unsafe fashion.

Intuitively. a piece of code with convoluted pointer arithmetic instructions may be more prone to memory errors than straightforward array accesses. More importantly. the more complex the bugs and the more convoluted the pointer arithmetic. the harder it will be to find using existing techniques like random fuzzing. and static analysis. Dowser ranks pointer dereference instructions according to their complexity. and then uses symbolic execution to zoom in on the most interesting operations. Zooming in on individual operations allows Dowser to severely reduce the search space necessary to cover the application. Instead of traditional code coverage. the symbolic execution phase employs a novel search algorithm which aims to maximize pointer coverage. We steer the execution along branches that show more potential to manipulate the value of a pointer. As a result. Dowser finds deep bugs in real programs.

1286658,Dynamic 3d scene depth reconstruction via optical flow field rectification,2012,You Yang and Qiong Liu and Rongrong Ji and Yue Gao,7,PloS one,11,e47041,Public Library of Science,In this paper. we propose a depth propagation scheme based on optical flow field rectification towards more accurate depth reconstruction. In depth reconstruction. the occlusions and low-textural regions easily result in optical flow field errors. which lead ambiguous depth value or holes without depth in the obtained depth map. In this work. a scheme is proposed to improve the precision of depth propagation and the quality of depth reconstruction for dynamic scene. The proposed scheme first adaptively detects the occlusive or low-textural regions. and the obtained vectors in optical flow field are rectified properly. Subsequently. we process the occluded and ambiguous vectors for more precise depth propagation. We further leverage the boundary enhancement filters as a post-processing to sharpen the object boundaries in obtained depth maps for better quality. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed scheme can reconstruct depth map with higher accuracy and better quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods.,True,1mQpXIcAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,25,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047041,2574737525905451069,/scholar?cites=2574737525905451069,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047041,0,0,0

Since a single projector only covers a limited area of the scene. multiple projectors should be employed simultaneously to extend the imaging area for a 3D object. However. patterns projected by different projectors superpose each other in a light-intersected area. which makes it difficult to recognize the original patterns and obtain the correct depth maps. To solve such a problem. we propose a method to design hierarchical patterns that can be separated from each other. In the proposed patterns. each pixel in binary patterns based on the de Bruijn sequence is replaced by a different bin with limited size. Then the proposed patterns can be separated by identifying distributions of colors in each bin in superposed patterns. and depth maps are obtained by decoding the separated …,True,1mQpXIcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,19,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-53-17-3621,16855493783676125064,/scholar?cites=16855493783676125064,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zengqiang_Yan/publication/263053877_Beyond_the_interference_problem_Hierarchical_patterns_for_multiple-projector_structured_light_system/links/55ffdd5508aeafc8ac8ba787.pdf,0,0,0

Both the European and the Italian legislations have banned the manufacture. importation. processing and distribution in commerce of asbestos-containing products and have recommended action plans for the safe removal of asbestos from public and private buildings. This paper describes the quantitative mapping of asbestos-cement covers over a large mountainous region of Italian Western Alps using the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer sensor. A very large data set made up of 61 airborne transect strips covering 3263 km 2 were processed to support the identification of buildings with asbestos-cement roofing. promoted by the Valle d’Aosta Autonomous Region with the support of the Regional Environmental Protection Agency. Results showed an overall mapping accuracy of 80%. in terms of asbestos-cement surface detected. The influence of topography on the classification’s accuracy suggested that even in high relief landscapes. the spatial resolution of data is the major source of errors and the smaller asbestos-cement covers were not detected or misclassified.

The phantom is also used frequently for magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction and k-space simulations. However. while the CT version incorporated the radiation attenuation properties of the head and brain. the MRI version of the phantom was neither adapted to MR physics nor defined as a viable standard. As a result. it is not currently possible to compare and validate MR simulations from different research studies.

These techniques have been previously advocated as a means to separate the sodium NMR signal from different physiological compartments based on the differences between their relaxation rates. Among the different triple quantum coherence transfer filters. the three-pulse coherence transfer filter has been demonstrated to be better suited for human imaging than the traditional four-pulse implementation. While the three-pulse structure has distinct advantages in terms of RF efficiency. the lack of a refocusing pulse in the filter introduces an increased dependence on the main magnetic field inhomogeneities. which can sometimes lead to significant signal loss.

The maximum likelihood approach provides images with superior noise characteristics compared to conventional filtered backprojection algorithm. A major drawback of the iterative image reconstruction methods is their high computational cost. In this paper. we develop a new algorithm called the improved ordered subset expectation maximization (IOS-EM) algorithm.

1286721,Regularized SENSE reconstruction using iteratively refined total variation method,2007,Bo Liu and Leslie Ying and Michael Steckner and Jun Xie and Jinhua Sheng,,,,121-124,IEEE,SENSE has been widely accepted as one of the standard reconstruction algorithms for parallel MRI. When large acceleration factors are employed. the SENSE reconstruction becomes very ill-conditioned. For Cartesian SENSE. Tikhonov regularization has been commonly used. However. the Tikhonov regularized image usually tends to be overly smooth. and a high-quality regularization image is desirable to alleviate this problem but is not available. In this paper. we propose a new SENSE regularization technique that is based on total variation with iterated refinement using Bregman iteration. It penalizes highly oscillatory noise but allows sharp edges in reconstruction without the need for prior information. In addition. the Bregman iteration refines the image details iteratively. The method is shown to be able to significantly reduce the artifacts in SENSE reconstruction,True,Z2G5vbYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,25,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4193237/,1017733149396398914,/scholar?cites=1017733149396398914,,,https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~leiying/cbil/index_files/Publications_files/ISBI07Reg.pdf,0,0,0

Although many regularization approaches have been developed to address the ill-conditioning problem for Cartesian SENSE. fewer efforts have been made to address this problem when the sampling trajectory is non-Cartesian.

Spectral vegetation indices are one of the main techniques currently used in remote sensing activities. since they are related to biophysical and biochemical crop variables. Moreover. they have been evaluated in some studies as potentially beneficial for detecting or differentiating crop diseases. Flavescence Dorée (FD) is an infectious. incurable disease of the grapevine that can produce severe yield losses and. hence. compromise the stability of the vineyards. The aim of this study was to develop specific spectral disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of FD disease in grapevines. Spectral signatures of healthy and diseased grapevine leaves were measured with a non-imaging spectro-radiometer at two infection severity levels. The most discriminating wavelengths were selected by a genetic algorithm (GA) feature selection tool. the Spectral Disease Indices (SDIs) are designed by exhaustively testing all possible combinations of wavelengths chosen. The best weighted combination of a single wavelength and a normalized difference is chosen to create the index. The SDIs are tested for their ability to differentiate healthy from diseased vine leaves and they are compared to some common set of Spectral Vegetation Indices (SVIs). It was demonstrated that using vegetation indices was. in general. better than using complete spectral data and that SDIs specifically designed for FD performed better than traditional SVIs in most of cases.

A high resolution – low cost imaging system for the analysis of high speed particle projection developed for this specific purpose is presented in this paper. The system. based on a camera and a sequence of flashes. is used to characterize the centrifugal spreading of fertilizer particles ejected at speeds of approximately 30m s−1. It automatically computes the direction of ejection and velocity of each granule observed in the …,True,0dYTZVcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,32,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024904523582,3055720380679110792,/scholar?cites=3055720380679110792,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45128131/Measurement_of_the_Motion_of_Fertilizer_20160427-30741-17zzut5.pdf,0,0,0

Current research activities enable large fields monitoring and plant disease detection using innovative and robust technologies. French grapevines have a reputation for producing premium quality wines. however. these major fruit crops are susceptible to many diseases. including Esca. Downy mildew. Powdery mildew. Yellowing. and many others. In this study. we focused on two main infections (Esca and Yellowing). and data were gathered from fields that were located in Aquitaine and Burgundy regions. France. Since plant diseases can be diagnosed from the properties of the leaf. we acquired both Red-Green-Blue (RGB) digital image and hyperspectral reflectance data from infected and healthy leaves. Biophysical parameters that were produced by the PROSPECT model inversion together with texture parameters compiled from the literature were deduced. Then we investigated their relationship to damage caused by Yellowing and Esca. This study examined whether spectral and textural data can identify the two diseases through the use of Neural Networks. We obtained an overall accuracy of 99% for both of the diseases when textural and spectral data are combined. These results suggest that. first. biophysical parameters present a valid dimension reduction tool that could replace the use of complete hyperspectral data.

In agronomic sciences. the 3D acquisition of natural scene is difficult due to the complex nature of the scenes. Our system is based on the Shape from Focus technique initially used in the microscopic domain. We propose to adapt this technique to the macroscopic domain and we detail the system as well as the image processing used to perform such technique. The Shape from Focus technique is a monocular and passive 3D acquisition method that resolves the occlusion problem affecting the multi-cameras systems. Indeed. this problem occurs frequently in natural complex scenes like agronomic scenes. The depth information is obtained by acting on optical parameters and mainly the depth of field. A focus measure is applied on a 2D image stack previously acquired by the system. When this focus measure is performed. we can create the depth map of the scene.

In Europe. over 90% of fertilizer is distributed using spinning disc spreaders. The popularity of spinning disc spreaders lies with their relative low cost. However. the performance of these machines is highly dependent on the particle properties (e.g. friction coefficients. shape). This results in large differences in spread patterns depending on the fertilizer type as well as the prevailing weather conditions (e.g. air humidity). This dependence requires extensive experimental calibration of the spreader for each type of fertilizer. When a new spreader is designed this calibration work has to be largely repeated. DEM is believed to be the key to increase the understanding of the spreading process. the design of better spreaders and a drastic reduction of experimental calibration …,True,0dYTZVcAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,22,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10035-008-0086-2.pdf,6266165374954439540,/scholar?cites=6266165374954439540,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00460958/document,0,0,0

However. no automated methods to detect ELM and/or determine its integrity from SD-OCT exist.Methods.: Sixteen subjects diagnosed with clinically significant DME (CSME) were included and underwent macula-centered SD-OCT (512× 19× 496 voxels). Sixteen subjects without retinal thickening and normal acuity were also scanned (200× 200× 1024 voxels). Automated quantification of ELM disruption was achieved as follows. First. 11 surfaces were automatically segmented using our standard 3-D graph-search approach. and the subvolume between surface 6 and 11 containing the ELM region was flattened based on the segmented retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. A second. edge-based graph-search surface-detection method segmented the ELM region in close proximity “above” the RPE. and each ELM A-scan was classified as disrupted or nondisrupted based on six texture features in the vicinity of the ELM surface. The vessel silhouettes were considered in the disruption classification process to avoid false detections of ELM disruption.Results.: In subjects with CSME. large areas of disrupted ELM were present.

The variations of illumination. style. scale. and appearance in different domains can seriously affect the performance of detection models. Previous works use adversarial training to align global features across the domain shift and to achieve image information transfer. However. such methods do not effectively match the distribution of local features. resulting in limited improvement in cross-domain object detection. To solve this problem. we propose a multi-level domain adaptive model to simultaneously align the distributions of local-level features and global-level features.

1286780,Prediction of treatment response from retinal OCT in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration,2014,Hrvoje Bogunovic and Michael D Abramoff and Li Zhang and Milan Sonka,1,,,,University of Iowa,Age related macular degeneration is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults. Its exudative form. where fluids leak into the macula. is especially damaging. The standard treatment involves injections of anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents into the eye. which prevent further vascular growth and leakage. and can restore vision. These intravitreal injections have a risk of devastating complications including blindness from infection and are expensive. Optimizing the interval between injections in a patient specific manner is of great interest. as the retinal response is partially patient specific. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach to predict the retinal response at the end of a standardized 12-week induction phase of the treatment. From a longitudinal series of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. a number of quantitative measurements are extracted. describing the underlying retinal structure and pathology and its response to initial treatment. After initial feature selection. the selected set of features is used to predict the treatment response status at the end of the induction phase using the support vector machine classifier. On a population of 30 patients. leave-one-out cross-validation showed the classification success rate of 87% of predicting whether the subject will show a response to the treatment at the next visit.

Considering the fact that each individual has a unique way of walking. inertial sensors can be applied to the problem of gait recognition where assessed gait can be interpreted as a biometric trait. Thus. inertial sensor-based gait recognition has a great potential to play an important role in many security-related applications. Since inertial sensors are included in smart devices that are nowadays present at every step. inertial sensor-based gait recognition has become very attractive and emerging field of research that has provided many interesting discoveries recently. This paper provides a thorough and systematic review of current state-of-the-art in this field of research. Review procedure has revealed that the latest advanced inertial sensor-based gait recognition approaches are able to sufficiently recognise the users when relying on inertial data obtained during gait by single commercially available smart device in controlled circumstances. including fixed placement and small variations in gait. Furthermore. these approaches have also revealed considerable breakthrough by realistic use in uncontrolled circumstances. showing great potential for their further development and wide applicability.

Acceleration data of three different walking speeds (slow. normal and fast) for each subject was acquired by the accelerometer embedded in cell phone which was attached to the person's hip. Data analysis was based on gait cycles that were detected first. Cumulants of order from 1 to 4 with different number of lags were calculated. Feature vectors for classification were built using dimension reduction on calculated cumulants by principal component analysis (PCA). The classification was accomplished by support vector machines (SVM) with radial basis kernel. According to portion of variance covered in the calculated principal components. different lengths of feature vectors were tested. Six healthy young subjects participated in the experiment.

Optical interferometer is a sensitive device that detects physical changes of optical-fiber length due to external perturbations. When in direct or indirect contact with human body (e.g.. hidden in a bed mattress). mechanical and acoustic activity of cardiac muscle and respiration reflect in the interferometric signal. enabling entirely unobtrusive monitoring of heartbeat and respiration.

Juric,10,IEEE Transactions on  Information Forensics and Security,7,1486 - 1498,IEEE,We propose a novel efficient and reliable gait authentication approach. It is based on the analysis of accelerometer signals using higher order statistics. Gait patterns are obtained by transformation of acceleration data in feature space represented with higher order cumulants. The proposed approach is able to operate on multichannel and multisensor data by combining feature-level and sensor-level fusion. Evaluation of the proposed approach was performed using the largest currently available data set OU-ISIR containing inertial data of 744 subjects. Authentication was performed by cross-comparison of gallery and probe gait patterns transformed in feature space. In addition. the proposed approach was evaluated using data set collected by McGill University. containing long-sequence acceleration signals of 20 subjects acquired by smartphone during casual walking.

Optical interferometer is a sensitive device that detects physical elongation of optical fibre due to external perturbations. Mechanical activity of cardiac muscle and respiration reflects in interferometric signal when the interferometer is in contact with human body and. thus. enables unobtrusive detection of human vital signs.

Optical fibre interferometer is a sensitive device which detects physical changes of the optical fibre length. If a person is in physical contact with the fibre. such as having it in bed. the fibre interferometers responds to small changes in fibre length induced by the heartbeat and breathing. This allows for unobtrusive and continuous monitoring of a person's vital life signs. The interferometer. however. has a cosine signal transfer characteristic. which complicates the feature extraction algorithms. An experiment was performed with the optical fibre on the mattress.

Perfection in image segmentation is a necessary condition for improving the diagnostic accuracy in automated cytology. Since the diagnostic information content of the segmented images is plentiful. suitable segmentation routines need to be developed for better disease recognition. Clustering is an essential image segmentation procedure which segments an image into desired regions. A judicious integration of rough sets and fuzzy sets is suitably employed towards leukocyte segmentation in a clustering framework. In this study. the goodness of fuzzy sets and rough sets is suitably integrated to achieve improved segmentation performance. The membership concept of fuzzy sets endow is efficient handling of overlapping partitions. and the rough sets provide a reasonable solution to deal with uncertainty. vagueness. and incompleteness in data. Such synergistic combination gives the proposed scheme an edge over standard cluster-based segmentation techniques. that is. K-means. K-medoid. fuzzy c-means. and rough c-means.

By applying the authors’ new approach to low-quality images of the FVC2004 fingerprint databases. the authors are able to show its competitiveness with other state-of-the-art enhancement methods for fingerprints like curved Gabor filtering. A major advantage of oriented diffusion filtering over those is its computational efficiency.

In this paper. we propose the filament sensor (FS). a fast and robust processing sequence which detects and records location. orientation. length. and width for each single filament of an image. and thus allows for the above described analysis. The extraction of these features has previously not been possible with existing methods. We evaluate the performance of the proposed FS in terms of accuracy and speed in comparison to three existing methods with respect to their limited output. Further. we provide a benchmark dataset of real cell images along with filaments manually marked by a human expert as well as simulated benchmark images.

Based on longitudinal data sets in juveniles' criminal records. we show that growth essentially leads to an isotropic rescaling. so that we can use the strong correlation between growth in stature and limbs to model the growth of fingerprints proportional to stature growth as documented in growth charts. The proposed rescaling leads to a 72% reduction of the distances between corresponding minutiae for the data set analyzed. These findings were corroborated by several verification tests.

1286809,Filter design and performance evaluation for fingerprint image segmentation,2016,Duy Hoang Thai and Stephan Huckemann and Carsten Gottschlich,11,PloS one,5,e0154160,Public Library of Science,Fingerprint recognition plays an important role in many commercial applications and is used by millions of people every day. e.g. for unlocking mobile phones. Fingerprint image segmentation is typically the first processing step of most fingerprint algorithms and it divides an image into foreground. the region of interest. and background. Two types of error can occur during this step which both have a negative impact on the recognition performance: ‘true’ foreground can be labeled as background and features like minutiae can be lost. or conversely ‘true’ background can be misclassified as foreground and spurious features can be introduced. The contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly. we propose a novel factorized directional bandpass (FDB) segmentation method for texture extraction based on the directional Hilbert transform of a Butterworth bandpass (DHBB) filter interwoven with soft-thresholding. Secondly. we provide a manually marked ground truth segmentation for 10560 images as an evaluation benchmark. Thirdly. we conduct a systematic performance comparison between the FDB method and four of the most often cited fingerprint segmentation algorithms showing that the FDB segmentation method clearly outperforms these four widely used methods.

Especially the Earth Mover's Distance is used in a plethora of applications ranging from content-based image retrieval. shape matching. fingerprint recognition. object tracking and phishing web page detection to computing color differences in linguistics and biology. Our starting point is the well-known revised simplex algorithm. which iteratively improves a feasible solution to optimality. The Shortlist Method that we propose substantially reduces the number of candidates inspected for improving the solution. while at the same time balancing the number of pivots required. Tests on simulated benchmarks demonstrate a considerable reduction in computation time for the new method as compared to the usual revised simplex algorithm implemented with state-of-the-art initialization and pivot strategies. As a consequence. the Shortlist Method facilitates the computation of large scale transportation problems in viable time.

The first processing step after fingerprint image acquisition is segmentation. that is. dividing a fingerprint image into a foreground region which contains the relevant features for the comparison algorithm. and a background region.

Absent. Regular. and Irregular. in a pigmented skin lesion. In addition. the directional pattern of detected lines is analyzed to extract their orientation features in order to detect the underlying pattern. The method uses a graphical representation to model the geometric pattern of valid streaks and the distribution and coverage of the structure.

First we perform a pre-processing step of image enhancement and edge detection. The resulting binary edge image is converted to a graph and the defined feature patterns are extracted by finding cyclic subgraphs corresponding to skin texture structures. We filtered these cyclic subgraphs to remove other round structures such as globules. dots. and oil bubbles. based on their size and color. Another high-level graph is created from each correctly extracted subgraph. with a node corresponding to a hole in the pigment network. Nodes are connected by edges according to their distances.

Recognition is a trivial task for humans. but to make a computer program that does character recognition is extremely difficult. Recognizing patterns is just one of those things humans do well and computers don’t.

Hence rules need to be heuristically deduced from samples. This paper provides a review for various available methods. Character recognition methods are listed under two main headlines.

But even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks. intra-class variability. noise. susceptibility etc. In the realm of biometrics. the consolidation of evidence presented by multiple biometric sources is an effective way of enhancing the recognition accuracy of an authentication system. This paper proposes an authentication for a multimodal biometric system identification using two traits ie. face and palmprint at feature extraction level. The training database consists of face and palmprint images. Principal Component Analysis method is used to extract the features from face and palmprints separately. The feature normalization and feature concatenation scheme followed by a dimensionality reduction procedure is adopted to form the feature matrix. The normalized match (distance) scores generated by respective palm and face features before fusion are used to form fused match score. The Euclidean distance and the feature distance are calculated after fusion. All three distances are used to arrive at final decision. Feedback routine implemented between the feature extraction and the matching modules of the biometric system can lead to substantial improvement in multimodal matching performance.,True,YKDgO-oAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,20,http://www.ijcee.org/papers/470-N031.pdf,7868521075883149947,/scholar?cites=7868521075883149947,,,http://www.ijcee.org/papers/470-N031.pdf,0,0,0

1286869,Slow Feature Analysis for Change Detection in Multispectral Imagery,2014,Chen Wu and Bo Du and Liangpei Zhang,52,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,5,2858 - 2874,IEEE,Change detection was one of the earliest and is also one of the most important applications of remote sensing technology. For multispectral images. an effective solution for the change detection problem is to exploit all the available spectral bands to detect the spectral changes. However. in practice. the temporal spectral variance makes it difficult to separate changes and nonchanges. In this paper. we propose a novel slow feature analysis (SFA) algorithm for change detection. Compared with changed pixels. the unchanged ones should be spectrally invariant and varying slowly across the multitemporal images. SFA extracts the most temporally invariant component from the multitemporal images to transform the data into a new feature space. In this feature space. the differences in the unchanged pixels are suppressed so that the changed pixels can be better separated.

Most traditional change detection methods deal with single-band or multispectral remote sensing images. Hyperspectral remote sensing images offer more detailed information on spectral changes so as to present promising change detection performance. The challenge is how to take advantage of the spectral information at such a high dimension. In this paper. we propose a subspace-based change detection (SCD) method for hyperspectral images. Instead of dealing with band-wise changes. the proposed method measures spectral changes. SCD regards the observed pixel in the image of Time 2 as target and constructs the background subspace using the corresponding pixel in the image of Time 1. and additional information.

However. due to the fact that it neglects the temporal correlation between corresponding pixels in multi-temporal images. the post-classification approach usually suffers from an accumulation of misclassification errors. In order to solve this problem. previous studies have separated the change and non-change candidates with change vector analysis. and they have only updated the classes of the changed pixels with the post-classification; however. this approach with thresholding loses the continuous change intensity information. where larger values indicate higher probability to be changed.

However. it is difficult to solve the problem of uncertainty. which mainly includes the inaccuracy of each candidate change map and the conflicts between different results. Dempster–Shafer theory (D–S) is an effective method to model uncertainties and combine multiple evidences.

Change vector analysis (CVA). iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IRMAD). and iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) were utilized to obtain the candidate change maps.

One of the main causes of traffic congestion is due to road merges. Vehicles tend to move slower when they reach the merging point. In this paper. an enhanced algorithm for traffic simulation based on the fluid-dynamic algorithm and kinematic wave theory is proposed. The enhanced algorithm is used to study traffic congestion at a road merge. This paper also describes the development of a dynamic traffic simulation tool which is used as a scenario planning and to forecast traffic congestion level in a certain time based on defined parameter values. The tool incorporates the enhanced algorithm as well as the two original algorithms.

Through this new construction tool it is possible to obtain integer versions of the wavelet transform. This is a very interesting issue when the goal is lossless compression of images. whose pixels are represented through integers. In the classical approach to the discrete wavelet. the filter coefficients are real numbers and so are the resulting coefficients. When pursuing hardware implementations for real time and embedded applications. this causes the need to manage fixed point operations and unavoidable quantization. If the output can be produced with integer values instead. perfect reconstruction and lossless compression are possible.

1286904,Pyramidal architectures for computer vision,2012,Virginio Cantoni and Marco Ferretti,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Computer vision deals with the problem of manipulating information contained in large quantities of sensory data. where raw data emerge from the transducing 6 7 sensors at rates between 10 to 10 pixels per second. Conventional general purpose computers are unable to achieve the computation rates required to op erate in real time or even in near real time. so massively parallel systems have been used since their conception in this important practical application area. The development of massively parallel computers was initially character ized by efforts to reach a speedup factor equal to the number of processing elements (linear scaling assumption). This behavior pattern can nearly be achieved only when there is a perfect match between the computational struc ture or data structure and the system architecture. The theory of hierarchical modular systems (HMSs) has shown that even a small number of hierarchical levels can sizably increase the effectiveness of very large systems. In fact. in the last decade several hierarchical architectures that support capabilities which can overcome performances gained with the assumption of linear scaling have been proposed. Of these architectures. the most commonly considered in com puter vision is the one based on a very large number of processing elements (PEs) embedded in a pyramidal structure.

1286913,Characterizing adversarial subspaces using local intrinsic dimensionality,2018,Xingjun Ma and Bo Li and Yisen Wang and Sarah M Erfani and Sudanthi Wijewickrema and Grant Schoenebeck and Dawn Song and Michael E Houle and James Bailey,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.02613,,,,Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples. which are carefully crafted instances that can mislead DNNs to make errors during prediction. To better understand such attacks. a characterization is needed of the properties of regions (the so-called'adversarial subspaces') in which adversarial examples lie. We tackle this challenge by characterizing the dimensional properties of adversarial regions. via the use of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). LID assesses the space-filling capability of the region surrounding a reference example. based on the distance distribution of the example to its neighbors. We first provide explanations about how adversarial perturbation can affect the LID characteristic of adversarial regions. and then show empirically that LID characteristics can facilitate the distinction of adversarial examples generated using state-of-the-art attacks. As a proof-of-concept. we show that a potential application of LID is to distinguish adversarial examples. and the preliminary results show that it can outperform several state-of-the-art detection measures by large margins for five attack strategies considered in this paper across three benchmark datasets. Our analysis of the LID characteristic for adversarial regions not only motivates new directions of effective adversarial defense. but also opens up more challenges for developing new attacks to better understand the vulnerabilities of DNNs.,True,MjgOHPYAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,294,https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02613,17134144151462669065,/scholar?cites=17134144151462669065,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02613,0,0,0

Based on this finding. we develop a new dimensionality-driven learning strategy. which monitors the dimensionality of subspaces during training and adapts the loss function accordingly. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is highly tolerant to significant proportions of noisy labels. and can effectively learn low-dimensional local subspaces that capture the data distribution.,True,MjgOHPYAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,159,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ma18d,13671594748199391279,/scholar?cites=13671594748199391279,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ma18d/ma18d.pdf,0,0,0

We introduce a rating tool that objectively evaluates the skills of surgical trainees performing cochlear implant surgery. Methods. Seven residents and seven experts performed cochlear implant surgery sessions from mastoidectomy to cochleostomy on a standardized virtual reality temporal bone. A total of twenty-eight assessment videos were recorded and two consultant otolaryngologists evaluated the performance of each participant using these videos. Results. Interrater reliability was calculated using the intraclass  correlation coefficient for both the global and checklist components of the assessment instrument. The overall agreement was high. The construct validity of this instrument was strongly supported by the significantly higher scores in the expert group for both components. Conclusion. Our results indicate that the proposed assessment tool for cochlear implant surgery is reliable. accurate. and easy to use.

The software defect prediction performance decreases significantly because the data set contains noisy attributes and class imbalance. Feature selection is generally used in machine learning when the learning task involves highdimensional and noisy attribute datasets. Most of the feature selection algorithms. use local search throughout the entire process. consequently near-optimal to optimal solutions are quiet difficult to be achieved.

Processing such images (for different purposes) can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this process. The first step in many medical image processing applications is segmentation. which is used to extract the Region of Interest (ROI) from a given image. Due to its effectiveness. a very popular segmentation algorithm is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. However. FCM takes a long processing time especially for 3D model. This problem can be solved by utilizing parallel programming using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In this paper. a hybrid parallel implementation of FCM for extracting volume object from medical DICOM files has been proposed.

The images acquired from different layers have a different contrast: the images obtained from the deeper layers of the specimen will have a lower contrast with respect to the images obtained from the topmost layers. The main reasons responsible for the effects described above are light absorption and scattering by the atoms and molecules contained in the volume through which the light passes. Also light attenuation can be caused by the inclination of the observed surface. In the case of the surfaces that have a steep inclination. the reflected light will have a different direction than the one of the detector.

1286989,Biological interactions with surface charge in biomaterials,2011,Syed AM Tofail,21,,,,Royal Society of Chemistry,When a biomaterial is placed inside the body. a biological response is triggered almost instantaneously. With devices that need to remain in the body for long periods. such interactions can cause encrustation. plaque formation and aseptic loosening on the surface. These problems contribute to the patient's trauma and increase the risk of death. Electrical properties. such as local electrostatic charge distribution. play a significant role in defining biological interactions. although this is often masked by other factors. This book describes the fundamental principles of this phenomenon before providing a more detailed scientific background. It covers the development of the relevant technologies and their applications in therapeutic devices such as MRSA-resistant fabrics. cardiovascular and urological stents. orthopaedic implants. and grafts. Academic and graduate students interested in producing a selective biological response at the surface of a given biomaterial will find the detailed coverage of interactions at the nanometre scale useful. Practitioners will also benefit from guidance on how to pre-screen many inappropriate designs of biomedical devices long before any expensive. animal or potentially risky clinical trials. Enhanced by the use of case studies. the book is divided in to four topical sections.

The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in its ability to account for the elastic deformation present in constituent fingerprints before stitching them. A 2D Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model based on minutiae correspondences between a pair of fingerprint images is used as the interpolant function to pre-distort one image based on its deformation with respect to the other.

The first contribution of this thesis is a post matching algorithm that observes the structure of the differences in feature templates to enhance recognition accuracy. The significance of the scheme is its robustness to inaccuracies in the iris segmentation process. Experimental results on the CASIA database indicate the efficacy of the proposed technique. The second contribution of this thesis is a novel iris segmentation scheme that employs Geodesic Active Contours to extract the iris from the surrounding structures.

Lanczos methods restrict the solution to lie in a Krylov subspace. but they are hindered by semi-convergence behavior. in that the quality of the solution first increases and then decreases. Hybrid methods apply a standard regularization technique. such as Tikhonov regularization. to the projected problem at each iteration. Thus. regularization in hybrid methods is achieved both by Krylov filtering and by appropriate choice of a regularization parameter at each iteration.

1287003,A hybrid LSMR algorithm for large-scale Tikhonov regularization,2015,Julianne Chung and Katrina Palmer,37,SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing,5,S562-S580,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,We develop a hybrid iterative approach for computing solutions to large-scale ill-posed inverse problems via Tikhonov regularization.  We consider a hybrid LSMR algorithm. where Tikhonov regularization is applied to the LSMR subproblem rather than the original problem. We show that. contrary to standard hybrid methods. hybrid LSMR iterates are not equivalent to LSMR iterates on the directly regularized Tikhonov problem.  Instead. hybrid LSMR leads to a different Krylov subspace problem. We show that hybrid LSMR shares many of the benefits of standard hybrid methods such as avoiding semiconvergence behavior. In addition. since the regularization parameter can be estimated during the iterative process. it does not need to be estimated a priori. making this approach attractive for large-scale problems.  We consider various methods for selecting regularization parameters and discuss stopping criteria for …,True,emZOTlUAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,27,https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/140975024,15970834091748934130,/scholar?cites=15970834091748934130,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/92d4/70f23262b4534bc37eb99b68541789f03f0a.pdf,0,0,0

We conducted a case-series study of 49 patients to assess the potential association between severity of rosacea and direct and serological evidence of H. pylori infection. Patients were classified by severity into non-inflammatory erythematotelangiectatic or inflammatory/papulopustular rosacea and were tested for current H. pylori infection and evidence of previous exposure.

Given that one in three children remain stunted in Bangladesh. the socioeconomic mapping of stunting prevalence may be critical in designing public policies and interventions to eradicate childhood undernutrition. Six rounds of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data are utilized. spanning the period 1996/97 to 2014. Using recognized measures of absolute and relative inequality (namely. absolute and relative difference. concentration curve and index). we quantify trends. and decompose changes in the concentration index to identify factors that best explain observed dynamics. Despite remarkable improvements in average nutritional status over the last two decades. socio-economic inequalities have persisted. and according to some measures. even worsened. For example. expressed as rate-ratios. the relative inequality in under-five stunting increased by 56% and the concentration index more than doubled between 1996/97 and 2014. Decomposition analyses find that wealth and maternal factors such as mothers’ schooling and short stature are major contributors to observed socio-economic inequalities in child undernutrition and their changes over time. Reflecting on recent success around socioeconomic and gender equity in child mortality. and the weak legacy of nutrition policy in Bangladesh. we suggest that nutrition programming energies be focused specifically on the most disadvantaged and applied at scale to close socioeconomic gaps in stunting …,True,jJeaLLwAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,35,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-016-0477-7,5516940050664373085,/scholar?cites=5516940050664373085,,,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-016-0477-7,0,0,0

A data-driven lung nodule modeling approach creates templates for common nodule types. using active appearance models (AAM); which are then used to detect candidate nodules based on optimum similarity measured by the normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Geometric feature descriptors (e.g.. SIFT. LBP and SURF) are applied to the output of the detection step. in order to extract features from the nodule candidates. for further enhancement of output and possible reduction of false positives.

Grid search constitutes an exhaustive search over a pre-defined discretized set of possible parameter values and evaluating the cross-validation error until the best is found. We developed a bi-level optimization approach to solve the model selection problem for linear and kernel SVMs. including the extension to learn several kernel parameters. Using this method. we can overcome the discretization of the parameter space using continuous optimization. and the complexity of the method only increases linearly with the number of parameters (instead of exponentially using grid search).

1287065,Subspace clustering guided convex nonnegative matrix factorization,2018,Guosheng Cui and Xuelong Li and Yongsheng Dong,292,Neurocomputing,,38-48,Elsevier,As one of the most important information of the data. the geometry structure information is usually modeled by a similarity graph to enforce the effectiveness of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). However. pairwise distance based graph is sensitive to noise and can not capture the subspace structure of the data. Reconstruction coefficients based graph can capture the subspace structure of the data. but the procedure of building the representation based graph is usually independent to the framework of NMF. To address this issue. a novel subspace clustering guided convex nonnegative matrix factorization (SC-CNMF) is proposed. In this NMF framework. the nonnegative subspace clustering is incorporated to learning the representation based graph. and meanwhile. a convex nonnegative matrix factorization is also updated simultaneously.

1287066,Feature extraction through contourlet subband clustering for texture classification,2013,Yongsheng Dong and Jinwen Ma,116,Neurocomputing,,157-164,Elsevier,Feature extraction is an important processing procedure in texture classification. For feature extraction in the wavelet domain. the energies of subbands are usually extracted for texture classification. However. the energy of one subband is just a specific feature. In this paper. we propose an efficient feature extraction method for texture classification. In particular. feature vectors are obtained by c-means clustering on the contourlet domain as well as using two conventionally extracted features that represent the dispersion degree of contourlet subband coefficients. The c-means clustering algorithm is initialized via a nonrandom initialization scheme. By investigating these feature vectors. we employ a weighted L 1-distance for comparing any two feature vectors that represent the corresponding subbands of two images and define a new distance between two images.

Although there have been many methods to perform foreground extraction. most of them are time-consuming. and the trimaps used in the matting step are labeled manually. In this paper. we propose a fast interactive foreground extraction method based on the superpixel GrabCut and image matting.

Due to that the resulting mask border is hard and toothing. we further propose fast and adaptive trimaps (FATs). and construct an FATs-based shared matting for computing a refined mask.

By estimating the alpha factor of the model. the foreground of an image can be extracted. However. there is some dimensional information redundancy in the alpha space.

To alleviate this problem. in this paper. we propose a subspace clustering method based on Cauchy loss function (CLF).

In this paper we report a hybrid technique that provides a focal spot that remains almost invariant in the depth-scanning processing of thick samples. This invariance allows the application of 3D deconvolution techniques to that provide an improved recovery of the specimen structure when imaging thick …,True,YotjTbsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,39,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-17-16-13810&seq=0,125578441372579722,/scholar?cites=125578441372579722,,,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-17-16-13810&seq=0,0,0,0

The acquisition system is formed by a monochrome camera. and a Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF) that allows to acquire images at different spectral bands in the [480. 680]nm wavelength interval. The Synthetic Aperture Integral Imaging acquisition technique is used to obtain the elemental images for each wavelength. These elemental images are used to computationally obtain the reconstruction planes of the 3D scene at different depth planes. The 3D profile of the acquired scene is also obtained using a minimization of the variance of the contribution of the elemental images at each image pixel.

The proposed method has been tested on a Velodyne HDL-64E S2 LiDAR system. which contains 64 rotating laser rangefinders. By time series analysis. we found that the collected range data have random measurement errors of around±25 mm. In addition. the layered misalignment of scans among the rangefinders. which is identified as a systematic error. also increases the difficulty to accurately locate planar surfaces. We propose a temporal-spatial range data fusion algorithm. along with a robust RANSAC-based plane detection algorithm to address these issues. Furthermore. we formulate an alternative geometric interpretation of sensory data using linear parameters. which is advantageous for the calibration procedure. The linear representation allows the proposed method to be generalized to any LiDAR system that follows the rotating beam model. We also confirmed in this paper. that given effective calibration datasets. the pre-calibrated factory parameters can be further tuned to achieve significantly improved performance. After the optimization. the systematic error is noticeable lowered. and evaluation shows that the recalibrated parameters outperform the factory parameters with the RMS planar errors reduced by up to 49%.

1287100,An incremental target-adapted strategy for active geometric calibration of projector-camera systems,2013,Chia-Yen Chen and Hsiang-Jen Chien,13,Sensors,2,2664-2681,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The calibration of a projector-camera system is an essential step toward accurate 3-D measurement and environment-aware data projection applications. such as augmented reality. In this paper we present a two-stage easy-to-deploy strategy for robust calibration of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a projector. Two key components of the system are the automatic generation of projected light patterns and the incremental calibration process. Based on the incremental strategy. the calibration process first establishes a set of initial parameters. and then it upgrades these parameters incrementally using the projection and captured images of dynamically-generated calibration patterns. The scene-driven light patterns allow the system to adapt itself to the pose of the calibration target. such that the difficulty in feature detection is greatly lowered. The strategy forms a closed-loop system that performs self-correction as more and more observations become available. Compared to the conventional method. which requires a time-consuming process for the acquisition of dense pixel correspondences. the proposed method deploys a homography-based coordinate computation. allowing the calibration time to be dramatically reduced. The experimental results indicate that an improvement of 70% in reprojection errors is achievable and 95% of the calibration time can be saved.

1287109,Spectral edge image fusion: Theory and applications,2014,David Connah and Mark Samuel Drew and Graham David Finlayson,,,,65-80,Springer. Cham,This paper describes a novel approach to the fusion of multidimensional images for colour displays. The goal of the method is to generate an output image whose gradient matches that of the input as closely as possible. It achieves this using a constrained contrast mapping paradigm in the gradient domain. where the structure tensor of a high-dimensional gradient representation is mapped exactly to that of a low-dimensional gradient field which is subsequently reintegrated to generate an output. Constraints on the output colours are provided by an initial RGB rendering to produce ‘naturalistic’ colours: we provide a theorem for projecting higher-D contrast onto the initial colour gradients such that they remain close to the original gradients whilst maintaining exact high-D contrast. The solution to this constrained optimisation is closed-form. allowing for a very simple and hence fast and efficient algorithm.

Rather than using conventional direct or two-step processes. we transform camera RGB to skin reflectance directly using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. The novelty in our direct method (RGB to spectra) is the use of a skin-specific colour characterisation chart with spectra closer to human skin spectra. and a new database of skin reflectances to derive the PCA bases. The experimental results using the facial images of 17 subjects demonstrate that our new direct method gives a significantly better performance than conventional. two-step methods and direct methods with traditional characterization charts.

Research has shown that both age and gender information are encoded in the face shape and texture. hence the active appearance model (AAM). a statistical model that captures shape and texture variations. has been one of the most widely used feature extraction techniques for the aforementioned problems. However. AAM suffers from some drawbacks. especially when used for classification. This is primarily because principal component analysis (PCA). which is at the core of the model. works in an unsupervised manner. i.e.. PCA dimensionality reduction does not take into account how the predictor variables relate to the response (class labels).

One of the main reasons for non-acceptance of the currently available solutions by seniors is that the fall detectors using only inertial sensors generate too much false alarms. This means that some daily activities are erroneously signaled as fall. which in turn leads to frustration of the users. In this paper we present how to design and implement a low-cost system for reliable fall detection with very low false alarm ratio. The detection of the fall is done on the basis of accelerometric data and depth maps.

The output of the first Mamdani engine is a fuzzy set. which assigns grades of membership to the possible values of dynamic transitions. whereas the output of the second one is another fuzzy set assigning membership grades to possible body poses. Since Mamdani engines perform fuzzy reasoning on disjoint subsets of the linguistic variables. the total number of the fuzzy rules needed for input–output mapping is far smaller. The person pose is determined on the basis of depth maps. whereas the pose transitions are inferred using both depth maps and the accelerations acquired by a body worn inertial sensor.

Heidelberg,Head pose estimation is an important task for many face analysis applications. such as face recognition systems and human computer interactions. In this paper we aim to address the pose estimation problem under some challenging conditions. e.g.. from a single image. large pose variation. and un-even illumination conditions. The approach we developed combines non-linear dimension reduction techniques with a learned distance metric transformation. The learned distance metric provides better intra-class clustering. therefore preserving a smooth low-dimensional manifold in the presence of large variation in the input images due to illumination changes.

Our study is based on a motion blur model which models blur effects of camera shakes using a set of planar perspective projections (i.e.. homographies).

Such studies are of great interest for diagnosis help and clinical course of development and treatment of illnesses. However. the processing of fetal brain MR images remains complicated which limits the translation from the research to the clinical domain. In this article. we describe an open-source image processing toolkit dedicated to these images. In this toolkit various tools are included such as: denoising. image reconstruction. super-resolution and tractography.

The proposed method has the advantage that no specific diffusion model needs to be assumed. Previous work assume the tensor model. but this is not suitable under certain conditions like intravoxel orientational heterogeneity (IVOH). Data reconstruction is particularly important when studying the fetal brain in utero. since registration methods applied for movement and distortion correction produce scattered data in spatial and diffusion domains. We propose the use of a groupwise registration method. and a dual spatio-angular interpolation by using radial basis functions (RBF).

Wall motion is related to local biomechanical properties of the aneurysm. which in turn are associated with the amount of damage undergone by the tissue.

In a previous work. a novel method was presented combining wall motion estimation using image registration techniques with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations in order to provide realistic intra-aneurysmal flow patterns.

1287213,A structural approach for finding functional modules from large biological networks,2008,Mutlu Mete and Fusheng Tang and Xiaowei Xu and Nurcan Yuruk,9,,9,1-14,BioMed Central,Biological systems can be modeled as complex network systems with many interactions between the components. These interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system. For example. the protein-protein interaction network is the physical basis of multiple cellular functions. One goal of emerging systems biology is to analyze very large complex biological networks such as protein-protein interaction networks. metabolic networks. and regulatory networks to identify functional modules and assign functions to certain components of the system. Network modules do not occur by chance. so identification of modules is likely to capture the biologically meaningful interactions in large-scale PPI data. Unfortunately. existing computer-based clustering methods developed to find those modules are either not so accurate or too slow. We devised a new methodology called SCAN (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks) that can efficiently find clusters or functional modules in complex biological networks as well as hubs and outliers. More specifically. we demonstrated that we can find functional modules in complex networks and classify nodes into various roles based on their structures. In this study. we showed the effectiveness of our methodology using the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein-protein interaction network.

In current practice. dermatologists determine lesion area by manually drawing lesion borders. Therefore. automated assessment tools for dermoscopy images have become an important research field mainly because of inter- and intra-observer variations in human interpretation. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is automated detection of lesion borders. To our knowledge. in our 2010 study we achieved one of the highest accuracy rates in the automated lesion border detection field by using modified density based clustering algorithm. In the previous study. we proposed a novel method which removes redundant computations in well-known spatial density based clustering algorithm. DBSCAN; thus. in turn it speeds up clustering process considerably. Our previous study was heavily dependent on the pre-processing step which creates a binary image from original image. In this study. we embed a new distance measure to the existing algorithm. This provides twofold benefits. First. since new approach removes pre-processing step. it directly works on color images instead of binary ones. Thus. very important color information is not lost. Second. accuracy of delineated lesion borders is improved on 75% of 100 dermoscopy image dataset.

Automated assessment tools for dermoscopy images have become an important field of research mainly because of inter- and intra-observer variations in human interpretation. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the detection of lesion borders. since many other features. such as asymmetry. border irregularity. and abrupt border cutoff. rely on the boundary of the lesion. To automate the process of delineating the lesions. we employed Active Contour Model (ACM) and boundary-driven density-based clustering (BD-DBSCAN) algorithms on 50 dermoscopy images. which also have ground truths to be used for quantitative comparison. We have observed that ACM and BD-DBSCAN have the same border error of 6.6% on all images. To address noisy images. BD-DBSCAN can perform better delineation than ACM. However. when used with optimum parameters. ACM outperforms BD-DBSCAN. since ACM has a higher recall ratio. We successfully proposed two new frameworks to delineate suspicious lesions with i) an ACM integrated approach with sharpening and ii) a fast boundary-driven density-based clustering technique. ACM shrinks a curve toward the boundary of the lesion. To guide the evolution. the model employs the exact solution [27] of a specific form of the Geometric Heat Partial Differential Equation [28].

Experienced histopathologists review the histological slides acquired from biopsy specimen in order to outline malignant areas. Recently. improvements in imaging technologies in terms of histological image analysis led to the discovery of virtual histological slides. In this technique. a computerized microscope scans a glass slide and generates virtual slides at a resolution of 0.25 μm/pixel. As the recognition of intrinsic cancer areas is time consuming and error prone. in this study we develop a novel method to tackle automatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck detection problem in high-resolution. wholly-scanned histopathological slides.

Recent advances in imaging technology enable us to investigate cancer tissue at cellular level. In this study we focus on wholly-scanned histopathological slides of head and neck tissues.

Automated assessment tools for dermoscopy images have become an important research field mainly because of inter- and intra-observer variations in human interpretation. In this study. we compare two approaches for automatic border detection in dermoscopy images: density based clustering (DBSCAN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithms. In the first approach. if there exists enough density –greater than certain number of points- around a point. then either a new cluster is formed around the point or an existing cluster grows by including the point and its neighbors. In the second approach FCM clustering is used. This approach has the ability to assign one data point into more than one cluster. Each approach is examined on a set of 100 dermoscopy images whose manually drawn borders by a dermatologist are used as the ground truth. Error rates; false positives and false negatives along with true positives and true negatives are quantified by comparing results with manually determined borders from a dermatologist.

These inhomogeneities may due to imperfections in the magnet or to spatial variations in the magnetic susceptibility of the object being imaged—so called susceptibility artifacts. Echo-planar imaging (EPI). used in virtually all diffusion weighted acquisition protocols. assumes a homogeneous static field. which generally does not hold for head MRI. The resulting distortions are significant. sometimes more than ten millimeters.

It is particularly well-suited for point sets that are in high-dimensions. but are close to being intrinsically low-dimensional. The approach is based on an adaptive multiscale decomposition of the point sets. The multiscale decomposition yields a sequence of optimal transport problems. that are solved in a top-to-bottom fashion from the coarsest to the finest scale. We provide numerical evidence that this multiscale approach scales approximately linearly. in time and memory. in the number of nodes. instead of quadratically or worse for a direct solution. Empirically. the multiscale approach results in less than one percent relative error in the objective function. Furthermore. the multiscale plans constructed are of interest by themselves as they may be used to introduce novel features and notions of distances between point sets. An analysis of sets of brain MRI based on optimal transport distances illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on a real world data set.

An important aspect for these scientists is to gain a qualitative understanding of the process or system from which the data is gathered. Often. both input variables and an outcome are observed and the data can be characterized as a sample from a high-dimensional scalar function. This work presents the R package msr for exploratory data analysis of multivariate scalar functions based on the Morse-Smale complex. The Morse-Smale complex provides a topologically meaningful decomposition of the domain. The msr package implements a discrete approximation of the Morse-Smale complex for data sets. In previous work this approximation has been exploited for visualization and partition-based regression. which are both supported in the msr package. The visualization combines the Morse-Smale complex with dimension-reduction techniques for a visual summary representation that serves as a guide for interactive exploration of the high-dimensional function. In a similar fashion. the regression employs a combination of linear models based on the Morse-Smale decomposition of the domain.

1287234,Regularization Free Principal Curve Estimation,2013,Samuel Gerber and Ross Whitaker,,Journal of Machine Learning Research,,,,Principal curves and manifolds provide a framework to formulate manifold learning within a statistical context. Principal curves define the notion of a curve passing through the middle of a distribution. While the intuition is clear. the formal definition leads to some technical and practical difficulties. In particular. principal curves are saddle points of the mean-squared projection distance. which poses severe challenges for estimation and model selection. This paper demonstrates that the difficulties in model selection associated with the saddle point property of principal curves are intrinsically tied to the minimization of the mean-squared projection distance. We introduce a new objective function. facilitated through a modification of the principal curve estimation approach. for which all critical points are principal curves and minima. Thus. the new formulation removes the fundamental issue for model selection in principal curve estimation. A gradient-descent-based estimator demonstrates the effectiveness of the new formulation for controlling model complexity on numerical experiments with synthetic and real data.,True,hrj5aK0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,21,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/gerber13a/gerber13a.pdf,1427620705865499659,/scholar?cites=1427620705865499659,,,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/gerber13a/gerber13a.pdf,0,0,0

Copy-move forgery (CMF) is a common technique to produce tampered images by concealing undesirable objects or replicating desirable objects in the same image. Therefore. means are required to authenticate image contents and identify the tampered areas. In this paper. a robust technique for CMF detection and localization in digital images is proposed. The technique extracts stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based features for exposing the forgeries in digital images. SWT is adopted because of its impressive localization properties. in both spectral and spatial domains.

In this paper. an effective novel technique is introduced to improve the performance of CBIR on the basis of visual words fusion of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and local intensity order pattern (LIOP) descriptors. SIFT performs better on scale changes and on invariant rotations. However. SIFT does not perform better in the case of low contrast and illumination changes within an image. while LIOP performs better in such circumstances. SIFT performs better even at large rotation and scale changes. while LIOP does not perform well in such circumstances. Moreover. SIFT features are invariant to slight distortion as compared to LIOP. The proposed technique is based on the visual words fusion of SIFT and LIOP descriptors which overcomes the aforementioned issues and significantly improves the performance of CBIR. The experimental results of the proposed technique are compared with another proposed novel features fusion technique based on SIFT-LIOP descriptors as well as with the state-of-the-art CBIR techniques.

The important aim in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is to reduce the semantic gap issue that improves the performance of image retrieval. In this paper. the objective is achieved by introducing effective visual words fusion technique based on speeded-up robust features (SURF) and histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptors. HOG is used to extract global features. whereas SURF is used for the extraction of local features. Global features are preferred for large-scale image retrieval. whereas local features perform better on those systems that support semantic queries with close visual appearance. Moreover. SURF is scale and rotation-invariant as compared to HOG descriptor and it works better for low illumination. On the contrary.

Image forensic techniques determine the integrity of images by applying various high-tech mechanisms developed in the literature. In this paper. the images are analyzed for a particular type of forgery where a region of an image is copied and pasted onto the same image to create a duplication or to conceal some existing objects. To detect the copy-move forgery attack. images are first divided into overlapping square blocks and DCT components are adopted as the block representations. Due to the high dimensional nature of the feature space. Gaussian RBF kernel PCA is applied to achieve the reduced dimensional feature vector representation that also improved the efficiency during the feature matching. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed method in comparison to state of the art. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique precisely determines the copy-move forgery even when the images are contaminated with blurring. noise. and compression and can effectively detect multiple copy-move forgeries. Hence. the proposed technique provides a computationally efficient and reliable way of copy-move forgery detection that increases the credibility of images in evidence centered applications.,True,L64Ch8kAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,47,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2016/8713202/abs/,1100458589383209954,/scholar?cites=1100458589383209954,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2016/8713202/abs/,0,0,0

In this article. we introduce a novel approach. which relies on the fusion of visual words of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and binary robust invariant scalable keypoints (BRISK) descriptors based on the visual-bag-of-words approach. The two local feature descriptors are chosen as their fusion adds complementary improvement to CBIR.

In this article. we propose a novel CBIR technique based on the visual words fusion of speeded-up robust features (SURF) and fast retina keypoint (FREAK) feature descriptors. SURF is a sparse descriptor whereas FREAK is a dense descriptor. Moreover. SURF is a scale and rotation-invariant descriptor that performs better in the case of repeatability. distinctiveness. and robustness. It is robust to noise. detection errors. geometric. and photometric deformations. It also performs better at low illumination within an image as compared to the FREAK descriptor. In contrast. FREAK is a retina-inspired speedy descriptor that performs better for classification-based problems as compared to the SURF descriptor. Experimental results show that the proposed technique based on the visual words fusion of SURF-FREAK descriptors combines the features of both descriptors and resolves the aforementioned issues. The qualitative and quantitative analysis performed on three image collections. namely Corel-1000.

The number of digital images in the form of personalized and enterprise collections have grown immensely. This is the reason that automatic image retrieval based on the actual image contents has attained a great research interest amongst the research communities. One of the major challenges which are faced in this regard is that low level digital semantics do not allow us to generate a form which may ensure the proper categorization of the images which could be further explored against the search query. The normal process which is followed is that: we generate the image representations by considering the image contents ie color. texture. or shape and group them through machine learning techniques. These groupings are returned whenever an image query is encountered and semantic class is determined. The basic limitation of this approach is that these semantic representations are not powerful enough that may guarantee the high retrieval rate. so the strength of the associated supervised. or unsupervised learning techniques cannot be fully acquired.

Natural disasters that badly affect the performance of Malaysian enterprises strongly demand a comprehensive investigation of supply chain risks. Effective mitigation strategy can only be operationalized when risks are appropriately identified and assessed. Supply chain collaboration has been verified to have a positive impact on the performance but only a limited number of studies investigate it as a risk mitigation tool. The current study presents a guiding framework for identification. assessment. and migration of environment side risks for Malaysian manufacturing. A questionnaire has been developed and distributed by systemic probability sampling. Data have been collected from the Federation of Manufacturing Malaysia through an online survey. The data were purified from missing values and outliers and were analyzed through structural equational modeling through Smart PLS. A total of nine environment side risks were identified. In risk assessment. it has been found that an environment side risk has negative effects on supply chain performance. While these risks can be mitigated through supply chain collaboration. they cannot be mitigated completely. This study will help managers to understand how environment side risks are affecting enterprise performance and how they can avoid these risks.

1287257,Watershed-based segmentation and region merging,2000,Andre Bleau and L Joshua Leon,77,Computer Vision and Image Understanding,3,317-370,Academic Press,In recent years. the watershed line has emerged as the primary tool of mathematical morphology for image segmentation. Several very efficient algorithms have been devised for the determination of watersheds. Nevertheless. the application of watershed algorithms to an image is often disappointing: the image is oversegmented into a large number of tiny. shallow watersheds. where one wanted to obtain only a few deep ones. This paper presents a novel approach to watershed merging. Mainly. it addresses the following question: given an image. what is the closest image that has a simpler watershed structure? The basic idea is to replicate the process of watershed merging that takes place when rain falls over a real landscape: smaller watersheds progressively fill until an overflow occurs. The water then flows to a nearby. larger or deeper watershed. in which the overflown watersheds are merged.

We then use wavelet multi-scale analysis (WMSA) to automatically localize specific features in both lateral and frontal radiographs. The WMSA gives an elegant spectral investigation that leads to gradient generation and edge extraction. Analysis of the information contained at several scales leads to the detection of 1) two curves enclosing the vertebral bodies' walls and 2) inter-vertebral spaces along the spine.

These contour lines are used to identify stereocorrespondent anatomical landmarks for the 3D reconstruction of the scoliotic spine using a stereoradiographic technique. Automation of the digitization of the landmarks should reduce the variability of the actual manual digitization method and improve the 3D reconstruction precision. First. a knowledge based model is used to generate anatomical markers near the pedicle centers. These markers are then used to control a morphological segmentation method allowing the automatic detection of the pedicle contour lines. Next. an ellipsis is fitted to the pedicle contour lines and stereocorrespondent landmarks are estimated in the stereoradiograhs to finally obtain their 3D location. The preliminary results demonstrated a reduction of the 2D standard deviation for the digitization of the pedicles from 2.3±1.6 mm (manual) to 0.39±0.37 mm (automatic) and an improvement in the 3D reconstruction precision by an amelioration of the stereocorrespondence estimation (reduction of the DLT error from 42.3±3.4 mm (manual) to 1.9±2.3 mm (automatic)). The automation of the stereocorrespondent landmarks digitization using computer vision methods seem to effectively reduce the variability of the method and improve the landmark correspondence identification.,True,9RuJ6JIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/15240,,,,,,0,0,0

While foraging in liquid food. larvae are observed to align themselves and coordinate their movements in order to drag a common air cavity and dig deeper. Large-scale cooperation is required to maintain contiguous air contact across the posterior breathing spiracles.

This approach is based on the availability of models describing both spatial and temporal behaviours of the geophysical features of interest. The model parameters are used to generate a multidimensional space that is then scanned with a user-defined resolution. For each point in the parameter space. a spatiotemporal template is reconstructed from the original model. This template is then used to scan the point cloud data set for regions matching the spatiotemporal behaviour.We also introduce a proportional measure where the residual for each point in the data set is compared to both the data and the template to provide a scale invariant measure of the behavioural matching.

A wide range of CBIR applications consider classification techniques. such as artificial neural networks (ANN). support vector machines (SVM). etc. to understand the query image content to retrieve relevant output. However. in multi-class search environments. the retrieval results are far from optimal due to overlapping semantics amongst subjects of various classes. The classification through multiple classifiers generate better results. but as the number of negative examples increases due to highly correlated semantic classes. classification bias occurs towards the negative class. hence. the combination of the classifiers become even more unstable particularly in one-against-all classification scenarios. In order to resolve this issue. a genetic algorithm (GA) based classifier comity learning (GCCL) method is presented in this paper to generate stable classifiers by combining ANN with SVMs through asymmetric and symmetric bagging. The proposed approach resolves the classification disagreement amongst different classifiers and also resolves the class imbalance problem in CBIR. Once the stable classifiers are generated. the query image is presented to the trained model to understand the underlying semantic content of the query image for association with the precise semantic class.

1287294,Designing an automated system for plant leaf recognition,2012,Jyotismita Chaki and Ranjan Parekh,2,International Journal of Advances in Engineering & Technology,1,149,IAET Publishing Company,This paper proposes an automated system for recognizing plant species based on leaf images. Plant leaf images corresponding to three plant types. are analyzed using three different shape modelling techniques. the first two based on the Moments-Invariant (MI) model and the Centroid-Radii (CR) model and the third based on a proposed technique of Binary-Superposition (BS). For the MI model the first four central normalized moments have been considered. For the CR model an edge detector has been used to identify the boundary of the leaf shape and 36 radii at 10 degree angular separation have been used to build the shape vector. The proposed approach consists of comparing binary versions of the leaf images through superposition and using the sum of non-zero pixel values of the resultant as the feature vector. The data set for experimentations consists of 180 images divided into training and testing sets and comparison between them is done using Manhattan. Euclidean and intersection norms. Accuracies obtained using the proposed technique is seen to be an improvement over the MI and CR based techniques. and comparable to the best figures reported in extant literature.,True,Jr-sebAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,40,https://www.academia.edu/download/9871522/16i6-ijaet0612733.pdf,4170001812882957653,/scholar?cites=4170001812882957653,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/9871522/16i6-ijaet0612733.pdf,0,0,0

Although leaves are convenient markers for identification. a major drawback is that they are prone to be damaged easily by various environmental and biological factors. The proposed research work aimed to tackle this situation by proposing a leaf recognition system that can specifically handle fragmented leaf images. As leaf images are fragmented they can not be recognize based on shape features. Here a novel approach is proposed by using the combination of fuzzy-color and edge-texture histogram in order to recognize fragmented leaf images. First. the dataset leaf images that are similar to the query fragmented leaf image is identified by using bag-of-feature. Then. the combined feature is used to generate the feature vector.

Plant leaves can have an assortment of unmistakable elements like green and non-green hue. simple and compound shape and distinctive vein designed surfaces. a solitary arrangement of elements may not be sufficiently adequate for a viable classification of heterogeneous plant sorts. A hierarchical architectural design is proposed where numerous components are joined together for a more powerful and strong classification of the visual data. The study likewise incorporates the arrangements of customization of the feature extraction modules and classifiers for best execution.

As the features are sensitive to geometric transformations of the leaf image. a pre processing step is initially performed to make the features invariant to transformations like translation. rotation and scaling. Images are classified to 32 pre-defined classes using a Neuro fuzzy classifier. Comparisons are also done with Neural Network and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers. Recognizing the fact that leaves are fragile and prone to deformations due to various environmental and biological factors. the basic technique is subsequently extended to address recognition of leaves with small deformations. Experimentations using 640 leaf images varying in shape. size. orientations and deformations demonstrate that the technique produces acceptable recognition rates.,True,Jr-sebAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,17,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7232876/,11055629526147335930,/scholar?cites=11055629526147335930,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38453648/2015_ICReTIS.pdf,0,0,0
