1215322,Residential demand response: dynamic energy management and time-varying electricity pricing,2016,Matteo Muratori and Giorgio Rizzoni,31,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,2,1108-1117,,Demand response programs are currently being proposed as a solution to deal with issues related to peak demand and to improve the operation of the electric power system. In the demand response paradigm. electric utilities provide incentives and benefits to private consumers as a compensation for their flexibility in the timing of their electricity consumption. In this paper. a dynamic energy management framework. based on highly resolved energy consumption models. is used to simulate automated residential demand response. The models estimate the residential demand using a novel bottom-up approach that quantifies consumer energy use behavior. thus providing an accurate estimation of the actual amount of controllable resources. The optimal schedule of all of the controllable appliances. including plug-in electric vehicles. is found by minimizing consumer electricity-related expenditures.

The total consumption is divided into four main categories. namely cold appliances. heating. ventilation. and air conditioning. lighting. and energy consumed by household members’ activities. The first three components are modeled using engineering physically-based models. while the activity patterns of individuals are modeled using a heterogeneous Markov chain. Using data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. a case study for an average American household is developed. The data are used to conduct an in-sample validation of the modeled activities and a rigorous statistical validation of the predicted electricity demand against metered data is provided.

Thus. one of the biggest drivers of costs and capacity requirements is the electricity demand that occurs during peak periods.This paper reviews market-related problems of modern electric grids and possible solutions to address them. In particular. one techno-economical solution. namely residential demand response programs enabled by a smart grid. is analyzed and modeled in detail. The implications of this solution from both economic and policy perspectives are discussed.The analysis results in several insights: first a local optimum does not generally lead to a global optimum. especially for complex markets; second. in this approach. there exists a disconnection between the locus of the problem (electric utilities) and the locus of the solution (change of demand); third. any techno-economic …,True,q1_gdjUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,141,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001488,852195114653579280,/scholar?cites=852195114653579280,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matteo_Muratori/publication/260780778_Role_of_residential_demand_response_in_modern_electricity_markets/links/59efa1bf0f7e9baeb26ac719/Role-of-residential-demand-response-in-modern-electricity-markets.pdf,0,0,0

However. the viability and economic consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment are not fully understood. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) integrated assessment model to explore the potential global and regional economic impacts of BECCS. As a negative-emissions technology.

The scenarios are used to characterize changes to end-use sectors under futures with increased electrification and to quantify how those changes might impact the amount and shape of electricity consumption. These scenarios were developed primarily using expert judgment and an energy system accounting framework. Of course. technology adoption will ultimately depend on a set of complex considerations that are not fully assessed using our methodology. but which are discussed extensively throughout the report. These interacting factors include technology and fuel cost trade-offs. infrastructure needs. environmental policies. and consumer preference. Within each of these factors are barriers that might challenge increased electrification-such as higher upfront costs or unfamiliarity with new electric technologies-but also opportunities that could yield greater adoption-such as increased productivity or expanded value streams enabled by electric and/or grid-connected technologies.

PEV sales. which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). have surged recently. Most PEV charging occurs at home. but widespread PEV adoption will require the development of a national network of non-residential charging stations. Installation of these stations strategically would maximize the economic viability of early stations while enabling efficient network growth as the PEV market matures. This document describes what effective co-evolution of the PEV fleet and charging infrastructure might look like under a range of scenarios. To develop the roadmap. NREL analyzed PEV charging requirements along interstate corridors and within urban and rural communities. The results suggest that a few hundred corridor fast-charging stations could enable long-distance BEV travel between US cities. Compared to interstate corridors. urban and rural communities are expected to have significantly larger charging infrastructure requirements.

For truck applications. currently responsible for nearly three-quarters of the total US freight energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. platooning has been identified as an early feature for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) that could provide significant fuel savings and improved traffic safety and efficiency without radical design or technology changes compared to existing vehicles. A statistical analysis was performed based on a large collection of real-world US truck usage data to estimate the fraction of total miles that are technically suitable for platooning. In particular. our analysis focuses on estimating'platoonable'mileage based on overall highway vehicle use and prolonged high-velocity traveling. establishing that about 65% of the total miles driven by combination trucks could be driven in platoon formation. leading to a 4% reduction in total truck fuel consumption.

Energy usage and CO2 emissions from freight have historically grown with a correlation to GDP. and there is limited evidence of near-term global decoupling of freight demand from GDP. Over the 21st century. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freight are projected to grow faster than passenger transportation or other major end-use sectors. with the magnitude of growth dependent on the assumed extent of long-term decoupling.

HEVs and PHEVs is a topic of great relevance. especially for the evaluation of the battery pack state of health (SoH) during vehicle operations and for battery life estimation. This work proposes a reduced-order model that estimates the thermal dynamics of a cylindrical Li-ion battery cell. with respect to time-varying current demands. Unlike most “black-box” dynamic models. based on system identification techniques. the proposed approach relies on the definition of a boundary-value problem for heat conduction. in the form of a linear partial differential equation. The problem is then converted into a low-order linear model by applying model-order reduction method in the frequency domain.

Hydrogen systems can present a positive value proposition for current markets. Three main findings include:(1) For hydrogen systems participating in California electricity markets. producing and selling hydrogen was found to be much more valuable than producing and storing hydrogen to later produce electricity; therefore systems should focus on producing and selling hydrogen and opportunistically providing ancillary services and arbitrage.(2) Tighter integration with electricity markets generates greater revenues (ie. systems that participate in multiple more»,True,SwXzea0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,66,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1239543,17596903208242038936,/scholar?cites=17596903208242038936,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1239543/,0,0,0

Hydrogen refueling stations may use electrolyzer systems to generate hydrogen and are proposed to have the potential of becoming smarter loads that can proactively provide grid services. On the basis of experimental findings. electrolyzer systems with balance of plant are observed to have a high level of controllability and hence can add flexibility to the grid from the demand side. A generic front end controller (FEC) is proposed. which enables an optimal operation of the load on the basis of market and grid conditions. This controller has been simulated and tested in a real-time environment with electrolyzer hardware for a performance assessment. It can optimize the operation of electrolyzer systems on the basis of the information collected by a communication module. Real-time simulation tests are performed to verify the performance of the FEC-driven electrolyzers to provide grid support that enables flexibility. greater economic revenue. and grid support for hydrogen producers under dynamic conditions. The FEC proposed in this paper is tested with electrolyzers. however. it is proposed as a generic control topology that is applicable to any load.

1215384,Hydrological effectiveness of an extensive green roof in Mediterranean climate,2019,Stefania Anna Palermo and Michele Turco and Francesca Principato and Patrizia Piro,11,Water,7,1378,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In urban water management. green roofs provide a sustainable solution for flood risk mitigation. Numerous studies have investigated green roof hydrologic effectiveness and the parameters that influence their operation; many have been conducted on the pilot scale. whereas only some of these have been executed on full-scale rooftop installations. Several models have been developed. but only a few have investigated the influence of green roof physical parameters on performance. From this broader context. this paper presents the results of a monitoring analysis of an extensive green roof located at the University of Calabria. Italy. in the Mediterranean climate region. To obtain this goal. the subsurface runoff coefficient. peak flow reduction. peak flow lag-time. and time to the start of runoff were evaluated at an event scale by considering a set of data collected between October 2015 and September 2016 consisting of 62 storm events. The mean value of subsurface runoff was 32.0% when considering the whole dataset. and 50.4% for 35 rainfall events (principally major than 8.0 mm); these results indicate the good hydraulic performance of this specific green roof in a Mediterranean climate. which is in agreement with other studies. A modeling approach was used to evaluate the influence of the substrate depth on green roof retention. The soil hydraulics features were first measured using a simplified evaporation method. and then modeled using HYDRUS-1D software (PC-Progress sro. Prague.

So far. many literature studies have investigated the hydraulic efficiency and the subsurface runoff coefficient of green roofs. showing their strong variability according to several factors. including the characteristics of storm events. Furthermore. only few studies have focused on the hydraulic efficiency of green roofs under Mediterranean climate conditions and defined the influencing hydrological parameters on the subsurface runoff coefficient. Nevertheless. for designing purposes. it is crucial to properly assess the subsurface runoff coefficient of a given green roof under specific climate conditions and its influencing factors. This study intends to. firstly. evaluate the subsurface runoff coefficient at daily and event-time scales for a given green roof. through a conceptual model implemented in SWMM. The model was loaded with both daily and 1-min rainfall data from two Mediterranean climate sites. one in Thessaloniki. Greece and one in Cosenza. Italy. respectively. Then. the most influencing hydrological parameters were examined through a statistical regression analysis. The findings show that the daily subsurface runoff coefficient is 0.70 for both sites. while the event-based one is 0.79 with a standard deviation of 0.23 for the site in Cosenza. Italy. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the influencing parameters are the rainfall intensity and antecedent dry weather period with a confidence level of 95%.

In recent years. the concept of the first flush has gained on prominence and was further developed for analyzing the interaction between the hydrology and transport of runoff pollutants. One of the most important definitions of the first flush can be derived from the analysis of the m(v) curves (i.e. the curves in which the normalized cumulative pollutant mass is plotted vs the normalized cumulative runoff volume). Indeed the m(v) curves. indicating the distribution of pollutant mass versus volume in wet‐weather flow (WWF) discharges. are commonly used for comparing pollutant discharges for different rainfall events and catchments.

Meanwhile. there are several problems in the process of implementing this approach. like epidemic diseases. Hence. in this study. the impact of climate and urban factors on confirmed cases of COVID-19 (a new type of coronavirus) with the trend and multivariate linear regression (MLR) has been investigated to propose a more accurate prediction model. For this propose. some important climate parameters. including daily average temperature. relative humidity. and wind speed. in addition to urban parameters such as population density. were considered. and their impacts on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. The analysis was performed for three case studies in Italy. and the application of the proposed method has been investigated. The impacts of parameters have been considered with a delay time from one to nine days to find out the most suitable combination. The result of the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impact of climate parameters on the trend of confirmed cases. The research hypothesis approved by the MLR model and the present assessment method could be applied by considering several variables that exhibit the exact delay of them to new confirmed cases of COVID-19.

1215389,A cumulative rainfall function for subhourly design storm in Mediterranean urban areas,2015,Marco Carbone and Michele Turco and Giuseppe Brunetti and Patrizia Piro,2015,Advances in Meteorology,,,Hindawi,Design storms are very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices and are obtained from statistical analysis of precipitation records. However considering design storms. which are often quite unlike the natural rainstorms. may result in designing oversized or undersized drainage facilities. For these reasons. in this study. a two-parameter double exponential function is proposed to parameterize historical storm events. The proposed function has been assessed against the storms selected from 5-year rainfall time series with a 1-minute resolution. measured by three meteorological stations located in Calabria. Italy. In particular. a nonlinear least square optimization has been used to identify parameters. In previous studies. several evaluation methods to measure the goodness of fit have been used with excellent performances. One parameter is related to the centroid of the rain distribution; the second one is related to high values of the standard deviation of the kurtosis for the selected events. Finally. considering the similarity between the proposed function and the Gumbel function. the two parameters have been computed with the method of moments; in this case. the correlation values were lower than those computed with nonlinear least squares optimization but sufficiently accurate for designing purposes.,True,yo4PeKUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,24,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2015/528564/abs/,30236943182841528,/scholar?cites=30236943182841528,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2015/528564/abs/,0,0,0

Studies show that green roofs can be applied to moderate roof temperature and affect the indoor temperature in summer and winter. However. the performance of green roofs depends on several parameters such as climate. irrigation. layer materials. and thickness. In this context. the present research deals with a comprehensive experimental analysis of different thermal impacts of green roofs in summer and winter in a Mediterranean climate. Measurements carried out in one year in three different types of green roofs with different thicknesses. layers. and with and without the insulation layer. The analysis determined the possible period that indoor cooling or heating might be required with and without green roofs and demonstrated the positive impact of green roofs in moderating the roof temperature and temperature fluctuations. which in summer was remarkable. In conclusion. since in the Mediterranean climate. the thermal differences between green roofs and conventional roofs in summer are much higher than winter. it seems that the green roof without an insulation layer would show better performance.

The solution to decreasing the negative effects cannot be effective without the consideration of sustainable development. There are several methods for sustainability evaluation. such as tools based on products. processes. or plants besides supply chain or life cycle analysis. and there are different rating systems suggesting 80. 140. or more indicators for assessment. The critical point is the limits such as required techniques and budget in using all indicators for all factories in the beginning. Moreover. the weight of each indicator might change based on the selected alternative that it is not a fixed value and could change in a new case study. In this regard. to determine the impact and weight of different indicators in sustainable factories. a multi-layer Triangular Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (TFAHP) approach was developed. and the application of the method was described and verified. The defined layers are six; for each layer. the pairwise comparison matrix was developed. and the total aggregated score concerning the sustainability goal for each alternative was calculated that shows the Relative Importance Coefficient (RIC). The method is formulated in a way that allows adding the new indicators in all layers as the verification shows. and thus. there are no limits for using any green rating systems. Therefore. the presented approach by TFAHP would provide an additional tool toward the sustainable development of factories.,True,0xWs8-EAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,15,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/1841,13862897287582802208,/scholar?cites=13862897287582802208,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/1841/htm,0,0,0

This study presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of different thermal impacts and water consumption of green roofs in a Mediterranean climate. The study aims to investigate the use of water directly for green roofs and reduce the water footprint of energy in summer and winter due to its thermal impacts. The measurements were carried out for an extensive green roof with an area of 55 m 2 and a thickness of 22 cm. and direct water consumption by a green roof and direct and indirect water consumption by cooling and heating systems were analyzed. According to the analysis. in summer. the maximum roof temperature on a conventional roof was 72 C. while under the green roof it was 30.3 C. In winter. the minimum roof temperature on a conventional roof was− 8.6 C. while under the green roof it was 7.4 C. These results show that green roofs affect energy consumption in summer and winter. and the corresponding thermal requirements for the building have a water footprint regarding energy production. In summer. the thermal reduction in the water footprint by a green roof was 48 m 3 if an evaporative air conditioner is used and 8.9 m 3 for a compression air conditioner. whereas the water consumed in the green roof was 8.2 m 3. Therefore. using water directly in the green roof would reduce the energy consumption in buildings. and thus less water has to be used in power plants to provide the same thermal impact.

These systems can be applied for managing stormwater. saving energy consumption. decreasing noise pollution. improving runoff quality. improving life quality. and so forth. Besides. atmospheric water harvesting methods are considered a nonconventional water source. There are many studies about the analysis and advantages of green walls and atmospheric water harvesting conducted separately. However. the use of a combined system that uses fog harvesting in the irrigation of green walls has received less attention in previous studies. and therefore in this research. the feasibility of a novel green wall platform was investigated. At first. the potential of using green walls and atmospheric water harvesting in different climates was analyzed. Then a new combined system was proposed and explained. The study results determined that atmospheric water harvesting can be applied as a source of irrigation for green facilities. particularly in the dry season and in periods with lower precipitation. In the Mediterranean climate. summer fog harvesting yields 1.4–4.6 L/m 2/day. and the water consumption of green walls is about 4–8 L/day/m 2. This can improve one issue of green walls in an urban environment. which is irrigation in summer. Furthermore. the novel system would protect plants from severe conditions. improve buildings’ thermal behavior by decreasing direct sunlight. and increase conventional green walls’ efficiency and advantages.

Remarkable results have been obtained about the value of fractal dimensions both of a whole network and of a single channel. In this paper 17 river networks in Southern Italy are investigated in terms of their fractal nature and fractal dimension. The results confirm the fractal structure of both river networks and of stream channels. Geological constraints and features deriving from the maturity of the basins seem to reduce the capability of stream reaches to develop a purely branching process. Consequently the fractal dimension of stream networks turns out to be appreciably different from the one predicted by the topological randomness model. Thus the values we found for the fractal dimensions are less than 2 for the networks and not equal to 1 for river reaches.,True,33t_7gcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,68,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169496030910,17288323630988717412,/scholar?cites=17288323630988717412,,,0,0,0

Studies show that green roofs can be applied to moderate roof temperature and affect the indoor temperature in summer and winter. However. the performance of green roofs depends on several parameters such as climate. irrigation. layer materials. and thickness. In this context. the present research deals with a comprehensive experimental analysis of different thermal impacts of green roofs in summer and winter in a Mediterranean climate. Measurements carried out in one year in three different types of green roofs with different thicknesses. layers. and with and without the insulation layer. The analysis determined the possible period that indoor cooling or heating might be required with and without green roofs and demonstrated the positive impact of green roofs in moderating the roof temperature and temperature fluctuations. which in summer was remarkable. In conclusion. since in the Mediterranean climate. the thermal differences between green roofs and conventional roofs in summer are much higher than winter. it seems that the green roof without an insulation layer would show better performance.

Specifically. these conditions require the identification of new resource allocation optimization solutions capable of taking into account the water resource losses due to climate change scenarios. As is well known. Southern Italy is a region that is potentially very sensitive to climate change. In this paper. a 1717 km 2 area. corresponding to the province of Crotone. was analyzed as a study case. This area is characterized by a sufficient availability of resources as a whole as compared to the needs of the users. but has an unbalanced distribution of water through its various systems. After identifying water resource allocations in detail for this area. an optimization solution accounting for the expected reduced availability of water resources in the context of climate change was created and was compared with the optimization solution for current water availability.

The threat of terrorist attacks to these systems has led to the need for the international scientific community to deal with the vulnerability assessment related to such events. In this context. this paper proposes an Infrastructure Vulnerability Index for drinking water distribution system with the aim of providing managers with a tool to assess system vulnerability to possible terrorist acts and to support the investments choice aimed at increasing security. This index is obtained using a set of indicators with reference to the structural parts of the system and considers both intentional contamination and physical damage. The index uses a hierarchic structure and decomposes the system into components and uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process to compute the weights.

The ability to meet the water demand at the nodes. under the required pressures head. depends on many characteristic factors of the water network. such as various infrastructural components. A water distribution network is a complex system consisting of numerous structural elements and dependent by several factors. Resilience. robustness and vulnerability are of great interest. for these systems. in relation to the possible failure conditions which may compromise the network’s ability to fulfill the project conditions. Vulnerability measures how much the network is fragile: a higher value of vulnerability means that the network is prone to fail in achieving the project conditions. In the present work. a new vulnerability measure based on a topological approach is proposed. A first application of the proposed vulnerability measure on two water networks known in the literature is described. and the obtained results are compared with other performance indices showing a significant correlation.

The solution to decreasing the negative effects cannot be effective without the consideration of sustainable development. There are several methods for sustainability evaluation. such as tools based on products. processes. or plants besides supply chain or life cycle analysis. and there are different rating systems suggesting 80. 140. or more indicators for assessment. The critical point is the limits such as required techniques and budget in using all indicators for all factories in the beginning. Moreover. the weight of each indicator might change based on the selected alternative that it is not a fixed value and could change in a new case study. In this regard. to determine the impact and weight of different indicators in sustainable factories. a multi-layer Triangular Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (TFAHP) approach was developed. and the application of the method was described and verified. The defined layers are six; for each layer. the pairwise comparison matrix was developed. and the total aggregated score concerning the sustainability goal for each alternative was calculated that shows the Relative Importance Coefficient (RIC). The method is formulated in a way that allows adding the new indicators in all layers as the verification shows. and thus. there are no limits for using any green rating systems.

We could also say that his real birth and development was in Magna Graecia. the ancient South of Italy. and it is surprising that we find. in that time. a notable convergence not only of the mathematical and philosophical point of view. but also of what resembles the first “computational approach” to “infinitely” or very large numbers by Archimedes. On the other hand. since the birth of philosophy in ancient Greece. the concept of infinite has been closely linked with that of contradiction and. more precisely. with the intellectual effort to overcome contradictions present in an account of Totality as fully grounded.

This study presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of different thermal impacts and water consumption of green roofs in a Mediterranean climate. The study aims to investigate the use of water directly for green roofs and reduce the water footprint of energy in summer and winter due to its thermal impacts. The measurements were carried out for an extensive green roof with an area of 55 m 2 and a thickness of 22 cm. and direct water consumption by a green roof and direct and indirect water consumption by cooling and heating systems were analyzed. According to the analysis. in summer. the maximum roof temperature on a conventional roof was 72 C. while under the green roof it was 30.3 C. In winter. the minimum roof temperature on a conventional roof was− 8.6 C. while under the green roof it was 7.4 C. These results show that green roofs affect energy consumption in summer and winter. and the corresponding thermal requirements for the building have a water footprint regarding energy production. In summer. the thermal reduction in the water footprint by a green roof was 48 m 3 if an evaporative air conditioner is used and 8.9 m 3 for a compression air conditioner. whereas the water consumed in the green roof was 8.2 m 3. Therefore. using water directly in the green roof would reduce the energy consumption in buildings. and thus less water has to be used in power plants to provide the same thermal impact.

In such conditions. the layer is the site of the formation of one or more bi-phase interfaces. which originate on the boundary surfaces. or are always present and fluctuate within the layer. It is also possible that the layer does not undergo any phase change. The study has been developed by a finite difference numeric calculation model which explicitly determines the number and the position of the bi-phase interfaces that originate in the layer and the temperature and the heat flux fields. The surface heat fluxes are used to evaluate the PCM layer energetic behavior in terms of energy transferred through the boundary surfaces and of stored energy in sensible and latent form. The proposed method employs the characteristic day that it is periodically repeated for all the days of the considered month. The use of the characteristic days drastically reduces the computational burden of the numerical calculation and it allows to obtain guidance on the behaviour of the PCM throughout the year. in accordance with the variability of external …,True,wBfXRLwAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,27,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/5/659,10973977771413773283,/scholar?cites=10973977771413773283,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/5/659/pdf,0,0,0

It is therefore necessary to quantify and assess properly the summer thermal performance and to determine how a green roof cover can attenuate and delay the temperature and heat flux acting on its surface. The paper deals with an experimental investigation of the dynamic thermal characteristics of a vegetated roof situated on a university building roof in south Italy. An analysis of the daily values of dynamic parameters showed a quite stable trend of the decrement factor with variation in the range 0.0982–0.1920.

Numerous studies have investigated green roof hydrologic effectiveness and the parameters that influence their operation; many have been conducted on the pilot scale. whereas only some of these have been executed on full-scale rooftop installations. Several models have been developed. but only a few have investigated the influence of green roof physical parameters on performance. From this broader context. this paper presents the results of a monitoring analysis of an extensive green roof located at the University of Calabria. Italy. in the Mediterranean climate region. To obtain this goal. the subsurface runoff coefficient. peak flow reduction. peak flow lag-time. and time to the start of runoff were evaluated at an event scale by considering a set of data collected between October 2015 and September 2016 consisting of 62 storm events. The mean value of subsurface runoff was 32.0% when considering the whole dataset. and 50.4% for 35 rainfall events (principally major than 8.0 mm); these results indicate the good hydraulic performance of this specific green roof in a Mediterranean climate. which is in agreement with other studies.

However considering design storms. which are often quite unlike the natural rainstorms. may result in designing oversized or undersized drainage facilities. For these reasons. in this study. a two-parameter double exponential function is proposed to parameterize historical storm events. The proposed function has been assessed against the storms selected from 5-year rainfall time series with a 1-minute resolution. measured by three meteorological stations located in Calabria. Italy. In particular. a nonlinear least square optimization has been used to identify parameters. In previous studies. several evaluation methods to measure the goodness of fit have been used with excellent performances. One parameter is related to the centroid of the rain distribution; the second one is related to high values of the standard deviation of the kurtosis for the selected events. Finally. considering the similarity between the proposed function and the Gumbel function. the two parameters have been computed with the method of moments; in this case. the correlation values were lower than those computed with nonlinear least squares optimization but sufficiently accurate for designing purposes.,True,YtbXnh8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,24,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2015/528564/abs/,30236943182841528,/scholar?cites=30236943182841528,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2015/528564/abs/,0,0,0

The solution to decreasing the negative effects cannot be effective without the consideration of sustainable development. There are several methods for sustainability evaluation. such as tools based on products. processes. or plants besides supply chain or life cycle analysis. and there are different rating systems suggesting 80. 140. or more indicators for assessment. The critical point is the limits such as required techniques and budget in using all indicators for all factories in the beginning. Moreover. the weight of each indicator might change based on the selected alternative that it is not a fixed value and could change in a new case study. In this regard. to determine the impact and weight of different indicators in sustainable factories. a multi-layer Triangular Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (TFAHP) approach was developed. and the application of the method was described and verified. The defined layers are six; for each layer. the pairwise comparison matrix was developed. and the total aggregated score concerning the sustainability goal for each alternative was calculated that shows the Relative Importance Coefficient (RIC).

Results have shown that the removal rates of Cu and Zn of the lab-scale system range from 85% to 92% and from 65% to 82%. respectively.

1215487,Modeling of hydraulic behaviour of green roof in catchment scale,2014,Marco Carbone and Michele Turco and Gennaro Nigro and Patrizia Piro,,,,471-478,,In the last decades the increase of urbanization has drastically modified the hydrological cycle; in particular. while the extension of impervious surface has increased the runoff and hence. the potential for flooding. the reduction of green areas has caused the formation of urban heat island and consequently. the increase of the energy demand. Another negative effect of urbanization has been a severe decline of biodiversity. In this context a comprehensive land planning and engineering design approach with a goal of maintaining are needed to restore pre-development hydrologic regime of urban and developing watersheds.

1215488,A Novel Idea for Improving the Efficiency of Green Walls in Urban Environment (an Innovative Design and Technique),2020,Behrouz Pirouz and Michele Turco and Stefania Anna Palermo,12,Water,12,3524,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The advantages of low-impact development approaches. such as green walls in an urban environment. are numerous. These systems can be applied for managing stormwater. saving energy consumption. decreasing noise pollution. improving runoff quality. improving life quality. and so forth. Besides. atmospheric water harvesting methods are considered a nonconventional water source. There are many studies about the analysis and advantages of green walls and atmospheric water harvesting conducted separately. However. the use of a combined system that uses fog harvesting in the irrigation of green walls has received less attention in previous studies. and therefore in this research. the feasibility of a novel green wall platform was investigated. At first. the potential of using green walls and atmospheric water harvesting in different climates was analyzed. Then a new combined system was proposed and explained. The study results determined that atmospheric water harvesting can be applied as a source of irrigation for green facilities. particularly in the dry season and in periods with lower precipitation. In the Mediterranean climate. summer fog harvesting yields 1.4–4.6 L/m 2/day. and the water consumption of green walls is about 4–8 L/day/m 2. This can improve one issue of green walls in an urban environment. which is irrigation in summer. Furthermore. the novel system would protect plants from severe conditions. improve buildings’ thermal behavior by decreasing direct sunlight. and increase conventional green walls’ efficiency and advantages.

For this reason. an accurate estimation of storm event properties is central to continuous simulation of rainfall. Rainfall is generally noted as single events or storms where the beginning and the end are defined by rainless of particular size duration called Minimum Inter-event Time (MIT). Starting from a critical study of the state of the art. this paper intends to investigate the definition of MIT for rainfall events shorter than an hour that. on an urban scale. are the most critical for designers. planners and operators of urban drainage system.

Southern Italy)—a sedimentation tank is located. aiming at collecting the basin surface runoff and improve its quality. First. experimental results of the treatment effects are here presented and analyzed. In addition. a monitoring campaign was conducted in order to characterize the particles transported by surface runoff and to determine the treatment efficiency of the tank. The analysis showed the presence of a pollutant load in the surface runoff of the Vermicelli basin and provided information on its particle-size distribution (PSD). Results were considered in terms of the treatment efficiency of the sedimentation tank. showing a good overall removal efficiency value. together with a high variability of the removal sedimentation efficiency. This variability is mainly due to the different grain size of the suspended solids and the characteristics of the rainfall event.

Green roofs consist of a number of layers. including a vegetation layer. a lightweight soil medium. a drainage layer and an impermeable membrane. Recent studies have confirmed the benefits of green roofs. Green roofs are able to retain water. reduce peak flow. improve biodiversity and mitigate heat island. Although the benefits are evident. the transition from traditional urban drainage systems to the sustainable ones is very slow. A limiting factor in spreading the use of such systems is the lack of proper modelling tools for design. especially for the infiltration processes in a growing medium.

Recently. scientific community has focused its attention on Low-impact developments (LIDs) techniques that have proven to be valuable alternatives for stormwater management and hydrological restoration. by reducing stormwater runoff by reproducing natural hydrological processes in urban areas. However. the lack of diffusion of adequate modelling tools represents a barrier in designing and constructing such systems. In general. Permeable Pavement (PP) represents a good solution to solve stormwater management problems both in quantitative and qualitative way. This thesis focused on assessing the hydraulic behaviour and water quality performance of permeable pavements based on laboratory experiments and developing a modelling approach for the water flow in order to assisting engineers and researchers in the design of these systems. In this way. an adequate hydrological description of water flow in the pavement system relies heavily on the knowledge of the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the construction materials.

The various parametrizations which have been used to analyse the low-energy K− p scattering data are reviewed and compared. and a simple consistency test of these parametrizations is proposed. The consistency condition is satisfied by the existing constant scattering length parameters and by a new constant K-matrix solution obtained by Martin and Sakitt. but not by the effective-range K-matrix parametrization of Kim. Other recently proposed consistency tests are discussed. and it is shown in particular that an argument used by Chan and Meiere to rule out the determination of g Λ 2 using constant scattering lengths is not valid. since the inconsistency found by them in this case is due entirely to the incorrect behaviour of …,True,010kMq0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,23,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321369900352,8888514443302635974,/scholar?cites=8888514443302635974,,,0,0,0

Our sum rules are applied to the analysis of forwardπ N scattering. Particular attention has been devoted to the problem of correctly handling the experimental errors. in order to understand the true predictive capacity of continous-moment sum rules. From the analysis of the crossing-odd amplitude it is suggested that the usual Regge-pole expansion provides a better approximation for the scattering amplitude stripped of the Born term than for the full amplitude. The results are consistent with a ρ-exchange model; it is shown that realistic errors on the ρ parameters are much larger than usually claimed.

For this purpose. a non-linear model of mechanic and chemo-poroelastic interactions between fluids. contaminants and solid matrix is presented. For the binary case we obtain a system of two non-linear coupled equations describing the isothermal evolution of fluid pressure and contaminant density in shales. In addition to the usual diffusive solutions obtained in linear analyses. a novel process is found. Indeed we show the presence of intense transient phenomena. i.e. quick non-linear shock waves of both pressure and contaminant. We apply this model first to a simple. homogeneous shale. then to more realistic cases. and finally to a non-compressive filter cake buildup.

BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide. especially in the Northern Hemisphere. have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus. and in particular. the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. OBJECTIVE: The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature. a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature.  METHOD: The research hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. The F-test was used to test whether there is significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies. and then. by the T-Test. the existence of a significant difference was investigated. In all statistical tests. the confidence level of 95% is considered. In order to minimize the impact on the results of factors like the policy of the government or cultural differences among countries (food. exercise. weight. etc.). three case studies within five countries. namely Iran.

Studies show that green roofs can be applied to moderate roof temperature and affect the indoor temperature in summer and winter. However. the performance of green roofs depends on several parameters such as climate. irrigation. layer materials. and thickness. In this context. the present research deals with a comprehensive experimental analysis of different thermal impacts of green roofs in summer and winter in a Mediterranean climate. Measurements carried out in one year in three different types of green roofs with different thicknesses. layers. and with and without the insulation layer. The analysis determined the possible period that indoor cooling or heating might be required with and without green roofs and demonstrated the positive impact of green roofs in moderating the roof temperature and temperature fluctuations. which in summer was remarkable. In conclusion. since in the Mediterranean climate. the thermal differences between green roofs and conventional roofs in summer are much higher than winter. it seems that the green roof without an insulation layer would show better performance.

Liquefied natural gas is transported by gas tankers at a temperature of around 113K at atmospheric pressure. The successive process of regasification. necessary to inlet the gas in the pipeline network. makes it possible to use the LNG exergy for various applications. particularly for the production of electrical energy. In this work. the possibility of capturing the thermal energy released during regasification with an ammonia closed Rankine cycle and an LNG open Rankine cycle. associated to a steam closed Rankine cycle of waste incinerator. is investigated.

In physical processes. the entropy assumes great significance for introduction to the second law of thermodynamics. and it is defined by means of a simple formulation of a Pfaff differential. Instead. in chemical processes. the entropic evaluations are described by the Gibbs thermodynamic theory. Concerning entropic analysis. the considered physical and chemical processes regard two different practical cases in thermodynamic science: the transfer of thermal energy in heat exchangers and combustion reactions. In particular. by means of entropic production. a comparison between different types of heat exchangers and the ecological goodness of some fuels in heat production. have been investigated. By using the information theory of Shannon and Weaver. the entropy notion extends its applicability domain. exploiting this concept also to different extra-physical applications.

Trombe walls are an interesting and viable option for the reduction of building energy requirements for heating. especially in cold climates. This study presents the experimental analysis of an innovative Trombe wall configuration. named a thermo-diode Trombe wall. which was specifically designed to improve the energy efficiency by providing a proper level of insulation for the building envelope. Such a design is essential in cold climates to limit the thermal losses whilst increasing solar heat gains to the heated spaces. An experimental campaign was conducted from December to March that involved monitoring the external climatic conditions and the main thermal parameters to assess the thermal performance of the proposed solution. The results demonstrated that in the presence of solar radiation. the thermo-diode Trombe wall was able to generate significant natural convection inside the air cavity. with temperatures higher than 35 C in the upper section. by providing consistent heat gains for the indoor environment. even on cold days and for hours after the end of the daylight.

All tests were carried out in controlled conditions in a full-scale experimental flume installed at a mine site. using the flow of fresh mine tailings from the discharge pipeline. For each test. a limiting equilibrium bed slope was obtained. Velocity and density fluctuations and also the average profile with depth were recorded.

The steps increase the rate of energy dissipation taking place on the spillway face. Turbulence. flow aeration and energy dissipation are the main tasks in the design of such structures. This study consists of the experimental investigation to determine the energy dissipation over stepped spillways. Experiments conducted at Water Research Institute on two physical models of the Siyah Bisheh stepped spillways in Iran. To develop a more generalized expression. the results of previous investigations were also considered in our study. Therefore. a wide range of variables were taken into account to estimate the energy dissipation along the non-uniform flow regime. Assuming the energy dissipation along the uniform flow regime to be equal to the vertical displacement of the jet. the total energy lost was calculated.

Aeration is found to be the most effective and efficient way to prevent cavitation attack. Several experimental equations are presented to predict air demand in gated tunnels; however. they are restricted to particular model geometries and flow conditions and often provide differing results. In this study the current relationships are first evaluated. and then other approaches for air discharge estimation are investigated. Three machine learning techniques are compared based on the flow measurements of eight physical models. with scales ranging from 1:12–1:20. including the fuzzy inference system (FIS). the genetic fuzzy system (GFS). and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

Meanwhile. there are several problems in the process of implementing this approach. like epidemic diseases. Hence. in this study. the impact of climate and urban factors on confirmed cases of COVID-19 (a new type of coronavirus) with the trend and multivariate linear regression (MLR) has been investigated to propose a more accurate prediction model. For this propose. some important climate parameters. including daily average temperature. relative humidity. and wind speed. in addition to urban parameters such as population density. were considered. and their impacts on confirmed cases of COVID-19 were analyzed. The analysis was performed for three case studies in Italy. and the application of the proposed method has been investigated. The impacts of parameters have been considered with a delay time from one to nine days to find out the most suitable combination. The result of the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impact of climate parameters on the trend of confirmed cases. The research hypothesis approved by the MLR model and the present assessment method could be applied by considering several variables that exhibit the exact delay of them to new confirmed cases of COVID-19.

The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) as an infectious disease showed that it has undesirable social. environmental. and economic impacts. and leads to serious challenges and threats. Additionally. investigating the prioritization parameters is of vital importance to reducing the negative impacts of this global crisis. Hence. the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose. four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters—such as daily average temperature. relative humidity. wind speed—and an urban parameter. population density. were considered as input data set. with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset. In this paper. two artificial intelligence techniques. including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm. were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters. The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally. the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models. hence. the two methods were not different in cost function. however. ANN-PSO was found to be better. because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE.

The solution to decreasing the negative effects cannot be effective without the consideration of sustainable development. There are several methods for sustainability evaluation. such as tools based on products. processes. or plants besides supply chain or life cycle analysis. and there are different rating systems suggesting 80. 140. or more indicators for assessment. The critical point is the limits such as required techniques and budget in using all indicators for all factories in the beginning. Moreover. the weight of each indicator might change based on the selected alternative that it is not a fixed value and could change in a new case study. In this regard. to determine the impact and weight of different indicators in sustainable factories. a multi-layer Triangular Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (TFAHP) approach was developed. and the application of the method was described and verified. The defined layers are six; for each layer. the pairwise comparison matrix was developed. and the total aggregated score concerning the sustainability goal for each alternative was calculated that shows the Relative Importance Coefficient (RIC). The method is formulated in a way that allows adding the new indicators in all layers as the verification shows. and thus. there are no limits for using any green rating systems. Therefore. the presented approach by TFAHP would provide an additional tool toward the sustainable development of factories.,True,MNrSUyoAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,15,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/1841,13862897287582802208,/scholar?cites=13862897287582802208,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/1841/htm,0,0,0

BACKGROUND: The rapid outbreak of the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the spread of the virus worldwide. especially in the Northern Hemisphere. have prompted various investigations about the impact of environmental factors on the rate of development of this epidemic. Different studies have called attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus. and in particular. the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. OBJECTIVE: The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature. a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature.  METHOD: The research hypothesis was investigated through statistical analysis. The F-test was used to test whether there is significant equality of variances for each pair of case studies. and then. by the T-Test. the existence of a significant difference was investigated.

Current talent identification (TI) schemes in sport typically select on the basis of discrete. unidimensional measures at unstable periods in the athlete’s development. In this article. the concept of talent is revised as a complex. dynamical system in which future behaviors emerge from an interaction of key performance determinants such as psychological behaviors. motor abilities. and physical characteristics. Key nonlinear dynamics concepts are related to TI approaches such as sensitivity to initial conditions. transitions. and exponential behavioral distributions. It is concluded that many TI models place an overemphasis on early identification rather than the development of potentially talented performers.

Transitory changes in the basketball free-throw shot were examined across different stages in skill development. Six female basketball players were selected. representing a range of playing expertise (pretest: 0–90% baskets scored). Each participant was video recorded performing 30 shots. Contrary to predictions. there was not a clear pattern of a reduction in trajectory variability with increasing skill level. However. improvements in skill level were associated with an increasing amount of intertrial movement consistency from the elbow and wrist joints. It is suggested that the angular motions of the elbow and wrist joints were compensated for each other toward the end of each throw to adapt to subtle changes in release parameters of the ball. ,True,yo-6AGoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,297,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02701367.2003.10609090,6257685324096985139,/scholar?cites=6257685324096985139,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris_Button/publication/9080309_Examining_Movement_Variability_in_the_Basketball_Free-Throw_Action_at_Different_Skill_Levels/links/5501a9350cf2d60c0e5faefb.pdf,0,0,0
1215602,19. Emergence of sport skills under constraints,2004,Duarte Araújo and Keith Davids and Simon J Bennett and Chris Button and Graham Chapman,,"Skill acquisition in sport: Research, theory and practice",,409,Routledge,A key factor in understanding the emergence of skilled behaviour in sport concerns the role of the coach in structuring task constraints and organizing practice environments (for a review. see Schmidt and Lee. 1999). Perhaps the most significant task constraints include the nature of the equipment used by learners during practice and the structure and organization of activities that coaches use to simulate strategic sub-phases of sports. such as attacking or defending in team ball games. From a dynamical systems theoretical standpoint. contemporary work on motor behaviour in sport has been influenced by concepts such as self-organization. constraints. emergence. variability and stability of motor patterns in developing and learning movement systems (see Davids et al.. 2002; Handford et al.. 1997; Kelso. 1995). Dynamical systems are complex. highly interconnected systems that are capable of acquiring rich patterns of behaviour due to the potential for interaction between system components. In human movement systems learners are able to assemble functional coordination patterns from numerous peripheral motor system degrees of freedom (broadly speaking. these are the many different components of the human body) during practice. Dynamical systems theory views influential factors within the practice environment as constraints on the acquisition of movement coordination (Newell et al.. 2001). The proposition is that movement coordination emerges under interacting constraints. which harness the mechanical degrees of freedom of the movement system during learning. Due to the abundance of mechanical degrees of freedom available …,True,yo-6AGoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,283,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Tm-BAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA409&dq=info:ADulfFhVREgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=YwY5dfwLMQ&sig=tzj0zcqFicMPrxTAwx4yKz-HB9w,5207380907683822336,/scholar?cites=5207380907683822336,,,0,0,0

Ten physically active men attended 5 separate testing sessions over a 3-week period where they performed unloaded and loaded (10-kg extra load) countermovement (CMJ) and static (SJ) jumps. followed by straight-line 20-m sprints. Jump height was recorded for the vertical jumps using a jump mat. while the time for 10 m and 20 m was recorded during the sprints using photocells. The highest (jump conditions) and fastest (sprint) of 3 trials performed during each of the 5 testing sessions was used in the subsequent analysis. Familiarization was assessed using the scores obtained during the 5 separate testing sessions. Reliability was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficient of variation (CV). No significant differences were obtained between the testing sessions for any of the measures. ICCs ranged from 0.89 to 0.95. while CVs ranged from 1.9 to 2.6%.

Weaknesses of traditional approaches to expert performance. which uniquely focus on the performer and the environment separately. are highlighted by an ecological dynamics perspective. Key properties of expert movement systems include ‘multi- and meta-stability’. ‘adaptive variability’. ‘redundancy’. ‘degeneracy’ and the ‘attunement to affordances’. Empirical research on these expert system properties indicates that skill acquisition does not emerge from the internal representation of declarative and procedural knowledge. or the imitation of expert behaviours to linearly reduce a perceived ‘gap’ separating movements of beginners and a putative expert model.

Four male participants practiced a soccer chipping task to seven different target positions over 12 sessions for 4 weeks. Data from each participant indicated changes in degrees of freedom involvement as a function of practice. Further. each participant showed a different progression of change in levels of joint involvement for hip. knee and ankle in the kicking limb. Cross-correlations between joints in the kicking limb also showed different pathways of coupling and de-coupling with practice.

We developed an in-situ experimental paradigm which manipulated the duration of anticipatory visual information from a penalty taker's actions to examine experienced goalkeepers' vulnerability to deception for the penalty kick in association football. Irrespective of the penalty taker's kick strategy. goalkeepers initiated movement responses earlier across consecutively earlier presentation points. Overall goalkeeping performance was better in non-deception trials than in deception conditions.

To support our argument we examine longitudinal data on the performance of fundamental target skills such as passing and shooting. Evidence emerged from these studies that the addition of random variability during the practice of football skills benefited participants of different skill levels. compared to players engaged in traditional practice programmes emphasizing continuous repetition of target movements. The ubiquitous phenomenon of stochastic resonance is proposed as a potential mechanism for the counterintuitive benefits of adding noise to learning and performance environments. Further research is needed to verify our interpretation of these data from football suggesting that stochastic resonance may form an umbrella explanatory framework on the role of variability in extant theories of motor learning.,True,yo-6AGoAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,120,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wolfgang_Schoellhorn/publication/27466409_Does_noise_provide_a_basis_for_the_unification_of_motor_learning_theories/links/0deec53873db69db4e000000/Does-noise-provide-a-basis-for-the-unification-of-motor-learning-theories.pdf?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=y175djm5mLWgjTe9adcdsNi8&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationDownload,9857735355965164369,/scholar?cites=9857735355965164369,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wolfgang_Schoellhorn/publication/27466409_Does_noise_provide_a_basis_for_the_unification_of_motor_learning_theories/links/0deec53873db69db4e000000/Does-noise-provide-a-basis-for-the-unification-of-motor-learning-theories.pdf?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=y175djm5mLWgjTe9adcdsNi8&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationDownload,0,0,0

This article discusses the nature of the relationship between expertise. perception and action using ideas from ecological psychology (Gibson. 1979) and representative task design (Brunswik. 1956). This conceptual framework suggests that a shortcoming of many research studies is a failure to accurately sample the performance environments of which skilled athletes have experience.

The main purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach for learning a sports skill. Twenty-four 10-year-old females participated in a 4-week intervention involving either a Nonlinear Pedagogy (i.e..manipulation of task constraints including equipment and rules) or a Linear Pedagogy (i.e.. prescriptive. repetitive drills) approach to learn a tennis forehand stroke. Performance accuracy scores. movement criterion scores and kinematic data were measured during pre-intervention. post-intervention and retention tests. While both groups showed improvements in performance accuracy scores over time. the Nonlinear Pedagogy group displayed a greater number of movement clusters at post-test indicating the presence of degeneracy (i.e.. many ways to achieve the same outcome). The results suggest that degeneracy is effective for learning a sports skill facilitated by a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach. These findings challenge the common misconception that there must be only one ideal movement solution for a task and thus have implications for coaches and educators when designing instructions for skill acquisition.,True,yo-6AGoAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,97,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104744,8717403875364332090,/scholar?cites=8717403875364332090,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104744,0,0,0

1215623,Memory retention–the synaptic stability versus plasticity dilemma,2005,Wickliffe C Abraham and Anthony Robins,28,,2,73-78,Elsevier Current Trends,Memory maintenance is widely believed to involve long-term retention of the synaptic weights that are set within relevant neural circuits during learning. However. despite recent exciting technical advances. it has not yet proved possible to confirm experimentally this intuitively appealing hypothesis. Artificial neural networks offer an alternative methodology as they permit continuous monitoring of individual connection weights during learning and retention. In such models. ongoing alterations in connection weights are required if a network is to retain previously stored material while learning new information. Thus. the duration of synaptic change does not necessarily define the persistence of a memory; rather. it is likely that a regulated balance of synaptic stability and synaptic plasticity is required for optimal memory retention in real neuronal circuits.,True,xs8_u2IAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,268,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223604003704,4965250930358623855,/scholar?cites=4965250930358623855,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.371.6320&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1215634,The role of teachers in implementing curriculum changes,2013,David Thompson and Tim Bell and Peter Andreae and Anthony Robins,,,,245-250,,In 2011 New Zealand introduced computer science into high schools after a long period when computing was mainly focussed on training students to be users. The transition was rapid. and teachers had little time to upskill to prepare for the new topics. and yet there was widespread voluntary adoption of the new standards. The role of teachers and the national teachers' organisation in making the change has been pivotal. and this paper reviews the changes from the teachers' perspective. This story is intended to inform those planning similar changes in other countries. and provide a context for the next steps in NZ. The discussion centres around a survey of 91~ teachers. which reveals strong intrinsic motivation from teachers to make the changes. a mixture of prior knowledge and skills that teachers shared with each other through peer support and online communication. a low level of confidence as teachers of …,True,xs8_u2IAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,55,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2445196.2445272,13623551956798218266,/scholar?cites=13623551956798218266,,http://132.181.17.3/tim.bell/dt/sig177-thompson.pdf,0,0,0
1215635,The consolidation of learning during sleep: comparing the pseudorehearsal and unlearning accounts,1999,Anthony Robins and Simon McCallum,12,Neural Networks,7-8,1191-1206,Pergamon,We suggest that any brain-like (artificial neural network based) learning system will need a sleep-like mechanism for consolidating newly learned information if it wishes to cope with the sequential/ongoing learning of significantly new information. We summarise and explore two possible candidates for a computational account of this consolidation process in Hopfield type networks. The “pseudorehearsal” method is based on the relearning of randomly selected attractors in the network as the new information is added from some second system. This process is supposed to reinforce old information within the network and protect it from the disruption caused by learning new inputs. The “unlearning” method is based on the unlearning of randomly selected attractors in the network after new information has already been learned.

The shots were the free throw. the three-point and the hook shot. The free throw and three-point shot were hypothesised to be more similar to one another than to the hook shot. The first analysis involved an analysis of trial trajectories visualised on a U-matrix. Two of the participants. unexpectedly. showed more similarity between the three-point shot and the hook shot. instead of the free throw. Where the first analysis was useful in showing aspects of the movement that were not obvious from viewing the computer animation of the original movement. a second SOM was trained on the appearance of the original trajectories and used to produce an output that shows the variability in coordination between all trials in the study. The second SOM showed groupings of the three shooting conditions which were unexpected.

In this paper. we extend the exploration of pseudorehearsal to a Hopfield-type net. The same general principles apply: old information can be rehearsed if it is available. and if it is not available. then generating and rehearsing approximations of old information that 'map' the behaviour of the network can also be effective at preserving the actual old information itself. The details of the pseudorehearsal mechanism. however. benefit from being adapted to the dynamics of Hopfield nets so as to exploit the extra attractors created in state space during learning.

The main purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach for learning a sports skill. Twenty-four 10-year-old females participated in a 4-week intervention involving either a Nonlinear Pedagogy (i.e..manipulation of task constraints including equipment and rules) or a Linear Pedagogy (i.e.. prescriptive. repetitive drills) approach to learn a tennis forehand stroke. Performance accuracy scores. movement criterion scores and kinematic data were measured during pre-intervention. post-intervention and retention tests. While both groups showed improvements in performance accuracy scores over time. the Nonlinear Pedagogy group displayed a greater number of movement clusters at post-test indicating the presence of degeneracy (i.e.. many ways to achieve the same outcome). The results suggest that degeneracy is effective for learning a sports skill facilitated by a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach.

However. there is currently no comprehensive empirical evidence to support the learning effectiveness of a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach among primary school children. Therefore. the main purpose of this PhD programme of study was to investigate the impact of Nonlinear Pedagogy (NP). in relation to Linear Pedagogy (LP). at various levels of the human movement system: 1) learning a sports skill (tennis forehand stroke)(chapter 3); 2) learning a game skill (modified tennis game)(chapter 4); and 3) teaching and learning a unit of modified tennis in a physical education (PE) context (chapter 5 & 6). Chapter 3 showed that while the NP group performed just as well as the LP group in terms of accuracy scores. there were more movement clusters present in the NP group (7 clusters) than in the LP group (3 clusters) following the 4-week intervention. This verifies the presence of degeneracy in the NP group and provides evidence that there is more than one optimal way to achieve a task successfully.

This study examined individual variations in the preferred movement strategy of a redundant motor task. Thirty-two participants performed a star tracing task on a digitizing tablet with the goal of minimizing a performance score that was given as feedback. The performance score was a weighted combination of spatial error and movement time. meaning that multiple strategies could yield the same score. A cluster analysis revealed three distinct groups of individuals based on their initial movement strategy preferences.

However. unlike previous variables. tracking velocity necessitates the use of a valid and reliable tool to monitor adaptation over time. Therefore. the primary purpose of this research was to assess the validity and reliability of a commercially-available linear position transducer (LPT). Nine resistance-trained men completed four sessions consisting of a single set of barbell back squat to volitional failure at 75% or 90% one-repetition maximum. Kinetic and kinematic data were captured for each repetition by the LPT and a 3-dimensional motion capture system and bipedal force platforms. In total. 357 instances of data from both systems were analyzed using intraclass correlations (ICC). effect size estimates. and standard error of measurement. Overall. the LPT yielded excellent ICCs (all≥ 0.94) and small/trivial differences (d< 0.60). When categorized by median values. ICCs remained high (all≥ 0.89) and differences remained small or trivial with the exception of high peak velocities (d=− 1.46). Together. these data indicate that the commercially-available LPT is a valid and reliable measure for kinetic and kinematic variables of interest with the exception of high peak velocities.

Participants (n= 18) with previous athletic experience (ie. jumping sports) volunteered for the study and performed planned and unplanned jumps in three different directions (left. straight. right). Kinematic and kinetic data were analyzed from initial ground contact and toe off. Preferential weight distribution toward the right side was found during the bilateral drop landing task which was supported by larger peak ground reaction forces (GRF Peak) on the right limb. Jump direction significantly altered total plate time (p< 0.05). GRF Peak (p< 0.001). mean GRF symmetry (p< 0.01). and knee path distance (p< 0.05).

Pathological gait exhibits altered gait variability. It can be either too periodic and predictable. or too random and disordered. as is the case with aging. While gait therapies often focus on restoration of linear measures such as gait speed or stride length. we propose that the goal of gait therapy should be to restore optimal gait variability. which exhibits chaotic fluctuations and is the balance between predictability and complexity.

However the lack of visual cues makes BW risky. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of visual cues provided by a virtual environment on FW and BW on gait variability. Each subject underwent four conditions of treadmill walking at self-selected pace. The subjects walked backwards in three conditions and forwards in the fourth condition. A virtual corridor was displayed to the subjects in the FW condition (forward optic flow) and two of the backward conditions (forward and backward optic flow). The third BW condition was a control condition (no visual cues). Gait variability measures of the hip. knee and ankle range of motion and the stride interval were analyzed. Magnitude of variability was evaluated with the coefficient of variation and structure of variability with approximate entropy. Significant differences were demonstrated between the FW and the BW gait characteristics as well as in gait variability (for both magnitude and structure of variability). No significant differences were found between the three BW conditions as a result of the direction of visual cues. In order to get optimal benefit of BW in the aged and the diseased. optical flow of visual feedback may need to be manipulated in a different manner than FW.

We do not know. however. whether acupuncture may enhance the effect of strength training on motor function. This study compared upper-limb motor functional improvement in chronic stroke survivors who received a combination of acupuncture and strength training with that of subjects who received strength training alone. A total of 10 chronic stroke patients with moderate or severe wrist muscle spasticity were recruited for this study. The study used a crossover design with a random order of either combined electroacupuncture and strength training or strength training alone. Each subject received one of the two types of treatment twice a week for the first 6 weeks and switched to the other for another 6 weeks. Quantitative measurements of wrist spasticity. active wrist extension range of motion. isometric wrist strength. and clinical evaluation with Fugl-Meyer (FM) upper-limb motor scores were conducted before and after either treatment. After the combined treatment. the quantitative spasticity level. active wrist extension range of motion (increased by a mean of 16.3 degrees). and FM upper-limb motor score (increased by a mean of 4.9 points) changed significantly (p< 0.01) but no significant changes were noted in isometric wrist strength.

Adaptation may require the use of visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory environment and back. as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight. the prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our previous paper. we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however. larger overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects. in the absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback. are believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because. in the absence of relevant external dynamic cues such as optic …,True,-sJyJkEAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,12,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00221-015-4484-5.pdf,6966663121627605296,/scholar?cites=6966663121627605296,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732903/,0,0,0

Several research studies showed that this popular gait rehabilitation tool alters gait variability. There is also recent evidence which suggests that alterations in the temporal structure of the external cues could restore gait variability at healthy levels. It is unknown. however. if such alterations produce similar effects if the cueing modalities used are different; visual or auditory. The modality could affect gait variability differentially. since there is evidence that auditory cues mostly act in the temporal domain of gait. while visual cues act in the spatial domain of gait. This study investigated how synchronizing steps with visual and auditory cues that are presented with different temporal structures could affect gait variability during treadmill walking. Three different temporal structured stimuli were used. invariant. fractal and random. in both modalities. Stride times. length and speed were determined. and their fractal scaling (an indicator of complexity) and coefficient of variation were calculated. No differences were observed in the coefficient of variation. regardless of the cueing modality and the temporal structure of the stimuli. In terms of the stride time’s fractal scaling. we observed that the fractal stimulus induced higher values compared to random and invariant stimuli. The same was also observed in stride length. but only for the visual cueing modality. No differences were observed for stride speed.

1215715,Temporal correlations of support surface movement affect the control of center of pressure velocity,2017,Troy Rand,,,,,,Interacting with changing environments is a key feature of postural control. Center of pressure velocity (COPv) can be used to explore postural responses to environmental changes. The COPv exhibits two scaling behaviors. persistence (short time-scale) and anti-persistence (longer time-scale). The crossover point where these scaling regions change indicate the period of the COPv oscillation. or how much time the COPv increases and decreases before changing directions. Little is known about how the COPv oscillation period changes during different postural demands. The goal of this research was to investigate the postural response to support surface translations of different temporal correlations and average movement velocities. Participants stood on the Neurocom while the support surface was translated in the anteroposterior direction with white noise. pink noise or sine wave at six different movement velocities. The time scale where the COPv switched from persistent to anti-persistent was measured using detrended fluctuation analysis. As the velocity of movement increased. the time scale of COPv oscillations increased for sine wave and decreased for pink and white noise. This indicates that when the movement has a high temporal correlation and the average movement velocity is increased. the COPv has a longer oscillation period. When there is moderate or no temporal correlation and movement velocity is increased. the COPv oscillation period becomes shorter.

1215718,Postural responses to noisy support surface translations in stroke survivors,2016,Troy Rand,,,,,,Healthy standing posture is characterized by the ability to interact with a changing environment while maintaining upright stance. Being adaptable to changing environments affords flexibility and allows the system to encounter novel environments without losing control of posture. The purpose of this research was to determine if stroke survivors could adapt to support surface translations with differing temporal structures. Methods: Eight stroke survivors participated in this research. Participants stood on a force platform for 3-minute trials. The support surface was translated in the anteroposterior direction according to different temporal structures. They also performed a normal standing trial where the platform did not move. Root mean square and detrended fluctuation analysis of the center of pressure signal were calculated to determine amount and temporal structure of variability respectively. Results: During normal standing the stroke survivors’ posture exhibited lack of adaptability. The stroke survivors had increased amount of variability and weakened long-range correlations in all conditions compared to normal standing. This indicates that regardless of the temporal structure of the support surface movement the amount of movement increased while the structure of movement became more random. Previous work has demonstrated that healthy posture is able to adapt to the temporal structure of support surface translations. this adaptability was not seen in a population of stroke survivors.

1215719,Long-range correlations of center of pressure are stronger for AP perturbations than ML perturbations in healthy young adults,2016,Venkata Naga Pradeep Ambati,,,,,,Control of center of pressure (COP) in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions use different mechanisms. Biological signals like COP have a fractal structure with long-range correlations (LRCs) such that postural sway at one point of time are related to postural sway at another point in time. Recent studies have shown that the LRCs of a healthy system can be driven towards a specific direction by administering a sensory input with the desired temporal structure We used signals with different temporal structures to perturb the support surface in AP and ML directions and examined the LRCs of resultant COP patterns. LRCs of COP during support surface translations in AP and ML directions were significantly different (p= 0.001). This may be due to differences in the alignment of body segments and muscles required for the activation of forces to maintain stability when perturbed in these directions. LRCs of COP were significantly different in response to different noise conditions (p< 0.0001). This shows that healthy individuals show adaptive flexibility in their ability to entrain their COP response to support surface oscillations with different temporal structures. Exploring the temporal structure of biological processes has provided many new insights into movement control. Because aging and disease are characterized by a degradation of this temporal structure it is important to investigate new ways to restore this highly complex structure.,True,GXgVWasAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/srcaf/2016/Schedule/190/,,,,,0,0,0

Minimum toe clearance (MTC) is the minimum vertical distance between the toe of the swinging leg and the walking surface when the leg is swinging. and decreased values are associated with an increased risk for falls.

1215725,Perception of Self-Motion using a Virtual Reality Environment Enhances Gait Adaptation in Chronic Stroke Survivors,2015,Troy Rand,,,,,,Introduction: Perception of self-motion through VR provides a unique avenue to improve gait adaptation in chronic stroke survivors. Stroke subjects exhibit asymmetrical gait patterns may benefit from training the lower limbs to walk under different task constraints for each leg. In this study. gait asymmetry was targeted with a split-belt paradigm. and perception of self-motion was provided with a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The VR environment was hypothesized to enhance the split-belt adaptation by removing conflict between the static visual input (as in normal treadmill walking) and the dynamic proprioceptive input. Methods: Healthy young. healthy older adults and chronic stroke survivors walked on a split-belt treadmill in either a VR or a non-VR environment while being exposed to different belt speeds for each leg. The VR stimuli consisted of walking in an infinitely long virtual corridor. Spatiotemporal measures as correlates of adaptation were compared between groups (young. old. stroke) and conditions (VR and non-VR). Results: The participants in the VR condition demonstrated an increase in stride length compared to the non-VR condition for both healthy young (P=. 019) and healthy elderly (P=. 014). Preliminary results from the stroke group showed a trend towards a more stable coordination pattern that was reached quicker in the VR group than the non-VR group. Conclusion: Results show that the perception of self-motion provided through VR may lead to faster and more enhanced adaptive capabilities. Such enhancement of adaptive capabilities during gait has important implications for pathological populations such as stroke …,True,GXgVWasAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/srcaf/2015/Schedule/187/,,,,,0,0,0
1215726,The strength of Long-range correlations of postural sway is greater in older fallers than non-fallers,2014,Troy Rand,,,,,,Falling is a major concern and results from an inability to maintain postural control during daily activities. The ability to maintain the center of pressure (COP) within the base of support during standing is a reflection of postural control. Mediolateral COP has been used to predict falls. 1 However. the temporal structure of mediolateral COP in older fallers compared to non-fallers remains largely unknown. The temporal structure of biological signals has been used to characterize the dynamics of human movement. 2 It has been suggested that an optimal temporal structure of human movement variability exists that permits the maintenance of a desired movement pattern while still allowing the system the adaptability needed to interact optimally with a dynamic environment. This research used Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to measure the long-range correlations in standing posture; DFA α-values provide a measure of the temporal correlations. Three groups were analyzed; young non-fallers (n= 9). older non-fallers (n= 10). and older fallers (n= 5). Participants stood on a force platform while center of pressure was recorded in three conditions. normal standing. absent vision. and faulty vision. The results demonstrated stronger long-range correlations in older fallers (α= 1.29) when compared to the older non-fallers (α= 1.06; P=. 009) and young non-fallers (α= 0.95; P<. 001). Stronger long-range correlations demonstrate a more rigid and constrained mediolateral postural sway. This indicates a lowering of the flexibility and adaptability necessary for older fallers to interact with a dynamic environment without falling.,True,GXgVWasAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/srcaf/2014/schedule/100/,,,,,0,0,0
1215727,Nonlinear mathematics detect subtle changes in center of pressure measures,2013,Troy Rand,,,,,,Falls are one of the most significant health concerns for elderly individuals and 30% of individuals over the age of 65 experience at least one fall per year. It is estimated that falls account for one third of the total cost of medical treatment for all injuries. Because maintaining the center of mass over the base of support is required for balance. it is safe to assume that impaired postural control could lead to falls. In biological signals it is theorized that there exists an optimal amount and structure of variability that is indicative of a healthy system. and there are techniques of nonlinear mathematics that allow us to investigate this healthy variability. The purpose of this research is to measure center of pressure. which is a reflection of center of mass movement. to investigate the structure of variability that is present. and to see how that changes with aging. Ten healthy young subjects and seven healthy older subjects were collected. Ninety-second trials of standing posture were recorded on a force platform while the different sensory systems responsible for balance were challenged. The center of pressure data was analyzed with a variety of linear and nonlinear measures. It was found that when the visual and somatosensory systems were challenged there were significant differences in nonlinear measures of posture. Instead. typical linear measures failed to show a difference. This indicates that the systems responsible for balance may start to decline before standard balance measures show a difference.,True,GXgVWasAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/srcaf/2013/schedule/131/,,,,,0,0,0

1215729,FEAR OF FALLING IS RELATED TO WALKING IMPAIRMENT IN PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE,,Troy Rand and Jennifer Yentes and Jason Johanning and Iraklis Pipinos and Sara Myers,,,,,,Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects over 8 million individuals in the United States. including 12-20% of all individuals 60 years of age and older [1. 5]. Symptoms of PAD include intermittent claudication in the lower extremities. making walking difficult even for short distances. In addition. recent findings have shown that patients with PAD experience 73% more falls than healthy controls. and have a significantly shorter uni-pedal stance performance time [2]. Therefore. it is possible that fear of falling may compound the above functional abnormalities [3]. The purpose of this study was to investigate if fear of falling relates to self-reported walking impairment and to a clinical walking test. It was hypothesized that patients with PAD that demonstrate increased fear of falling would also demonstrate increased difficulty in self reported walking and decreased actual walking distances.,True,GXgVWasAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4158236421311156364&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

By using several seeds at the same time. large samples could be fabricated in a short time with simple heat treatment. However. the samples fabricated by the normal multiseeding technique show a rapid decrease of trapped magnetic field value across the grain boundaries because of the residual liquid layer. To remove the residual liquid layer. various types of multiseeding were newly suggested. The optimum result was obtained when the seeds were arranged without spacing.

The axisymmetric rotor is divided into several rings and the stiffness matrix for each ring is derived by solving the radial equilibrium equation and the stress–strain–temperature relations. The ring stiffness matrices are assembled into a symmetric global matrix satisfying the continuity equations at each interface with the assumptions of a modified generalized plane strain (MGPS). In the MGPS. the z-directional axial strains are assumed to vary linearly along the radial direction; εz=ε0+ε1r. The conditions that the z-directional force and the circumferential moment resultants vanish are thus used to solve the z-directional axial strains as well as the radial and circumferential strains.

However. it has two critical problems; the system is significantly sensitive to an input excitation frequency and is not proper to a low frequency vibration environments. such as human motions. This research presents a new nonlinear cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvester which consists of a conventional cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvester and springs. By attaching springs. this system can have two stable states; one is deforming upwards and another is deforming downwards. The springs also make the frequency range which shows intense dynamics response lower.

As a result. the system shows intense dynamic responses at the frequency range from 1 Hz to 7 Hz under the acceleration of 3 m/s 2. The vibration of this frequency range (1 Hz∼ 7 Hz) can be easily observed from the motion of human or animal. shaking of a tree by wind.

1215815,A Modified Rayleigh-Ritz Method for Analyzing Flexible Multibody Systems and its Applications,,Sinwoo Jeong and Hong Hee Yoo,,,,,,In the eigenvalue problem. for structures where the parameternon-uniformities are not particularly pronounced and/or geometries are not complicated. the assumed mode substructure synthesis method (AMSSM) has a great capability of yielding superior accuracy for the same number of degrees of freedom (DOF) or the same accuracy with fewer DOF than finite element method (FEM)[1]. However. different from FEM. AMSSM needs more laborious procedures to satisfy compatibility conditions of the system [2]. In this paper. an efficient AMSSM withsimplified procedures for satisfyingcompatibility conditionsis presented. To eliminate a serial kinematics expression in the conventional AMSSM. nodal displacement (ND) isintroduced. These ND form a bridge between local deformations in the members of the structure. This paper also shows that AMSSM has excellent convergence performance in the large deflection static analysis of multi beam structures.

We designed and optimized an energy harvester for a busy roadway using piezoelectric cantilever beams. Using the road vibrational frequency under vehicle speeds of 60–80 km/h. we tuned the natural frequency of the beams by attaching a tip mass. Considering the typical vehicle wheel width and the depth of pavement. the designed energy harvester with a volume of 30 × 30 × 10 cm3 contained 48 piezoelectric beams. To optimize the harvester circuit. we rectified the output current from each piezoelectric beam and connected the beams in parallel to avoid phase difference interruptions.

Because piezoelectric modules easily break when directly subjected to energy generated by human movements. we designed a tile that employs indirect energy transmission using springs and a tip mass. We aimed at matching the mechanical resonance frequency of the tile with that of the piezoelectric modules.

It has a possibility to be applied to a macro-power source such as a road energy harvesting. We have designed a new road energy harvester. in which all the cantilever beams share a single tip mass. This mechanism allows all the beams to have the same bending trajectory and to generate voltages identically. It eliminates the need of multiple rectifying circuits since all the power outputs have the same waveforms and a negative interference barely happens. We have modeled a lab-scale experiment and measured its frequency matching results. The single cantilever beam without any tip mass has a natural frequency of 60 Hz.

LI emphasises change in the positions of the EU member states as the key to understand what happened and why. whereas MLG opens up for change in the position of supranational entrepreneurial leaders as the key explanation. The main conclusion is that entrepreneurial epistemic leadership exercised by the European Commission was crucial for making the EU ETS. The principal means of leadership involved building up independent expertise on how an EU ETS could be designed. and …,True,4B7gmK0AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,94,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378009001241,13095439184674182728,/scholar?cites=13095439184674182728,,https://www.fni.no/getfile.php/131538-1467555911/Filer/Publikasjoner/JBS-JW-GEC-2010-2.pdf,0,0,0

Understanding the post-2012 changes,2010,Jon Birger Skjærseth and Jørgen Wettestad,10,Global Environmental Politics,4,101-123,MIT Press,This article explains why the significant changes in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for the 2013–2020 phase were adopted in 2008. The combination of a more stringent EU-wide cap. allocation of emission allowances for payment. and limits on imports of credits from third countries have strengthened the system for the post-2012 period. This will promote reduction in greenhouse gases compared to the old system. The main reasons for these changes are. first. changes in the positions of the member states due to unsatisfactory experience with performance of the EU ETS so far. Second. a “package approach” where the EU ETS reform was integrated into wider energy and climate policy facilitated agreement on the changes. Third. changes in the position of nonstate actors and a desire to affect the international climate negotiations contributed to the reform.,True,4B7gmK0AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C,93,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/GLEP_a_00033,18012201756716430441,/scholar?cites=18012201756716430441,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.737.8666&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

An increasing transference of competence to EU level institutions. and hence “vertical integration.” has taken place. most clearly in the case of the ETS. The main reasons for the differing increase in vertical integration are. first. that more member states were dissatisfied with the pre-existing system in the case of the ETS than in the two other cases. Second. the European Commission and Parliament were comparatively more united in pushing for changes in the case of the ETS. And. third. although RES and IEM policies were influenced by regional energy security concerns. they were less structurally linked to and influenced by the global climate regime than the ETS.,True,4B7gmK0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,77,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/GLEP_a_00109,3801205526077251350,/scholar?cites=3801205526077251350,,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/GLEP_a_00109,0,0,0

It argues that implementation in terms of ambitiousness has been only moderately successful so far. but significant differences between the Member States are also observed. Similarities and differences are then explained within a multi-level governance approach emphasizing the need to search for explanations at national. EU. and global levels. The EU ETS case shows that the multi-level governance approach can be as relevant for understanding implementation as for explaining policy-making. In addition to factors located at the national level. the decentralized nature of the EU scheme itself is important for understanding how the system works in practice.

A key element in the ETS implementation process is deciding upon the ceiling (“cap”) for the emissions included in the ETS. Over time. a significant change and centralization of this model has taken place. In order to understand this development. we need to acknowledge the increasing acceptance of stronger centralized governance among the member states due to ETS pilot phase problems; take into consideration frustration in the European Commission over complex and differing National Allocation Plans; and add the fact that the Kyoto Protocol target was getting nearer and a good performance of the “flagship” ETS was becoming increasingly important.

Despite the substantial reform in 2008. subsequent problems of allowance surplus and a low carbon price have spurred new efforts to reform the system for the 2013–2020 phase. But these efforts have met resistance both among member states and in the European parliament. and the EU is struggling in its efforts to improve the ETS. This article draws on four central EU and political science theory approaches to more systematically explore why. The financial crisis and slow international policy progress have narrowed the window of opportunity that was open in 2008. Factors that could open that window again include an economic upswing. a new European commission and parliament. and new global negotiations in 2015. But even without short-term reform. the linear reduction factor will gradually tighten the system and lead to a higher carbon price.,True,4B7gmK0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,42,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/GLEP_a_00229,8449884044803287692,/scholar?cites=8449884044803287692,,https://fni.brage.unit.no/fni-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2485904/2014-JW-GLEP-Rescuing+EU+Emissions+Trading+-+Mission+Impossible.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

In 1974. the theory was launched that a group of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) could destroy the ozone layer. By the late 1970s. the ozone-depletion issue was placed on the agenda of international envi-ronmental and scientific organizations like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). Negotiations on a binding international political instrument were started in 1981. and in 1985 the Vienna Convention on the protection of the ozone layer was signed by twenty countries plus the European Community. Progress in the following decade was quite impressive. not least so when we look at regulatory development. The 1985 Vienna Convention was a loose framework convention. The 1987 Montreal Protocol was a big step forward with regard to binding requirements and specificity. The protocol included specific measures and timetables for reducing production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. The London and Copenhagen meetings of the early 1990s and the 1995 Vienna meeting speeded up and specified these oblig-ations in several ways. both in the form of accelerated timetables and the addition of new substances.

The EU’s emissions trading system (ETS) covers almost half of its greenhouse gas emissions and has been hailed as the cornerstone and flagship of EU climate policy. But in spring 2013 the ETS was in severe crisis. with a huge surplus of allowances and a sagging carbon price. Even a formally simple measure to change the timing of auctioning was initially rejected by the European Parliament. Two years later a much more important ‘market thermostat’was adopted (ie the Market Stability Reserve) and proposals for a complete ETS overhaul were put on the table.

In this respect. EU energy policy is no exception. The fragmentation in three coexisting strands and external shocks has emphasised the need for intergovernmental coordination and oversight. This new intergovernmentalism. exemplified prominently by the recent move towards Energy Union. is surprising in two respects.

The Europeanization of energy policy in third countries is often described as a one-directional process in which these countries essentially adopt the EU energy acquis. Our article questions this dominant view by exploring whether and how third countries can influence the formulation and implementation of EU energy policy. We argue that relative differences in third country influence depend on their access to relevant venues and actors of EU policy-making as well as their structural power resources. We develop a typology linking these two factors to the outsider. follower. challenger. or shaper roles that third countries assume in EU energy governance. We empirically probe our argument in three case studies representing different models of EU–third country cooperation. Our cases include a group of nine Southeast and East European countries (Energy Community). Switzerland (bilateral arrangements). and Norway (European Economic Area). The analysis shows that it is access and structural power which together define the extent to which third countries are able to influence the formulation of EU energy policy and customize its implementation to their domestic needs. We find that while the Energy Community members are followers in EU energy governance. Switzerland and Norway are shapers. Strikingly. the influence of these two non-EU members may occasionally even surpass that of smaller EU member states. This highlights that third countries are not merely downloading EU energy regulation but sometimes also succeed in uploading their own preferences.

1215907,Unpacking 'Coherence'in EU Foreign Policy: How Policy Setting and Policy Content Shape EU External Relations Towards Russia,2015,Philipp Thaler,,,,,,The foreign policy of the European Union (EU) towards Russia has been characterized by extensive institutionalization. a catalogue of formally stated objectives and repeatedly articulated political will since the end of the Cold War. These elements matured over time. reflecting the aim to increase the Union‘s external impact. However. the relationship with Russia is also characterized by an inherent lack of external coherence. The EU has ongoing difficulties to coordinate the interests of different political stakeholders and policies vis-à-vis Moscow.This thesis explores the reasons for the EU‘s lack of external coherence. For that purpose. it develops a dual analytical approach that distinguishes between policy setting and policy content. Consistent with institutionalist research agendas. the policy setting highlights bureaucratic structures. rules and procedures to explain policy outcomes. In contrast. the policy content emphasizes substance and objectives of policies. The central conceptual move of the thesis is the application of Arnold Wolfers ‘concept of milieu and possession goals to the specific context of EU foreign policy to investigate the relation between policy content and external coherence.

1215908,Governance through real-time compliance: the supranationalisation of European external energy policy,2021,Philipp Thaler and Vija Pakalkaite,28,Journal of European Public Policy,2,208-228,Routledge,Member States have retained core competences in external energy policy since the beginning of European integration. Even the new ‘energy chapter’ in the Lisbon Treaty safeguards national prerogatives. Contrasting this trend. we show that throughout the past decade this national stronghold has been eroding and replaced by supranational oversight. Reviewing energy-related negotiations of Poland and Lithuania with Russia and new regulation on intergovernmental agreements. we demonstrate how the Commission gained control over Member States’ external energy relations.

While members of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Energy Community implement large parts of the EU’s energy acquis. other third countries are also affected. Switzerland—physically integrated in the European energy grid but lacking a formalized mechanism of regulatory adaptation with the EU—is an interesting case in this respect. not least because of its implications for a UK-EU relationship post-Brexit. Currently. an EU-Switzerland electricity agreement is being negotiated but its conclusion remains highly uncertain. This briefing paper highlights that either outcome—with or without an electricity agreement—has important implications for the Swiss energy transition.

The effects of the Council Trio Presidency on the EU’s energy agenda,2015,Philipp Thaler,5,European Energy Journal,4,14-28,Claeys & Casteels Publishing,Since the late 1990s. the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) has been subjected to a range of discussions and changes aimed at improving its functioning. One of the central concerns was to ensure continuity of the Council's policy-making in an enlarged and increasingly diverse EU. After multiple attempts for reform. the current working method of the Council is based on the so-called Trio Presidency-an institutionalized setup in which each Member States holds the Presidency for 6 months while three successive Presidencies cooperate more closely in the form of a so-called Trio and have to agree on a common program.This article argues that. looking at the example of energy policy. the Trio mechanism is overrated in its potential to deliver policy continuity.

The Europeanization of energy policy in third countries is often described as a one-directional process in which these countries essentially adopt the EU energy acquis. Our article questions this dominant view by exploring whether and how third countries can influence the formulation and implementation of EU energy policy. We argue that relative differences in third country influence depend on their access to relevant venues and actors of EU policy-making as well as their structural power resources. We develop a typology linking these two factors to the outsider. follower. challenger. or shaper roles that third countries assume in EU energy governance. We empirically probe our argument in three case studies representing different models of EU–third country cooperation. Our cases include a group of nine Southeast and East European countries (Energy Community). Switzerland (bilateral arrangements). and Norway (European Economic Area). The analysis shows that it is access and structural power which together define the extent to which third countries are able to influence the formulation of EU energy policy and customize its implementation to their domestic needs. We find that while the Energy Community members are followers in EU energy governance. Switzerland and Norway are shapers. Strikingly. the influence of these two non-EU members may occasionally even surpass that of smaller EU member states. This highlights that third countries are not merely downloading EU energy regulation but sometimes also succeed in uploading their own preferences.

1215920,Policy Responses to New Ocean Threats: Arctic Warming. Maritime Industries. and International Environmental Regulation,2019,Benjamin Hofmann,,,,215-235,Cambridge University Press,This chapter studies international regulatory responses to new threats that growing maritime industrial activities in a warming Arctic pose to the ocean environment. Climate change accelerates the melting of Arctic Ocean ice. making the area more accessible to maritime industries such as shipping and offshore oil and gas production. These industrial operations can have negative external effects on this ecologically vulnerable region. This chapter investigates how states have responded to such threats. assessing and comparing the stringency of international environmental regulation of maritime industries in the Arctic. Stringency is the product of a regulation’s formal tightness and its substantive ambition. Tightness refers to legality. precision. monitoring and enforcement. Ambition includes changes in scope and in requirement levels from temporal and global perspectives. Empirically. this chapter presents a stringency database that includes all regulations that have partly or wholly covered the Arctic from 1950 to 2017. Regulatory stringency is compared across industries (shipping. oil and gas). regulators (International Maritime Organization. Arctic Council. and OSPAR Commission). external effects. and time. The chapter shows that Arctic warming has been accompanied by increased regulatory activity to address environmental impacts of maritime industries. However. the stringency of these regulations is found to vary considerably across regulatory bodies. Several regulatory gaps persist. The chapter’s findings can guide future research on the drivers of stringent regulation and its effects. Policymakers can use the findings to identify regulatory …,True,BLh45h0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,2,http://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/publications/256663,15981747196314134147,/scholar?cites=15981747196314134147,,https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/256663/1/Hofmann_Arctic%20Warming%2C%20Maritime%20Industries%2C%20and%20International%20Environmental%20Regulation.pdf,0,0,0

1215925,Saving Liberalism: Governance through Global Hanses,2017,Benjamin Hofmann,,,,,St. Gallen Symposium,Liberalism – the fabric of the current world order – is seriously challenged these days. Protectionism pushes back free trade. authoritarianism threatens liberal democratic institutions. and nationalism undermines regional integration. The decline of liberalism heralds a return of history that will make the world less prosperous and less safe. Protectionism will trigger trade wars and economic recession. and nationalist authoritarianism will fuel armed conflict.   The essay argues that the crisis of liberalism is due to an inappropriate governance of globalization. Globalization has differential effects on communities. Adaptive globalized communities benefit from globalization and thus support libertarian values. Communities that are less willing or able to adapt are more supportive of authoritarian stances. Neither the nation-state nor existing global governance institutions can accommodate this widening cleavage.  The essay sketches the disruptive idea of governing through Global Hanses. Global Hanses are flexible policy collaborations of globalized regions and municipalities. They translate the historic role model of the Hanseatic League into a socially and economically unevenly globalized world. Global Hanses are democratic. overlapping. and competing. Their members benefit from devolved competencies. but share part of their profits with less adaptive communities. The essay proposes to launch a first Global Hanse on digitalization. education. and social cohesion. It can later also develop joint policies on other issues. such as innovation. energy. migration. and trade in services.

Following an examination of the achievements and shortcomings of the forest regime to date.

Although the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was considered initially to have the greatest potential to fill these gaps. the emergence and widespread proliferation of industry-dominated schemes have marginalized the FSC in many countries.

It is argued that historical and structural differences in the management of forest and fisheries have resulted in divergent state responses to certification programs. but that both trajectories of interaction have led to a strengthening of the non‐state program. The article draws upon these cases to inductively identify types of interaction between state policies and non‐state certification programs. the causal mechanisms that shed light on interaction dynamics. and the conditions …,True,20TBoasAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,254,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rego.12005,2758659196197399766,/scholar?cites=2758659196197399766,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/rego.12005,0,0,0

Through a careful examination of the initiation and spread of such initiatives in the fishery and forestry sectors. this paper challenges a rational–economic perspective that sees the spread of nonstate governance schemes primarily as a market‐driven phenomenon. Drawing on a political consumerism perspective. the paper argues that transnational environmental group networks and their targeting of firms were key to the emergence of nonstate eco‐labelling schemes. and that most firms decided to support or participate in such schemes only after intensive environmental group pressure.

It focuses on two types of accountability that are likely to be achievable and important to non-state standards organizations: control and responsiveness. In setting a global standard based on a multi-stakeholder governance structure. FSC established a model for other certification schemes. specifically within the forestry and fisheries sectors.

Most scholars agree that NGOs do make a difference in global environmental politics (eg Chatterjee and Finger. 1994; Princen and Finger. 1994; Wapner. 1996; Raustiala. 2001). but it is contestable to what extent their efforts have actually affected international negotiation outcomes and domestic implementation of commitments. Little of the literature on NGOs has addressed what actual inﬂuence they have on policy outcomes. Studies that have addressed this question have often confused inﬂuence with NGO access. activities or resources in assessing policy outcomes (Betsill and Corell. 2001). 2 Thus. a systematic approach to measuring and analysing NGO inﬂuence has been called for (Betsill and Corell. 2001).In this chapter. we address NGOs’ role in promoting climate compliance under the Kyoto Protocol. Because the Kyoto Protocol is not yet in force. we will focus on how the NGOs have contributed to the design of the compliance system and what their options are for enhancing future compliance. Although we do not pretend to measure NGO inﬂuence and causality patterns systematically. we make an informed evaluation of their role in promoting climate compliance.

Carrying out a ground-breaking analysis of their design and diffusion. this book covers all the major carbon market systems and processes around the world: the EU. RGGI. California. Tokyo. New Zealand. Australia. China. South Korea and Kazakhstan. It offers a systematic. in-depth discussion and comparison of the key design features in these systems with expert contributors exploring how. and to what extent. these features have been shaped by central policy diffusion mechanisms and domestic politics. By focussing on the specific design features of the instruments used. this volume makes important contributions to diffusion theory. highlighting how ETS diffusion processes more often have resulted in design divergence than convergence. and discussing the implications of this finding for the vision of linked systems in the post-Paris era. It will be of significant interest to a broad audience interested in the emergence. evolution. functioning and interaction of carbon markets.,True,20TBoasAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,24,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NzJDDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT12&dq=info:4-QNFJQsAUEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=BxoiddJ61Q&sig=XQqkXAtBbh7uKhQK1CqiVBTOTNA,4684074101945263331,/scholar?cites=4684074101945263331,,,0,0,0

1215952,Climate Change Adaptation and Development: Transforming Paradigms and Practices,2015,Tor Håkon Inderberg and Karen O’Brien and Siri Eriksen and Linda Sygna,,,,273,Routledge,Climate change poses multiple challenges to development. It affects lives and livelihoods. infrastructure and institutions. as well as beliefs. cultures and identities. There is a growing recognition that the social dimensions of vulnerability and adaptation now need to move to the forefront of development policies and practices. This book presents case studies showing that climate change is as much a problem of development as for development. with many of the risks closely linked to past. present and future development pathways. Development policies and practices can play a key role in addressing climate change. but it is critical to question to what extent such actions and interventions reproduce. rather than address. the social and political structures and development pathways driving vulnerability. The chapters emphasise that adaptation is about much more than a set of projects or interventions to reduce specific impacts of climate change; it is about living with change while also transforming the processes that contribute to vulnerability in the first place. This book will help students in the field of climate change and development to make sense of adaptation as a social process. and it will provide practitioners. policymakers and researchers working at the interface between climate change and development with useful insights for approaching adaptation as part of a larger transformation to sustainability.,True,v30kL9cAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,116,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_kqLBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:K0rFh-oK6dAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=X_rv0P8Rul&sig=9kGUcDCXp8OzhnBoyV9FptWerZk,15053575231879072299,/scholar?cites=15053575231879072299,,,0,0,0
1215953,Limits to adaptation: analysing institutional constraints,2009,Tor Hdkon Inderberg and Per O Eikeland,,,,443-447,Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. UK,The academic literature has been biased towards depicting adaptation to climate change as a rational decision-making process. with constraints being mainly available resources and technologies. An ideal rational adaptation process would start by evaluating the problem of climate change (assessing exposure). mapping possible solutions (possible adaptive measures). and. through a cost—beneﬁt approach. the best and most feasible adaptation measure (s) would be decided and simply implemented. Should organisational structure not favour the implementation of measures directed at the goals set. it would be accordingly altered.Recent studies have focused on institutional barriers and limits to adaptation. however (for example Adger et al.. 2007). We share their concern that neglecting institutional constraints may conceal true human limits to adaptation and also narrowly frame the scope of measures that could be taken in order to increase adaptive capacity. Society consists of formal and informal social structures (regulatory factors. values. norms and cognitive limits) inﬂuencing choice and behaviour. These factors have still not received the deserved attention in the adaptation literature. After all. resources and technology are of little use if such institutional factors hinder implementation of proper adaptive measures. In this chapter. we develop an institutional approach and seek to apply it to analyse constraints to adaptive capacity in the national energy system. chosen due to its vital role as a hub linking together other societal systems and functions.

Denmark’s energy system has evolved from import- and fossil fuel-dependency to self-sufficiency with a high share of renewable energy. This transformation has been supported by co-evolving energy policies. A policy shift in 2001 brought a temporary halt to the transformation. which resumed after a return in policy in 2008. Applying public choice- and path-dependency perspectives. this article analyses the development of the Danish energy system and co-evolving policies. Initial structural characteristics have strong explanatory power for the long-term policy trend: de-central ownership. and entrepreneurship have given local-level actors leverage as a political constituency.

Resting on data from 21 interviews the paper analyses the Norwegian electricity sector and the influence on adaptive capacity to climate change from changes in formal structure and institutional culture. The sector underwent transformational change between the beginning of the 1980s and mid-2000s. with the reform from 1991 as a watershed. and gradual consolidation from about 2000. From a self-regulated vertically integrated sector with an emphasis on robustness of supply the sector changed into a liberalised and unbundled structure. with economic efficiency as the guiding principle. These changes reduced adaptive capacity to climate change. After 2000. gradually adaptive capacity has increased somewhat.

Thispaper uses the Swedish and the Norwegian electricity grid sector. as providers of a vital public good under strict public regulation. to analyse reforms' effects on adaptive capacity in this area. The paper shows that transformational changes in both sectors during the 1990s shifted both the formal organisational structure (rules and regulations). as well as the organisational culture. in the direction of economic efficiency. These two dimensions individually reduced adaptive capacity to climate change. although differently in the two countries. However. the formal structure and organisational culture also yielded substantial influence on each other. This leads to the conclusion that when designing public regulations and implementing reforms. organisational culture must be …,True,v30kL9cAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,2,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13549839.2013.869200,13783939397564347714,/scholar?cites=13783939397564347714,,,0,0,0
1215975,Formal structure and culture: organizational influence on adaptive capacity to climate change in quasi-public network sectors,2012,Tor Håkon Inderberg,,PhD thesis,,,Oslo University,The climate is changing–and rapidly (IPCC 2007). While the issue of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions has dominated political and scientific attention for some years (Schipper 2008). it is now widely acknowledged that these mitigating efforts are not going to be enough. nor will they happen quickly enough (O'Brien et al. 2006; IEA 2011b). We must also try to find out how we can adapt to meet the challenges of the changing climate. Climate change adaptation (CCA) can be undertaken by individuals. but is often conducted by organizations. or at least within an organizational setting (Næss et al. 2005; Berkhout. Hertin. and Gann 2006). CCA may take place in the private or public sectors. or as an interrelation between the two. and is usually a relevant matter for state regulation.For this reason it is important to examine what enables or disables organizational CCA. This PhD thesis does this by analysing organizational capacity to adapt to climate change. It asks what types of barriers and dimensions of CCA prevail in the quasi-public sectors in developed countries. using the electricity grid sectors in Norway and in Sweden as cases for comparison. Since most CCA research has focused on developing countries. it is important to widen the scope and look into the mechanisms that influence the CCA capacity of quasi-public network sectors within developed states. in order to identify other types of barriers and dimensions. This thesis explains organizational capacity for CCA through four articles that compare the Norwegian and the Swedish electricity sectors on the general sector-level. and also investigates adaptations made ‘on the ground’by …,True,v30kL9cAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/34923/1/dravhandling-inderberg.pdf,13448485083587277470,/scholar?cites=13448485083587277470,,https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/34923/1/dravhandling-inderberg.pdf,0,0,0

Denne førte an til en kraftig effektivisering av sektoren. noe som var helt nødvendig. Norge var tidlig ute med å få til en vellykket reform av bransjen. Splittelsen av produksjon og overføring av strøm i konkurranseutsatt og monopolvirksomhet var et viktig virkemiddel for effektivisering. noe som ble basert på gode. samfunnsøkonomiske argumenter.Samtidig har dette langt på vei svekket nettselskapenes insentiver for å drive vedlikehold og investere i utbygging av nett. I 2008 kom Riksrevisjonen med en rapport der den pekte på store og kritiske mangler i strømnettet. Investeringene har latt vente på seg. og deler av årsaken kan finnes i reguleringssystemet. Reguleringen av nettselskapene har i stort grad blitt gjort ved hjelp av økonomiske insentiver. Dette er regulering etter gulrotprinsippet. der selskapene tjener penger på å være effektive. og således forventes å være det. Problemet med dette styringsredskapet er at det i liten grad sikrer andre hensyn enn effektivitet. og dersom regulator ønsker å ivareta andre hensyn enn dette må det andre virkemidler til. Når vedlikehold og nettinvesteringer henger langt etter slik det gjør nå. er det behov for å ta igjen det tapte.

In 2008 the EU adopted a new Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) policy with an inventive funding instrument at its core: the NER 300 fund. based on revenues from the auctioning of emissions trading allowances. Thus far. the literature on policy entrepreneurs has focused more on success factors that enable particular persons to be especially influential than on the defining characteristics of entrepreneurship. We contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship and windows of opportunity by distinguishing two entrepreneurial techniques – framing and procedural engineering – and two categories of commitment – ‘tortoise’ and carpe diem.

But do they all approach CSR similarly? And what issues are their CSR activities directed towards? This chapter aims to track down the prevailing CSR perceptions in the oil sector. What is the ‘oil sector’in this context? In Europe this sector is highly dominated by a relatively small number of multinational oil companies. We found it appropriate to include major companies as well as ensuring geographical representation encompassing different parts of Europe and major actors with a basis abroad. Most of the companies are involved in upstream as well as downstream activities. Moreover. we checked relevant federations’ member lists1 and added the criterion of being central companies/operators on the British. Dutch and Norwegian shelves. On this basis. we singled out a set of 15 relevant companies: Amerada Hess. BP. Conoco. ENI. ExxonMobil. Gaz de France. Hydro. NAM. Orlen. Repsol. RWE-DEA. Shell. Statoil. Talisman and Total. After considerable effort. we managed to get a response from nine of these companies; mostly the European ones (Table 5.1). This is not surprising. as there appears to be some CSR ‘questionnaire fatigue’among companies these days. not least in the big oil companies.

Oppgaven viser i hvilken grad og hvilken måte klimahensyn er organisert inn i petroleumspolitiske beslutningsprosesser og svarer på hvorfor klimahensyn er organisert inn i en slik grad og på en slik måte.   Både utlysning og tildeling av utvinningskonsesjoner er formelt definert som miljøpolitiske situasjoner. men fordi klimahensyn i liten grad er tatt opp i kulturen i forvaltningen blir ikke klimahensyn organisert inn. Myndighetene bruker ikke disse prosessene til å gi formelle føringer for hvordan selskapene skal håndtere klimahensyn ved eventuell seinere utvinning. Dette reduserer mulighetene til å trekke inn klimahensyn når utbyggingsplanene behandles. Den formelle organisasjonsstrukturen virker styrende for aktørenes situasjonsoppfattelse og identitetsforståelse. men mangelen på formelle regler gjør at aktørene i stor grad følger uformelle normer. Klimahensyn er svakt organisert inn ved behandlingen av utbygginger. Situasjonen er både formelt og uformelt definert som klimapolitisk. men reglene embetsverket følger er ikke avledet av Norges Kyotoforpliktelse.   Det er stort sett forvaltningen som tar initiativ i petroleumspolitikken. ikke regjeringen. I klimapolitikken er situasjonen motsatt.

1215989,Multi-sphere climate policy: conceptualizing national policy-making in Europe,2011,Elin Lerum Boasson,,,,,,In 2000. there was general political agreement that Norwegian climate policy should focus on general economic measures. such as the Co2 tax and emission quotas. Nevertheless. only ten years later. a wide range of more specific measures were in place. albeit with considerable differences among the issue-areas. While CCS is supported through direct state industry construction. renewable energy is supported by means of a market-based system of green certificates. In the buildings sector. a great range of different measures have been introduced to increase energy efficiency. Massive sums have been invested in CCS. but much less support has been given to renewable energy and energy efficiency of buildings. The dissertation enquires whether this is due to political governance. to close ties between bureaucracy and industry actors. or to EU directives and regulation imposed on Norway through the EEA Agreement. The analysis shows that Norwegian politicians have devoted considerable energy and resources to realizing CCS. but opposition from the oil industry and parts of the bureaucracy has made implementation difficult. Many actors have invoked EU arguments to strengthen their own positions. whereas in reality the EU has had scant influence on Norways CCS policy. As regards renewable energy. it took a long time for the politicians to bow to pressures from the power industry to create a system of green certificates. It also proved difficult to design an alternative system that could be acceptable under EU state aid regulations.

1215991,Understanding the Differing Governance of EU Emissions Trading and Renewables: Feedback Mechanisms and Policy Entrepreneurs,2010,Elin L Boasson and Jørgen Wettestad,,,,,,This paper presents a comparative study of two central EU climate policies: the revised Emissions Trading System (ETS). and the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RES). Both were originally developed in the early 2000s and revised policies were adopted in December 2008. While the ETS from 2013 on will have a quite centralized and market-streamlined design. the revised RES stands forward as a more decentralized and technology-focused policy. Differing institutional feed-back mechanisms and related roles of policy entrepreneurs can shed considerable light on these policy differences. Due to member states’ cautiousness and contrary to the preferences of the Commission. the initial ETS was designed as a rather decentralized and ‘politicized’ market system. creating a malfunctioning institutional dynamic. In the revision process. the Commission skillfully highlighted this ineffective dynamic to win support for a much more centralized and market-streamlined approach. In the case of RES. national technology-specific support schemes and the strong links between the renewables industry and member states promoted the converse outcome: decentralization and technology development. Members of the European Parliament utilized these mechanisms through policy networking. while the Commission successfully used developments within the global climate regime to induce some degree of centralization.,True,655HHt4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,9,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/82j3n9k4,18307684977193715188,/scholar?cites=18307684977193715188,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt82j3n9k4/qt82j3n9k4.pdf,0,0,0
1215992,Europeanization of renewables support,2021,Elin Lerum Boasson,,Comparative Renewables Policy,,58,,This chapter chronicles how the European environment of support to renewable electricity has developed and changed over the course of four decades. In some countries. promotion of new renewable energy began as a domestic policy issue in the 1970s. With the rise of attention to the climate issue in the 1990s. support schemes became a widespread policy measure. eventually becoming subject to significant EU steering.For a long period. technology-specific feed-in schemes dominated in Europe. These offered beneficiaries a fixed price for electricity for 15 to 20 years. independent of market-price fluctations. often ensuring different levels of support for different renewables technologies (Cointe and Nadaï 2018). To the surprise of many. in 2014 the EU adopted state-aid guidelines that steered countries towards shifting to competitive auctioning combined with feed-in premiums (support on top of the spot-market electricity price; see Fitch-Roy et al. 2019). This shift was not the result of changes in EU renewables policy proper. but of the introduction of new guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy. The European environment is a meta-field. embracing developments at the all-EU level as well as in the member states. It can be described along two dimensions (Boasson 2021. Chapter 3 in this book).

1215993,Constitutionalization and entrepreneurship: Explaining increased EU steering of renewables support schemes,2019,Elin Lerum Boasson,7,Politics and Governance,1,70-80,,This article sheds light on two under-researched issue areas: the energy policy-shaping role of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and how constitutionalization of EU state aid law gives the European Commission (Commission) increased leverage over EU policy development. EU state aid governance is embedded in the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU’s prohibition of state aid. The CJEU and the Commissions’ Directorate-General for Competition (DG Comp) have played important roles in the emergence of stronger EU steering of renewable energy support schemes after 2014. For many years. powerful member states. most notably Germany. stopped the adoption of EU rules requiring more market streamlining and European harmonization of renewables support. This primarily played out in regular EU decision-making (co-decision) related to adoption and revision of the Renewable Energy Directive. A radical shift occurred in 2014 when the Commission introduced new guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy. giving the Commission increased authority over development of renewables support schemes across Europe. These guidelines called for renewables investments to become more exposed to energy market pricing and introduced auctioning as the main allocation mechanism. Support schemes for renewable energy were included for the first time in the EU state aid guidelines for environmental protection in 2001. Back then. member states had ample leeway to design support schemes as they pleased. The 2014 version of the guidelines includes far more detailed requirements.

1215999,10 Standardized CSR and climate performance: why is Shell willing. but Hydro reluctant?,2009,Elin Lerum Boasson and Jørgen Wettestad,,Corporate Social Responsibility in Europe: Rhetoric and Realities,,133,Edward Elgar Publishing,As shown in previous chapters. oil companies are. at least in their rhetoric. front-runners when it comes to engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In particular. they apply a large number of standardized CSR instruments. Further. they tend to perceive climate change as the most important of all societal challenges confronting the industry. Thus. one might assume that they would apply the CSR instruments they adhere to as tools in their efforts towards reducing their contribution to global warming.Whether CSR merely serves to streamline company rhetoric or has an influence on actual efforts has been heatedly debated by stakeholders and scholars alike (for example. Sahlin-Andersson 2006). This chapter explores whether the CSR instruments of the oil industry have merely worked as a rhetorical means or whether they have contributed to alterations in climate-related practices. Two oil companies were selected for study. the comparatively small Norwegian company Hydro and the larger Dutch/British Shell. They were chosen due to their similarity in CSR portfolios and differences as companies. as elaborated below. Hydro’s petroleum branch was merged with Statoil in spring 2007. after the period which is the focus of this study (St. prp. nr. 60 2006–2007). Instruments with standardized approaches for coping with societal issues are central features of the CSR trend. Such instruments involve formal decisions concerning adherence; they are managed and promoted by dedicated secretariats. and they provide global meeting places for their adherents. Against this backdrop. we might expect the rules promoted by the CSR instruments to …,True,655HHt4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,7,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zgL3p855qu4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA133&dq=info:lsuH9TkaYYkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=gkRWnqbL8j&sig=JzRvCFcbhCCJU4Se_kxRwWhJ6aQ,9899222292171836310,/scholar?cites=9899222292171836310,,,0,0,0

Although some of them have had a positive effect on the problem at hand. overall progress has been limited and existing environmental problems are formidable. In this book we explore the emergence of the environment as an international political issue. The main focus. however. is on the working and effect of these agreements.

1216002,A dynamic multi-field approach,2021,Elin Lerum Boasson,,Comparative Renewables Policy,,32,,The multi-field approach is developed to facilitate study of organizational and political factors that shape the development of public policy. Many fields play into developments of domestic support-scheme support. Each field has an identifiable social architecture: a distinct distribution of structural resources and certain specific cultural-institutional characteristics (Boasson 2015: 1). The multi-field approach is a spatial. relational approach to understanding how actors interact with one another (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016: 186). This unit of analysis–a given field–is ‘neither a macro-social process that contains some underlying structural logic operating independently of actors (eg. social class) nor is it a micro-social process that focuses on the idiosyncratic preferences and motivations of individual actors’(Kluttz and Fligstein 2016: 186). A field is a socially distinct constellation of actors. with varying degrees of internal coherence. unity and autonomy. and more or less impenetrable boundaries. Thus. a field is not an actor as such. but a distinct social space with some coherence across actors. In this chapter. we conceptualize three specific fields–the European environment. the domestic organizational field and the domestic political field–and their interrelationships. All three can be seen as social arenas where the actors take one another into account; and all have a local social order that constrains. facilitates or enables certain behaviours and policy developments (Kluttz and Fligstein 2016: 186; Scott [2001] 2014).

The data were collected through a questionnaire survey on a sample of 70 female head porters and in-depth interviews with key informants and some of the Kayayei. The findings indicate that the factors affecting accessibility to maternal health services by the Kayayei are unavailability of health facilities in the slums where Kayayei live. low-income levels. high cost of maternal health care. long queues and …,True,TW8uIygAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12134-014-0372-2,811471579795715719,/scholar?cites=811471579795715719,,http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/bitstream/handle/123456789/26953/Accessibility%20and%20Utilisation%20of%20Maternal%20Health%20Services%20by%20Migrant%20Female%20Head%20Porters%20in%20Accra..pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1216014,Groundwater evolution in the Voltaian Basin. Ghana—an application of multivariate statistical analyses to hydrochemical data,2011,Sandow Mark Yidana and GAB Yiran and Patrick Asamoah Sakyi and Prosper M Nude,,,,,Ghana Journal of Geography,Multivariate statistical methods were applied to hydrochemical data obtained from various field sampling campaigns in order to highlight the major groundwater types and the evolution of groundwater from recharge areas to discharge areas in the groundwater flow regime. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis distinguished four major hydrochemical types: Ca-HCO3 low salin-ity fresh groundwater in the south of the basin. through Na-HCO3 fresh low to intermediate sa-linity groundwater types. to saline-brackish Na- Cl groundwater types in the north of the basin. The concentrations of the major hydrochemical parameters also increase from south to north. suggesting that groundwater evolves from ap-parent recharge areas in the south to saline- brackish Na-Cl groundwater types in the north. On the basis of the observed variation in the hydrochemical data. this study hypothesizes that the southern parts of the basin are the ma-jor recharge areas in the basin. whereas the northern sections are discharge locations in the groundwater flow regime. R-mode factor analy-sis was then applied to the data to differentiate the various factors responsible for the observed hydrochemical variations. Four factors were distinguished: dissolution of chlorides of the major ions. silicate mineral weathering and or-ganic matter oxidation. dissolution of kieserite group of minerals. and anthropogenic conta- mination. Of all these factors. silicate mineral weathering is the most pervasive throughout the study area. This is apparently due to the presence of silicate minerals almost everywhere in the terrain.

It is associated with areas where the water is slow-flowing or stagnant. Policy makers take the necessary strategic and policy decisions especially where to target interventions based on available evidence including spatial distribution of the disease. Unfortunately. there is limited information on the spatial distribution of BU in Ghana. The aim of the study was to use Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to show the spatial distribution and hot spots of BU in Greater Accra and Eastern Regions in Ghana. The information could then be used by decision makers to make the necessary strategic and policy decisions. especially where to target intervention. We conducted a community case search and spatial mapping in two districts in Eastern region (Akuapem South and Suhum- Kraboa-Coaltar) and two districts in Greater Accra region (Ga West and Ga South Municipalities) of Ghana to identify the spatial distribution of BU cases in the communities along the Densu River. These municipalities are already known to the Ministry of Health as having high case load of BU. Structured questionnaires on demographic characteristics. environmental factors and general practices were administered to the cases. Using the E-trex Garmin Geographical Positioning System (GPS). the location of the case patient was marked along with any important attributes of the community.

And. investigate whether the replacement of dense forest by crop land and other opportunistic covers has resulted in land degradation. It is suggested that settlement expansion. smallholder farming. timber extraction. wood carving. bushfires and harvesting of non-timber forest products are causal factors of the land cover change. Based on census records. population increase could be considered as ultimate cause of the land cover change. particularly the activities of the proliferating smallholder cocoa farmers. However. timber extraction. which does not relate to population increase and bushfires which showed inverse relationship with population increase are proximate causes.

BNs have been used in a wide range of diagnostic problems in ‘real-life’systems. that is. those that are complex and vague; and they promise an ability to identify causal relationships that can define water-related poverty. A significant additional advantage of BNs is that the algorithm is ‘expert-friendly’and hence amenable to a process of joint discovery amongst analysts and domain specialists. A third advantage is that BNs are tolerant of uncertainties in the content and structure of analytical models–a critical attribute when dealing with mixtures of data typical for large river basins.

The frequency and intensity of these hazards are projected to increase during the twenty-first century as a result of climate variability and change. Vulnerabilities to these hazards vary. both spatially and temporally. due to differences in susceptibilities and adaptive capacities. Many mapping exercises in Ghana have considered the impacts of single hazards on single sectors. particularly agriculture. But the hazards often occur concurrently or alternately and have varying degrees of impacts on different sectors. The impacts also interact.

Ghana,2014,GERALD ALBERT BAERIBAMENG Yiran,,,,,,The climate is warming. a trend that is projected to increase with increasing frequency and intensity of climate related hazards. Impacts are likely to be greater in developing countries because of dependence on climate sensitive livelihood activities. The nature and impacts of climate hazards require a study that goes beyond investigating a single hazard or livelihood activity to embrace multiple hazards and their impacts on the various livelihood activities. It is against this background that this research was set up to undertake a multi-hazard/multi-sector analysis and mapping of vulnerability and identify policy options to enhance adaptation in the savannah ecosystem. using the Upper East Region as a case study.  To achieve this. an integrated framework was developed to guide the research.

Gaisie et al. 2015). Some studies show that urbanisation in Africa is rapid (Boadi. Kuitunen et al. 2005. Bao and Fang 2012. Cobbinah. Gaisie et al. 2015) while others counter that belief (Davis 2004. Potts 2009. Potts 2012). Urbanisation in Africa stood at 39% in 2010 and is predicted to reach 58% by 2050 (UNDESA/PD. 2012). Rapid urbanisation of African cities has led to increases in land required for development due to the growing desire for home ownership that has fuelled a construction boom in such cities. For this reason. fertile agricultural lands around cities are being converted for residential and other constructional activities. leaving smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on such fertile lands fewer livelihood opportunities (Quan. Tan et al. 2004). There is evidence that Tamale is fast expanding (Gyasi. Fosu et al. 2014. Fuseini. Yaro et al. 2017)). The rapid urbanization of Tamale means that the urban is taking over the peri-urban which. in turn. also pushes into the rural. Peri-urban can be described as the urban transition zone where urban and rural users mix and often clash (Griffiths. Hostert et al. 2010). The expansion could increase access to social amenities. eg water. health and educational facilities. new forms of employment. electricity. among others (Pendall 1999. Brueckner 2000. Bart 2010.

This paper revisits this significant correlation by examining the relationship between country-level happiness and the amount of urban green space as measured systematically from satellite images. Based on 2018 and 2013 data from 30 developed countries. we found that there is a correlation between urban green space and happiness. and this relationship becomes stronger among countries with higher GDP.

Yet value chain analysis is not the only relational approach. In this chapter. we seek to complement value chain analysis with the ‘business systems’ approach. an analytical framework that focuses explicitly on the institutions steering economic relations within a geographical context. By means of a comparative analysis of development in five regions of South-East Asia. we aim to elucidate the contributions of value chain analysis as well as of business systems analysis in explaining the performance of the case study areas. especially in terms of the inclusiveness of regional economic development. The key insight of relational approaches is that the performance of firms depends not only on their ‘in-house’assets and capabilities. but also on the environment in which they operate. ie on the nature of their links with other actors. The broadest framework of the relational approach is that of the global production network (GPN)(Coe etal. 2008). Though admirable in its comprehensiveness. GPN has the practical disadvantage of providing little focus for analysis. Depending on the context and industry. several ‘dimensions’ of a firm’s relations with others may have the upper hand in determining performance.

The body of knowledge on this topic has been split into two parts: private sector development (PSD) and local-central relations (LCR). This article argues that. in order for policies to be effective. PSD and LCR should be analysed simultaneously. Drawing on evidence from empirical work conducted in South-East Asia. the article offers policymakers some ways forward.

1216054,Droughts and debts: The domestic tea value chain and vulnerable livelihoods in Girimukti village. West Java. Indonesia,2017,Widyawati Sumadio and Edo Andriesse and Frimanisa Aprilianti and Andika Sulyat,,,,,Kassel University Press,This article is concerned with the linkages between the livelihoods of tea smallholders and domestic value chains in Indonesia. Theoretically. our empirical inquiry is informed by an integration of the sustainable livelihoods approach and value chain analyses. This enables a better investigation of micro (livelihoods)—meso (industry)—macro (national and international trends and political economy) interdependencies and interactions. In addition to value chains and socioeconomic challenges. tea smallholders in Indonesia are also confronted with droughts due to climate change and the 2015–2016 El Niño. The empirical work consisted of 36 semi-structured interviews in Girimukti village in West Java; a remote village relatively far from urban markets. Overall. our analysis demonstrates that tea smallholders are not poor. but are in a vulnerable position and remain far below the level of a stable lower-middle class. The smallholders lack human and financial capital and growing tea is not supported by horizontal coordination/social capital. In contrast. a few wealthy tea agripreneurs have established themselves as providers of inputs. intermediaries. tea drying factories. informal rural banks and village philanthropists. In other words. Girimukti is host to a process of increasing rural inequality driven by endogenous actors who are able to accumulate and concentrate tea assets and position themselves as essential nodes within the domestic tea value chain. The adaptive strategy of rural-urban migration from Girimukti to escape rural marginalisation is unattractive because of relatively low human capital levels.,True,cSImKmsAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,7,https://kobra.uni-kassel.de/handle/123456789/2017010351858,139676470524484316,/scholar?cites=139676470524484316,,https://kobra.uni-kassel.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/2017010351858/JARTSVol118No1S069.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1216055,Malaysia and South Korea: A decade after the Asian financial crisis,2008,Hye Jin Zumkehr and Edo Andriesse,,SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,1-26,,This paper undertakes a comparative analysis of the Malaysian and South Korean post-crisis policies over a ten-year period following the Asian crisis of 1997. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the policies and to obtain insight into the factors that generated simultaneous recovery. despite a different policy environment in both countries. South Korea implemented neo-liberal International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies. while Malaysia resorted to controversial capital controls. The ten-year analysis demonstrates that an initial strong recovery to pre-crisis growth levels could not be maintained over the long-term. Moreover. improvements are still warranted in the field of corporate governance. Furthermore. the analysis shows that significant improvements have been made. with respect to the reduction of non-performing loans and the Human Development Index (HDI). In all. the outcomes indicate that a heterodox policy such as capital controls is by no means doomed from the start. This implies that future monetary and fiscal policy making in Asia should not blindly follow the Washington Consensus. Instead. each country should find its own rightful policy mix. possibly taking elements from the emerging Beijing Consensus. Indeed. China and other Asian countries appear to recover quicker from the current turmoil in the global economy.

It discusses the impact of the Greater Mekong Subregion on new institutional economic and economic geographical arrangements. It demonstrates the usefulness of the varieties of Asian capitalism approach. The rubber industry was chosen to unravel emerging but various sub-national institutional arrangements linked to higher scale levels. Rubber is a growing agribusiness industry throughout the country. led by the insatiable demand from China. Overall. this study shows that the capitalist development of the rubber industry features much geo-institutional differentiation. due to the different strategies of Chinese. Thai and Vietnamese investors. Since Laos is still in transition from a state-led economy to something else. it is impossible at this to identify the exact number capitalisms. Yet. the evidence on rubber clearly lays bare the presence of multiple institutional arrangements. Without more inclusiveness. however. the implications for regional development are worrying. Exclusive arrangements will most likely lead to more uneven regional development and higher regional inequality. To refine theories on sub-national varieties of capitalism in developing countries it is instructive to consider more explicitly the notion of regional personal capitalisms and the complex interplay between national and regional states and relationships between capital accumulation and livelihood analyses.,True,cSImKmsAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,4,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201509365223387.page,14638162631682381095,/scholar?cites=14638162631682381095,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201509365223387.pdf,0,0,0

Focusing on this region enables an in-depth focus on geographical differentiation of the middle income trap. The empirical outcomes demonstrate that policymakers involved with sugar should look at the particular challenges in Northeastern Thailand: 1. The role of brokers which is unaddressed in the current regulatory environment; 2. A lack of information of the regulatory environment among growers; 3. Distrust between growers and millers; 4. Alack of implementation of R&D efforts; 5. A lack of support from associations; 6. The labor shortage problem. and 7. No incentives for growers. brokers and millers to improve quality and embark on upgrading. Since agricultural value chains in Southeast Asia often start in relatively poor rural areas it is imperative that policymakers balance the interests of upstream. midstream and downstream actors. Unfortunately. this is rather difficult as midstream actors (millers) and wholesalers are powerful and therefore. are in the best position to defend their interests.

Nevertheless. rapid economic growth has not been accompanied with sufficient reductions in poverty levels. The two countries belong to the group of least developed countries (LDCs) and rising income and land inequality is alarming (So 2010; UNDP 2011; Howe and Sims 2011). Worrying is the observation by leading experts on the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) that the poor are ill-prepared to make ends meet. let alone improve their livelihoods. Whereas the middle class is clearly expanding in Thailand. Vietnam and China. the middle class and an active civil society is missing in Cambodia and Laos.

1216063,Institutions and regional development in Southeast Asia,2008,EHS Andriesse,374,,,,,The study of relationships between regional performance and varieties of capitalism within developing countries is an interesting and challenging topic. Although it is evident that capitalist institutions have made further inroads in Southeast Asia. it is far from certain how particular institutional arrangements should be classified and how institutions will change in the future. What seems reasonably certain. however. is that the traditional dichotomy of liberal capitalist systems (notably the USA and the UK) and coordinated capitalist systems (Germany and Japan) may prove to be an unsuitable lens through which to scrutinise the performance of non-core regions. For example. Vietnam. with a similar population to Germany. is neither liberal nor coordinated. This thesis has been concerned with the bandwidth of capitalist variety within Southeast Asia and has made an effort to apply elements of the Varieties of Capitalism approach as developed by Hall and Soskice (2001) to Thailand and Malaysia. The institutional turn in economic geography has proven to be valid and useful for explaining patterns of regional development in the developed world. Nevertheless. remarkably few publications employed an institutional approach for non-core regions in developing areas. From a theoretical and methodological point of view. then. it was and is interesting to scrutinize to what extent the institutional turn makes sense in such areas. The province of Satun in Southern Thailand and the state of Perlis in Northern Malaysia. two neighbouring non-core regions. were chosen to identify. explore and unravel capitalist institutions and to investigate its impact on patterns of …,True,cSImKmsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,3,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/27611,3994584586402953719,/scholar?cites=3994584586402953719,,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/27611/andriesse.pdf%3Bsequence=1,0,0,0

1216094,A Novel Neuro-Optimal Approach for Decentralized LFC Design in multi-area power system,2006,M Ansarian and GH Shakouri and J Nazarzadeh and SM Sadeghzadeh,,,,167-172,IEEE,This paper introduces a robust decentralized load-frequency controller (LFC) for a power system. which is configured based on the structured singular values (SSVs). A new linear quadratic regulator (LQR) solution is applied for a two-area power system. using an artificial neural network (ANN). Subject to a restriction which is based on SSVs. each LFC can be designed independently. The proposed neuro-optimal controller combines the advantages of ANN and the good performance of the SSV-LQR controller. To overcome the problem of SSV-LQR. which needs the measurement of all system states; the suggested controller has only one input from system states in each area and regenerates the other states just using lags of the frequency variations. The results show that the proposed controller has improved dynamic behavior of the system. compared to the both SSV-LQR controller and a genetic algorithm (GA …,True,EoSAPUwAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4154484/,14724550334260055327,/scholar?cites=14724550334260055327,,,0,0,0

Solution of the problem depends on availability of a model. This paper proposes a systematically developed model. It is based on a previously performed exogeneity investigation of various quantified variables. A certain nonlinear model among a collection of 100 models with different inputs is chosen as the most appropriate model. Structure of all nonlinear competing models is established according to logical conjunctive and disjunctive relationships between variables. Different combinations of the exogenous variables generate these models. At first. unacceptable models are put away applying coefficient sign significance criterion and error validity.

A fuzzy-based approach is applied for the industry energy demand forecasting using socio-economic indicators. This approach is structured as a fuzzy linear regression (FLR). A multi-level FLR model is designed properly. This paper indeed proposes a multi-level FLR model by which the inputs to the ending level are obtained as outputs of the starting levels. Actual data from 1994-2008 are used to develop the multi-level FLR and illustrate capability of the approach in this regard. The estimation fuzzy problem for the model is formulated as a linear optimization problem and is solved using the linear programming based simplex method.

Improvements from the original algorithm in the recent decade mostly concentrate on combining its initial algorithm with some heuristic methods. This is while modifications to the method are rarely happened to the initial conditions from which the annealing schedule starts. There are several parameters in the process of annealing the adjustment of which affects the overall performance.

Use of classical multidimensional scaling produces a low‐dimensional representation of the data for which Euclidean distances approximate the original dissimilarities. The resulting scores are then analysed using discriminant analysis. giving tests based on the canonical correlations. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics under permutations of the observations are shown to be invariant to changes in the distributions of the original variables. unlike the distributions of the multi‐response permutation test statistics which have been considered by other workers for testing differences among groups.

1216116,Re-contextualizing the notion of comfort,2008,Raymond J Cole and John Robinson and Zosia Brown and Meg O'shea,36,Building Research & Information,4,323-336,Routledge,To what extent can the urgency of climate change and an evolving concept of agency (at the individual and social levels of building users) create a new context for rethinking the notion of comfort? A new. emerging notion of comfort is explored that embraces engagement with new conditions. new experiences. and new types of interactions between inhabitants and building systems and unfamiliar technologies. The emphasis is on communication and dialogue as two dynamic and adaptive processes necessary to achieve optimal building performance while valuing and responding to inhabitant knowledge and agency. and enhancing indoor environmental quality from the standpoint of the inhabitants. A primary conclusion is that the goal of shifting into a lower carbon society has created a new context for comfort. from its conventional emphasis as automated. uniform and predictable. to a broader notion that takes into …,True,c-KeIAcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,248,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613210802076328,3351685558094712002,/scholar?cites=3351685558094712002,,,0,0,0

To the degree that the future is not already determined but remains to be created. then the search for the most likely future is not only misguided (since we are usually wrong) but actually counterproductive. What are needed are backcasting techniques that reveal the possibility. and test the feasibility and impacts. of alternative futures.

Evidence increasingly supports the finding that this transformation is not triggered by climate policy alone. but rather is shaped by a broad array of decisions and practices that are rooted in underlying patterns of development.

This paper is the first attempt to incorporate asset-based financing into production decisions. Instead of setting a known. exogenously determined budgetary constraint as most existing models suggest. we model the available cash in each period as a function of assets and liabilities that may be updated periodically according to the dynamics of the production activities. Furthermore. our models allow different interest rates on cash balance and outstanding loans. which is an enhancement over most traditional models in that inventory financed by a loan may be more expensive than that by out-of-pocket cash.

The appropriate values of these parameters are influenced by the accuracy of forecasts over the lead time. the variability of processing time and the degree of congestion. together with the costs of inventory and shortages. These influences are explored using stochastic models of a single stage manufacturing system for which work release is controlled using MRP. The major conclusion is that safety time is usually only preferable to safety stock when it is possible to make accurate forecasts of future required shipments over the lead time. otherwise safety stock is more robust in coping with changes in customer requirements in the lead time or with fluctuations in forecasts of lead time demand.,True,i_gAnSsAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,228,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.40.12.1678,2045035402728625636,/scholar?cites=2045035402728625636,,,0,0,0

1216140,Flexibility and decision making,1990,Marvin Mandelbaum and John Buzacott,44,European Journal of Operational Research,1,17-27,North-Holland,This paper presents a formal treatment of flexibility by using decision theory in a two-period decision problem. It is supposed that each action at the first period has a flexibility measure the number of options open at the second period. The model presented assumes that uncertainty exists in the loss functions of the decision problem and shows how this uncertainty gives rise to a consideration of flexibility as a criterion in the decision process. The tradeoff of flexibility against an expected loss calculated using a preliminary model is shown. A simple manufacturing example is used to illustrate the ideas.,True,i_gAnSsAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,224,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377221790903108,823926158673402265,/scholar?cites=823926158673402265,,,0,0,0

A linked queueing network model is developed to describe the behaviour of Kanban controlled systems. Next it is shown that the linked model is equivalent to multiple server queues in series with a blocking mechanism that depends on the features of the system. If there are reserve stocks in the system then the blocking mechanism is the conventional blocking of service because the next queue is full. However. if Kanbans can be triggered by backorders. then the blocking mechanism is more complex and requires looking at the number of customers in following stages. Next. it is shown that MRP systems are also equivalent to series queues but with the rules for determining release of jobs into service now involving forecasts of future demand.

Control mechanisms that take into account this availability are necessary in order to achieve the potential improvements in performance. We investigate the structure of optimal control policies for a discrete-time make-to-stock queue with advance order information. Since the optimal policy does not have a simple structure. we then propose a heuristic policy which is an extension of the base stock system that incorporates advance order information through a release lead time parameter.

They feel that it should be possible to reduce these inventories; however. before doing so it is necessary for them to understand their function. Although the general rule that inventories exist because of imbalance in supply and demand at a point within the system is true. it is necessary to show more precisely how such an imbalance might arise in single-product systems due to variability in processing times at the stations. or interruptions in production due to breakdown and subsequent repair of stations.

This paper presents an analysis of the environmental conflict that arose between the state. society. and industry stakeholders in an industrial zone of the Eastern Seaboard Development Program of Thailand. This paper seeks to determine the effectiveness of policy measures implemented by the state to resolve the conflict. The purpose of this study is to draw lessons for industrializing nations that adopt the industrial zone model to foster environmentally sustainable industrial development. The study revealed that blatant violation of land-use planning regulations and expansion of the industrial zone into community areas was a root cause of the conflict. Through legal action. civil society has been successful in forcing the state and industries to halt unplanned expansion of industrial areas and practice better environmental governance. However. inadequate commitment by the state and industry stakeholders seems to perpetuate the conflict. threatening the sustainability of economic gains. A Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based analysis confirmed that the policy interventions of the government to resolve the conflict have not produced significant results.

Since the mid-1980s. housing production in Bangkok has reached an extremely large volume and the private sector has played the dominant role in this development. However. due to the inadequacy of market information. uninformed speculation. and excessive production. some 350.000 fully completed housing units. most of which have been sold by their developers. remain unoccupied in Bangkok. This large surplus of housing has hindered the recovery of the market after the crisis. The implications of this experience support the view that there is a need to establish a property information centre and an estate management bureau to support efficient recovery of the market.,True,HzSqADQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397504000037,9965301824628206264,/scholar?cites=9965301824628206264,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49997115/Housing_speculation_in_Bangkok_lessons_f20161030-23436-1utfvlc.pdf,0,0,0

Although there has been successful implementation of the LCS approach in some cities of developed countries. it is more difficult in developing countries like Thailand. The objectives of this paper are to present drivers and barriers affecting the abilities of three regional cities of Thailand to combine LCS activities with their strategies. Lessons learned from this study will allow for sharing these experiences with municipalities in other developing countries.

This study attempts to analyze this nexus by identifying the magnitude and quality of the links among the elements. The study was undertaken in Bandung City. Indonesia by analyzing the concen-tricity of land use of the city. computing traffic loads at some primary radial trunk roads towards city center. assessing transport energy and air quality in the study area. Analysis on the present linearity of the nexus was also conducted by acquiring relevant secondary data as well as information from the separate study by the first authors in the same city. A quantitative analysis was undertaken to corroborate the rela-tionships among linear connections of the elements. The result exhibits that the interconnections among elements in the nexus do exist. It also shows that the interconnection of the nexus ie land use. transport. energy consumption and air quality is linear and it requires a synergistic efforts to enhance the strategies towards climate change co-benefits.

1216167,Promoting travel demand reduction in transport sector in cities of Asian developing countries: Case of Bangkok,2006,Ranjith Perera,,"Institute for Global Environmental Studies, Japan",,,,Urban land use observably induces and generates traffic particularly where segregation among categories of land uses are distinct. Zoning in land use that distinguishes residential and commercial zones would create the needs of motorized transport due to journey to works and other purposes. provided that the proximity between residential and commercial zones is absence. In Bangkok. this state exists because of significant residential developments in the suburban areas. Bangkok has been sprawling into various directions particularly to North. Northeast. East and Southeast to form Bangkok Metropolitan Region. This experience makes motorized travel demand increasing. and reducing it would be indispensable from the environment and energy viewpoints. This paper explores the current conditions of land use and transportation relationship in Bangkok that affects urban air quality.With the growing number of population of Bangkok and insufficient integration of transit systems. the number of private vehicles operating on road is increasing every year. Since vehicles predominantly use fossil fuels this trend has lead to the degradation of air quality until 1996. However. with synergistic efforts in both urban development and transport sectors that commenced in 1997. the air quality in Bangkok is considerably improving. A number of solutions had been adapted to cope with the problem of air quality. While urban planners introduced strategies to promote poly-centric development of the city and thereby dispersing the traffic to limited areas. the transport planners employed a series of measures to reduce the vehicular emissions.

This is clear from the comparative assessment of the accommodated and unaccommodated enterprises in the study areas of Colombo. The study also demonstrates that a substantial proportion of the unaccommodated entrepreneurs could afford to pay accommodation fees if physical access to marketplaces were ensured. It is a fallacy that the majority of informal sector (IS) entrepreneurs cannot afford to pay the costs of any physical facility. Such a notion hides the financial capacities and entrepreneurship of productive is enterprises.

1216170,Corroborating the land use change as primary determinant of air quality degradation in a concentric city,2015,Ariva Sugandi Permana and Ranjith Perera and Norsiah A Aziz and Chin Siong Ho,2,International Journal of Built Environment and Sustainability,2,,,Bandung City is characterized by concentric land use pattern as found in many naturally grown cities. It radiates from mixed commercial areas in the center to low density residential areas in the periphery. This pattern generates significant traffic volume towards city center. The gener-ated traffic releases emissions and degrades urban air quality since fossil fuel is predominantly used by vehicles in Bandung. In the absence of air polluting industries as well as construction and demolition activities. traffic load generated by land use changes is the only major contribu-tor to air quality degradation in the city. The land use change can therefore be seen as primary determinant of air pollution in Bandung. This study analyses land use changes and its impacts on traffic pattern and air quality. Multivariate correlation between traffic load and land use changes is employed as tool to substantiate the proposition. Relationships between the degree of chang-es in land use. as reflected in traffic loads. and the quantity of two principal air pollutants. namely SO2 and HC are also established to validate the argument.

Numerous projects. especially those that are small-and medium-scale in size and scope. are implemented in areas by a local authority without any type of EA. Based on a comparative analysis of the environmental status of large-. medium-and small-scale road development projects implemented by a local authority in Thailand. this paper attempts to justify the enforcement of EAs for medium-and small-scale projects. The justification is mainly based on the perceptions of people affected by these projects. Environmental impact scores. computed on the basis of people’s perceptions. reveal that. irrespective of the size of a project. the impacts caused by different sized projects are perceived as similar.

It radiates from mixed commercial areas in the center to low density residential areas in the periphery. This pattern generates significant traffic volume towards city center. The gener-ated traffic releases emissions and degrades urban air quality since fossil fuel is predominantly used by vehicles in Bandung. In the absence of air polluting industries as well as construction and demolition activities. traffic load generated by land use changes is the only major contribu-tor to air quality degradation in the city. The land use change can therefore be seen as primary determinant of air pollution in Bandung. This study analyses land use changes and its impacts on traffic pattern and air quality. Multivariate correlation between traffic load and land use changes is employed as tool to substantiate the proposition. Relationships between the degree of chang-es in land use. as reflected in traffic loads. and the quantity of two principal air pollutants. namely SO2 and HC are also established to validate the argument.

The role that housing plays in the social and economic development of a country cannot be underestimated. Interventions in housing by government are widely acknowledged as one of the ways by which the social aspect of the life of the citizenry can be impacted especially through mass housing otherwise called social housing. This paper aims to examine the various potentials in the housing sector in order to enhance the delivery of more housing to Nigerians. A survey research approach was used in the study. Descriptive analysis was employed to explain the potentials in the housing sector. Housing deficit in Nigeria currently stands at about 17 million units. Efforts to meet and rectify the deficit will need a concerted effort of individuals and government. It requires unleashing the potentials in the housing sector to stimulate growth in the economy. thereby diversifying the economy from the mono to a multi sector economy. Interventions of governments at all levels as well as the involvement of informal sector in the housing sector will have a multiplier effect. It will generate multiple employment opportunities which will in turn stimulate the economy through the circulation of money in the system. The paper noted that interventions in housing sector will stimulate industries in the production of local building materials.

Damaturu town became a state capital in August 1991. Since then the population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along axial route to major cities in the northeast region. Wastes are being generated mainly from residential. commercial and institutional land uses. Waste collection bins are placed at strategic locations identified by the agency and termed as high waste generating points with wheeled plastic waste bins. metal waste bins and constructed waste bunkers. The contents of these bins are finally disposed of at a location 6 kilometers away from the generating points. Spatial data on waste distribution was collected using a global positioning system (GPS). The data was manipulated and processed using Geographic information system (GIS) to produce the waste distribution map. Findings revealed that the existing solid waste management system is inefficient as the present practice rely on monthly collection and disposal of waste using an open dump site.,True,fv93Od4AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,37,https://file.scirp.org/pdf/JEP20100400004_43795261.pdf,15510139695817874421,/scholar?cites=15510139695817874421,,https://file.scirp.org/pdf/JEP20100400004_43795261.pdf,0,0,0

The focus of the study was on the changes in physical-chemical and biological environment as well as on the socioeconomy of fishermen in the form of fishery productivity and income level. Field observation and qualitative descriptive analysis were used as an approach. Data were gathered from government institutions and from a set of questionnaires handed out to a total of 89 respondents. Results showed that reclamation activities changed the environment such as coastal morphology. hydro-oceanography. mangrove and coral reefs deterioration. Other effects are the hill-cutting and tree-cutting of the surrounding area to get filling materials for the reclamation project. Among the consequences observed and recorded were flooding. erosions. sedimentations. and adverse influences on the seawater quality. sea biota. local depletion of several kinds of fishes such as snappers. groupers. and shrimps.

1216244,Sprawling of a Malaysian city: what type and what solutions,2010,M Rafee Majid and Hafizul Yahya,17,"The First International Conference on Sustainable Urbanization (ICSU 2010),(December), 15â",,,,Urban sprawl refers to the uncontrolled growth of an urban area resulting from poorly or totally unplanned urbanization. Researchers have categorized various types of urban sprawls. distinguished by their patterns and causes. These various categories of sprawls call for solutions of different approaches. This paper discusses a study carried out to identify the type of sprawl being experienced by a rapidly growing urban area in the southern part of Malaysia. The Landsat TM images of the study area. the City of Johor Bahru. for the years 1988. 1997 and 2005 were classified to detect for any occurrence of sprawl and its type. The classified images of the city for 1988. 1997 and 2005 showed a rapid increase of urbanized area of 231 km2. 304 km2 and 416 km2 respectively. Spatial investigation of the growth of the city. however. revealed an unsustainable growth in different directions along major roads. leaving pockets of undeveloped areas scattered within the city limit. This is typical of a ribbon sprawl where development occurs along major roads.

The same scenario repeats itself in Iskandar Malaysia. a southern development corridor located in Johor. Malaysia where close to three hundred housing developments have been launched from pre-1980s to 2000s. These housing developments are believed to have undergone a layout design evolution affecting land use distribution. road network design. density and many other neighborhood metrics. Thus. this study investigates the impact of housing development designs on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as they evolve over the decades. Evolution in layout design is discussed in terms of the 4Ds of urban form factors: density. diversity. design (street connectivity and intersection density) and destination accessibility (proximity).

1216246,The Consequences of Drought and Desertification in Nigeria.,2009,Nasiru Idris Medugu and Mohammed Rafee Majid and Foziah Johar,3,IUP Journal of Environmental Sciences,3,,,Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with an estimated population of over 140 million and a total land area of 923.773 km². The country is currently losing about 351.000 ha annually to advancing desert and such conditions are estimated to be advancing southwards at the rate of about 0.6 km per year. The dunes are threatening life-supporting oasis. burying water points. and in some cases. engulfing major roads in the affected areas. Trees planted by the government as shelterbelts to check the advancing dunes are withering due to the lack of attention. This paper highlights the state of desertification in Nigeria. the historical trends. the past national efforts. as well as the ongoing and planned measures for combating this fast-spreading desert condition.

Eight Millennium Development Goals were formulated of which the eradication of poverty given top priority. However. Malaysia's participation with the UN in dealing with poverty. precede this when it committed itself with the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) programme. which was then reinforced when the Millennium Declaration was made in 2000. Nationally. poverty eradication as well as bridging the inequality gap among the major ethnic groups and states has been the main development goal in Malaysia's development agenda since independence. In this regards. the principle of â€ œgrowth with equity has been the central theme in all Malaysia's development policies and efforts since independence. Although Malaysia has made significant achievements in reducing the incidence of aggregate poverty across the country from 8.9% in 1995 down to 1.7% in 2012. there still exist pockets of poverty in the rural areas. in certain states/regions and among ethnic groups. as well as in some urban areas. This shows that formulating planning and policy implementation to eradicate poverty now needs to be more spatially focused for the implementation to be more effective. Recognising the incidence of poverty through standard statistical data tables alone is no longer adequate in formulating planning and policy implementation.

As a result. a number of policies. agencies and departments were established to ensure proper protection and management of these areas. To ensure management effectiveness. frequent evaluation is necessary. This paper is a review of relevant literatures on protected area management effectiveness and collaboration in management. The findings of the review indicated that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) framework is the most widely used for assessing management effectiveness of protected areas. However. a limitation of the framework is its deficiency to integrate collaboration and motivation. These factors play vital roles in effective management of protected areas through promoting wildlife conservation particularly in developing world. Therefore. this paper proposes a hybrid framework for evaluating protected area management effectiveness. consisting of the IUCN framework. collaboration and motivation to be used in subsequent assessment of protected areas.

However. this information is severely limited. and most users rely on published topographic maps or DEMs produced by government agencies. This paper proposes an alternative method of generating DEM by using online source of elevation data which is easier and free. The result shows that. the difference in percent of the watershed boundary is 0.19% by using Google Earth’s elevation data as it compared with the same watershed area which is delineated using 20 meter interval contour data obtained from JUPEM (Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia). Firstly. the location of the study area identified in Google Earth. was divided into thirty-six areas and marked using provided mark functions in Google Earth. The coordinates were exported to an online application tool named Terrain Zonum Solutions for extracting 5000 elevation points for each thirty-six areas. These points were uploaded and processed in ArcGIS software (version 9.3. 1) to generate the DEM. As to compare the reliability of the elevation values that extracted from Google Earth. the DEM was utilized and integrated with river line data to delineate Sungai Muar’s watershed boundary using ArcHydro version 1.4 tool.

Field observation and both quantitative & qualitative descriptive analyses were used as an approach. Data were gathered from government institutions and from a set of questionnaires handed out to a total of 89 respondents. Results showed that reclamation activities changed the environment such as coastal morphology. hydro-oceanography. mangrove and coral reefs. Other effects include the clearing and cutting of surrounding hills and vegetation to get backfill materials for the reclamation project. Among the consequences observed and recorded were flooding. erosion. sedimentation. and adverse influences on the seawater quality. sea biota as well as local depletion of several kinds of fishes such as snappers. groupers. and shrimps.

The Assessment examines a large number of potential measures to reduce harmful emissions. identifying a small set of specific measures that would likely produce the greatest benefits. and which could be implemented with currently available technology. An outlook up to 2070 is developed illustrating the benefits of those emission mitigation policies and mesures for human well-being and climate. The Assessment concludes that rapid mitigation of anthropogenic black carbon and tropospheric ozone precursor emissions would complement carbon dioxide reduction measures and would have immediate benefits for human well-being.

New York, ME Sharpe",,121-149,,China's reputation for developing ineffective environmental policies made these environmental problems seem unsolvable. In recent years. China has developed air pollution regulations and supported resource conservation projects that promise to put its past reputation to rest. Domestically. environ-mental awareness has grown. and China's younger generation of leaders is better educated and more capable of absorbing new policy concepts and management tools than their predecessors. While these internal factors clearly played a role in China's environmental policy improvements. this chapter explores the significant influence of international organizations on strengthening environmental policy design and implementation in China. Many theories on policymaking in China emphasize interbureaucratic obstacles to policy reform. In contrast. this chapter emphasizes the extrabureaucratic influences that international NGOs and multilateral orga-nizations have had on policy innovation. As interest in protecting China's environment has spread. international organizations (bilateral. multilateral. and nongovernmental) have increased their activities inside China. These international organizations have enhanced communication and coordination among China's bureaucracies and empowered nonstate actors in the environmental policy sphere—highlighting how considerable policy change can be initiated beyond China's bureaucracy.

1216260,Low carbon transport in Asia: strategies for optimizing co-benefits,2012,Eric Zusman and Ancha Srinivasan and Shobhakar Dhakal,,,,,Routledge,Without the effective participation of developing Asia. a climate crisis is certain. Within developing Asia. the key to averting such a crisis lies in low carbon transport. China. India and Asia's other emerging economies could promote fuel efficient vehicles. public transport. and sustainable urban planning. Or they could become locked into inefficient vehicles. energy intensive infrastructure. and suburban sprawl. The path they choose will have long-term implications for the entire world. And it will depend upon the extent to which they adopt a co-benefit approach. A co-benefit approach involves recognizing that some transport policies mitigate greenhouse gases while simultaneously improving urban air quality. commuting times and energy security. Accounting for these additional benefits can overcome a reluctance to bear the costs of climate actions. But it also presents unique technical. financial. and institutional challenges to decision-makers unaccustomed to optimizing multiple benefits. The book represents a pioneering effort to identify and remove barriers to a co-benefit approach in developing Asia's transport sector. The introductory section makes the case for co-benefits in developing Asia's transport sector. The second section features analytical frameworks to identify strategies with potential co-benefits. offering new findings on black carbon and dieselization.

1216265,Implementing the sustainable development goals (SDGs): An assessment of the means of implementation (MOI),2014,Simon Hoiberg Olsen and Eric Zusman and Ikuho Miyazawa and Tim Cadman and Tetsuro Yoshida and Magnus Bengtsson,,Institute for Global Environmental Strategies. Available at: http://tinyurl. com/h5juhlq,,1-10,,The 2012 Rio+ 20 conference initiated an intergovernmental process to identify a set of universal. integrated and transformational Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Negotiations over the SDGs are scheduled to deliver an actionable post-2015 development agenda by the end of 2015. To reach this deadline. the SDGs will draw some inspiration from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). But while MDGs have been widely credited for advancing international development for the past decade and a half. they included a hastily-designed governance goal that did not significantly strengthen their implementation. Though this may have had a moderate influence on relatively uncontroversial and straightforward MDGs. considering governance and related actionable means of implementation will arguably have a more pronounced effect on the implementation of integrated and transformational SDGs (Olsen and Elder: 2013) 7The paper suggests that the recent emphasis on means of implementation (MoI) under the SDGs has the potential to improve upon experiences with the MDG’s handling of governance. Toward this end. the paper reviews nine official and unofficial documents related to sustainable development to organize proposed MoI into three overarching types: finance. technology and institutions. The paper then contends that more attention is needed to how national institutions within MoI handle three core functions: 1) the articulation. aggregation. and conversion of diverse interests into policies; 2) the allocation and distribution of resources to comply with provisions in those policies; and 3) the monitoring. evaluation. and …,True,xmFCFgYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,14,https://isap.iges.or.jp/2014/PDF/IPSS_SDGs_conference_paper.pdf,5848722118051676039,/scholar?cites=5848722118051676039,,https://isap.iges.or.jp/2014/PDF/IPSS_SDGs_conference_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Indonesia has tasked provincial governments with defining sub‐national actions to help implement the nationally appropriate mitigation action (NAMA) it pledged to the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFCCC) in 2009. This paper assesses provincial plans in Indonesia's Sustainable Urban Transport Initiative (SUTI) — a set of transport plans that developed in parallel to its NAMA — focusing on three key questions distilled from sustainable low carbon transport and multi‐level governance literature. The questions seek to shed light into whether provincial governments: (1) prioritize actions that avoid unnecessary travel and shift passengers to more efficient modes; (2) carefully consider funding and costs estimates; and (3) clearly define institutional roles and responsibilities.

But whether the SDGs prove truly transformational will to a large extent depend upon governance. Governance is pivotal to translating the global sustainability agenda into national and local action. This timely report not only reinforces this point; it suggests looking back at the governance of national sustainable development strategies (NSDS) after the 1992 Earth Summit to draw insights into how governance may affect the post-2015 agenda.Focusing on the governance elements contained in overarching development strategies (such as the NSDS) in Bhutan. Indonesia. the Philippines. South Korea. and Thailand. the report provides some eyeopening messages for the architects of the SDGs. Among the most relevant is that really gaining traction with the SDGs is likely to require that countries not only exhibit leadership and well-coordinated institutions but also develop mechanisms that can engage multiple stakeholders and monitor and track progress. Without attention to all four of these desirable elements of governance—leadership. institutional coordination. stakeholder engagement. and review of progress—countries may find themselves. two decades after the SDGs. calling for an even greater transformational sustainable development agenda but still lacking the governance mechanisms to implement it.,True,xmFCFgYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,10,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.726.6981&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2204926789829308497,/scholar?cites=2204926789829308497,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.726.6981&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Many factors have contributed to this interest. including a future climate change regime that provides financial. technological and capacity building support for “nationally appropriate mitigation actions” (NAMAs) (UNFCCC. 2007). But among those factors with the greatest potential to shape the region's climate policies is research on low carbon development. This research has already demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of a low carbon future in China. India. Indonesia. and Asia's other emerging economies (Jiang 2009. Shukla.

1216274,The river runs dry: examining water shortages in the Yellow River basin,2000,Eric Zusman,,,,,,The Yellow River (Huang He) has been deservedly cast as a source of great prosperity and great despair in the annals of Chinese history. Droughts have been a part of the struggles of the Yellow River basin’s population and. in an arguably less dramatic fashion. exacted an even more crippling toll than floods. In recent years. a lack of water has once again reawakened the anxiety caused by droughts. attracting the attention of Chinese policymakers and the Chinese media. In 18 out of the past 26 summers the Yellow River has run dry further and further upstream for longer and longer periods of time. During the summer of 1998. the river failed to reach its mouth at Bohai Bay for over 250 days.Water managers in China cite a combination of unique characteristics or tedian as factors that contribute to the basin’s water shortages. The most obvious of these tedian is the yellow soil or huang tu from which the Yellow River gets its name. The Yellow River is the most heavily sediment-laden river in the world. holding nine-times as much sediment as the Ganges River. the closest standard for comparison. Less often mentioned as a factor contributing to water shortages in China is growth in agricultural. municipal and industrial rates of water usage that followed the liberalizing of the Chinese economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The least frequently mentioned reason for water shortages. however. is the system that manages the Yellow River.

The collection of benefits accruing to actions linking climate change and other development priorities (eg. reducing local pollution) are known as ‘co-benefits’[1]. Over the past two decades. a growing number of studies have demonstrated that an integrated or co-benefits approach could prove more cost effective than managing climate and development issues in isolation. but policies reflecting this integration have tended to lag behind research.

Many of the vehicles in this informal sector contribute to rising air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Energy-efficient technologies could make paratransit environmentally sustainable. However. the purchase and use of clean vehicles is contingent on the willingness of the drivers to switch vehicles in the face of different policies. This paper draws upon a series of discrete choice and regression models to analyze drivers’ response to a set of such hypothetical policies in Jakarta. Indonesia. The analysis confirmed that drivers are relatively unlikely to alter preferences for high-emissions vehicles without strong support from subsidies and demand management policies.

This paper searches for answers to two broad questions: what do we know about the GHG emissions from urbanization at multiple scales and what are the key opportunities to mitigate GHG from cities and their efficient governance? The review suggests that the quantification of urban contribution to global. regional and national GHGs are limited to few regions and for CO2 only. The GHG emissions of urban areas differ widely for the accounting methods. scope of GHGs. emission sources and urban definition. thus. making place-based comparisons difficult.

Over the next decades the increase in rural population in many developing countries will be overshadowed by population flows to cities. Rural populations globally are expected to peak at a level of 3.5 billion people by around 2020 and decline thereafter. albeit with heterogeneous regional trends. This adds urgency in addressing rural energy access. but our common future will be predominantly urban. Most of urban growth will continue to occur in small-to medium-sized urban centers. Growth in these smaller cities poses serious policy challenges. especially in the developing world. In small cities. data and information to guide policy are largely absent. local resources to tackle development challenges are limited. and governance and institutional capacities are weak. requiring serious efforts in capacity building. novel applications of remote sensing. information. and decision support techniques. and new institutional partnerships. While'megacities' with more than 10 million inhabitants have distinctive challenges. their contribution to global urban growth will remain comparatively small.Energy-wise. the world is already predominantly urban.

The nature of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from cities is not well understood in Asia. In fact. municipal policies to reduce energy consumption bring multiple benefits to the community. It helps to solve air pollution and traffic congestion. and also facilitates the reduction of CO2 emissions. Energy management at city level was neither a priority nor an important issue until recently because energy related decisions are made at the national level.

1216322,Paradigm shifts in the international housing debate and its local implications for Surakarta’s approaches on housing the poor,2015,C Obermayr and W Astuti,,"Proceeding od 13 th International Asian Unbanization Conference, UGM",,,,Since the first international conference on Human Settlements in 1976. Habitat I. governments have begun to understand the need for sustainable human settlements in the face of rapid urbanisation. The goal to provide adequate housing for all has remained one of the main challenges for the international development agenda and the debate on sound housing policies was characterised by manifold paradigm shifts over the last 40 years. On the local level. these changes are reflected in shifting strategies and programs in housing delivery systems to overcome slum-and squatter settlements and the housing backlog. In the case of Surakarta. an Indonesian city in Central Java. different strategies were established. Supply-based strategies. eg public housing and housing capital subsidies. as well as demand-based strategies. such as relocation policies for squatter areas and slum-upgrading measures. are increasingly changing towards more comprehensive approaches based on self-help and community empowerment.Firstly. this paper explores these changing paradigms on housing policies for low-income people and secondly the shifting housing strategies in the city of Surakarta.

1216344,Using multi-criteria analysis to identify suitable light rail transit route,2006,A Ludin and SNHM Latip,,Map Asia,,,,Public transportation planning and development are undergoing continuous changes often prompted by both external factors and policy-directed responses. The role of public transit. particularly rail transit. becomes increasingly importance with the changing demographic and economic pattern. The trend of returning to urban living for eg has significantly increased the demand for efficient public transportation in urban centres. However. the design and development of Light Rail Transit (LRT) route seldom takes into consideration land use changes and demand. This paper investigates how non-spatial and spatial data can be integrated within a multi criteria decision framework to formulate and evaluate land use development corridor to determine suitable route for LRT. A raster base multi-criteria analysis model was developed base on a set and specific objectives. criteria. indicator and data requirement. The set criteria and indicator proposed are in line with the objectives to improve public transportation as stipulated in the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan. A case study approach is undertaken within a selected LRT railroad in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia. The model. integrating GIS and external software. shows that suitable LRT alignment can be identified that take into account social. institutional and environmental objectives.

However. most often poor planning and displacement of land uses particularly in urban areas contribute to social ills such as drug abuse and criminal activities. This research explains the spatial relationship of drug abuse and other criminal activities on urban land use planning and their implications on the society at large. Spatial statistics was used to show patterns. trends and spatial relationships of crimes and land use planning. Data on crime incidents were obtained from the Royal Malaysia Police Department whilst cases of drug abuse were collected from the National Anti-Drug Agency (AADK). Analysis of the data together with digital land use maps produced by Arnpang Jaya Municipal Council. showed the distribution of crime incidents and drug abuse in the area. Findings of the study also indicated that. there was a strong relationship between petty crimes. drng abuse and land use patterns.

This includes the ability of both technologies to be integrated in order to produce a better system of data management. Monitoring on green and recreation area is critically important to create an environment which is comfortable and suitable to live in especially in urban areas. The objective of this study is to determine new parameter and indicator in improving the existing planning and development guidelines for open space and linear network. Five residential areas in Majlis Perbandaran Johor Bahru Tengah are selected for this study. The scope of the study covers an evaluation using remotely sensed data on;(i) compliance of open space to planning standards;(ii) accessibility to open space;(iii) green density. and (iv) potential green connectors. The green area in the study area are detected and mapped by satellite image classification process. While. the densities of green and built-up area are determined using remote sensing analysis model. ie the Normalized Difference Green Red Vegetation Index (NDGRVI). In addition. the classified images were effectively integrated with GIS technology to assist in the designing and managing databases which are then displayed graphically. The final results of the study can be divided into two; firstly. the assessment on the compliance of planning standards during submission of layout plan and the compliance of the standards after the residential area has been built.

It utilized a structured questionnaire for this purpose. The result of the analysis of this questionnaire reveals among other things that. greater percentage of the people in the study areas spend above 30% of their monthly income on housing. This is at variance with the 30% affordability benchmark set by scholars such as Andrew (1998). Cox and Pavletich 2010) as well as Adedeji (2006). The paper therefore concludes that the greater percentage of the people in the study area cannot afford adequate housing while others pay not just over 30% but over 50% of their monthly income on housing which is cost-burden. This has adverse effect on their standard of living as what is left is insufficient to cater for other needs such as food. clothing. and medical bills and so on.

This paper looks at the missing link between land use planning and urban growth. and it implications for environmental sustainability in a selected sub Saharan Africa city of Kaduna. Nigeria. We assessed urban growth from historical GIS data of the city to evaluate the urban expansion. At the same time. regression analysis was used to established relationship between carbon emission and traffic volume in the city. A city characterized by weak land use planning has created a gap leading to uncoordinated land use planning and uncontrolled physical growth. A steady increase of built up area of 8.400.31 hectares in 1982 to an area of 17.120.5 hectares in 2015 can be a reflection of the presence of uncontrolled urban expansion. The lack of coordination between land use planning and urban growth has resulted to environmental ills within the city. One among the ills. is ubiquitous traffic congestion within the city leading to high carbon (CO2) emission. Findings shows a strong connection between emission and volume of traffic. In addition to findings. is the decline of green areas in the city. By this findings. it is suggested that the modern concept of land use planning which embraces flexibility. public participation and integration of environmental issues should be entrenched and allow to take the lead in the process of urban growth.,True,9_h8pSIAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,7,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/181,4205616098883849726,/scholar?cites=4205616098883849726,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/181/98,0,0,0

South-Eastern Nigeria Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques,2011,Fanan Ujoh and Olarewaju O Ifatimehin and Adams Ndalai Baba,6,"Confluence Journal of Environmental Science, Kogi State University, Anyigba, Nigeria",,,,Since 1991 when it became the capital city of Abia State. Umuahia has undergone tremendous transformation in its land use and land cover due to rapid urbanization. The main materials employed for this study are a land use map (1991) and Landsat ETM+satellite image (2007) of the study area. These. combined with field survey/checks. were brought into a GIS environment using ILWIS 3.2 Academic image classification software to map the land use/land cover and to estimate the rate of urban expansion and loss of rural land at the periurban fringes of Umuahia between 1991 and 2007. The study revealed significant changes in land use types over the period of study. It was observed that while built-up area and vacant landuse types increased over the study period. agricultural land and vegetation depreciated significantly. This development raises concerns. given the rate of deforestation and loss of cultivable land in the study area. Although other environmental and ecological problems such as increased runoff/flash floods. soil erosion and pollution of surface and underground water are identified as being caused by urban expansion. there is the need for further inquiry/investigation. It is suggested that urban planning authorities and policy makers develop policies that would de-emphasize/curtail urban land consumption rate. and create an environment that would conserve agricultural land and vegetation at the peri-urban fringes of Umuahia.,True,9_h8pSIAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,7,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.948.7613&rep=rep1&type=pdf,35363625010249058,/scholar?cites=35363625010249058,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.948.7613&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The HSA can be used to identify. examine and address the challenges and challenges of sustainable housing development in Nigeria based on the core tenets of sustainability; society. economy and environment and the twin concepts of needs and limitation. The study identified that the numerous challenges facing housing provision in Nigeria are largely due to poverty. redundant housing policies and financial bottlenecks. Others include high cost of building materials. lack of financial instrument for building construction projects as well as the palpable lack of innovative building technologies. This is in addition to uncontrolled development. poor maintenance culture and social infrastructure. Despite of these challenges. the authors posit sustainable housing provision has numerous prospects for the future. Consequently. effective provision of housing in Nigeria will spur sustainable socio-economic leading to enhanced well-being of the society.

Access to formal land and shelter is put out of reach of low-income earners who have little or no choice but to end up living in unintended settlements. illegal. poorly. and haphazardly constructed structures. within the urban centres and sometimes at the urban fringes including poor access to basic infrastructure. This research carried out an assessment of land development and planning regulation in Lokoja. Nigeria by comparing formal and non-formal residential land developments. The study employed qualitative methods of data collection with information drawn from 15 respondents. Results from field measurement and interviews were analysed using ATLAS ti and presented using the descriptive method. Findings from the study revealed that residential land development is non-formal due to exclusion of low-income earners in accessing formal land. The officials involved in the land administration have weak institutional capacity to check and control land development effectively. Furthermore. lack of political will to develop a concise framework that is workable and inclusive limits the ability of major land developers to comply fully with the planning standards and regulations.

Physical developmental processes are considered as inducing climate change. which in turn adversely exposes humanity to significant risk. In this study. the influence of climate change on social infrastructure and socioeconomic growth in a less developed country (LDC). like Nigeria. was examined. Nigeria currently is the fastest urbanizing. most populous and largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. Infrastructural developments in Nigeria since independence in 1960. till date. are based on low energy efficient technologies. Empirical observations signpost a nexus between climate change and social infrastructure and its impacts on socioeconomic growth and development. Consequently. based on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda. this paper examines the link between climate change and infrastructural development. Furthermore. the study presents practical strategies required to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change on current and future infrastructural developments. The solutions proffered in the paper are anchored on Development. Adaptation and Mitigation (DAM) approach and Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP). The findings demonstrated that climate change not only affects social infrastructural development but also the socio-economic growth and sustainable development especially in Less Developing Countries (LDCs) like Nigeria.

The origin of these different traditional building body associates with the natural materials availability to the local builders as well as religious belief. cultural and taboos. The advent of colonialism in Nigeria changed the traditional life and culture of Nigerian which creates a weak connection between traditional architecture and contemporary architecture in Nigeria. Most recent buildings designs across Hausa regions in Nigeria have been built with imported materials and the construction techniques tailored to satisfy the modernity self-ego and aspirations. Thus. traditional architecture ought not to be abandoned and forgotten. hence; experts’ awareness should be tailored to the understanding of its original essence.

This paper looks at the missing link between land use planning and urban growth. and it implications for environmental sustainability in a selected sub Saharan Africa city of Kaduna. Nigeria. We assessed urban growth from historical GIS data of the city to evaluate the urban expansion. At the same time. regression analysis was used to established relationship between carbon emission and traffic volume in the city. A city characterized by weak land use planning has created a gap leading to uncoordinated land use planning and uncontrolled physical growth. A steady increase of built up area of 8.400.31 hectares in 1982 to an area of 17.120.5 hectares in 2015 can be a reflection of the presence of uncontrolled urban expansion. The lack of coordination between land use planning and urban growth has resulted to environmental ills within the city. One among the ills. is ubiquitous traffic congestion within the city leading to high carbon (CO2) emission. Findings shows a strong connection between emission and volume of traffic. In addition to findings. is the decline of green areas in the city. By this findings. it is suggested that the modern concept of land use planning which embraces flexibility. public participation and integration of environmental issues should be entrenched and allow to take the lead in the process of urban growth.,True,qcKIazsAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,7,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/181,4205616098883849726,/scholar?cites=4205616098883849726,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/181/98,0,0,0

There have been challenges encountered by the planners. landscape architects and allied professionals towards improving the physical quality of Oja in recent time. Plethora of relevant literatures revealed persistence advocacy necessary to improve the physical quality of Oja in diverse forms. However. fewer studies have attempted to explore the residents’ contributions to its improvement through community efforts initiatives in South-west region of Nigeria. Consequently. this research explored the factors responsible to improvement on the physical quality of Oja through residents’ collective opinion efforts. The qualitative method was adopted for the study through focus group interview comprising thirty-five (n= 35) Hausa. Ibo. and Yoruba participants. The decision extracts from the deliberations were analysed using content analysis and QSR (10) Nvivo software. Research findings revealed that Oja physical quality could be improved upon through residents’ opinions and views as supportive mechanisms to government initiative drives. This research suggests joint collaboration efforts between governments; stake holders and community residents towards improvement of Oja. It is therefore recommended that residents’ participation and opinions in decision making concerning Oja could further enhance the physical condition towards higher satisfaction in Nigeria.

This current study fills the gap by examining the adolescents’ sense of community through a quantitative survey via appraisal of the quality of community playground. emotional connection and effects of their participation in playground activities on ameliorating the delinquents’ behavior and social vices. Completed survey questionnaires retrieved from a total number of 69 purposive respondents who are adolescents from three towns and analyzed through relative importance index (RII) via Likert scale. Results from the analysis indicated that adolescents’ positive attitudinal changes and reduction in social vices and delinquent’s behavior could be achieved through their involvements in quality and well-equipped playgrounds. Similarly. the significant role of sense of community in enhancing adolescent social participation in playground activities contributes to a major role in increasing their social well-being and togetherness. Thus. the study recommends appropriate future planning. design. and management of neighborhood …,True,qcKIazsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,3,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/179,6260171680221621334,/scholar?cites=6260171680221621334,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53172714/My_publication_Adolescent_sense_of_community.pdf,0,0,0

Recent developments in the field of built environment have led to an interest in exploring the perception of neighbourhood open spaces and its impact on the sense of community of residents. There are numerous types of open spaces in the Nigerian neighbourhood environment such as the market square. sports and playground areas. streets space. public plazas. and town parks. This study focuses on the market square known as oja. which remains a significant character in the context of Nigerian rural neighbourhood spaces. Currently. there has been little effort in the exploration of the significance of oja towards achieving harmonious social relationship among residents of diverse ethnicity.

This paper attempts to review the variance between urban greenery. urban development and the quest for environmental sustainability. A critical review of relevant materials related to the study was carried out. The quantitative nature of the study was backed empirically. Findings from the study reveal that physical development plans for some urban areas have been very ad-hoc and loosely defined. Allocation of open green spaces is not in harmony with the urban population and it mostly characterized by a low percentage. Abuja master plan. for instance. has the highest allocation of 32.87%. while allocation in other master plans fall below 30% with Suleja master plan counts 2.5% only. Outdated master plan and the lack of will power from urban authority in plan implementation has often resulted in the distortion. encroachment. and conversion of green areas to other land uses. Increase carbon emission and pollution especially from the transport sector has been marked by a decline in greenery. Therefore. reducing the sequestration capacity of the urban area. weak urban planning and harsh climatic condition could be regarded as critical challenges. This study suggests the strict adherent to sustainable urban planning that integrates physical development and environmental consideration to enhance greenery. The study also recommends the placement of urban greenery on the same platform with the urban grey infrastructure by urban stakeholders.,True,vvQNar8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,5,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/211,10419225160532045829,/scholar?cites=10419225160532045829,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/211/106,0,0,0

In relation to flood control. over the years. most attention has been given on the use of structural and non-structural approaches. Thus. this study adopts a qualitative phenomenological approach. using Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and semi-structured interviews to explore indigenous knowledge for flood disaster risk reduction in Kaduna floodplain. The data generated was analysed using Nvivo 11 software. The analysis of the FGDs revealed that the major flood adaptation strategy in Kaduna is community work. The analysis also revealed that waste dumping in drainages was found to be the major environmental problem. This is related to community work involving local drainage construction. which causes blockages. Additionally. solutions were proposed for the effective use of indigenous flood adaptation strategies. in which public enlightenment was proposed as the means of resolving major waste dumping in local drainages. In addition. it was found in the analysis of the interviews that the major indigenous flood early warning signs identified in Kaduna floodplain are by the weather such as continuous downpour. black thick cloud and position of clouds. These are not based on meteorological stations but on past experiences of living with flood disaster in the floodplain of Kaduna.

It helps generating the economic and social values and promoting a healthy lifestyle for local community. The aim of the study is to audit the green spaces in Pasir Gudang Municipality and promote the strategies to improve the use of green space in the study area towards better quality of life of the citizens. The study classifies the existing green spaces in Pasir Gudang in terms of size. function. use. quality. area. accessibility and facilities provided in the green space areas. Two key points have been identified as a basic reference before any development of green spaces take place in Pasir Gudang. The study reveals that present green space areas in Pasir Gudang Municipality are able to serve most communities in the municipality. However. still about 35% of the municipality area is not presently served by the existing green spaces. Thus quantity. quality and accessibility of the green space areas need improvement. This study also shows the potential network of the access that will be able to improve the approachability of all existing green space areas by the citizens to contribute to their quality of life.,True,AS5z_RsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,https://www.planningmalaysia.org/index.php/pmj/article/view/115,12545744436359678099,/scholar?cites=12545744436359678099,,https://www.planningmalaysia.org/index.php/pmj/article/download/115/113,0,0,0

While studies on the extent of impervious surface are common in advanced countries. few have been carried out in developing countries. This paper discusses a study on the nature of impervious surface coverage in a southern city in Malaysia. The study focuses on impervious surface in several residential areas. looking at the relationship between impervious surface and housing density as well as the source of the surface. Remote sensing images combined with some GIS techniques were employed for this purpose. The percentage o [impervious surface measured ranged from 40-95%. well above the values indicated from similar studies overseas. While density was a factor in the amount of impervious surface. it was not the only factor. Other factors such as policies on impervious surface control were also important as illustrated by comparison of the results of this study to similar studies reported in the USA.

As a consequence. the changes disturbed the quality of natural environment and ecosystem. Historical experience and prediction of future land use and land cover change is important to understand the spatial characteristics and environmental consequences of development area. Evaluating the spatiotemporal in urban development is essential as an important component improving adaptive management in landscape planning. Thus. the objective of this paper is to discuss the spatiotemporal land use and land cover change in major river basins (Sungai Tebrau. Sungai Skudai. Sungai Pulai and Coastal Zone) in the rapid development region of Iskandar Malaysia. The past experience indicates rapid growth of population and substantial urban development changed the spatial structure of the region and there is tremendous transformation of land use and land cover in the present due to high demand for development.

1216423,SERVICE OF NOTICE FOR DETERMINATION IN CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS,2011,WANMIBIN IBRAHIM,,,,,,Determination is a remedy provided under contract for a party to discharge his obligations upon breach by the other party. When the party to contract intends to determine a contract. he must let the other party knows his intention to do so. He is required to follow several procedures before he is said to determine the contract validly. Standard forms and bespoke construction contracts usually provide procedures for parties to contract to do so. Failure to adhere to the procedures may cause the termination invalid and the repercussions of such failure is severe and of serious consequences to the determining party. When one party exercises his intention to determine a contract. the other party often seeks to destroy his intention by claiming non compliance to procedural requirement for valid exercise of determination under the contract. One party argues that he has followed the required procedures for service of notice and the other party claims otherwise. This has led to numerous arguments and disputes between the parties often end with arbitrations or litigations. The arbitrators and courts are not helping either as decisions have not been consistent depending on how one construes the ambiguous words. The underlying matter is the interpretation adopted by arbitrators and courts in construing the ambiguous words. There are two commonest methods of interpretations used by arbitrators and courts in construing commercial contracts; by literal method or commonsense business method.

1216426,Paving of Malaysian Greenfields: The Amount of Residential Impervious Surface and Factors Influencing It,,M Rafee Majid and Wan Yusryzal Wan Ibrahim and Misariah Halili,,,,,,Arnold & Gibbons [1] defined impervious surfaces as any material covering the ground that prevents infiltration of water into the soil. Impervious surface is not a single homogeneous quantity but when used as a landscape indicator it is typically presented as a percentage of the land that is covered with impervious materials. The word imperviousness is also regularly used to refer to the extent of this percentage. Different types of surfaces such as paved surfaces (roads. parking lots. sidewalks. etc.) and building rooftops fall unambiguously under the definition of impervious surface while there are also other surfaces. man-made and natural. that are so heavily compacted as to be functionally impervious. Examples of these are compacted soil in construction areas. dirt roads. bedrock outcrops and. even to a certain extent. grass turf in residential areas.It is a fact that urbanization carries with it a series of environmental concerns such as water and air pollution as well as increase in temperature and occurrence of flash floods. On many occasions have these been linked to the extent of impervious surface. an indicator that defines urbanization. As development alters the natural landscape. the percentage of land covered by impervious surface too increases. Increase in urban impervious surface has been identified by many studies as an important contributor to water pollution. urban heat island. flash floods and other environmental degradations [2. 3. 4. 1].,True,AS5z_RsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/2731679/PavingofMalaysianGreenfields_MRafeeMajid.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/2731679/PavingofMalaysianGreenfields_MRafeeMajid.pdf,0,0,0

Eight Millennium Development Goals were formulated of which the eradication of poverty given top priority. However. Malaysia's participation with the UN in dealing with poverty. precede this when it committed itself with the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) programme. which was then reinforced when the Millennium Declaration was made in 2000. Nationally. poverty eradication as well as bridging the inequality gap among the major ethnic groups and states has been the main development goal in Malaysia's development agenda since independence. In this regards. the principle of â€ œgrowth with equity has been the central theme in all Malaysia's development policies and efforts since independence. Although Malaysia has made significant achievements in reducing the incidence of aggregate poverty across the country from 8.9% in 1995 down to 1.7% in 2012. there still exist pockets of poverty in the rural areas. in certain states/regions and among ethnic groups. as well as in some urban areas. This shows that formulating planning and policy implementation to eradicate poverty now needs to be more spatially focused for the implementation to be more effective. Recognising the incidence of poverty through standard statistical data tables alone is no longer adequate in formulating planning and policy implementation.

Although the number of earthquakes remains fairly unchanged. the loss of properties and human lives in recent periods has increased manifolds due to increasing concentration of human population and urbanisation in earthquake-prone areas. Recent improvement in documentations and computational facilities. however. allows for the preparation of seismic microzonation maps of such areas for urban planning and earthquake mitigation purposes. This paper discusses the development of seismic microzonation maps for Banda Aceh which lies close to the Sumatra Subduction Zone and the Sumatran Transform Faults. making the city extremely vulnerable to earthquake hazards. The development of the maps employs Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques that make use of several layers of parameters influencing earthquake hazards such as seismological data. faults. tsunami. etc. and site characteristic data such as soil type. groundwater distribution and depth. geological and geophysical data. The seismic microzonation maps incorporate various seismic hazard maps including ground shaking hazard map. liquefaction susceptibility hazard map. landslide potential hazard map. surface faulting hazard map and tsunami hazard map.

Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Several countries. including Malaysia. have set a long term target of establishing a more educated workforce. This thrust on the massification of higher education has resulted in a new problem-graduate unemployment. The growing problem of graduate unemployment in Malaysia is widely debated in the media and blogs. The Higher Education Ministry. in its Graduate Tracer Study Report 2011. reported that 24 per cent of them have not found a job after six months of graduating. The employment scenario of the urban planning graduates has changed over the years from catering the needs of the public sector. to catering the needs of the private sector and to fulfilling the need of the One Stop Centre or the OSC. The advent of the liberalization of urban planning services challenges urban planning schools in Malaysia to produce planners not only to cater for local needs but also with the capability of exporting their skills and services internationally. Given the diverse scope of urban planning it is a paradox that graduates of urban planning should converge on the conventional urban planning organizations for employment.

As developing nations in the world aspire to meet the vision 20: 2020. it is imperative that whatever economic approach. model or strategy adopted must not be at the expense of the welfare of the citizens. In western industrialised world. privatisation is used to improve the lives of citizens where market competition in the provisions of goods and services thrive for the benefit of an egalitarian and equitable society. However. the outcomes of privatisation in most developing countries are not as intended. as the social costs far supersede its benefits. owing to some reasons the paper is out to discuss. As a conceptual paper with discussions based predominantly on secondary data sources cum literature. this paper seeks to explain the socio-inequality and poverty laden outcomes of privatisation policy of service delivery of electricity in Nigeria. Privatisation policy has been claimed to adversely impinged the welfare of the populace. making the poor. poorer. Based on identified theoretical gap of non-harmonising policies with actual situation on ground. this paper argues that the issues of social inequality are occasioned by privatisation policy. and identifies the shortcomings of this approach to service delivery of electricity.

Reducing energy consumption in cities through various controlling strategies has significant impact on the conservation of natural resources and environment. Residential density and floor area to land ratio has been used as key parameters in development control tools towards creating harmonious urban development. However no attempt has been made to employ them to lower residential energy consumption. This study attempts to demonstrate the possibility of using residential density and floor area to land ratio as passive parameters to reduce non-transportation energy consumption at household level. The analysis was based on questionnaire survey of nontransportation energy consumption viz. energy for lighting. thermal comfort and cooking purposes at household level in Bandung City. Indonesia. The result shows that non-transportation energy consumption perceptibly associates with the two parameters of development control with a u-shape pattern ie the correlation has one lowest point with higher trends at both ends. This finding is important for urban planners in formulating strategies towards lower consumption of non-transportation energy in tropical cities and consequently contributing to better-off urban environment.,True,9mSPPsUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://planningmalaysia.org/index.php/pmj/article/view/SI-2-6,,,,https://planningmalaysia.org/index.php/pmj/article/download/118/116,0,0,0

Although the number of earthquakes remains fairly unchanged. the loss of properties and human lives in recent periods has increased manifolds due to increasing concentration of human population and urbanisation in earthquake-prone areas. Recent improvement in documentations and computational facilities. however. allows for the preparation of seismic microzonation maps of such areas for urban planning and earthquake mitigation purposes. This paper discusses the development of seismic microzonation maps for Banda Aceh which lies close to the Sumatra Subduction Zone and the Sumatran Transform Faults. making the city extremely vulnerable to earthquake hazards. The development of the maps employs Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques that make use of several layers of parameters …,True,9mSPPsUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/58127196/Planning_Malaysia_-_Seismic_Microzonation_Paper.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/58127196/Planning_Malaysia_-_Seismic_Microzonation_Paper.pdf,0,0,0
1216440,Iskandar Malaysia’s Neighbourhood Design and Its Low Carbon City Vision,,M Rafee Majid and Anis Shazreen Azmi and Abdul Razak Jaffar and Noordini Che Man,,,,,,Parallel to the main agenda of the Conference of Parties 21 (COP21) in Paris in 2015. Malaysia has committed itself to reduce carbon emission targeting to limit the temperature rise by 2o Celsius or lower. In spite of all the efforts to promote sustainable development in Malaysia. however. limited research has been carried out about the sustainability of neighbourhood design. particularly in the Iskandar Regional Development region or better known as Iskandar Malaysia. By examining the trend of the Region’s neighbourhood residential density gradient. the paper aims to show if in reality the neighbourhoods’ design was in line with the Region’s Low Carbon City Vision. A study was conducted on 133 neighbourhoods within the Region based on secondary data and semi-structured interviews with the developers. planning consultants and planning officers. The residential density analysis was conducted using ArcGIS10. The results of the study were able to show the mismatch between the vision and reality. The results showed that the higher the residential density the greater the distance to the commercial centres; meaning longer travelling distance and higher carbon emitted to the atmosphere. Planning experts pointed to the economic objectives of the developments as the main reason for this unacceptable scenario. and that the design of the neighbourhoods did nothing to mitigate climate change due to the higher dependency on private vehicles. Finally. the paper suggests a review into the design approach of the neighbourhood to ensure that the Region’s vision of becoming a low carbon city could become a reality.

Universitas Sebelas Maret,Nowadays the development of the cities are more and more rapid and complex as in Surakarta City. The problem of physical development occurs in Surakarta City especially in in the southern of the city where massive physical development is underway. It causes deferent levels of urban compactness inside the city. The deference enables movement from an area with low level urban compactness to higher level urban compactness because the area provide sophisticated facilities. Then compact city concept concerning with centralizing the development of area rises. The concept can decrease the conversion of vacant land by intensifying the land use through mixed land use that has the goal in reducing movement. Meanwhile urban compactness is a methodological approach to measure the level of compactness based on the concept of compact city. The objective of this research is to find out the correlation between the levels of urban compactness with the patterns of population movement. This research is conducted at functional border of the city of administrative border of Surakarta City. The method to determine the level of urban compactness is by scoring three variables. They are density. mixed land use. and transportation and connectivity. On the other hand. the patterns of population movement are viewed from mileage variable. movement spreads variable. movement time and transportation modes that are seen from five movement purposes consisting of working. studying. shopping. health. and recreation or entertainment.

To map pore pressure around the mega-splay fault and plate boundary décollement. we integrate the high-resolution WT velocities with laboratory data and borehole well log data using rock physics theory. The predicted pore pressure distribution shows that high pore pressures (close to lithostatic pressure) along the footwall of the mega-splay fault extend seaward to the trough region. and the normalized pore pressure ratio is nearly constant over that extent. This continuity of the overpressured zone indicates that a coseismic rupture can potentially propagate nearly to the trough axis.

However. recent studies have demonstrated that higher modes contain useful information for improving the inverted S-wave velocity model. In this study. we propose two inversion methods that consider higher modes by using the amplitude response of each mode. which can avoid mode misidentification in the spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method. One method is to compare the observed phase velocities by the extended spatial autocorrelation (ESPAC) method with the effective phase velocities calculated from theoretical dispersion curves and the amplitude responses of each mode. In the other method. SPAC coefficients are fit directly by comparing theoretical SPAC coefficients determined from dispersion curves and amplitude responses with the observed ones.

We found the technique of window-controlled CMPCC analysis. which applies two kinds of spatial windows to further improve the lateral resolution of CMPCC analysis. First. a spatial weighting function given by the number of crosscorrelation pairs is applied to CMPCC gathers. Because the number of crosscorrelation pairs is concentrated near the CMP. the lateral resolution in extracting dispersion curves on CMPs can be improved. Second. crosscorrelation pairs with longer receiver spacing are excluded to further improve lateral resolution.

Japan. has a large potential to generate megathrust earthquakes in the near future. To investigate the temporal variation of stress or strain in the Nankai subduction zone. we estimated the temporal variation of seismic velocity by using cross-correlations of ambient noise in the frequency range 0.7–2.0 Hz. which was dominated by ACR waves. recorded by the DONET offshore seismic network from 1 October 2014 to 30 November 2017. The 1 April 2016 Off-Mie earthquake (MW 5.9) and its aftershocks occurred beneath the seismic network. Our results document a clear decrease in seismic velocity at the time of the earthquake. These coseismic velocity drops were correlated with peak ground velocities at each station. suggesting that dynamic stress changes due to strong ground motions are a primary factor in coseismic velocity variations. Differences in the sensitivity of seismic velocity changes to peak ground velocity may reflect subsurface conditions at each station. such as geological structures and effective pressure conditions. We also observed a long-term increase in seismic velocities. independent of the 2016 earthquake. that may reflect tectonic strain accumulation around the Nankai subduction zone. After removing the long-term trend. we found that the coseismic velocity drops had not completely recovered by the end of the observation period. possibly indicating nonlinear effects of the 2016 earthquake.

Many earthquakes occur in this area. but much of the activity has been relatively recent. so the fault distribution has yet to be fully clarified. Here. we used continuous ambient noise data from a dense seismic network. deployed from November 2009 to extract Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data between station pairs. and then applied a direct surface wave inversion to the phase velocities of each station pair to determine a three-dimensional S-wave velocity model.

Rayleigh wave anisotropy is estimated by array analysis of 102 teleseismic events that occurred between 2007 and 2014. The frequency variation of the estimated azimuthal anisotropy indicates depth variation of the seismic anisotropy within the crust: (1) north‐south fast velocity direction around the upper crust and (2) trench‐normal fast velocity direction in the deeper crust. We also conduct a time‐lapse analysis of Rayleigh wave anisotropy to demonstrate the stability of the estimated anisotropy in time and to estimate possible changes in seismic anisotropy associated with the 2011 Tohoku‐oki earthquake.

Low‐frequency Rayleigh waves (0.25–1 Hz) show diurnal variations and a dominant back azimuth related to the wind direction in a nearby area. Low‐frequency signals that are derived mainly from wind may be sensitive to subsurface structure deeper than the lithological boundary derived from an autocorrelation analysis.

Surface-wave tomography has been widely applied to obtain high-resolution maps of phase or group velocity from dispersion curves between pairs of stations in seismological studies. However. very few studies have done surface-wave tomography with active-source (exploration) seismic data. probably because extracting surface-wave dispersion curves between two stations is difficult due to the complex wave propagation in heterogeneous near-surface structures.

The rock shows weak orthotropy which was altered from transverse isotropy (TI) generated by biotite-preferred orientation. The orthotropy was caused by microfolding in the rock. The velocity increase under confining pressure indicates that most crack planes are aligned parallel to the cleavage planes (silicate sheet) of the oriented biotite minerals. The anisotropy of the rock is basically TI due to both the aligned biotite minerals and cracks. which have a common symmetry axis. We found that other sheet silicate-rich rocks have a similar anisotropy with the biotite schist. in which the TI-type anisotropy is characterized by the slow P- and S-wave velocities along the symmetry axis. This is caused by the preferred orientation of sheet silicate minerals and the extremely slow P- and S-wave …,True,ro6tUgoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,27,https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-abstract/182/1/375/562921,14920908042679368451,/scholar?cites=14920908042679368451,,https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/182/1/375/562921,0,0,0

This restriction. and association restrictions on source‐receiver geometries. are overcome by applying inverse techniques that operate in the frequency‐space domain. In order to incorporate the rigorous modelling technique of finite differences into the inverse procedure a nonlinear approach is used. To reduce computational costs the method of finite differences is applied directly to the frequency‐domain wave equation.

Such closely spaced data are potentially amenable to multi-channel techniques involving wavefield propagation methods. such as those commonly used in reflection data processing. However. the wide-angle configuration requires techniques capable of handling very general wave types. including those not commonly used in reflection seismology. This is a situation analogous to that faced in cross-borehole seismics. where similar wave types are also recorded. In a real cross-borehole example. we compare pre-stack migration. traveltime tomography and wavefield inversion.

In the frequency domain. the integral terms are easily represented by complex valued elastic media properties. There are further significant advantages to using the frequency domain if the forward or the inverse problem requires modeling or inverting a large number of prestack source gathers. Numerical modeling is expensive for seismic data because of the large number of wavelenghths typically separating sources from receivers. which results in a need for a large number of grid points.

Wave‐theoretical methods require the ability to forward‐model appropriate wave equations for all source positions in arbitrary reference media. This can be achieved using a frequency‐domain elastic wave propagator that facilitates the modelling of multi‐source data at the cost of temporal bandwidth. The trade‐off is deliberate; the propagator is applied to the cross‐hole imaging problem. in which wide spatial bandwidths are more important than temporal bandwidth.

Full‐wave 2-D inversion schemes are of limited utility even in 2-D media because they do not model 3-D dynamics correctly. Many seismic experiments effectively assume that the geology varies in two dimensions only but generate 3-D (point source) wavefields; that is. they are “two‐and‐one‐half‐dimensional” (2.5-D). and this configuration can be exploited to model 3-D propagation efficiently in such media.

In the exploration industry. AVO analyses are particularly suitable for the detection and mapping of gas zones since reservoirs often consist of shale with high Poisson’s ratio (high ) overlying gas bearing sands with low Poisson’s ratio (low ). If the gas sand has lower impedance than the overlying shale. the magnitude of the reflection coefficient will increase with increasing angle of incidence or offset. Other combinations of rock types will also show a similar increase in magnitude. such as shale over hard limestone. but the sign of the reflection coefficient will be positive in most of these cases …,True,GqTT0iMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,66,https://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/1.1443504,1345115200664483162,/scholar?cites=1345115200664483162,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.912.9734&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Data from the 2012 survey (61 kt of CO2). show further growth and migration of the amplitude anomaly interpreted to be induced by the CO2 injection. The anomaly is similar in shape to that obtained from the 2009 survey. but significantly stronger and larger by ∼150 m in the N–S direction and by ∼200 m in the E–W direction.

Based on high-resolution reflection seismic data along two parallel seismic profiles. potential field modeling has been carried out and two geologic cross sections have been constructed that are consistent with the available geophysical data as well as surface geologic observations.

These lakes and their surrounding waters support over 2.000 species of cichlid fish. many of which are descended from a single common ancestor within the past 10 Ma. The extraordinary East African cichlid diversity is intricately linked to the highly variable geologic and paleoclimatic history of this region. Greater than 10 Ma. the western arm of the East African rift system began to separate. thereby creating a series of rift basins that would come to contain several water bodies. including the extremely deep Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi. Uplifting associated with this rifting backponded many rivers and created the extremely large. but shallow Lake Victoria. Since their creation. the size. shape. and existence of these lakes have changed dramatically which has. in turn. significantly influenced the evolutionary history of the lakes' cichlids.

Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in the tropics and is currently a biogeographic barrier between the eastern and western branches of the East African Rift. The lake has previously desiccated at ~17 ka and again at ~15 ka. but little is known from this region prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The Pleistocene terrestrial deposits on the northeast coast of Lake Victoria (94 to 36 ka) are ideal for paleoenvironmental reconstructions where volcaniclastic deposits (tuffs). fluvial deposits. tufa. and paleosols are exposed. which can be used to reconstruct Critical Zones (CZ) of the past (paleo-CZs). The paleo-CZ is a holistic concept that reconstructs the entire landscape using geologic records of the atmosphere. hydrosphere. lithosphere. biosphere. and pedosphere (the focus of this study). New paleosol-based mean annual precipitation (MAP) proxies from Karungu.

Sandstone petrography from each of the five members of the Hornbrook Formation indicates a variable source region with elements from basement uplift. transitional continent. recycled orogen. and dissected arc sources. A conglomerate clast count from the Klamath River Conglomerate member is broadly consistent with sandstone petrography. but yielded more quartzite and fewer volcanic clasts than the sand-sized fraction. This reflects the different susceptibility to weathering and diagenesis of these rock types. Likewise. Klamath River Conglomerate quartzite clasts contain a Precambrian detrital zircon age distribution very similar to that found in the Antelope Mountain Quartzite within the Yreka subterrane of the Eastern Klamath Mountains. but these Precambrian ages are absent in the sandstone sample from the same member. This discrepancy suggests that the quartzite was not broken down into sand-sized grains during transport but rocks from plutonic arc sources were disaggregated. In addition. detrital zircon age spectra from sandstones throughout the strata of the Hornbrook Formation clearly show that the provenance of the Hornbrook Formation changed with time and was not limited to the Klamath Mountains. contrary to past assumptions.

Lake Victoria has desiccated in the past at ~17 ka and at ~15 ka. but little is known about its history prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The Middle to Late Pleistocene deposits exposed on the shoreline of eastern Lake Victoria. which preserve abundant vertebrate fossils and Middle Stone Age (MSA) artifacts. are ideal for paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions to understand the effect of changing environment during the migration of early modern humans within and out of Africa. Measured stratigraphic sections reveal fluvial and tufa deposits that directly overlie Miocene paleotopography. The ages (94.0±3.3. 111.4±4.2. and 455±45 ka) of these tufa deposits demonstrate that spring-fed rivers were a recurrent. variably preserved feature on the Pleistocene landscape for ~360 kyr. but tufa precipitation abruptly ceased at ~94 ka. Above the riverine tufas. three well-exposed and laterally continuous paleosols with intercalated tuffs allow for reconstruction of modern soil properties and estimates of  mean annual precipitation (MAP). The oldest paleosol is a smectitic paleo-Vertisol with vertic features and saline and sodic properties that indicate seasonal precipitation. Higher in the section. the paleosols are tuffaceous paleo-Inceptisols with Alfisol-like soil characteristics (illuviated clay).

However. fractured aquifers are typically anisotropic. their transmissivity controlled by the conductive properties of faults and fractures. which are partially controlled by the in situ stress field. Faults at Yucca Mountain predominantly strike approximately north (azimuth~ 005). Slip and dilation tendency analysis of the region indicates that those faults and fractures ideally oriented for slip in the current stress field strike north-northeast (azimuth~ 025–030) and dip moderately to steeply. whereas those ideally oriented for dilation strike north-northeast (azimuth~ 025–030) and are vertical. Faults with favorable orientations for slip or dilation present potential fluid flow pathways. These observations imply anisotropic transmissivity at Yucca Mountain with an azimuthal direction of maximum transmissivity between 005 (based on dominant fault trend) and 030 (based on slip-and dilation-tendency constraints). Reinterpretation of data from a long-term aquifer pumping test on the eastern flank of Yucca Mountain indicates anisotropic transmissivity with a maximum principal transmissivity direction of approximately 030. This is consistent with anisotropic transmissivity controlled by faults and fractures active in the …,True,IL5rY4MAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C,205,https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/9/5/pdf/gt9905.pdf,15099225948832338435,/scholar?cites=15099225948832338435,,https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/9/5/pdf/gt9905.pdf,0,0,0

Texas,2008,David A Ferrill and Alan P Morris,92,AAPG bulletin,3,359-380,GeoScienceWorld,Normal faults in Cretaceous carbonates in the Balcones fault system provide important analogs for fault zone architecture and deformation in carbonate reservoirs worldwide. Mechanical layering is a fundamental control on carbonate fault zones. Relatively planar faults with low-displacement gradients develop in massive. strong. clay-poor limestones and dolomites. In less competent clay-rich strata. shale beds impede fault propagation. resulting in fault-related folding. and locally steep bedding dips. Faults in clay-poor massive limestones and dolomites tend to be steep (70 or more). whereas weaker. clay-rich limestones develop faults with shallower dips (60 or less). Fault zone rocks show evidence of cataclasis. cementation. deformation of cement by mechanical twinning and pressure solution. and multiple generations of cement with differing degrees of deformation. indicating contemporaneous cementation and …,True,IL5rY4MAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,172,https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/aapgbull/article/doi/10.1306/10290707066/132913/pages/remote-access-information,12704707479269419515,/scholar?cites=12704707479269419515,,,0,0,0

Corrugations appear to form from overlapping or en échelon fault arrays by two breakthrough mechanisms: lateral propagation of curved fault-tips and linkage by connecting faults. Both mechanisms include localized fault-parallel extension and eventual abandonment of relay ramps. These breakthrough mechanisms produce distinctive hanging wall and footwall geometries indicative of fault system evolution. From such geometries. we can estimate the positions of tilted relay ramps or ramp segments and ramp internal deformation in incompletely exposed or poorly imaged fault systems. We examine the evolution of normal fault corrugations at Fish Slough (California). Yucca Mountain (Nevada). and Pleasant Valley (Nevada). in the Basin and Range province. We discuss how evolution of the Pleasant Valley and Yucca Mountain systems relates to seismicity.

Probabilistic volcanic hazard models for future eruptions through the proposed repository depend heavily on our understanding of the spatial controls on volcano distribution at a variety of scales. On regional scales. Pliocene‐Quaternary volcano clusters are located east of the Bare Mountain fault. Extension has resulted in large‐scale crustal density contrast across the fault. and vents are restricted to low‐density areas of the hanging wall. Finite element modeling indicates that this crustal density contrast can result in transient pressure changes of up to 7 MPa at 40 km depth. providing a mechanism to generate partial melts in areas where mantle rocks are already close to their solidus.

Analog modeling is used to evaluate the sequence of structural evolution of pull-apart basins and factors that control their degree of structural asymmetry and geometry. Basin evolution. internal structure and overall symmetry are investigated for oblique releasing step angles and with varying rates of displacement between brittle and ductile crust on opposing sides of the strike-slip system. while maintaining relative rates between brittle crust on opposing sides of the basin. Pull-apart basin evolution is separated into three stages: incipient. early. and mature.

They are common on the surface of Mars and similar to features observed on Earth and other terrestrial bodies. Pit craters lack an elevated rim. ejecta deposits. or lava flows that are associated with impact craters or calderas. It is generally agreed that the pits are formed by collapse into a subsurface cavity or explosive eruption. Hypotheses regarding the formation of pit crater chains require development of a substantial subsurface void to accommodate collapse of the overlying material. Suggested mechanisms of formation include: collapsed lava tubes. dike swarms. collapsed magma chamber. substrate dissolution (analogous to terrestrial karst). fissuring beneath loose material. and dilational faulting.

This inequality may be due to fundamental differences between the rock type (marble versus limestone) and deformation temperatures (above and below 200°C) for samples used in technique calibration versus samples used in testing and application. A technique that was empirically derived from marble experimentally deformed at 200–800°C yields values of differential stress that are factors of 2 to 9 times larger than maximum differential stress measured during experimental deformation of limestone at low temperature (<200°C).

Crosslinked chitosan solution was synthesized by homogeneous reaction of medium molecular weight chitosan in aqueous acetic acid solution with glutaraldehyde as crosslinking agent. It was deposited on gold film by spin coating. Using SPR technique. the optical properties of crosslinked chitosan thin film before and after contacting with different concentration of Pb(II) ion in a range of 0.5–100 ppm had been obtained by fitting. The resonance angle shifted to lower value as the Pb(II) ion concentration increased. Changes in the resonance angle (Δθ) are directly proportional to the concentration of Pb(II) ion solution.

1216963,Mechanism of turbidity and hardness removal in hard water sources by using Moringa oleifera,2011,Muhammad Ridwan Fahmi and Nor Wahidatul Azura and Zainon Najib and Chan Ping Pang and Hamidin Nasrul,,,,,Asian Network for Scientific,The objective of this study was to describe the mechanism of simultaneous removal of hardness and background turbidity in hard water for drinking water purpose by using Moringa oleifera (MO) that extracted with 1.0 M sodium chloride solution (MO-NaCl). Raw water containing high concentration of hardness from Timah Tasoh Dam (Perlis. Malaysia) and synthetic water (turbid. hard. turbid and hard) were used in this study. The optimum turbidity removal efficiency of Timah Tasoh raw water. synthetic turbid water and synthetic turbid and hard water were approximately 80% which were attained at MO dosage of 15. 30 and 10 mg L-1. respectively. However. this optimum MO dosage was not applicable for hardness removal. The mechanism for turbidity removal by MO-NaCl was supposed to be adsorption and charge neutralization. with the adsorption isotherm following the Freundlich adsorption model. In addition. the mechanism for hardness removal in hard water seems to be adsorption that conforms to both Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models. Therefore. for hard water such as Timah Tasoh raw water and synthetic turbid and hard water. the MO-NaCl tends to adsorb hardness to form a netlike structure followed by turbidity removal through sweep coagulation mechanism. Hence. hardness and turbidity can be removed simultaneously by using MO-NaCl.,True,NYXazFcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,48,http://103.86.130.60/handle/123456789/14693,17399044664819992328,/scholar?cites=17399044664819992328,,http://103.86.130.60/bitstream/handle/123456789/14693/MECHANISM%20OF%20TURBIDITY%20N%20HARDNESS%20IN%20HARD%20WATER.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

In recent years. this phenomenon has been accelerated by human activities mainly by rural and urban development projects. This research integrates the GIS tools and multivariate regression analysis for landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM) in north of Iran. To map the landslide susceptibility. ten potential independent variables were selected as effectual factors. including geological formation. terrain elevation. terrain slope and aspect. proximity to roads. proximity to faults and proximity to main rivers. soil unit. land use and annual rainfall. A GIS-database was developed containing all variables for the study area. Previous records of landslides in the study area were mapped based on inventory reports. satellite image processing and field survey using handhold GPS. The slope. proximity to roads. elevation. aspect and soil units was found to be the most effective factors in landslides respectively. Five other factors had no significant effect on landslides in this region. Landslide susceptibility map was then generated based on multivariate regression equation in a raster GIS environment and classified in five susceptibility classes.

1217020,Long term investigation on sulphate resistance of aerated concrete containing palm oil fuel ash,2015,Fadzil Mat Yahaya and Khairunisa Muthusamy and Mohd Warid Hussin,11,ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,,2406-2411,,The increasing demand for natural sand supply by concrete industry and rising quantity of palm oil fuel ash. an environmentally polluting solid waste disposed by Malaysian palm oil industry has led to the innovation of aerated concrete containing palm oil fuel ash as partial sand replacement material. This lightweight concrete exhibits improvement in the compressive strength with the incorporation of 30% palm oil fuel ash. However. the long term experimental result of the strength and durability performance of this modified concrete is unavailable. This paper reports the one year result on strength performance of aerated concrete containing palm oil fuel ash when subjected to different curing method and behavior of this material upon exposure to long term sulphate attack. Comparisons are made between behavior of plain aerated concrete mix as control specimen and another mix. aerated concrete with 30% palm oil fuel ash as partial sand replacement. Compressive strength performance of the specimens were observed by placing it in two types of curing regime. water curing and air curing. Durability of the mixes were assessed by exposing the specimens in Sodium sulphate environment. Findings indicate that water curing promotes better pozzolanic reaction in aerated concrete containing palm oil fuel ash. that leads to formation of larger amount of CSH gel resulting it to be stronger than control specimen. Integration of palm oil fuel ash consumes calcium hydroxide which is vulnerable to sulphate attack and produces secondary CSH gel making the concrete more compact thus enhancing its durability against sulphate attack.,True,njvsikgAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,7,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1057.146&rep=rep1&type=pdf,15525763017868811439,/scholar?cites=15525763017868811439,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1057.146&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Concrete grade 30 was used and POFA cement replaced 10%. 20% and 30% of the total weight of ordinary Portland cement [1]. The compressive strength was tested after 7. 28. 60 and 90 days cured in water in order to investigate the strength development of the POFA-concretes. In addition. the pre-crack (hairline crack) concrete was examined under compression load to determine the effectiveness of self-healing POFA-concretes after different curing conditions. Four types of curing condition. namely air. room temperature. wet and dry. and water curing were tested. An ultra-pulse velocity (UPV) test was performed after 7. 28. 60 and 90 days of curing to monitor the self-healing progress in the POFA-concrete. The results show that POFA-concrete witha 20% replacement level recorded the highest compressive strength. It was also revealed that the UPV readings increased significantly with increased curing age. The results showed that the selfhealing ability of pre-cracked POFA-concrete at 10% replacement level increases significantly for the water curing condition. From these findings. the optimum POFA replacement level was recorded at 20% for the strength. while inclusion of a 10% POFA replacement level was appropriate for self-healing concrete.,True,njvsikgAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,7,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/159183653.pdf,8061394674056811958,/scholar?cites=8061394674056811958,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/159183653.pdf,0,0,0

The immersion test. electrochemical and surface analysis techniques were successfully carried out in this research. Scanning electron microscope images indicated that the ethanol fuel blend induced pitting corrosion of steel. Remarkably. the surface of the sample containing 1000 ppm APL-EAE is smoother than the others submerged in different conditions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy result shows that APL-EAE has formed a good protective layer. preventing corrosive factors from hitting the steel surface. The potentiodynamic polarization data argue that the corrosion inhibition efficiency was strengthened with the increase of APL-EAE concentration. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated less intensity of Fe peaks. higher intensity of C 1s peak and the appearance of organic peaks (N 1s.

This phenomenon is related to the localized corrosion that takes place even in the presence of an optimal concentration of organic corrosion inhibitors in the given medium.

The immersion test. electrochemical and surface analysis techniques were successfully carried out in this research. Scanning electron microscope images indicated that the ethanol fuel blend induced pitting corrosion of steel. Remarkably. the surface of the sample containing 1000 ppm APL-EAE is smoother than the others submerged in different conditions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy result shows that APL-EAE has formed a good protective layer. preventing corrosive factors from hitting the steel surface. The potentiodynamic polarization data argue that the corrosion inhibition efficiency was strengthened with the increase of APL-EAE concentration. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated less intensity of Fe peaks. higher intensity of C 1s peak and the appearance of organic peaks (N 1s. P 2p. O 1s) from specimens with and without APL-EAE addition. Therefore. the results suggest the formation of the protective film on steel surface and affirm that APL-EAE has served as an effective corrosion inhibitor for steel in ethanol fuel blend.

Lower bandgap in crystalline silicon causes less absorbency at higher wavelengths which reduces the performance of solar cells.[2] Crystalline solar cell has a market share of about 85-90%[3].,True,3vet8OkAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ankit_Goyal9/publication/311351031_Effect_of_wafer_thickness_on_characteristics_of_hetero-_junction_silicon_solar_cell/links/5842696608ae61f75dd16a60/Effect-of-wafer-thickness-on-characteristics-of-hetero-junction-silicon-solar-cell.pdf,15040012817652415924,/scholar?cites=15040012817652415924,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ankit_Goyal9/publication/311351031_Effect_of_wafer_thickness_on_characteristics_of_hetero-_junction_silicon_solar_cell/links/5842696608ae61f75dd16a60/Effect-of-wafer-thickness-on-characteristics-of-hetero-junction-silicon-solar-cell.pdf,0,0,0

BiFeO3 is the only single phase multiferroic material which possesses a high Curie temperature (TC ∼ 1103 K). and a high Neel temperature (TN ∼ 643 K) at room temperature. Normally sophisticated methods are being used to deposit thin films but here we have tried a different method Low cost Spray Pyrolysis Method to deposit BiFeO3 thin film of Glass Substrate with rhombohedral crystal structure and R3c space group. Bismuth Ferrite thin films are synthesized using Bismuth Nitrate and Iron Nitrate as precursor solutions. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were used to study structural analysis of prepared thin films. XRD pattern shows phase formation of BiFeO3 and SEM analysis shows formation of nanocrystals of 200 nm.

1217180,Screening of salt tolerance in different varieties of Hordeum vulgare,2012,Ankit Goyal and Swati Pradhan and Vijay Kumar Bajaj,16,World Applied Sciences Journal,7,926-932,,Soil salinity is the major abiotic stress in plant agriculture strongly influencing productivity worldwide and it delimit the crop yield. Several abiotic stresses are united by the fact that at least part of their detrimental effect on plant performance is caused by disruption of plant water status. This can occur through decreased availability of water in the environment during drought. altered ion content and water uptake caused by salinity or cellular dehydration caused by formation of extracellular ice during freezing stress. Barley is used as food and in production of beverage all over the world. In the present study. screening of few barley varieties for their tolerance against salt stresses and then be able to find the best tolerant variety. In the experimental set up. Hoagland medium is used for hydroponic studies in which seeds were grown on different salt concentration to find out their salt tolerance. Out of five varieties of Hordeum vulgare BH 924 and RD 2508 are the good salt tolerant varieties in comparison to others.,True,3vet8OkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.389.9363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12345230262873533361,/scholar?cites=12345230262873533361,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.389.9363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
