Archaea utilize unique metabolic pathways to survive in seemingly inhospitable environments. The methanogen Methanosarcina acetivorans. for instance. uses several substrates: methanol. acetate. methyl amines. carbon monoxide. etc.. to acquire energy and produce methane. Methanol and carbon monoxide share few steps in their processing pathways for methane biosynthesis. 1 The affects on protein and post translational modification (PTM) expression when utilizing different substrates is not well-known. To this end. M. acetivorans was grown on carbon-13 labeled methanol versus carbon-12 carbon monoxide.

How GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are trafficked from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface is poorly understood. but the GPI moiety has been postulated to function as a signal for sorting and transport. Here. we established mutant cells that were selectively defective in transport of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi. We identified a responsible gene. designated PGAP5 (post-GPI-attachment to proteins 5). PGAP5 belongs to a dimetal-containing phosphoesterase family and catalyzed the remodeling of the glycan moiety on GPI-APs. PGAP5 catalytic activity is a prerequisite for the efficient exit of GPI-APs from the ER.

There are at least 26 genes involved in biosynthesis and remodeling of GPI anchors. Hypomorphic coding mutations in seven of these genes have been reported to cause decreased expression of GPI anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface and to cause autosomal-recessive forms of intellectual disability (ARID). We performed homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in a family with encephalopathy and non-specific ARID and identified a homozygous 3 bp deletion (p.Leu197del) in the GPI remodeling gene PGAP1. PGAP1 was not described in association with a human phenotype before. PGAP1 is a deacylase that removes an acyl-chain from the inositol of GPI anchors in the endoplasmic reticulum immediately after attachment of GPI to proteins. In silico prediction and molecular modeling strongly suggested a pathogenic effect of the identified deletion. The expression levels of GPI-APs on B lymphoblastoid cells derived from an affected person were normal. However. when those cells were incubated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). GPI-APs were cleaved and released from B lymphoblastoid cells from healthy individuals whereas GPI-APs on the cells from the affected person were totally resistant. Transfection with wild type PGAP1 cDNA restored the PI-PLC sensitivity. These results indicate that GPI-APs were expressed with abnormal GPI structure due to a null mutation in the remodeling gene PGAP1.

More than 10% of patients with AA develop clinically evident PNH. Moreover. flow cytometric analysis demonstrates that the majority of patients with AA have a subclinical percentage of granulocytes with PNH phenotype. Some of them have clearly recognizable PNH clones. Granulocytes with a PNH phenotype are also often found in normal individuals. though at much smaller percentages of cells.

The addition of Hmo nevertheless had an enhancing effect on Imo activity. but cleavage did not proceed beyond iC3b.

Pig cells are very susceptible to human complement. presumably because pig cell-surface complement regulatory proteins are inefficient against it. Expression of human complement regulatory proteins. such as decay-accelerating factor and membrane cofactor proteins (MCP or CD46). by means of transgenes would confer resistance to human complement upon pig cells. thereby preventing hyperacute rejection.

DAF very effectively prevents the amplification steps of the cascade by interfering with assembly of the C3-convertases. C4b2a and C3bBb. and the C5convertases. C4b2a3b and C3bBb3b (3-5). The precise mechanism of action of DAF is unknown but several lines of evidence indicate that it binds to C4b or C3b and competitively prevents the interaction with C2 and factor B. Erythrocyte DAF functions only in the membrane in which it is located. that is. DAF does not act on C3-or C5-convertases formed on neighboring cells or on foreign substrates. such as bacteria and immune complexes (5). For this reason it has been suggested that the physiological role of DAF is to protect cells from damage by autologous complement. This hypothesis is in agreement with the finding that erythrocytes from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). an acquired syndrome characterized by an unusual susceptibility of red cells to complement activation (6). are DAF deficient (4. 7-9). Platelet and leukocyte abnormalities are also found in PNH. but the role of DAF in these disorders is unclear (10-13). The idea that DAF's role is to prevent damage to autologous cells by complement. receives further support from the findings reported here.

We have been using expression cloning methods in which a cDNA library was transfected into GPI-anchor-deficient mutant cells. The transfectants which restored surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins were isolated and the plasmids were rescued. In this way we previously cloned cDNAs of genes for complementation classes A and F. and named them PIG-A and PIG-F. respectively. In the present study we have cloned the gene for class B. termed PIG-B. In each case we used different methods. For cloning PIG-A cDNA we used a cDNA library made with an Epstein-Barr-virus-based vector and human class A mutant JY5 which expresses EBNA-1 protein. The EBNA-1 protein allows stable replication of oriP-containing plasmids in the episomal form. For cloning PIG-F cDNA we chose a transient expression method and cotransfected a human T-cell cDNA library made with a vector bearing an origin of replication of polyoma virus with a plasmid bearing polyoma virus large T into the class F murine thymoma mutant. This cotransfection strategy was unsuccessful for cloning PIG-B due to low transfection efficiency of the class B thymoma mutant SIA-b. Thus. we first established large T-expressing SIA-b cells and then transfected them with a cDNA library. PIG-B cDNA restored the surface expression of Thy-1 on SIA-b cells and also synthesis of mature type GPI-anchor precursors in these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),True,Zlvj3BwAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C,11,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8081220,12594552055322000048,/scholar?cites=12594552055322000048,,,0,0,0

Cham,One hundred and fifty or more of human proteins are anchored to the outer leaflet of plasma membrane by a glycolipid. termed glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). While GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) have wide range of functions. they share two unique characteristics due to the common membrane-anchors. One is that GPI-APs are mainly associated with membrane microdomains so called membrane rafts. Recent reports demonstrated that GPI-APs exist as homodimers and that homodimerization is important for their raft association. Another characteristic of GPI-APs is release from the cell surface after cleavage by GPI-cleaving enzymes. Preassembled GPI is transferred en bloc by GPI transamidase to the C-terminus of proteins having a C-terminal GPI-attachment signal peptide. A unique feature of GPI-anchor is that GPI structure is dynamically modified during transport to the cell surface.

Two lines of evidence suggest that second abnormality is involved in clonal expansion of GPI-anchor deficient cells. Pig-a dismpted hematopoietic stem cells in mouse and PIG-A deficient cells in normal human individuals did not clonally expand Two possible mechanisms for clonal expansion have been proposed One is an immunoselection mechanism in that PNH cells are more resistant to immunological attack than normal cells because of the deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins.

The deficiency of the surface expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins caused by a somatic mutation of the PIG-A gene. an X-chromosomal gene that participates in the first step of the GPI anchor synthesis. has been shown to be responsible for PNH in all patients. The mutations of PIG-A studied to date are highly heterogeneous. They are however mainly of the frameshift type (61.5%). The characteristic abnormalities of PNH phenotypes has also been shown especially by DAF-and/or CD59-based fluorescent immunocytometry. A great degree of heterogeneity in the patterns and levels of expression of GPI-anchored proteins in various cell types was demonstrated indicating a discrepancy of lineage involvement. In this investigation. major blood cell populations. ie erythrocytes and granulocytes were analyzed immunophenotypically. the mutations of PIG-A were identified by heteroduplex analysis and nucleotide sequencing and the consequences of PIG-A mutations were observed. All the mutations identified in 9 patients with PNH resulted in complete loss of function as clones of affected granulocytes completely negative for CD59 expression were shown in all patients. Interestingly. granulocytes in these patients contained variable proportions of affected cells varied from 50% to 100% and four of the patients had erythrocytes with diminished expression of GPI-anchored DAF and CD59 coexisting with normal and completely negative cells.

C3b binds covalently to hydroxyl groups and C5b-7. an intermediate to C5b-9. binds to lipids presumably by hydrophobic interactions. Either binding is therefore non-specific. These binding mechanisms that do not depend on specific interactions. such as those used by antibodies and T-cell receptors. are suitable for invariant complement proteins to handle wide varieties of microorganisms. Since these reactions occur in the milieu of host cell surfaces. some of these fragments and complexes inherently bind to host cells.

The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab (ECU) was approved in Japan in 2010 under the indication to suppress hemolysis in PNH. We comprehensively report as post marketing surveillance (PMS) on the efficacy and safety of ECU administered from June 2010 to March 2013 in Japanese patients with PNH. In spite of complete blocking hemolysis. the degree of improvement of anemia by ECU treatment varies patient by patient. Analyzing the data of PMS. we investigated if patient characteristics. such as LDH. bone marrow function and renal function. can affect anemia in PNH patients treated with ECU.

Osaka University. in collaboration with the National Institute of Health (NIH). Department of Medical Sciences (DMSc). Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). Thailand. This was initiated based on the recognition that. with today’s highly developed transportation networks including those between Japan and Thailand. infectious disease outbreak and transmission are no longer limited to a single country. Indeed. such diseases are likely to be transmitted immediately to a third country. This makes it essential to cooperate globally in exchanging information fast and often. A dozen Japanese researchers are working regularly at RCC-ERI. where they conduct joint research with Thai researchers on bacterial and viral infectious diseases prevailing in Thailand that could conceivably affect Japan. Examples of such diseases include cholera. meningitis with Streptococcus suis. AIDS. chikungunya fever. and dengue fever. Conducting long-term research in other countries often reveals gaps in perception due to differences in national laws and regulations. in rules and operating customs within research institutions. in economic and cultural backgrounds. and in values and ways of thinking among individual researchers. RCCERI is being operated as fine adjustments are made to achieve maximum productivity and developing human resources. Some of the many researchers stationed at the Center faced unpredicted situations such as social chaos due to political instability or …,True,Zlvj3BwAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jdr/9/5/9_784/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0,0,0

Currently. more than 300 patients have been treated with eculizumab. and a total of 11 poor-responders were identified all of whom are Japanese.To clarify the mechanism of difference in the responsiveness of eculizumab. blood samples from poor and good responders were analyzed after obtaining informed consent.

A case with PNH due to a combination of inherited mutation in one allele and a somatic mutation in the other allele of autosomal gene PIGT was reported recently (Blood 2013 doi:10.1182/blood-2013-01-481499). On the other hand. many inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs) were found recently using whole exome sequencing (Nat Genet 2010 vol.42 p827. Am J Hum Genet 2012 vol. 90 p295. p146.

Affected progeny cells are deficient in all GPI-anchored surface proteins. including the complement regulators CD55 and CD59. Deficiency of CD55 and CD59 accounts for the intravascular hemolysis. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against complement component 5 (C5). thereby inhibiting terminal complement-mediated hemolysis.

Hiroh Ikezawa and Martin Low found that phosphatidylinositol (PI)- specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) released membrane-bound hydrolases from the mammalian cell surface and predicted the presence of enzymes. which were anchored to the plasma membrane via PI. A number of researchers who studied Trypanosome brucei. which is a parasite causing a sleeping sickness. noticed that variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) were anchored to the surface membrane via lipids. These findings led to the discovery of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). In 1988. the first complete GPI structures for VSG and rat Thy1 were solved.

Tokyo,Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors more than 200 surface proteins to the plasma membrane. Therefore. GPI deficiency causes severe effects. Twenty-six genes involved in GPI biosynthesis have been cloned and among them PIGA carries the first step. The finding. that a Piga knockout mouse is lethal. indicates that GPI is essential for ontogenesis. Even the tissue-specific knockout of the Piga gene causes severe defects. e.g.. a keratinocyte-specific knockout causes death soon after birth and an oocyte-specific knockout causes infertility. These lines of evidence suggest that only partial GPI deficiency causes disease. Among 26 GPI biosynthesis genes. 4 genes. DPM1. DPM2.

However. the pathobiology of PNH is different from malignant clonal myelopathies such as acute leukemia. and the optimal approach to transplant is unresolved.

Recently we identified two patients whose PIGA mutant cells had a concurrent rearrangement of chromosome 12 that resulted in ectopic expression of HMGA2. the architectural transcription factor deregulated in many benign tumors.

Abelson Melvin I. Simon,,205,,Most glycosaminoglycan (GAG)‐defective mutants have been isolated and characterized from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Wild‐type and GAG‐defective CHO cells have been used by several hundreds of laboratories to study how altering the GAG structure of proteoglycans affects fundamental properties of cells. such as bacterial/viral infection. signaling. protein degradation. and cell adhesion. This chapter describes methods used to construct and characterize new CHO cell lines with gain‐of‐function GAG structures. These novel CHO cell lines allow herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry or have anticoagulant properties that are not possessed by wild‐type CHO cells.

Tokyo,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder caused by PIG-A mutations. Many patients with PNH have more than one PNH clone. but it is unclear v^hether a single PNH clone remains dominant or if minor clones eventually become dominant. Furthermore. it is unknown how many hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain hematopoiesis and how long a single HSC can support hematopoiesis in humans. To understand the dynamics of HSCs. we reanalyzed the PIG-A gene mutations in 9 patients with PNH 6 to 10 years after their initial analysis. The proportions of affected peripheral blood PMNs in individual patients were highly variable; 2 patients increased. 3 patients decreased. and 4 had stable populations (changed less than 20%).

Tokyo,The core backbone of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors contains three mannoses. each linked in different bonds. All three mannoses are donated by dolichol- phosphate-mannose. Three dolichol-phosphate-mannose-dependent mannosyltrans- ferases are therefore involved in biosynthesis of the GPI-anchors. PIG-B is necessary for transfer of the third mannose and is most likely α1.2-mannosyltransferase itself. PIG-B cDNA was expression-cloned using a mouse mutant cell line that is defective in transfer of the third mannose to GPI.

90368,Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria,2001,Taroh Kinoshita,,eLS,,,American Cancer Society,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a peculiar acquired clonal genetic disease caused by somatic mutation of the X‐linked PIGA gene in a hematopoietic stem cell. Loss‐of‐function mutation in PIGA gene causes a lack or a decreased biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). which in turn results in a complete or a partial deficiency in the cell surface expression of GPI‐anchored proteins. such as CD59 and CD55. The PIGA‐mutant stem cell clone becomes dominant in hematopoiesis due to an autoimmune‐mediated decrease of normal hematopoietic stem cells and/or an acquisition of benign tumour characteristics after additional genetic change (s) such that it causes ectopic expression of HMGA2 gene known to cause benign tumours.

Its clinical features include carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). erosive arthropathy and lytic bone lesions. Recent studies demonstrated that 32-micro-globulin (3-MG) is a major protein constituent of the amyloid fibrils of dialysis patients. Serum 3-MG levels are known to increase markedly (usually 30> fold) in these patients than in normal subjects. but statistical correlation between serum concentrations and the occurrence of HAA is unclear. To elucidate the pathological role of 3-MG in HAA. the present study was undertaken to compare the acidic form of 3-MG with normal 3-MG in their physicochemical and immunochemical properties.[Results) Amyloid fibril proteins were isolated from connective tissues forming carpal tunnels in hemodialysis patients with CTS. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting demonstrated that most of 3-MG forming amyloid fibrils exhibited a more acidic pi value than normal 6-MG. This acidic 6-MG was also found in a small fraction of 3-MG in serum and urine from these patients. whereas heterogeneity was not observed in healthy individuals. We purified acidic and normal B-MG from the urine of long-term hemodialysis patients. and compared their physicochemical and immunochemical properties.

This led us to hypothesize that the expression of such a C3 modulatory molecule should be regulated in human trophoblasts since both villous and extravillous trophoblasts are exposed to complement during placentation. Human trophoblasts were isolated from chorionic villi by trypsin/DNAse digestion followed by percoll gradient centrifugation.  Cells were placed in culture and terminated at timed intervals. total RNA was extracted. and Northern analysis for DAF was performed.  DAF expression was also assessed by immunocytochemistry.  In some cultures. the cells were exposed to the agonists 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP and Sp-cAMP and to the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMP. Freshly isolated mononuclear cytotrophoblasts exhibited very little. if any. of either the membrane bound (2.2kb) or the secretory (1.5kb) DAF RNA transcripts.  As cells aggregated in culture. there was a dramatic increase in both forms of DAF.  Initially the RNA transcript for the membrane bound form appeared. followed by the mRNA for the secretory form.  These observations were confirmed at the protein level by indirect immunofluorescence.  The RNA abundance of both transcripts at steady state appeared to be approximately equal.  This is in sharp contrast to what has been observed in other cell types where greater than 90% of the mRNA encodes the membrane bound form.  Exposure of the cells to the cyclic AMP antagonist Rp-cAMP inhibited the up regulation of both DAF mRNAs. suggesting that endogenous cyclic AMP …,True,Zlvj3BwAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC,0,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-a45577bb-454f-333e-8861-53baf55097f7,,,,,0,0,0

90415,Recent advances in research on paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,1993,T Kinoshita,34,,5,529-536,,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hemolytic anemia caused by complement-mediated hemolysis. Blood cells from patients with PNH contain abnormal cells that lack complement regulatory proteins. DAF and CD59. both of which protect host cells from action of complement. DAF and CD59 are GPI-anchored and on the abnormal blood cells other GPI-anchored proteins are also deficient. A fundamental abnormality of PNH appeared to be deficient biosynthesis of the GPI-anchor at an early step. We cloned a cDNA of a gene termed PIG-A (for Phosphatidyl Inositol Glycan-class A) that encodes a 484 amino acid putative ER membrane protein which functions at that step and hence a responsible gene for PNH. Analysis of PIG-A transcripts in the abnormal cells from patients with PNH demonstrated various types of abnormalities such as decreased level of the transcript. splicing abnormality and mutations in the coding region. Thus.

Glycoproteomics determines which sites on each glycoprotein of a cell are glycosylated and ideally includes the identification and quantitation of each glycan structure at each site on the heterogeneous glycoforms in the cell.

PNH is not a simple binary diagnosis and both flow cytometric characterization of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expression on peripheral blood cells and marrow analysis are required for comprehensive disease classification. For optimum management. the contribution of both hemolysis and marrow failure to the complex anemia of PNH should be determined. Complement inhibition by eculizumab is a promising new approach to treating the hemolytic anemia. Stem cell transplant is potentially curative. but the decision on use is best made on a case-by-case basis because of the heterogeneous natural history of the disease. PNH clone size and ethnic/geographic factors appear to influence thrombophilic propensity. but a consensus on prophylactic anticoagulation has not been reached.

Netherlands: Bentham Science Publishers. c1994-,Cyclic peptides that are potent regulators of biological processes are rapidly emerging as important mechanistic probes and drug leads. Nature clearly uses macrocycles to. constrain peptides into conformations that can selectively bind proteins or small molecules. Therapeutic effects of such macrocycles. often containing additional conformational constraints that finetune structure (eg D-amino acids. N-methyl substituents. aromatic rings. to name a few). have so far been mainly discovered by accident. However it is now becoming possible to rationally design synthetic macrocycles to selectively recognize and inhibit a specific protein. A receptor-binding structure is more easily adopted by macrocyclic peptidomimetics than more flexible acyclic peptides because the former have less conformational entropy. Macrocycles are often stable to hydrolysis by peptidases that degrade acyclic peptides and hydrophobic side chains can protect peptide bonds in macrocycles from hydrolysis. as well as enhance lipophilicity. cell permeability and bioavailability. Synthetic efforts to obtain bioactive conformations of short peptides have so far been substrate-based. guided by molecular modelling predictions and structure-activity data for modified amino acid sequences of substrates. However. dramatic advances in molecular biology. X-ray crystallography.

Both infiltrating immunoinflammatory cells and adipocytes play critical roles in the modulation of metabolic homeostasis. so it is important to understand factors that regulate both adipocyte and immune cell function. A currently favored paradigm for obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction is that chronic macronutrient and/or lipid overload (associated with adiposity) induces cellular stress that initiates and perpetuates an inflammatory cycle and pathophysiological signaling of immunoinflammatory cells and adipocytes. Many lipid mediators exert their biological effects by binding to cognate receptors. such as G-protein-coupled receptors and Toll-like receptors.

Netherlands: Bentham Science Publishers. c1994-,Proteins are generally poor drug candidates due to bioavailability problems that stem from conformational instability. susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. poor membrane penetration. and unfavourable pharmacokinetics. Since many proteins exert their biological activity through relatively small regions of their folded surfaces. their actions could in principle be reproduced by much smaller ‘designer'molecules that retain these localised bioactive surfaces but have potentially improved pharmacokinetic/dynamic properties. Unlike proteins. smaller peptides generally lack well defined three dimensional structure in aqueous solution and tend to be conformationally mobile. Considerable progress has been made in recent years towards the use of molecular constraints to stabilise bioactive conformations. By affixing or incorporating templates that fix secondary and tertiary structures of small peptides. synthetic molecules (protein surface mimetics) can be devised to mimic the localised elements of protein structure that constitute bioactive surfaces. This is a promising growth area of medicinal chemistry that could impact significantly on biology and medicine. In this perspective review we summarise and prescribe methods for mimicking individual elements of secondary structure (helices. turns. strands. sheets) and for assembling their combinations into tertiary structures (helix bundles. multiple loops. helixloop-helix motifs). A detailed understanding of the features that stabilise secondary and tertiary structures is the key to developing appropriate templates to support and correctly position residues in smaller folded surfaces.

Checkpoints are often defective in cancer cells. Drugs that target checkpoint mechanisms should therefore be selective for tumor cells that are defective for the drug‐sensitive checkpoint. Histone deacetylase inhibitors typify this class of agents. They trigger a G2‐phase checkpoint response in normal cells but are cytotoxic in tumor cells in which this checkpoint is defective. In this study. we investigated the molecular basis of the tumor‐selective cytotoxicity of these drugs and demonstrated that it is due to the disruption of two cell cycle checkpoints.

West Nile virus has spread rapidly via mosquito transmission from infected migratory birds to humans. One potential therapeutic approach to treating infection is to inhibit the virally encoded serine protease that is essential for viral replication. Here we report the crystal structure of the viral NS3 protease tethered to its essential NS2B cofactor and bound to a potent substrate-based tripeptide inhibitor. 2-naphthoyl-Lys-Lys-Arg-H (Ki = 41 nM). capped at the N-terminus by 2-naphthoyl and capped at the C-terminus by aldehyde. An important and unexpected feature of this structure is the presence of two conformations of the catalytic histidine suggesting a role for ligand stabilization of the catalytically competent His conformation.

Consequently a generic approach to the development of protease inhibitors is the use of constraints that conformationally restrict putative inhibitor molecules to an extended form. In this way the inhibitor is pre-organized for binding to a protease and does not need to rearrange its structure. One constraining device that has proven to be effective for such pre-organization is macrocyclization. This article illustrates the general principle that macrocycles. especially those composed of 3-4 amino acids and usually 13-17 ring atoms. can effectively mimic the extended conformation of short peptide sequences.

In this report. we demonstrate in a preclinical mouse model of breast cancer that the complement anaphylatoxin C5a receptor (C5aR) facilitates metastasis by suppressing effector CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses in the lungs. Mechanisms of this suppression involve recruitment of immature myeloid cells to the lungs and regulation of TGFβ and IL10 production in these cells. TGFβ and IL10 favored generation of T regulatory cells (Treg) and Th2-oriented responses that rendered CD8+ T cells dysfunctional. Importantly. pharmacologic blockade of C5aR or its genetic ablation in C5aR-deficient mice were sufficient to reduce lung metastases. Depletion of CD8+ T cells abolished this beneficial effect. suggesting that CD8+ T cells were responsible for the effects of C5aR inhibition.

Signal transduction via PARs proceeds via an unusual activation mechanism. Instead of being activated through direct interaction with an extracellular signal like most GPCRs. they are self-activated following cleavage of their extracellular N-terminus by serine proteases to generate a new receptor N-terminus that acts as an intramolecular ligand by folding back onto itself and triggering receptor activation. Short synthetic peptides corresponding to this newly exposed N-terminal tethered ligand can activate three of the four known PARs in the absence of proteases. and such PAR activating peptides (PAR-APs) have served as templates for agonist/antagonist development.

It is now clear that these agents also have pleiotropic effects on angiogenesis and the immune system. and some of these properties are likely to contribute to their anti‐cancer activities. It is also emerging that inhibitors of specific HDACs affect the differentiation. survival and/or proliferation of distinct immune cell populations. This is true for innate immune cells such as macrophages. as well as cells of the acquired immune system. for example. T‐regulatory cells.

We have investigated the possibility of dampening the induced fit by using a constrained template as a replacement for adjoining segments of a ligand. The template preorganizes the ligand structure. thereby organizing the local enzyme environment. To test this approach. we used templates consisting of constrained cyclic tripeptides. formed through side chain to main chain linkages. as structural mimics of the protease-bound extended β-strand conformation of three adjoining amino acid residues at the N- or C-terminal sides of the scissile bond of substrates.

HDAC inhibitors are also important tools for the study of epigenetic mechanisms. transcriptional control. and other important cellular processes. In this study the effects of three structurally related antimalarial HDAC inhibitors on P. falciparum malaria parasite gene expression were compared. The three hydroxamate-based compounds. trichostatin A (TSA). suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; Vorinostat®) and a 2-aminosuberic acid derivative (2-ASA-9). all caused profound transcriptional effects. with ∼2–21% of genes having >2-fold altered expression following 2 h exposure to the compounds. Only two genes. alpha tubulin II and a hydrolase. were up-regulated by all three compounds after 2 h exposure in all biological replicates examined. The transcriptional changes observed after 2 h exposure to HDAC inhibitors were found to be largely transitory. with only 1–5% of genes being regulated after removing the compounds and culturing for a further 2 h. Despite some structural similarity. the three inhibitors caused quite diverse transcriptional effects. possibly reflecting subtle differences in mode of action or cellular distribution.

One promising approach to overcoming the limitations of peptides is to progressively replace amide bonds in peptides with non-peptidic constraints that bring drug-like properties like stability and bioavailability to the molecules. These constraints can also be used to mould molecules into shapes which mimic key elements of protein secondary structure that confer bioactivity to protein surfaces.

The classical human C5a receptor (C5aR) preferentially binds C5a. with a 10–100-fold lower affinity for C5a des Arg. In contrast. C5L2 binds both ligands with nearly equal affinity. C5aR presents acidic and tyrosine residues in its N terminus that interact with the core of C5a while a hydrophobic pocket formed by the transmembrane helices interacts with residues in the C terminus of C5a. Here. we have investigated the molecular basis for the increased affinity of C5L2 for C5a des Arg. Rat and mouse C5L2 preferentially bound C5a des Arg. whereas rodent C5aR showed much higher affinity for intact C5a.

Many studies have associated PAR2 with inflammatory conditions (arthritis. airways inflammation.

However such probes are now known not to be highly selective for PAR2. and thus precisely what PAR2 does and what mechanisms of downstream regulation are truly affected remain obscure. Effects of PAR2 activation on gene expression in Human Embryonic Kidney cells (HEK293). a commonly studied cell line in PAR2 research. were investigated here by comparing 19.000 human genes for intersecting up- or down-regulation by both trypsin (an endogenous protease that activates PAR2) and a PAR2 activating hexapeptide (2f-LIGRLO-NH2).

Protein folding endows structural stability to localised surface epitopes. imparting high affinity and target specificity upon interactions with binding partners. However. short synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to such protein epitopes are unstructured in water and promiscuously bind to proteins with low affinity and specificity. Here we combine structural stability and target specificity of proteins. with low cost and rapid synthesis of small molecules. towards meeting the significant challenge of binding coiled coil proteins in transcriptional regulation. By iteratively truncating a Jun-based peptide from 37 to 22 residues. strategically incorporating i→i+4 helix-inducing constraints. and positioning unnatural amino acids. we have produced short. water-stable. α-helical peptides that bind cFos. A three-dimensional NMR-derived structure for one peptide (24) confirmed a highly stable α-helix which was resistant to proteolytic degradation in serum. These short structured peptides are entropically pre-organized for binding with high affinity and specificity to cFos. a key component of the oncogenic transcriptional regulator Activator Protein-1 (AP-1). They competitively antagonized the cJun–cFos coiled-coil interaction.

The viral protease encoded by NS2B and NS3 is an attractive target for development of an inhibitor and has been the focus of numerous studies. Most have employed recombinant proteases based on an expression strategy we developed which links the essential hydrophilic cofactor domain within NS2B to the NS3 protease domain by a flexible glycine linker. However. autoproteolysis has been a significant problem associated with this construct. The recently resolved crystal structure of the cofactor bound WNV NS3 protease for example. was found to be truncated by 18 residues at its N-terminus.

Two differentiating agents. butyric acid and azelaic bishydroxamic acid (ABHA). significantly increased the response to Zn2+ in a melanoma cell line (MM96L-gal). UVB (280-315 nm) had two distinct. time-dependent effects. During the first 4 h after irradiation. high doses of UVB inhibited induction by Zn2+. an effect that was made more acute by simultaneous exposure to the differentiating agents. These changes in reporter activity were not due to alterations in Zn2+ transport into the cell. The UVB-depressed MT response subsequently recovered and by 24 h was double the control. yet remained sensitive to ABHA. Reporter activity in transfected HeLa cells differed from that in MM96L. being depressed 4 and 24 h after UVB and insensitive to ABHA at both times. Galactosidase reporter activity driven by non-MT promoters was not affected by these treatments. Dependence of MT transcriptional activity on UV-related DNA damage could be inferred because equitoxic UVC (254 nm) affected the response to Zn2+ in a similar fashion. whereas UVA. cisplatin and a methylating agent had no effect.

Details of the peptide binding mode and binding site provide valuable clues for inhibitor design. Structure–activity relationships for 30 analogues were used to produce short peptides with a cysteine that bind tightly to EcDsbA (Kd = 2.0 ± 0.3 μM) and inhibit its activity (IC50 = 5.1 ± 1.1 μM). The most potent inhibitor does not bind to or inhibit human thioredoxin that shares a similar active site. This finding suggests that small molecule inhibitors can be designed to exploit a key interaction of EcDsbA. as the basis for …,True,D5XJk3MAAAAJ:0xcHesCNKywC,26,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm500955s,7256382684714294345,/scholar?cites=7256382684714294345,,,0,0,0

Peptides can inhibit protein–protein interactions but tend not to enter cells. We systematically compare cell permeability for 8–12 residue model peptides with helix-inducing lactam/hydrocarbon linkers between amino acid sidechains. Cell uptake increases when hydrophobic residues and lactam linkers (i. i + 4) form a contiguous hydrophobic surface patch. Uptake increases further when both hydrophobic and positively charged (but not neutral or negative) residues are clustered into like surface patches. Amphipathicity alone is however insufficient for cell uptake of acyclic sequences. Changing the linker from lactam to hydrocarbon further increases uptake. but also promotes cell lysis.

The periplasmic oxidative folding system in Gram-negative bacteria represents a possible target for anti-virulence antibacterials. By targeting virulence rather than viability. development of resistance and side effects (through killing host native microbiota) might be minimized. Here. we undertook the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting the interaction between the two key enzymes of oxidative folding. DsbA and DsbB. with the ultimate goal of preventing virulence factor assembly. Structures of DsbB - or peptides - complexed with DsbA revealed key interactions with the DsbA active site cysteine. and with a hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site. The present work aimed to discover peptidomimetics that target the hydrophobic groove to generate non-covalent DsbA inhibitors. The previously reported structure of a Proteus mirabilis DsbA active site cysteine mutant. in a non-covalent complex with the heptapeptide PWATCDS. was used as an in silico template for virtual screening of a peptidomimetic fragment library. The highest scoring fragment compound and nine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for DsbA binding and inhibition. These experiments discovered peptidomimetic fragments with inhibitory activity at millimolar concentrations.

90797,Mimicking extended conformations of protease substrates. Designing cyclic peptidomimetics to inhibit HIV-1 protease.,1997,Robert C. Reid and David P. Fairlie,1,Advances in Amino Acid Mimetics and Peptidomimetics,,77-107,JAI Press,There are many examples of structurally distinct cyclic peptides that potently regulate biological processes (eg Curr. Med. Chem. 1995. 2.654-686). but the method of altering their structures to obtain optimal bioactivity is still largely trial and error and thus is painstakingly slow. In this article we describe a more rational approach to inhibitor design that focuses on directly mimicking the conformations of peptidic substrate analogues that bind to the protease of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIVPR). This application of inhibitor design to the specific example of HIVPR is illustrative of a general approach to the structural mimicry of receptor-binding conformations of substrates for other proteases. The macrocycles are easily synthesized. conformationally rigid. proteolytically stable. water and lipid soluble. and can be readily varied by altering the size or substituents of a cycle. Such molecules promise to be important mechanistic probes of biological processes and potential drug leads.A novel hypothesis that extended (strand) substrate conformations are selectively recognized by proteolytic enzymes in general is demonstrated here for HIV-1 protease and supported by our evidence elsewhere for this and other proteases. Evidence includes (1) a consensus extended conformation in X-ray crystal structures of all substrate-mimicking peptidic inhibitors bound to HIV-1 protease.(2) slower processing for rurn-or helix-favoring peptide substrates.(3) lack of turn/helical/sheet structure in peptide and also protein substrates that are most rapidly degraded by HIV-1 protease. and (4) factors that promote stretching of the amide bond for substrate processing.,True,D5XJk3MAAAAJ:0oeUc68sgesC,12,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SJpORvXHSdYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA77&dq=info:Y8ujuTHo_JIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=k_ZxcsiSZu&sig=ly4bu6QuCWT5B30F1vfhpKgbcEQ,10591595723934124899,/scholar?cites=10591595723934124899,,,0,0,0

However. the mechanisms responsible for MAIT cell antimicrobial activity are not fully understood. and the efficacy of these mechanisms against antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been explored. Here. we show that MAIT cells mediate MR1-restricted antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli clinical strains in a manner dependent on the activity of cytolytic proteins but independent of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or induction of apoptosis in infected cells. The combined action of the pore-forming antimicrobial protein granulysin and the serine protease granzyme B released in response to T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated recognition of MR1-presented antigen is essential to mediate control against both cell-associated and free-living. extracellular forms of E. coli. Furthermore. MAIT cell-mediated bacterial control extends to multidrug-resistant E. coli primary clinical isolates additionally resistant to carbapenems. a class of last resort antibiotics. Notably. high levels of granulysin and granzyme B in the MAIT cell secretomes directly damage bacterial cells by increasing their permeability. rendering initially resistant E. coli susceptible to the bactericidal activity of carbapenems.

These structures lead to cell death with the majority of point mutations associated with early onset PD (A30P. E46K. H50Q. G51D.

Striking evolutionary conservation and pulmonary abundance implicate them in antibacterial host defense. yet their roles in protection against clinically significant pathogens are unknown. Murine Legionella infection induced MR1-dependent MAIT cell activation and rapid pulmonary accumulation of MAIT cells associated with immune protection detectable in fully immunocompetent host animals. MAIT cell protection was more evident in mice lacking CD4+ cells. whilst profoundly immunodeficient RAG2−/−γC−/− mice were substantially rescued from uniformly lethal Legionella infection by adoptively-transferred MAIT cells. This protection was dependent on MR1. IFN-γ and GM-CSF. but not IL-17. TNF-α or perforin. Protection was enhanced and observed earlier post-infection in mice that were Ag-primed to boost MAIT cells before infection. Our findings define a significant role for MAIT cells in protection against a major human pathogen and indicate a potential role for vaccination to enhance MAIT cell immunity.,True,D5XJk3MAAAAJ:vnF2_uLGgtgC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/231472v1.abstract,12154573307500130420,/scholar?cites=12154573307500130420,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/09/231472.full.pdf,0,0,0

This template was oligomerized in one pot to a library (cyclo-[1]n. n = 2−10) of giant symmetrical macrocycles (up to 120-membered rings). fused to 2−10 appended loops that were carried intact through multiple oligomerization (chain extension) and cyclization (chain terminating) reactions of the template.

Compounds were derived from cysteine. fused at the S-terminus to 4-butanoyl hydroxamate. and at the N-terminus to 4-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid. The latter was extended by coupling to amines to form a small library of prospective anti-cancer compounds. Four compounds were cytotoxic at sub-micromolar concentrations against cells of a particularly aggressive human melanoma (MM96L). and nine compounds showed selectivities of ≥ 5:1 for killing human melanoma instead of normal human fibroblast cells.

The reverse of this principle. the simple new concept of using inhibitors containing metal ions to target peptide receptors in enzymes. is now described. Such"" metalloinhibitors"" have opportunities for covalent or ionic metal-enzyme interactions which can substantially increase the inhibitor-enzyme binding energy that usually arises from combined ionic. hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Although simple metal salts are known to inhibit numerous enzymes in vitro. no concerted attempts have yet been made to elaborate ligand environments of metals in order to potentiate inhibition. provide enzyme selectivity or protect against compromising in vivo toxicities. Regulation of the ligand microenvironment of the metal can produce spectacular changes in coordinating properties of and ligand affinities for metal ions.

90912,Fortified Coiled Coils: Enhancing Mechanical Stability with Lactam or Metal Staples,2021,Patricia López‐García and Aline D de Araujo and Ana E Bergues‐Pupo and Isabell Tunn and David P Fairlie and Kerstin G Blank,60,Angewandte Chemie International Edition,1,232-236,,Coiled coils (CCs) are powerful supramolecular building blocks for biomimetic materials. increasingly used for their mechanical properties. Here. we introduce helix‐inducing macrocyclic constraints. so‐called staples. to tune thermodynamic and mechanical stability of CCs. We show that thermodynamic stabilization of CCs against helix uncoiling primarily depends on the number of staples. whereas staple positioning controls CC mechanical stability. Inserting a covalent lactam staple at one key force application point significantly increases the barrier to force‐induced CC dissociation and reduces structural deformity. A reversible His‐Ni2+‐His metal staple also increases CC stability. but ruptures upon mechanical loading to allow helix uncoiling. Staple type. position and number are key design parameters in using helical macrocyclic templates for fine‐tuning CC properties in emerging biomaterials.,True,D5XJk3MAAAAJ:T5V60G5X4B8C,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202006971,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7821110/,0,0,0

Major efforts are underway to understand bat immune response to viruses. whereas much less is known about their immune responses to bacteria. In this study. MR1-restricted T (MR1T) cells were detected through the use of MR1 tetramers in circulation and tissues of Pteropus alecto (Pa) bats. Pa MR1T cells exhibited weak responses to MR1-presented microbial metabolites at resting state. However. following priming with MR1-presented agonist they proliferated. upregulated critical transcription factors and cytolytic proteins. and gained transient expression of Th1/17-related cytokines and antibacterial cytotoxicity. Collectively. these findings show that the Pa bat immune system encompasses an abundant and functionally conserved …,True,D5XJk3MAAAAJ:UmJFWc0aipQC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220310737,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220310737,0,0,0

Here we report the pharmacological profiling of a potent new agonist. suggested by molecular modelling to bind in the putative orthosteric site. and two novel PAR2 antagonists with distinctly different mechanisms of inhibition. We identify coupling between different PAR2 binding sites. One antagonist is a competitive inhibitor that binds to the orthosteric site. while a second antagonist is a negative allosteric modulator that binds at a remote site. The allosteric modulator shows probe dependence. more effectively inhibiting peptide than protease activation of PAR2 signalling.

Here we compare three‐dimensional structures for cyclic peptides from six families. including isomers differing only in the location of a single N‐ or Ca‐methyl substituent. We show that a single methyl group only increases membrane permeability when it connects or expands hydrophobic surface patches. Positional isomers. with the same molecular weight. hydrogen bond donors/acceptors. rotatable bonds. calculated LogP. topological polar surface area and total hydrophobic surface area. can still have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch.

Mutations in Retromer cause late-onset Parkinsons disease. while viral and bacterial pathogens can hijack the complex during cellular infection. To modulate and probe its function we have created a novel series of macrocyclic peptides that bind Retromer with high affinity and specificity. Crystal structures show the majority of cyclic peptides bind to Vps29 via a Pro-Leu-containing sequence. structurally mimicking known interactors such as TBC1D5. and blocking their interaction with Retromer in vitro and in cells. By contrast. macrocyclic peptide RT-L4 binds Retromer at the Vps35-Vps26 interface and is a more effective molecular chaperone than reported small molecules. suggesting a new therapeutic avenue for targeting Retromer. Finally. tagged peptides can be used to probe the cellular localisation of Retromer and its functional interactions in cells. providing novel tools for studying Retromer function.,True,D5XJk3MAAAAJ:nFloTcPoiwMC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.410779v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/12/04/2020.12.03.410779.full.pdf,0,0,0

MR1 presents microbial riboflavin biosynthesis derived metabolites produced by bacteria and fungi. Consistent with their ability to sense ligands derived from bacterial sources. MAIT cells have been associated with the immune response to a variety of bacterial infections. such as Mycobacterium spp.. Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli. To date. MAIT cells have been studied in humans. non-human primates and mice. However. they have only been putatively identified in cattle by PCR based methods; no phenotypic or functional analyses have been performed. Here. we identified a MAIT cell population in cattle utilising MR1 tetramers and high-throughput TCR sequencing. Phenotypic analysis of cattle MAIT cells revealed features highly analogous to those of MAIT cells in humans and mice. including expression of an orthologous TRAV1-TRAJ33 TCR α chain. an effector memory phenotype irrespective of tissue localisation. and expression of the transcription factors PLZF and EOMES. We determined the frequency of MAIT cells in peripheral blood and multiple tissues. finding that cattle MAIT cells are enriched in mucosal tissues as well as in the mesenteric lymph node.
