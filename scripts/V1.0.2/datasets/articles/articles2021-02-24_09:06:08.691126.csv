1075019,Cofilin increases the bending flexibility of actin filaments: implications for severing and cell mechanics,2008,Brannon R McCullough and Laurent Blanchoin and Jean-Louis Martiel and M Enrique,381,Journal of molecular biology,3,550-558,Academic Press,We determined the flexural (bending) rigidities of actin and cofilactin filaments from a cosine correlation function analysis of their thermally driven. two-dimensional fluctuations in shape. The persistence length of actin filaments is 9.8 μm. corresponding to a flexural rigidity of 0.040 pN μm2. Cofilin binding lowers the persistence length ∼5-fold to a value of 2.2 μm and the filament flexural rigidity to 0.0091 pN μm2. That cofilin-decorated filaments are more flexible than native filaments despite an increased mass indicates that cofilin binding weakens and redistributes stabilizing subunit interactions of filaments. We favor a mechanism in which the increased flexibility of cofilin-decorated filaments results from the linked dissociation of filament-stabilizing ions and reorganization of actin subdomain 2 and as a consequence promotes severing due to a mechanical asymmetry.

Here. we test this prediction by evaluating how the severing activities of vertebrate and yeast cofilactin scale with the flexural rigidities determined from analysis of shape fluctuations.

Modulation of filament bending and twisting dynamics has been linked to regulatory actin-binding protein function. filament assembly and fragmentation. and overall cell motility. The relationship between actin filament bending and twisting dynamics has not been evaluated.

Quantitative knowledge of the mechanical properties of those polymers is essential for developing predictive models of cell mechanics and mechano-sensing. Linear cytoskeletal polymers. such as actin filaments and microtubules. can grow to cellular length scales at which they behave as semiflexible polymers that undergo thermally-driven shape deformations. Bending deformations are often modeled using the wormlike chain model. A quantitative metric of a polymer's resistance to bending is the persistence length. the fundamental parameter of that model. A polymer's bending persistence length is extracted from its shape as visualized using various imaging techniques. However. the analysis methodologies required for determining the persistence length are often not readily within reach of most biological researchers or educators. Motivated by that limitation. we developed user-friendly. multi-platform compatible software to determine the bending persistence length from images of surface-adsorbed or freely fluctuating polymers. Three different types of analysis are available (cosine correlation. end-to-end and bending-mode analyses). allowing for rigorous cross-checking of analysis results.

Myosin alters the torsional dynamics of actin filaments. which may contribute to aspects of force generation and nucleotide-dependent stability of the actin-myosin complex. We measured how biochemical ATPase-cycle intermediate states of high-duty myosins V and VI affect the flexural rigidity of actin filaments by analyzing the angular correlation of thermally driven shape fluctuations. Both myosins increase the flexural rigidity of actin filaments in a manner that depends on the chemical state of bound adenine nucleotide. High binding affinity states increase the flexural rigidity of actin filaments more than weak binding states.

However. it is unknown how cofilin severs an actin filament. I determined that cofilin decreases the elastic modulus of actin filaments. which makes them more flexible. Based on these results. I proposed that cofilin severs actin filaments when partially decorated by accumulating stress from thermally-driven shape fluctuations at bare (rigid) and cofilin-decorated (compliant) boundaries. This mechanics-based severing model predicts that changes in actin filament compliance due to cofilin binding affect severing activity.

We have recently characterised and expressed OmCI. a 16 kDa protein derived from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata that specifically binds C5. thereby preventing C activation. The structure of recombinant OmCI determined at 1.9 Å resolution confirms a lipocalin fold and reveals that the protein binds a fatty acid derivative that we have identified by mass spectrometry as ricinoleic acid. We propose that OmCI could sequester one of the fatty acid-derived inflammatory modulators from the host plasma. thereby interfering with the host inflammatory response to the tick bite. Mapping of sequence differences between OmCI and other tick lipocalins with different functions. combined with biochemical investigations of OmCI activity. supports the hypothesis that OmCI acts by preventing interaction with the C5 convertase. rather than …,True,OA04HDwAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,54,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607004305,16627538060086923524,/scholar?cites=16627538060086923524,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607004305,0,0,0

The ability of this specie to inhabit in such extreme environment may have been assisted by a type of defence metabolites. In the present study. the content of total phenolic and antioxidant activity in matured leaves. young leaves and the husk of mature fruitswere examined. Total phenolic was measured using Folin-Ciocalteu and antioxidant was based on free radical-scavenging activity. The results showed that the matured leaf contains the highest total phenolic (299.06±0.02 mg/g dry wt. sample). followed by the young leaf (205.97±0.02 mg/g dry wt. sample) and fruit-husk (30.77±0.01 mg/g dry wt. sample) extracts. Both mature and young leaf contained high antioxidant activity. the IC50 values were 0.42 and 0.32 mg/ml. respectively.

1075062,Thymoquinone suppresses IRF-3-mediated expression of type I interferons via suppression of TBK1,2018,Nur Aziz and Young-Jin Son and Jae Youl Cho,19,International journal of molecular sciences,5,1355,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 is known to have a critical role in viral and bacterial innate immune responses by regulating the production of type I interferon (IFN). Thymoquinone (TQ) is a compound derived from black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) and is known to regulate immune responses by affecting transcription factors associated with inflammation. including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). However. the role of TQ in the IRF-3 signaling pathway has not been elucidated. In this study. we explored the molecular mechanism of TQ-dependent regulation of enzymes in IRF-3 signaling pathways using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophage-like RAW264. 7 cell line. TQ decreased mRNA expression of the interferon genes IFN-α and IFN-β in these cells. This inhibition was due to its suppression of the transcriptional activation of IRF-3. as shown by inhibition of IRF-3 PRD (III-I) luciferase activity as well as the phosphorylation pattern of IRF-3 in the immunoblotting experiment. Moreover. TQ targeted the autophosphorylation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). an upstream key enzyme responsible for IRF-3 activation. Taken together. these findings suggest that TQ can downregulate IRF-3 activation via inhibition of TBK1. which would subsequently decrease the production of type I IFN. TQ also regulated IRF-3. one of the inflammatory transcription factors. providing a novel insight into its anti-inflammatory activities.

Physiological and molecular strategies have been implemented to revert or at least to control aggregation but they often meet only partial success and have to be optimized case by case. Recent studies have shown that proteins embedded in inclusion bodies may retain residual structure and biological function and question the former axiom that solubility and activity are necessarily coupled.

This metabolic switch is mediated by the lac repressor (LacI). which in the absence of lactose binds to the operator DNA sequence to inhibit transcription. Allosteric rearrangements triggered by binding of the lactose isomer allolactose to the core domain of the repressor impede DNA binding and lift repression. In Nature. the ability to detect and respond to environmental conditions comes at the cost of the encoded enzymes being constitutively expressed at low levels. The readily-switched regulation provided by LacI has resulted in its widespread use for protein overexpression. and its applications in molecular biology represent early examples of synthetic biology. However. the leakiness of LacI that is essential for the natural function of the lac operon leads to an increased energetic burden. and potentially toxicity. in heterologous protein production.

Ten rounds of directed evolution of the mutant. TEV Ser. overcame the detrimental effects of nucleophile exchange to recover near-wild-type activity in the mutant TEV Ser X. Rather than respecialising TEV to the new nucleophile. all the enzymes along the evolutionary trajectory also retained the ability to use the original cysteine nucleophile. Therefore the adaptive evolution of TEV Ser is paralleled by a neutral trajectory for TEV Cys. in which mutations that increase serine nucleophile reactivity hardly affect the reactivity of cysteine. This apparent nucleophile permissiveness explains how nucleophile switches can occur in the phylogeny of the chymotrypsin-like protease PA superfamily.

Here. we describe the isolation and characterization of human monoclonal IgG and IgA antibodies against a GI.I NoV. Norwalk virus (NV). A higher proportion of the IgA antibodies blocked NV VLP binding to glycans than did IgG antibodies. We generated isotype-switched variants of IgG and IgA antibodies to study the effects of the constant domain on blocking and binding activities.

Despite the advanced knowledge on the biology. immunobiology and molecular genetics of melanoma. the alternatives of treatment are limited with poor prognosis. On clinical trials. natural products and among them redox-active quinones have been tested in the attempt to control the growth of cancer cells. Recently. we isolated jacaranone from Pentacalia desiderabilis. a benzoquinone derivative that showed a broad antitumor activity and protective anti-melanoma effect in a syngeneic model. The purified substance is active at micromolar concentrations. is not hemolytic. and is not toxic in naïve mice.   Methodology/Principal Findings The jacaranone antitumor activity was shown against several human cancer cell lines in vitro. Moreover. the induction of apoptosis in murine melanoma cells and jacaranone antitumor activity in vivo. in a melanoma experimental model. were also shown. Jacaranone renders antiproliferative and proapoptotic responses in tumor cells. by acting on Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The free radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) was able to completely suppress cell death induced by jacaranone as it blocked Akt downregulation. p38 MAPK activation as well as upregulation of proapoptotic Bax. Notably. treatment of melanoma growing subcutaneously in mice with jacaranone significantly extended the mean survival times in a dose-dependent manner.

FTY720 is a compound already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis. It has also been observed that FTY720 inhibits tumor growth in vivo (experimental models) and in vitro (animal and human tumor cells). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of FTY720 on a metastatic melanoma model and in tumor cell lines. METHODS: We analyzed FTY720 efficacy in vivo in a syngeneic murine metastatic melanoma model. in which we injected tumor cells intravenously into C57BL/6 mice and then treated the mice orally with the compound for 7 days. We also treated mice and human tumor cell lines with FTY720 in vitro. and cell viability and death pathways were analyzed. RESULTS: FTY720 treatment limited metastatic melanoma growth in vivo and promoted a dose-dependent decrease in the viability of murine and human tumor cells in vitro. Melanoma cells treated with FTY720 exhibited characteristics of programmed cell death. reactive oxygen species generation. and increased β-catenin expression. In addition. FTY720 treatment resulted in an immunomodulatory effect in vivo by decreasing the percentage of Foxp3+ cells. without interfering with CD8+ T cells or lymphocyte-producing interferon-gamma. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed using FTY720 as a monotherapy or in combined therapy. as different types of cancer cells would require a variety of signaling pathways to be extinguished. ,True,6zLm3OAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,18,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1807-59322013000701018&script=sci_arttext,5556092227686005144,/scholar?cites=5556092227686005144,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1807-59322013000701018&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

The most prevalent treatments against candidiasis involve fluconazole. itraconazole. miconazole. and caspofungin. Moreover. amphotericin B associated with prolonged azole administration is utilized to control severe cases. Currently. numerous guidelines recommend echinocandins to treat invasive candidiasis. However. resistance to these antifungal drugs has increased dramatically over recent years. Considering this situation. new therapeutic alternatives should be studied to control candidiasis. which has become a major medical concern. Limonene belongs to the group of terpene molecules. known for their pharmacological properties. In this study. we evaluated in vitro the limonene concentration capable of inhibiting the growth of yeast from the genus Candida susceptible or resistant to antifungal drugs and its capacity to induce fungal damage. In addition. intravaginal fungal infection assays using a murine model infected by Candida albicans were carried out and the fungal burden. histopathology. and scanning electron microscopy were evaluated. All of our results suggest that limonene may play a protective role against the infection process by yeast from the genus Candida.

To date. little is known about changes in tumoral PD-L1 expression and tumor-associated immune cell flux in melanoma patients undergoing these treatments. Materials and Methods: 49 tumor biopsies from 24 unresectable AJCC Stage III/IV metastatic melanoma patients receiving pembrolizumab/nivolumab were analyzed. Tumor biopsies were collected prior to (PRE. n= 21) and within two months of commencing treatment (EDT. n= 21) and again on disease progression (PROG. n= 7). Patients exhibiting stable disease (n= 9). partial (n= 6) or complete (n= 1) regression on their best response on RECIST or iRC criteria were deemed responders. Response status was correlated with a histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis.Results: PRE intra-tumoral and peri-tumoral density of PD1+ T-cells was 8.1-fold higher (p= 0.0142) and 6.8-fold higher (p= 0.0098) in responders and directly correlated with the degree of tumor shrinkage on radiology (r=-0.356. p= 0.0090 and r=-0.442. p= 0.0035. respectively). EDT biopsies revealed a significant influx of intra-tumoral CD3+. CD8+ and CD68+ macrophages in the responders. but not in non-responders. At EDT. the distribution of tumoral and macrophage PD-L1 expression was higher in responders (p= 0.0554 and p= 0.0379. respectively).

In three diagnosed cancers. one is skin cancer. More rare and lethal. melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer. Currently. 132000 cases occur worldwide each year. 1 However. if detected early. the cure chances are more than 90%. Metastatic melanoma cases have a worse prognosis. which in most cases has no cure and have a limited number of therapeutic options. 2 Therefore. prevention campaigns and early diagnosis are very important. Typically. melanoma arises in areas of the body most exposed to solar radiation. especially people with pale skin. 3 In recent years. some new drugs have improved the survival of patients with melanoma. However. this increase in survival is modest and most patients with metastatic melanoma are not cured. 2 Thus. studies should be conducted to search for new molecular targets and more effective treatment options for melanoma skin cancer.

Soil health is the continued capacity of the soil to function as a vital living system. providing essential ecosystem services. Within soils. all bio-geo-chemical processes of the different ecosystem components are combined. These processes are able to sustain biological productivity of soil. to maintain the quality of surrounding air and water environments. as well as to promote plant. animal. and human health. A common criterion to evaluate long term sustainability of ecosystems is to assess the quality of soil. However. the increased concentration and distribution of toxic substances in soils by mismanagement of industrial activities. overuse of agrochemicals and waste disposal are causing worldwide concern.

However. Tamil Nadu had launched this program several decades before; during the regime of Mr. Kumarasami Kamraj (1954-1963). An empirical study was undertaken in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu. in the south of India. to understand the nutritional status of the children between 11 and 18 years old. This group is vulnerable. as during this age. individuals undergo physical and mental changes. We calculated the Body Mass Index (BMI) of school children to assess their nutritional status. A total of 806 school children took part in this study and the majority of them were found to be underweight in the study region. Irrespective of their age group and sex. as per the WHO’s international standards. 83% of the students were underweight (BMI< 18.5). Only 16% of the students were in the normal range (BMI 18.5 - 24.9). and of the rest. 0.39% and 0.06% were in the BMI range of 25 - 29.9 (overweight) and 30 - 35.9 (obese). respectively.

Parkinson’s. ALS. and diabetes type 2. While structure-based discovery of compounds has been effective in combating numerous infectious and metabolic diseases. ignorance of amyloid structure has hindered similar approaches to amyloid disease. Here we show that knowledge of the atomic structure of one of the adhesive. steric-zipper segments of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein of Alzheimer’s disease. when coupled with computational methods. identifies eight diverse but mainly flat compounds and three compound derivatives that reduce Aβ cytotoxicity against mammalian cells by up to 90%. Although these compounds bind to Aβ fibers. they do not reduce fiber formation of Aβ. Structure-activity relationship studies of the fiber-binding compounds and their derivatives suggest that compound binding increases fiber stability and decreases fiber toxicity. perhaps by shifting the equilibrium of Aβ from oligomers to fibers.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00857.001,True,0bKZ7mgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,122,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00857,8693276891950652395,/scholar?cites=8693276891950652395,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00857.pdf,0,0,0

Greater than 30% of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) appear to be insoluble. The prevailing view is that insolubly expressed proteins cannot be easily solubilized. and are usually sequestered into inclusion bodies. However. we hypothesize that small molecules added during the cell lysis stage can yield soluble protein from insoluble protein previously screened without additives or ligands. We present a novel screening method that utilized 144 additive conditions to increase the solubility of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. These selected additives are natural ligands. detergents. salts. buffers. and chemicals that have been shown to increase the stability of proteins in vivo. We present the methods used for this additive solubility screen and detailed results for 41 potential drug target recombinant proteins from infectious organisms. Increased solubility was observed for 80% of the recombinant proteins during the primary and secondary screening of lysis with the additives; that is 33 of 41 target proteins had increased solubility compared with no additive controls. Eleven additives (trehalose. glycine betaine. mannitol. L-Arginine. potassium citrate. CuCl2. proline. xylitol. NDSB 201. CTAB and K2PO4) solubilized more than one of the 41 proteins; these additives can be easily screened to increase protein solubility.

Although TAAs are highly divergent in sequence and domain structure. they are all conceptually comprised of a C-terminal membrane anchoring domain and an N-terminal passenger domain. Passenger domains consist of a secretion sequence. a head region that facilitates binding to the host cell surface. and a stalk region.  Methodology/Principal Findings Pathogenic species of Burkholderia contain an overabundance of TAAs. some of which have been shown to elicit an immune response in the host. To understand the structural basis for host cell adhesion. we solved a 1.35 Å resolution crystal structure of a BpaA TAA head domain from Burkholderia pseudomallei. the pathogen that causes melioidosis. The structure reveals a novel fold of an intricately intertwined trimer. The BpaA head is composed of structural elements that have been observed in other TAA head structures as well as several elements of previously unknown structure predicted from low sequence homology between TAAs. These elements are typically up to 40 amino acids long and are not domains. but rather modular structural elements that may be duplicated or omitted through evolution. creating molecular diversity among TAAs.  Conclusions/Significance The modular nature of BpaA. as demonstrated by its head domain crystal structure. and of TAAs in general provides insights into evolution of pathogen-host adhesion and may provide an avenue for diagnostics.,True,0bKZ7mgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,35,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012803,1961011542025855621,/scholar?cites=1961011542025855621,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012803,0,0,0

The need for new therapeutics for the treatment of giardiasis is of paramount importance. Owing to the ubiquitous nature of kinases and their vital importance in organisms. they are potential drug targets. In this paper. the first structure of a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) from G. lamblia (GlCDK; UniProt A8BZ95) is presented. CDKs are cell-cycle-associated kinases that are actively being pursued as targets for anticancer drugs as well as for antiparasitic chemotherapy. Generally. a CDK forms a complex with its associated cyclin. This CDK–cyclin complex is active and acts as a serine/threonine protein kinase. Typically. CDKs are responsible for the transition to the next phase of the cell cycle.

In order to identify novel bacterial immunostimulatory proteins. we developed a new high-throughput approach called “EPSIA”. Expressed Protein Screen for Immune Activators. Out of 3.882 Vibrio cholerae proteins. we identified phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) as a conserved bacterial protein capable of activating host innate immunity. PSD in concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and primary peritoneal macrophage cells to secrete TNFα and IL-6. respectively.

The sample consisted of twenty-three adult male and nine adult female elite kayakers. with more than three years’ experience in international events. who voluntarily took part in this study. The subjects performed a 10-min warm-up. followed by a 2-min passive interval. before starting the test itself. which consisted of a maximum 4-min work paddling on an ergometer; right after the end of the test. an 8 ml blood sample was collected for analysis. 72 hours after the test. all athletes took part in an official race. when then it was possible to check their performance in the on site K1 1000m test (P1000m). The results showed that all lipoproteins and hematological parameters tested presented a significant difference (p≤0.05) after exercise for both genders. In addition. parameters related to muscle damage such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) presented significant differences after stress. Uric acid presented an inverse correlation with the performance (r = -0.76). while CK presented a positive correlation (r = 0.46) with it. Based on these results. it was possible to verify muscle damage and the level of oxidative stress caused by indoor training with specific ergometers for speed kayaking. highlighting the importance of analyzing and getting to know the physiological responses to this type of training. in order to provide information to coaches and optimize athletic …,True,iYr4llAAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153709,561690195802549962,/scholar?cites=561690195802549962,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153709,0,0,0

Its usefulness as a marker has been proved for hepatocarcinoma. melanoma and ovary carcinoma. However. there are no studies analyzing GPC3 usefulness as a biomarker in mammary tumors. The aim of this work was to analyze GPC3 expression in breast tissues and to determine whether it might be useful as a biomarker in breast cancer patients. Expression level of GPC3 mRNA in Brazilian and Argentine human breast tumor (n= 121) and peritumoral “normal” tissue (n= 77) samples was analyzed using qRT-PCR. GPC3 protein expression was analyzed from 69 breast cancer and 10 peritumoral samples using IHC. Statistical analyses were done to evaluate the clinical-pathological significance of GPC3 expression. We found that Brazilian and Argentine populations are statistically different regarding GPC3 mRNA expression. In Argentine patients a lower GPC3 mRNA expression was found in tumors as compared to peritumoral tissues. No association was found between GPC3 mRNA and protein expression and the clinical-pathological parameters. The Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that elevated levels of GPC3 mRNA are associated with relapse. Our results indicate differential expression of GPC3 in mammary tumors in comparasion to normal breast tissues.

Partially modified siRNAs (up to 70% of the nucleotides) provide significant stabilization in vitro and are commercially available; thus are commonly used to evaluate efficacy of bio-conjugates for in vivo delivery. In contrast. most clinically-advanced non-formulated compounds. using conjugation as a delivery strategy. are fully chemically modified (100% of nucleotides).

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) accentuates the infiltration of immune cells within the prostate. However. the immunosuppressive pathways regulated by androgens in PCa are not well characterized. Arginase 2 (ARG2) expression by PCa cells leads to a reduced activation of tumor-specific T cells. Our hypothesis was that androgens could regulate the expression of ARG2 by PCa cells.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this report. we demonstrate that both ARG1 and ARG2 are expressed by hormone-sensitive (HS) and hormone-refractory (HR) PCa cell lines. with the LNCaP cells having the highest arginase activity. In prostate tissue samples. ARG2 was more expressed in normal and non-malignant prostatic tissues compared to tumor tissues. Following androgen stimulation of LNCaP cells with 10 nM R1881. both ARG1 and ARG2 were overexpressed. The regulation of arginase expression following androgen stimulation was dependent on the androgen receptor (AR). as a siRNA treatment targeting the AR inhibited both ARG1 and ARG2 overexpression. This observation was correlated in vivo in patients by immunohistochemistry. Patients treated by ADT prior to surgery had lower ARG2 expression in both non-malignant and malignant tissues. Furthermore. ARG1 and ARG2 were enzymatically active and their decreased expression by siRNA resulted in reduced overall arginase activity and l-arginine metabolism. The decreased ARG1 and ARG2 expression also translated with diminished LNCaP cells cell growth and increased PBMC …,True,kvT5l5QAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,47,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012107,3360596116911967803,/scholar?cites=3360596116911967803,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012107,0,0,0

It has been proposed that. before its attachment. Pup is modified by deamidation of its C-terminal glutamine to glutamate. Here we have identified Dop (locus tag Rv2112) as the specific deamidase of Pup in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Deamidation requires ATP as a cofactor but not its hydrolysis. Furthermore. we provide experimental evidence that PafA (locus tag Rv2097) ligates deamidated Pup to the proteasomal substrate proteins FabD and PanB. This formation of an isopeptide bond requires hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. suggesting that deamidated Pup is activated for conjugation via phosphorylation of its C-terminal glutamate.

Because cancer frequently presents as a disseminated disease. it is imperative to deliver cytotoxic radiation not only to the primary tumor but also to distant metastases. while reducing exposure of healthy organs as much as possible. Monoclonal antibodies and their fragments. labeled with therapeutic radionuclides. have been used for many years in the development of anticancer strategies. with the aim of concentrating radioactivity at the tumor site and sparing normal tissues. This review surveys important milestones in the development and clinical implementation of radioimmunotherapy and critically examines new trends for the antibody-mediated targeted delivery of radionuclides to sites of cancer.

However. recent work on an ADC that targets fibronectin in the tumor microenvironment suggests this may not be necessary. The alternatively spliced extra domains A and B (EDA and EDB) of fibronectin offer appealing targets for ADC development. because the antigen is strongly expressed in many solid human tumors and nearly undetectable in normal tissues except for the female reproductive system.

The role of ATM in insulin signalling has not been firmly resolved for skeletal muscle cells. for which Akt phosphorylation is a pivotal step in stimulation of glucose transport. Accordingly. our aim was to determine the role of ATM in insulin effects for cell lines derived from skeletal muscle and for skeletal muscle. Methods: We examined insulin effects in L6 myotubes. mouse soleus. C2C12 myotubes and differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells in the presence and absence of a low concentration (1 μm) of the ATM inhibitor KU55933. We also compared insulin signalling in C2C12 cells expressing shRNA against ATM and control cell lines (empty vector; cells expressing non‐targeting shRNA).

Iraq. METHODS: We carried out a community-based study in Baghdad City. Iraq from November through June 2002. We selected a sample of 2090 healthy subjects (aged 1 month to 85 years). We used a pre-tested questionnaire. designed to obtain information on gender. birth dates. height. weight. residence. habitual food consumption patterns. and social status. We performed laboratory assessment of serum zinc level. dietary assessment of food frequency and usual zinc intake. We considered subjects with serum zinc concentration of< 7.7 umol/l zinc deficient and>/-7.7 to 12.3 umol/l mild to moderately zinc deficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of zinc deficiency among the studied sample was 2.7%. We found mild to moderate zinc deficiency among 55.7% of the study sample. Dietary zinc intake assessment showed that 74.8% of the studied sample consumed less than the recommended intake. and in 62.3%. the intakes were deficient and grossly deficient. Mean daily zinc ranged from 5.2 mg in children to 8.5 mg in adults.

The resulting decrease in total body zinc maycontribute to diabetic complications. Hence. the present study was conducted to evaluate zinc status for diabetic patients. in an effort to identify diabetic group for whom zinc supplementation may be concern. The objective was to assess zinc status among randomlyselected diabetic patients of Duhok city. Methods Collection of data was carried out during the period from September 2009 to June 2010 at the Duhok Diabetes Center in Duhok Governorate/Kurdistan region/Iraq. In the first part of the study (cross sectional study). a total of 362 subjects were involved. Among these. 206 were diabetic patients (type 1 DM. n= 48; Type 2 DM. n= 158) and the remainders were 156 apparently healthy subjects. In the second part of the study (intervention study). twenty eight type 2 diabetic patients were selected according to selection criteria and were supplemented with 40 mg elemental zinc as zinc gluconate per day for 3 months. from those 23 completed the trial. General information for each subject was obtained by questionnaire designed for the study. Fasting serum glucose (FSG). lipid profile. glycoselated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum zinc were measured for each subject.

The process of oxidation and its kinetics were established by using cyclic voltammetry. chronoamperometry techniques. and steady-state polarization measurements. The results revealed that cobalt hydroxide promotes the rate of oxidation by increasing the peak current. so these bimolecular reactions are oxidized at lower potentials.

The effect of silicon (Si) nutrition on salt stress symptoms was investigated in hydroponically grown rice seedlings. Seeds from Khazar (salt sensitive) and Zayandehrood (salt tolerant) cultivars of rice were exposed to 0 and 100 mM NaCl in the absence and presence of silicon (3 mM) using sodium silicate. Plant growth parameters. sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) concentrations. Si accumulation. chlorophyll content and efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) were determined in 25 days old seedlings exposed to salinity for 96 h. The results showed that salt stress generally inhibited seedling growth and reduced photosynthesis efficiency. However. the addition of Si significantly decreased shoot Na+ concentration. but increased Si uptake. Additionally. in salinized plants. the addition of Si increased Fv/Fm in Khazar cultivar. It could be concluded that Na+ concentration. Si accumulation and Fv/Fm ratio play key role in salinity stress tolerance.

Molybdenum (Mo). which functions as a cofactor for a limited number of enzymes including xanthine dehyrogenase. aldehyde oxidase. and sulfite oxidase in mammals. is believed to be an essential trace element in animal nutrition. The aim of this study is to evaluate the hepatoprotective potential of sodium molybdate against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced liver damage. Materials and Methods: In an experimental study. adult male rats received daily oral administrations of different doses of sodium molybdate (0.05. 0.1. and 0.2 g/kg bw) along with intrapertioneal CCl4 (50% CCl4 in olive oil. 1 ml/kg bw) twice a week for 28 consecutive days. Results: Histopathological examinations in CCl4-treated rats showed extensive liver injuries characterized by extensive hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis. fat degeneration. and inflammatory cell infiltration while histopathological changes induced by CCl4 were significantly attenuated by sodium molybdate treatment. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that sodium molybdate could protect liver against the CCl4-induced oxidative damage in rats. and this hepatoprotective effect might be contributed to the protection of liver by preventing the toxic chemical reactions which generate oxidative stress. lipid peroxidation. and molecular changes which ultimately lead to liver tissue necrosis.,True,kGLSo8YAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,10,http://jams.arakmu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=700&sid=1&slc_lang=en,9739051990006339768,/scholar?cites=9739051990006339768,,http://jams.arakmu.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_44b4b4/bahrami2002-A-10-810-1-acbc4a7.pdf,0,0,0

It is also involved in pathological conditions such as tumor growth. metastases. and certain chronic diseases. Angiogenesis is dependent on a delicate equilibrium between endogenous angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. However. under pathological conditions. this tight regulation becomes lost which can result in the formation of the different diseases. including corneal neovascularization. endometriosis. obesity. atherosclerosis. diabetic retinopathy. psoriasis and cancer. In general. the process of angiogenesis is a multi-factorial and highly structured sequence of cellular events comprising migration. proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells and finally vascular formation. maturation and remodelling.

Accurate and reliable qualification of neovascular (angiogenic) response. both in vitro and in vivo. is an essential requirement for the study of new blood vessel growth. The complexity of currently used three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis systems makes it difficult to approve material in its models. Capillary-like structure occurs on basement membrane components such as collagen and/or laminin. while in other models. CLS formation occurs on transitional matrices such as fibrin. To solve this problem. we were interested in developing an angiogenesis system which allows rapid and reliable quantification of three-dimensional neovessel formation in vitro.Methods: Human bone marrow endothelial cells were seeded on gelatin-coated microcarriers and suspended in a solution of platelet-poor plasma which was induced to polymerize by addition of calcium chloride. In this way. microcarriers were entrapped in three-dimensional coagulated plasma.Results: Within a few hours. endothelial cells begin to leave these supporting microcarries and migrate into the coagulated-plasma matrix and formed CLS within 48-72 hours.Conclusion: We developed a convenient angiogenesis in vitro system which allows reliable quantification of capillary formation in a three-dimensional environment.,True,h6dzoZEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,13,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=158321,7089089410347924774,/scholar?cites=7089089410347924774,,https://www.sid.ir/EN/VEWSSID/J_pdf/84920090307.pdf,0,0,0

Fifty years later. PAS continues to be used to treat tuberculosis. PAS is assumed to inhibit dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mimicking the substrate p-aminobenzoate (PABA). However. we found that sulfonamide inhibitors of DHPS inhibited growth of M. tuberculosis only weakly because of their intracellular metabolism. In contrast. PAS served as a replacement substrate for DHPS. Products of PAS metabolism at this and subsequent steps in folate metabolism inhibited those enzymes. competing with their substrates.

The latter is an essential precursor to the cell wall arabinogalactan of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The catalytic mechanism for this enzyme had not been elucidated. Here. we provide evidence for a mechanism in which the flavin cofactor assumes a new role. Specifically. the N5 of the reduced anionic flavin cofactor captures the anomeric position of the galactose residue with release of UDP. Interconversion of the isomers occurs via a flavin-derived iminium ion. To trap this putative intermediate. we treated UGM with radiolabeled UDP-Galp and sodium cyanoborohydride; a radiolabeled flavin-galactose adduct was obtained.

UGM catalyzes a unique ring contraction reaction that results in the conversion of UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-Galp) to UDP-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf). UDP-Galf is an essential precursor to the galactofuranose residues found in many different cell wall glycoconjugates. Due to the important consequences of UGM catalysis. structural and biochemical studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism and identify the key residues involved.

Uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP) Galf. the biosynthetic precursor of Galf-containing glycoconjugates. is produced from UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-Galp) by the flavoenzyme UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM). The gene encoding UGM (glf) is essential for the viability of pathogens. including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. and this finding underscores the need to understand how UGM functions. Considerable effort has been devoted to elucidating the catalytic mechanism of UGM. but progress has been hindered by a lack of structural data for an enzyme–substrate complex. Such data could reveal not only substrate binding interactions but how UGM can act preferentially on two very different substrates.

Here we characterize a previously unrecognized Ca 2+-driven pathway for activation of the kinase Erk. which was proapoptotic and biochemically distinct from Erk activation induced by diacylglycerol (DAG). This pathway required protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) and the guanine nucleotide–exchange factor RasGRP and depended on the concentration of the Ca 2+ sensor STIM1. which controls the magnitude of Ca 2+ entry.

To understand how the kinase Csk. a negative regulator of SFKs. controls the basal state and the initiation of TCR signaling. we generated mice that express a Csk variant sensitive to an analog of the common kinase inhibitor PP1 (Csk AS). Inhibition of Csk AS in thymocytes. without engagement of the TCR. induced potent activation of SFKs and proximal TCR signaling up to phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1). Unexpectedly. increases in inositol phosphates. intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of the kinase Erk were impaired.

ITAM receptors engage Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) to initiate phagocytosis and macrophage activation. Macrophages also encounter nonpathogenic molecules that cluster receptors weakly and must tune their sensitivity to avoid inappropriate responses. To investigate this response threshold. we compared signaling in the presence and absence of receptor clustering using a small-molecule inhibitor of Csk. which increased SFK activation and produced robust membrane-proximal signaling. Surprisingly. receptor-independent SFK activation led to a downstream signaling blockade associated with rapid degradation of the SFK LynA. Inflammatory priming of macrophages upregulated LynA and promoted receptor-independent signaling. In contrast. clustering the hemi-ITAM receptor Dectin-1 induced signaling that did not require LynA or inflammatory priming.

We now report the mechanism by which LynA is preferentially targeted for degradation and how cell specificity is built into the LynA rheostat. Using genetic. biochemical. and quantitative phosphopeptide analyses. we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl preferentially targets LynA via a phosphorylated tyrosine (Y32) in its unique region. This distinct mode of c-Cbl recognition depresses steady-state expression of LynA in macrophages derived from mice. Mast cells. however. express little c-Cbl and have correspondingly high LynA.

A wide variety of signals activate NF-[kappa]B driven gene expression through different NF-[kappa]B signaling pathways in a stimulus- and cell type-dependent manner. Due to the diverse regulatory mechanism acting on NF-[kappa]B signaling. the signal dependent activation of NF-[kappa]B remains a challenging area of research. This thesis describes the mechanism of gene regulation by the NF- [kappa]B p52 homodimer with its specific transcriptional co-regulator Bcl3. Chapter I introduces the NF-κB family transcription factors together with its regulation through the I[kappa]B family. NF-[kappa]B signaling pathways. and its DNA recognition in gene transcription initiation. Chapter II describes the promoter specificity by NF-[kappa]B p52 homodimers.

Our previous preclinical gene therapy experiments with Fancc knock-out mice have shown that wild-type hematopoietic stem cells (introduced by transplantation or generated by gene transfer) have a strong selective growth advantage in vivo. However. despite the successful modeling of FA gene therapy in the mouse. application of the same approach to humans is complicated by the requirement for ex vivo manipulation and scarcity of HSCs in FA patients.

FANCC. FANCD2. FANCE. FANCF. and FANCG) 1-8. Fanconi Anemia type A and type C combined account for about 80% of all FA patients 5. The clinical features of FA are considerably heterogeneous. and include congenital abnormalities of the skeleton and other organs (kidney. heart). life-threatening bone marrow failure. and increased cancer susceptibility. Life expectancy is on average reduced to 20 years. with serious cases dying in pediatric age and mild forms surviving until the fifth decade of life. The clinical presentation is usually dominated by hematological deficiencies derived from bone marrow failure. which can progressively lead to profound aplastic anemia. If the supportive treatment for the anemia is successful. patients are at high risk of developing acute myelogenous leukemias and solid tumors 9-11.

Bacteria colonizing the urinary tract face extremely low iron availability. To counteract this. UPEC expresses a wide variety of iron acquisition systems.

Our primary assay was carried out under iron-limiting conditions. Hits in the primary screen were assayed using two counterscreens that ruled out iron chelators and compounds that inhibit growth by means other than inhibition of iron acquisition.

During the life cycle of lamprey. larvae produce copious amounts of 5α‐cholan‐PZS. and trace amounts of allocholic acid (ACA). which attracts adults to the same breeding ground. Later the spermeating males produce 3keto‐PZS. and trace amounts of 3‐keto‐ACA. which attracts the ovulating females. signaling both its reproductive status and its nesting location for successful reproduction. In both stages. a mixture of components serves as pheromone plume. similar to insects.

1075922,The Molecular Paradigm of Human Complexity,2014,K Venkatachalam,3,Clon Transgen,,e109,,Ever since the crystal structure of DNA was discovered. humanity has been fascinated by the double helical structure of DNA. Scientists have estimated that if we were to extend the total of 6× 109 bp of DNA from the content of all 23 pairs of human chromosome. it would be a ladder that would go up formiles [1. 2]. We were very pleased to believe that the greater length of the human genome could explain the complexity of human as an organism relative to simple bacteria that has a genome size of only 4.7× 106 bp. a 1000 fold difference. However. in the 1990s when the Human Genome Project gained momentum. we began to unravel that the total number of genes may not be as large a number as first believed. Now we know that the total number of protein coding genes in humans is amere~ 22.700 [3-5]. This number of~ 23.000 genes is only slightly higher than the simple worm C. elegans. This is startling. yet it is true. With this information we can conclude that it is neither the simple total length of the double helix nor the total number of protein coding genes responsible for the complexity of an organism. It is a conundrum as to how one could achieve a complex individual such as Homo sapiens given the fact there are only~ 23.000 (190.000 exons) protein coding genes. In other words. how do we achieve complexity with just 23.000 genes? We know that bacteria with just~ 5000 genes can perform pathways such as glycolysis. gluconeogenesis. pentose phosphate pathway. synthesis and degradation of glycogen. fatty acids. all 20 amino acids. purine. pyrimidine. and can perform more pathways to maintain life.

Once phosphoryl group is transferred to a recipient molecule. it receives total of two negative charges changing its physicochemical properties. Similarly. upon sulfuryl transfer the recipient molecule receives one negative charge from the sulfonate group. Aside from this difference are there any other advantages of choosing an additional element in the biological systems? It appears that the phosphoryl transfer reactions take place during cell cycle/signaling and in primary metabolism. Whereas. sulfuryl transfer reaction happens mainly to the secondary metabolites/protein transformations? In this paper. I have compared the overall biochemical aspects of phosphate/sulfate metabolic activation and the variety of phosphate/sulfate based cofactors. ATP. CoA. PAPS. NADP+. NAD+. FAD+ and SAM. all share the presence of adenosyl moiety. ATP. SAM and FAD+ contain only 5’phosphate. CoA and PAPS in addition to 5’phosphate have 3’phosphate. CoA has the terminal pantotheine sulfur in the reduced thiol form whereas PAPS contain sulfate (the most oxidized form of sulfur). SAM has sulfur in cationic form that is attached to adenosyl group. NADP+ has 2’phosphate in addition to the unique 5’-5’linked phosphates.

It affects the respiratory. gastrointestinal. glandular and reproductive systems. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF is the respiratory disorder caused by a vicious cycle of obstruction of the airways. inflammation and infection that leads to epithelial damage. tissue remodeling and end-stage lung disease. Over the past decades. life expectancy of CF patients has increased due to early diagnosis and improved treatments; however. these patients still present limited quality of life. Many attempts have been made to rescue CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression. function and stability. thereby overcoming the molecular basis of CF. Gene and protein variances caused by CFTR mutants lead to different CF phenotypes. which then require different treatments to quell the patients’ debilitating symptoms. In order to seek better approaches to treat CF patients and maximize therapeutic effects.

We hypothesized that dasatinib. a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. might exhibit therapeutic efficacy in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Silicosis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by a single intratracheal administration of silica particles. whereas the control group received saline. After 14 days. when the disease was already established. animals were randomly assigned to receive DMSO or dasatinib (1 mg/kg) by oral gavage. twice daily. for 14 days. On day 28. lung morphofunction. inflammation. and remodeling were investigated.

Although CF leads to multifaceted clinical manifestations. the respiratory disorder represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality of these patients. The life expectancy of CF patients has substantially lengthened due to early diagnosis and improvements in symptomatic therapeutic regimens. Quality of life remains nevertheless limited. as these individuals are subjected to considerable clinical. psychosocial and economic burdens. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene in 1989. tremendous efforts have been made to develop therapies acting more upstream on the pathogenesis cascade. thereby overcoming the underlying dysfunctions caused by CFTR mutations. In this line. the advances in cell-based high-throughput screenings have been facilitating the fast-tracking of CFTR modulators. These modulator drugs have the ability to enhance or even restore the functional expression of specific CF-causing mutations. and they have been classified into five main groups depending on their effects on CFTR mutations: read-through agents. amplifiers. correctors. potentiators and stabilizers.

ΔF508. in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. (CFTR). is located in nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). disease-causing mutations also occur in NBD2. To provide information on potential therapeutic strategies for mutations in NBD2. we studied. using a combination of biochemical approaches and newly created cell lines. two disease-causing NBD2 mutants. N1303K and S1235R. Surprisingly. neither was rescued by low temperature. Inhibition of proteasomes with MG132 or aggresomes with tubacin rescued the immature B and mature C bands of N1303K and S1235R. indicating that degradation occurs via proteasomes and aggresomes. We found no effect of the lysosome inhibitor E64. Thus. our results show that these NBD2 mutants are processing mutants with unique characteristics. Several known correctors developed to rescue ΔF508-CFTR. when applied either alone or in combination. significantly increased the maturation of bands B and C of both NBD 2 mutants. The best correction occurred with the combinations of C4 plus C18 or C3 plus C4. Co-transfection of truncated CFTR (∆27-264) into stably transfected cells was also able to rescue them. This demonstrates for the first time that transcomplementation with a truncated version of CFTR can rescue NBD2 mutants. Our results show that the N1303K mutation has a more profound effect on NBD2 processing than S1235R and that small-molecule correctors increase the maturation of bands B and C in NBD2 mutants.

There is no effective drug therapy that regenerates lung tissue or prevents the progression of emphysema; current treatment is aimed at symptomatic relief. We hypothesized that LASSBio-596. a molecule with potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. might reduce pulmonary inflammation and remodeling and thus improve lung function in experimental emphysema. Emphysema was induced in BALB/c mice by intratracheal administration of porcine pancreatic elastase (0.1 IU) once weekly during 4 weeks. A control group received saline using the same protocol. After the last instillation of saline or elastase. dimethyl sulfoxide or LASSBio-596 were administered intraperitoneally. once daily for 8 days. After 24 h. in elastase-induced emphysema animals. LASSBio-596 yielded: 1) decreased mean linear intercept. hyperinflation and collagen fiber content. 2) increased elastic fiber content. 3) reduced number of M1 macrophages. 4) decreased tumor necrosis factor-α. interleukin-1β. interleukin-6. and transforming growth factor-beta protein levels in lung tissue. and increased vascular endothelial growth factor.

Yet the functional significance of 6mA remains elusive due to its low abundance. difficulty of manipulation within native DNA. and lack of understanding of eukaryotic 6mA writers. Here. we report a novel DNA 6mA methyltransferase in ciliates. termed MTA1. The enzyme contains an MT-A70 domain but is phylogenetically distinct from all known RNA and DNA methyltransferases. Disruption of MTA1 in vivo leads to the genome-wide loss of 6mA in asexually growing cells and abolishment of the consensus ApT dimethylated motif. Genes exhibit subtle changes in chromatin organization or RNA expression upon loss of 6mA. depending on their starting methylation level. Mutants fail to complete the sexual cycle. which normally coincides with a peak of MTA1 expression. Thus. MTA1 functions in a developmental stage-specific manner. We determine the impact of 6mA on chromatin organization in vitro by reconstructing complete. full-length ciliate chromosomes harboring 6mA in native or ectopic positions.

1076075,Hypoxia in obesity and diabetes: potential therapeutic effects of hyperoxia and nitrate,2017,Reza Norouzirad and Pedro Gonzalez-Muniesa and Asghar Ghasemi,2017,Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity,,14,Hindawi,The prevalence of obesity and diabetes is increasing worldwide. Obesity and diabetes are associated with oxidative stress. inflammation. endothelial dysfunction. insulin resistance. and glucose intolerance. Obesity. a chronic hypoxic state that is associated with decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. is one of the main causes of type 2 diabetes. The hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is involved in the regulation of several genes of the metabolic pathways including proinflammatory adipokines. endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). and insulin signaling components. It seems that adipose tissue hypoxia and NO-dependent vascular and cellular dysfunctions are responsible for other consequences linked to obesity-related disorders. Although hyperoxia could reverse hypoxic-related disorders. it increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases the production of NO. Nitrate can restore NO depletion and has antioxidant properties. and recent data support the beneficial effects of nitrate therapy in obesity and diabetes. Although it seems reasonable to combine hyperoxia and nitrate treatments for managing obesity/diabetes. the combined effects have not been investigated yet. This review discusses some aspects of tissue oxygenation and the potential effects of hyperoxia and nitrate interventions on obesity/diabetes management. It can be proposed that concomitant use of hyperoxia and nitrate is justified for managing obesity and diabetes.,True,7KiJi1sAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,43,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/5350267/abs/,11484292685176282955,/scholar?cites=11484292685176282955,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/5350267/abs/,0,0,0

RAD51. a key homologous recombination protein. promotes the search for homology and DNA strand exchange between homologous DNA molecules. RAD51 is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells. Downregulation of RAD51 by siRNA increases radio- or chemo-sensitivity of cancer cells. We recently developed a specific RAD51 small molecule inhibitor.

In a large global survey. we find that kelch13 mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African kelch13 mutations have originated locally. and that kelch13 shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa. whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations. many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus. kelch13 is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa. despite a deep reservoir of variations that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on kelch13 data alone. and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions. shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08714.001,True,ww_FceoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,155,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08714,335042627044763236,/scholar?cites=335042627044763236,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08714.pdf,0,0,0

Most approaches to studying genotypic diversity have involved analysis of a modest number of polymorphic loci. although whole genome sequencing enables a broader characterisation of samples. PCR-based microsatellite typing of a panel of ten loci was performed on Plasmodium falciparum in 95 clinical isolates from a highly endemic area in the Republic of Guinea. to characterize within-isolate genetic diversity. Separately. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from genome-wide short-read sequences of the same samples were used to derive within-isolate fixation indices (F                            ws). an inverse measure of diversity within each isolate compared to overall local genetic diversity. The latter indices were compared with the microsatellite results. and also with indices derived by randomly sampling modest numbers of SNPs. As expected. the number of microsatellite loci with more than one allele in each isolate was highly significantly inversely correlated with the genome-wide F                            ws fixation index (r = −0.88.

RDTs are simple to use and have been extensively used in the diagnosis of malaria among travelers to malaria-endemic regions. routine case management. and surveillance studies. Most RDTs target the histidine-rich protein (Pf HRP) which is exclusively found in Plasmodium falciparum and a metabolic enzyme Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (p LDH) which is common among all Plasmodium species. Other RDTs incorporate the enzyme aldolase that is produced by all Plasmodium species.

Thus. kelch13 is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa. despite a deep reservoir of standing variation that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on kelch13 data alone. and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions. shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.,True,ww_FceoAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/019737v1.abstract,11314577212083867706,/scholar?cites=11314577212083867706,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/05/22/019737.full.pdf,0,0,0

Though the frequency of codon usage is not equal across species and within genome in the same species. the phenomenon is non random and is tissue-specific. Several factors such as GC content. nucleotide distribution. protein hydropathy. protein secondary structure. and translational selection are reported to contribute to codon usage preference. The synonymous codon usage patterns can be helpful in revealing the expression pattern of genes as well as the evolutionary relationship between the sequences. In this study. synonymous codon usage bias patterns were determined for the evolutionarily close proteins of albumin superfamily. namely. albumin. -fetoprotein. afamin. and vitamin D-binding protein. Our study demonstrated that the genes of the four albumin superfamily members have low GC content and high values of effective number of codons (ENC) suggesting high expressivity of these genes and less bias in codon usage preferences.

Brazil [2]. Cuba [3]. Costa Rica [4]. and Thailand [5] have inspired us to report on the development of bioinformatics activities in Malaysia. Rapid progress in molecular biology research and biotechnology in Malaysia has created sufficient demand for bioinformatics in Malaysia. Although bioinformatics in Malaysia started in the early 1990s. the initial focus on the development of the biotechnology industry has curtailed the early gains and overshadowed the systematic development of bioinformatics in Malaysia. which currently lacks in human capital development. research. and commercialization. However. government initiatives have been devised to develop the necessary national bioinformatics network and human resource development programs and to provide the necessary infrastructure. connectivity. and resources for bioinformatics. Stakeholders are experiencing reorientation and consolidating existing strengths to align with the global trends in bioinformatics.

However. their enzymatic properties differ leading to disparate clinical consequences. In order to identify the residues that are responsible for such differences. we used evolutionary trace (ET) method to compare the amino acid conservation patterns of BACE1 and BACE2 in several mammalian species. We found that. in BACE1 and BACE2 structures. most of the ligand binding sites are conserved which indicate their enzymatic property of aspartyl protease family members. The other conserved residues are more or less randomly localized in other parts of the structures. Four group-specific residues were identified at the ligand binding site of BACE1 and BACE2. We postulated that these residues would be essential for selectivity of BACE1 and BACE2 biological functions and could be sites of interest for the design of selective inhibitors targeting either BACE1 or BACE2.,True,QXnY6XcAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,10,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/482463/abs/,16742358727644961219,/scholar?cites=16742358727644961219,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/482463/abs/,0,0,0

In addressing the issue. this study deals with the targeting of silver-copper-boron (ACB) nanoparticles to infected osteoblasts. which could decrease systemic toxicity and form the basis of targeting specific markers expressed in bone infections.   Methods ACB nanoparticles were synthesized and conjugated to the Cadherin-11 antibody (OBAb). The effect of targeting nanoparticles against extracellular and intracellular S. aureus was determined by enumeration of bacterial growth. The binding of the targeting nanoparticles to infected osteoblasts as well as the visualization of live/dead bacteria due to treatment was carried out using fluorescence microscopy.

Unfortunately. there have been only limited attempts at concerted research efforts to seek solution. DDC (diethyldithiocarbamate) is used as a metal chelator. has been used for many years as an antimicrobial agent and more recently as anticancer drug. DDC is also receiving more attention as a useful medication in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to its immune modulating action and antiviral activity against AIDS virus. Recent studies show that DDC-induced liver toxicity is mediated via generation of free radicals.

This nondividing state is characterized by extreme longevity and age-dependent decline of key regulatory proteins. To study the lifespans of cells and proteins in adult tissues. we combined isotope labeling of mice with a hybrid imaging method (MIMS-EM). Using 15N mapping. we show that liver and pancreas are composed of cells with vastly different ages. many as old as the animal. Strikingly. we also found that a subset of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. both known for their replicative potential. are characterized by the absence of cell division during adulthood. In addition. we show that the primary cilia of beta cells and neurons contains different structural regions with vastly different lifespans. Based on these results. we propose that age mosaicism across multiple scales is a fundamental principle of adult tissue. cell. and protein complex organization.,True,_1FI2-EAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413119302505,17928696071269796901,/scholar?cites=17928696071269796901,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413119302505,0,0,0

The aim of this paper is to study on a free floating fibroblast populated collagen lattice (FPCL) model the release of IL-1α and IL-1β in the medium and the pattern of the expressed matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 as a result of mechanical. oxidative. irritant and gamma irradiation induced lesions. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are clearly involved in the regulation of the wound healing. We studied the level of the extracellular IL-1α and IL-1β and found out a higher expression of the IL-1β in the first day of culture and a decrease of both IL-1 after 14 days of culture. Different phases of the wound healing involve some matrix metalloproteinase members and their tissue inhibitors. In our study. the zymographic analysis demonstrated the presence of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the medium of fibroblasts grown in the three dimensional collagen network. The levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were gradually increasing in the first 5 days of culture. probably as a result of the action of IL-1β on the process of MMP activation.

Based on three main objectives. this research targeted the:(i) adaptation of an indirect synthesis route by modulating the amount of phosphorus used in the chemical reaction.(ii) comprehensive structural. morphological. and surface characterization. and (iii) biocompatibility assessment of the synthesized powdered samples. The morphological characterization was performed on digitally processed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The complementary 3D image augmentation of SEM results also allowed the quantification of roughness parameters. The results revealed that both morphology and roughness were modulated through the induced variation of the synthesis parameters. Structural investigation of the samples was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Depending on the phosphorus amount from the chemical reaction. the structural studies revealed the formation of biphasic CaPs based on hydroxyapatite/brushite or brushite/monetite.

Results showed appropriate cell adhesion and high viability without distinguishable differences in the morphological features. Likewise. the pre-osteoblast proliferation overtime on both naturally derived calcium phosphate materials showed a statistically significant increase comparable to that of commercial hydroxyapatite. used as reference material. Furthermore. evaluation of the intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis and deposition. used as markers of the osteogenic ability of these bioceramics. revealed that all samples promoted pre-osteoblast differentiation.

A thorough characterization of bare and nitrided Ti-based alloy and pure Ti was performed in terms of surface film composition and morphology. electrochemical behaviour. and short term osteoblast response. XPS analysis showed that the nitriding treatment strongly influenced the composition (nitrides and oxynitrides) and surface properties both of the substrate and of the bulk alloy. SEM images revealed that the nitrided surface appears as a similar dotted pattern caused by the formation of N-rich domains coexisting with less nitrided domains. while before treatment only topographical features could be observed. All the electrochemical results confirmed the high chemical stability of the nitride and oxynitride coating and the superiority of the applied treatment. The values of the corrosion parameters ascertained the excellent corrosion resistance of the coated alloy in the real functional conditions from the human body. Cell culture experiments with MG63 osteoblasts demonstrated that the studied biomaterials do not elicit any toxic effects and support cell adhesion and enhanced cell proliferation.

We elucidate a p110α-independent role of homodimerized p85α in the positive regulation of PTEN stability and activity. p110α-free p85α homodimerizes via two intermolecular interactions (SH3:proline-rich region and BH:BH) to selectively bind unphosphorylated activated PTEN. As a consequence. homodimeric but not monomeric p85α suppresses the PI3K pathway by protecting PTEN from E3 ligase WWP2-mediated proteasomal degradation. Further. the p85α homodimer enhances the lipid phosphatase activity and membrane association of PTEN. Strikingly. we identified cancer patient-derived oncogenic p85α mutations that target the homodimerization or PTEN interaction surface. Collectively. our data suggest the equilibrium of p85α monomer–dimers regulates the PI3K pathway and disrupting this equilibrium could lead to disease development.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06866.001,True,8BTaOeAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,45,https://elifesciences.org/articles/06866,7271343988845514337,/scholar?cites=7271343988845514337,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/06866.pdf,0,0,0

Injection of the photogenerated F3Y radical from the [Re]–F3Y−βC19 peptide into the surface accessible Y731 of the α2 subunit is only possible when the second Y730 is present. With the Y–Y established. radical transport occurs with a rate constant of 3 × 105 s–1. Point mutations that disrupt the Y–Y dyad shut down radical transport. The ability to obviate radical transport by disrupting the hydrogen bonding network of the amino acids composing the colinear proton-coupled electron transfer pathway in α2 suggests a finely tuned evolutionary adaptation of RNR to control the transport of radicals in this enzyme.,True,rIsEGhYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,41,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja209016j,9000826260572417180,/scholar?cites=9000826260572417180,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268775/,0,0,0

Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). which catalyze the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides in all organisms. are an exemplar of radical mediated transformations in biology. Class Ia RNRs are composed of two subunits: α2 and β2. As a method to initiate radical formation photochemically within β2. a single surface-exposed cysteine of the β2 subunit of Escherichia coli Class Ia RNR has been labeled (98%) with a photooxidant ([Re ] = tricarbonyl(1.10-phenanthroline)(methylpyridyl)rhenium(I)).

For example. antibody-drug conjugates represent a class of biotherapeutics that couple the targeting specificity of an antibody with the chemotherapeutic potency of a small molecule drug. While first generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) used random conjugation approaches. next-generation ADCs are employing site-specific conjugation. A facile way to generate site-specific protein conjugates is via the aldehyde tag technology. where a five amino acid consensus sequence (CXPXR) is genetically encoded into the protein of interest at the desired location. During protein expression. the Cys residue within this consensus sequence can be recognized by ectopically-expressed formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE). which converts the Cys to a formylglycine (fGly) residue. The latter bears an aldehyde functional group that serves as a chemical handle for subsequent conjugation. The yield of Cys conversion to fGly during protein production can be variable and is highly dependent on culture conditions. We set out to achieve consistently high yields by modulating culture conditions to maximize FGE activity within the cell. We recently showed that FGE is a copper-dependent oxidase that binds copper in a stoichiometric fashion and uses it to activate oxygen. driving enzymatic turnover. Building upon that work. here we show that by supplementing cell culture media with copper we can routinely reach high yields …,True,rIsEGhYAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC,35,https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-016-0254-0/,955768287557816106,/scholar?cites=955768287557816106,,https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-016-0254-0/,0,0,0

We have established a program to design and optimize HO inhibitors using structure-activity relationships in conjunction with X-ray crystallographic analyses. One of our previous complex crystal structures revealed a putative secondary hydrophobic binding pocket which could be exploited for a new design strategy by introducing a functional group that would fit into this potential site. To test this hypothesis and gain further insights into the structural basis of inhibitor binding. we have synthesized and characterized 1-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-4.4-diphenyl-2-butanone (QC-308).

The crystal structure of hHO-1 with QC-308 revealed that the second phenyl group in the western region of the compound is indeed accommodated by a definitive secondary proximal hydrophobic pocket.

It is already known that HO has cytoprotective properties with a role in several disease states; thus. it is an enticing therapeutic target. Historically. the metalloporphyrins have been used as competitive HO inhibitors based on their structural similarity to the substrate. heme. However. heme’s important role in several other proteins (e.g. cytochromes P450. nitric oxide synthase). results in non-selectivity being an unfortunate side effect. Reports that azalanstat and other non-porphyrin molecules inhibited HO led to a multi-faceted effort over a decade ago to develop novel compounds as potent. selective inhibitors of HO.

While HemO is a well-known heme oxygenase. previously we discovered that PhuS also possesses heme degradation activity and generates verdoheme. an intermediate of heme breakdown. To understand the coexistence of these two enzymes. using the DFT calculation we reveal that PhuS effectively enhances heme degradation through its participation in heme hydroxylation. the rate limiting reaction. Heme is converted to verdoheme in this reaction and the energy barrier for PhuS is substantially lower than for HemO. Thus. HemO is mainly involved in the ring opening reaction which converts verdoheme to biliverdin and free iron.

Previously. CHOP was shown to comprise extensive disordered regions and to self-associate in solution. In the current study. the intrinsically disordered nature of this protein was characterized further by comprehensive in silico analyses. Using circular dichroism. differential scanning calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance. we investigated the global conformation and secondary structure of CHOP and demonstrated. for the first time. that conformational changes in this protein can be induced by the free amino acid l-cysteine. Addition of l-cysteine caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in the protein helicity – dropping from 69.1% to 23.8% in the presence of 1 mM of l-cysteine – and a sequential transition to a more disordered state. unlike that caused by thermal denaturation. Furthermore. the presence of small amounts of free amino acid (80 µM. an 8∶1 cysteine∶CHOP ratio) during CHOP thermal denaturation altered the molecular mechanism of its melting process. leading to a complex. multi-step transition. On the other hand. high levels (4 mM) of free l-cysteine seemed to cause a complete loss of rigid cooperatively melting structure. These results suggested a potential regulatory function of l-cysteine which may lead to changes in global conformation of CHOP in response to the cellular redox state and/or endoplasmic reticulum stress.,True,GKePpLQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034680,2264151858875218851,/scholar?cites=2264151858875218851,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034680,0,0,0

Lipids modulate mixed species biofilm formation in vivo and inherent antifungal resistance associated with these organized communities. Cells in C. albicans biofilms display phase-dependent changes in phospholipid classes and in levels of lipid raft formation. Systematic studies with genetically modified strains in which the membrane phospholipid composition can be manipulated are limited in C. albicans.

The regulators. Sef1 and Sfu1 influence activation and repression of genes required for iron uptake and acquisition by inducing the expression of iron regulon genes in iron-deplete conditions and inactivating them in iron-replete condition. Our study for the first time shows that C. albicans coordinates the activation of the iron regulon with the mitochondrial use of iron for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. a cellular process that is connected to cellular iron metabolism. We took advantage of a mutant defective in mitochondrial biogenesis (fzo1∆/∆) to assess the aforesaid link as this mutant exhibited sustained expression of the Sef1 iron regulon. signifying an iron-starved state in the mutant. Our analysis demonstrates that mitochondrion is pivotal for regulation of Fe-S cluster synthesis such that the disruption of this cellular process in fzo1∆/∆ cells lead to excessive mitochondrial iron accumulation and reduced activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing enzyme aconitase. Sef1 responds to defective Fe-S cluster synthesis by regulated changes in its subcellular localization; it was retained in the nucleus resulting in the induced expression of the iron regulon. We predict that the mitochondrial Fe-S assembly generates a molecule that is critical for ensuring iron-responsive transcriptional activation of the Sef1 regulon.

Its emergence disturbs the human biome and can create serious damage in immunocompromised conditions. Hyphal growth and biofilm formation are mainly the core factors leading to progression of pathogenicity in C. albicans. The drug resistance towards azoles has created a demand of new novel pharmacologically active compounds. Although there are several pathways and factors known for causing pathogenicity there is none single connected pathway known for the whole mechanism such as SAP5. N-myrstyltransferase. Erg11 and Efg1 proteins. In the present study we have focussed on all the pathways and sorted major factors contributing in more than one pathways. The plant based polyphenols that have been studied here are non-toxic and more efficient as compared to the marketed azoles.

Usually these ABC proteins encode transporters. These transporters provide an advantage to yeasts living in competitive environments by actively secreting toxic compounds. thereby serving as a first-line of defence. Amongst the different subfamilies of the ABC transporters. proteins of the multi drug resistance (MDR) and the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) subfamilies are well characterized. Most members of the PDR subfamily are drug transporters involved in the development of antifungal drug resistance caused by the over expression of genes encoding these drug efflux pump proteins. As compared to any other yeast. the role of efflux pumps in drug resistance has been extensively studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However. several studies in the past decade have given momentum to the research pertaining to ABC drug transporters in pathogenic yeasts as well.

Degradation of certain cytokine receptors is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase SCF(βTrCP). In several instances. Janus kinase (Jak) family members can stabilise their cognate cytokine receptors at the cell surface.  Principal Findings In this study we show in Hek293 cells that Jak2 binding to the growth hormone receptor prevents endocytosis in a non-catalytic manner. Following receptor activation. the detachment of phosphorylated Jak2 induces down-regulation of the growth hormone receptor by SCF(βTrCP). Using γ2A human fibroblast cells we show that both growth hormone-induced and constitutive growth hormone receptor endocytosis depend on the same factors. strongly suggesting that the modes of endocytosis are identical. Different Jak2 RNA levels in HepG2. IM9 and Hek293 cells indicate the importance of cellular concentration on growth hormone receptor function. Both Jak2 and βTrCP bind to neighbouring linear motifs in the growth hormone receptor tail without the requirement of modifications. indicating that growth hormone sensitivity is regulated by the cellular level of non-committed Jak2.

1076596,Understanding the Growth Hormone Receptor-βTrCP interactions: Molecular Tools for controlling Growth Hormone Sensitivity,2011,Ana Carolina da Silva Almeida,,,,,,Growth hormone (GH) signaling plays major roles in the organism and. therefore. the sensitivity of the cells to GH and the signaling duration are under a tight control. GH receptor (GHR) endocytosis is one of the main mechanisms that determine the amount of GHRs at the cell surface. and allow the cells to regulate GH signaling. In this thesis we characterized the interaction between GHR and βTrCP. an essential factor that mediates ubiquitination events necessary for GHR endocytosis. and explored the potential of this interaction as a tool for manipulating the sensitivity of the cells to GH. We showed that βTrCP binds two motifs in GHR: the previously described unconventional UbE motif. and the downstream DSGRTS sequence. that corresponds to a consensus degron (DSGxxS) present in other βTrCP substrates. Interestingly. we found that while the UbE motif is necessary for both basal and GH-induced endocytosis. the DSGRTS sequence is only necessary for basal endocytosis. Therefore. besides the UbE motif. the DSGRTS has a crucial importance in the regulation of the cellular levels of GHR. and consequently the responsiveness of the cells to GH. Furthermore. we characterized in detail the interaction between βTrCP and the UbE motif. We showed that βTrCP ubiquitinates GHR in vitro in an UbE motif-dependent manner. The amino acid residues in βTrCP and UbE motif necessary for the interaction were determined and used together with NMR data. in the computation modeling of the interaction. This revealed that the interaction βTrCP-UbE motif is unconventional.

1076603,Growth hormone receptor endocytosis and degradation are regulated by phosphorylation of serine 323 in the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif,,Ana C da Silva Almeida and Agnes GSH van Rossum and Ger J Strous,,Molecular Tools for controlling Growth Hormone Sensitivity,,,,Growth hormone (GH) is an important regulator of growth and metabolism. The duration of GH signaling is tightly controlled at several levels. In this way cells avoid the potential detrimental effects resulting from too high/low GH signaling. At steady state (in the absence of GH). GH receptor (GHR) has a half-life of approximately 60 min. mainly due to endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. Upon activation by GH the degradation is accelerated. In both cases. the endocytosis and degradation of GHR depend on the E3 ligase SCF (βTrCP). which is recruited to the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif and mediates the ubiquitination of yet unknown factors. In this study we report that phosphorylation of S323 in the UbE motif considerably increases the affinity for SCF (βTrCP). This phosphorylation event is triggered by GH. Mutation of the S323 to a phosphomimetic residue (S323D) increased GHR endocytosis and degradation considerably. This finding provides a novel mechanism to regulate GHR endocytosis. which enables an efficient way for GH (de) sensitization of cells.,True,6AYFJq8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/350510/Almeida.pdf?sequence=1#page=92,,,,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/350510/Almeida.pdf?sequence=1#page=92,0,0,0

The sensitivity of the cells to GH is mainly controlled by the endocytosis of the receptor. βTrCP an essential factor regulating GHR endocytosis. In this study we show that βTrCP interacts directly via its WD40 repeats domain with the ubiquitin dependent endocytosis motif (UbE) in GHR. The E3 ligase SCF (βTrCP) mediates GHR ubiquitination in vitro in a UbE dependent manner. The role of βTrCP WD40 residues in GHR binding. in vitro ubiquitination and endocytosis was analysed and revealed the unconventionality of the UbE-βTrCP interaction. With structural data of this interaction. obtained by NMR. combined the functional mapping of the UbE and βTrCP WD40 aminoacid residues involved. a computational model of the interaction was constructed. This model shows a unique interaction of βTrCP with GHR-UbE. different from the one occurring with canonical motifs present in all other βTrCP substrates.

There are reports of growth hormone (GH) resistance in cachexia patients. probably due to a decreased level of GH receptors (GHRs). In this study we show for the first time that in tumor-bearing mice suffering from cachexia the GHR mRNA expression in the liver is 2.5 times lower and GHR protein level 9 times lower than in control mice. indicating that cachexia is associated with decreased GHR levels. In this study we aim to discover small drugs. which improve the GH sensitivity of cells by reducing GHR degradation. and consequently increase the number of GHRs. GHR interacts via its UbE motif with βTrCP (the substrate recognizing factor of the E3 ligase SCF (βTrCP)). This interaction is essential for GHR endocytosis and degradation. The UbE motif (DDSWVEFIELDIDD) differs from the canonical motif (DSGxxS) in other βTrCP substrates and is. therefore. a specific target for drug discovery. We developed a high throughput screening assay based on the molecular interaction between GHR and βTrCP. From a 40.000-compound library 26 compounds were identified that specifically inhibited the interaction between βTrCP and the GHR-UbE motif. Six compounds blocked GHR endocytosis. From the four most potent hits 352 analogous compounds were selected and tested in the same high throughput screening and cell based assays. Three most prominent compounds were tested in mice.

1076608,βTrCP controls growth hormone receptor degradation via two different motifs,,Ana C da Silva Almeida and Ger J Strous and Agnes GSH van Rossum,,Molecular Tools for controlling Growth Hormone Sensitivity,,,,The physiological roles of growth hormone (GH) are broad and include metabolism regulation and promotion of somatic growth. Therefore. the responsiveness of cells to GH must be tightly regulated. This is mainly achieved by a complex and well-controlled mechanism of GH receptor (GHR) endocytosis. GHR endocytosis occurs independently of GH and requires the ubiquitin ligase SCF (βTrCP) that is recruited to the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis (UbE) motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the GHR. In this study we report that. in addition to the UbE motif. a downstream degron. DSGRTS. binds to βTrCP. The WD40 residues on βTrCP involved in the interaction with this sequence are identical to the ones necessary for binding the “classical” motif. DSGxxS. in IκB. and βcatenin. Previously. we showed that this motif is not involved in GH-induced endocytosis. We show here that the DSGRTS sequence significantly contributes to GHR endocytosis/degradation in basal conditions. while the UbE motif is involved both in basal and GH-induced conditions.

In this study. BRET technology was used to study interactions important for the regulation of growth hormone receptor (GHR) endocytosis: the E3 ligase SCF (βTrCP) and the kinase JAK2. GHR is constitutively endocytosed through the action of the ubiquitin ligase SCF (βTrCP) bound to the UbE motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Binding of JAK2 to box1 inhibits GHR endocytosis. Using BRET. we showed in living cells. in real time. that JAK2 is constitutively bound to GHR. Moreover. we show that GH stimulation results in decreased BRET signal from GHR-JAK2 interaction. consistent with GH-induced JAK2 release from GHR. GHR-βTrCP interaction was measured constitutively. and was not influenced by GH stimulation. The hypothesis that JAK2 and βTrCP compete for GHR binding could not be proven.

In this study. we show that the lone Ser/Thr phosphatase (PstP) is regulated through phosphorylation by STPKs.   Principal Findings PstP is phosphorylated by PknA and PknB and phosphorylation is influenced by the presence of Zn2+-ions and inorganic phosphate (Pi). PstP is differentially phosphorylated on the cytosolic domain with Thr137. Thr141. Thr174 and Thr290 being the target residues of PknB while Thr137 and Thr174 are phosphorylated by PknA. The Mn2+-ion binding residues Asp38 and Asp229 are critical for the optimal activity of PstP and substitution of these residues affects its phosphorylation status. Native PstP and its phosphatase deficient mutant PstPcD38G are phosphorylated by PknA and PknB in E. coli and addition of Zn2+/Pi in the culture conditions affect the phosphorylation level of PstP. Interestingly. the phosphorylated phosphatase is more active than its unphosphorylated equivalent.   Conclusions and Significance This study establishes the novel mechanisms for regulation of mycobacterial Ser/Thr phosphatase. The results indicate that STPKs and PstP may regulate the signaling through mutually dependent mechanisms. Consequently. PstP phosphorylation may play a critical role in regulating its own activity.

In this study. we focus on previously uncharacterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) PknJ. a putative transmembrane protein. PknJ is shown to possess autophosphorylation activity and is also found to be capable of carrying out phosphorylation on the artificial substrate myelin basic protein (MyBP). Previous studies have shown that the autophosphorylation activity of M. tuberculosis STPKs is dependent on the conserved residues in the activation loop. However. our results show that apart from the conventional conserved residues. additional residues in the activation loop may also play a crucial role in kinase activation. Further characterization of PknJ reveals that the kinase utilizes unusual ions (Ni2+. Co2+) as cofactors. thus hinting at a novel mechanism for PknJ activation. Additionally. as shown for other STPKs. we observe that PknJ possesses the capability to dimerize. In order to elucidate the signal transduction cascade emanating from PknJ. the M. tuberculosis membrane-associated protein fraction is treated with the active kinase and glycolytic enzyme Pyruvate kinase A (mtPykA) is identified as one of the potential substrates of PknJ. The phospholabel is found to be localized on serine and threonine residue(s). with Ser37 identified as one of the sites of phosphorylation.

Homologs of PrkC and its cognate phosphatase PrpC (BasPrpC) are the most conserved mediators of signaling events in diverse bacteria. BasPrkC homolog in Bacillus subtilis regulates critical processes like spore germination and BasPrpC modulates the activity of BasPrkC by dephosphorylation. So far. biochemical and genetic studies have provided important insights into the roles of BasPrkC and BasPrpC; however. regulation of their activities is not known. We studied the regulation of BasPrkC/BasPrpC pair and observed that Zn2+ metal ions can alter their activities. Zn2+ promotes BasPrkC kinase activity while inhibits the BasPrpC phosphatase activity.

PrkC is shown to be important for B. anthracis pathogenesis. but little is known about its other functions and phosphorylated substrates. Systemic analyses indicate the compelling role of PrkC in phosphorylating multiple substrates. including the essential chaperone GroEL.

This plasmid encodes multiple virulence-associated genes. including mup011. which is an uncharacterized Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) PknQ.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. we have characterized PknQ and explored its interaction with MupFHA (Mup018c). a FHA domain containing protein also encoded by pMUM001. MupFHA was found to interact with PknQ and suppress its autophosphorylation. Subsequent protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation analyses showed that this interaction involves the FHA domain of MupFHA and PknQ activation loop residues Ser170 and Thr174. FHA domains are known to recognize phosphothreonine residues. and therefore. MupFHA may be acting as one of the few unusual FHA-domain having overlapping specificity. Additionally. we elucidated the PknQ-dependent regulation of MupDivIVA (Mup012c). which is a DivIVA domain containing protein encoded by pMUM001. MupDivIVA interacts with MupFHA and this interaction may also involve phospho-threonine/serine residues of MupDivIVA.  Conclusions/Significance Together. these results describe novel signaling mechanisms in M. ulcerans and show a three-way regulation of PknQ. MupFHA. and MupDivIVA. FHA domains have been considered to be only pThr specific and our results indicate a novel mechanism of pSer as well as pThr interaction exhibited by MupFHA.

The expression and function of TMH1.7 mutant P-gp with twelve mutations was characterized using the BacMam baculovirus-HeLa cell expression system. The expression and conformation of TMH1.7 mutant P-gp was not altered by the introduction of the twelve mutations. as confirmed by using the human P-gp-specific antibodies UIC2. MRK16 and 4E3.

In this present study. we investigated the cholesterol-lowering activity of three major polyphenolic compounds found in grape seed. The results showed that gallic acid. catechin. and epicatechin significantly inhibited pancreatic cholesterol esterase in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover. they bound to taurocholic acid. taurodeoxycholic acid. and glycodeoxycholic acid at levels ranging from 38.6% to 28.2%. At the concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. gallic acid. catechin. and epicatechin reduced the formation of cholesterol micelles 27.26±2.17%. 11.88±0.75%. and 19.49±3.71%. respectively. These findings clearly demonstrate that three major polyphenolic compounds present in a particular grape seed have cholesterol-lowering activity by inhibiting pancreatic cholesterol esterase. binding of bile acids. and reducing solubility of cholesterol in micelles which may result in delayed cholesterol absorption.

However. little is known about the antiglycation properties of cinnamic acid and its derivatives. The present study sought to characterize the protein glycation inhibitory activity of cinnamic acid and its derivatives in a bovine serum albumin (BSA)/fructose system. The results demonstrated that cinnamic acid and its derivatives significantly inhibited the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by approximately 11.96–63.36% at a concentration of 1 mM. The strongest inhibitory activity against the formation of AGEs was shown by cinnamic acid. Furthermore. cinnamic acid and its derivatives reduced the level of fructosamine. the formation of N ε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML). and the level of amyloid cross β-structure. Cinnamic acid and its derivatives also prevented oxidative protein damages. including effects on protein carbonyl formation and thiol oxidation of BSA. Our findings may lead to the possibility of using cinnamic acid and its derivatives for preventing AGE-mediated diabetic complications.

Eleven T2DM and ten healthy subjects underwent a high-fat meal loading. Erythrocytes were isolated from blood obtained after fasting and 4 h after the meal. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was initially used to screen erythrocyte PLs by monitoring CH stretching vibrations. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species were further investigated by Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionisation-Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). For the control group. FTIR revealed postprandial changes in CH stretching vibrations. particularly of the olefinic band. These findings were supported by LC-ESI-MS data. showing marked changes in PC molecular species. especially of the PC34: 1 (where 34 and 1 mean the summed number of carbons and double bonds. respectively). However. similar changes of those were not apparent in the T2DM group.

Metal ligands can stabilize the native structure and/or play critical catalytic roles in the underlying biochemistry. An atom’s chemical shift is exquisitely sensitive to its electronic environment. Chemical shift data can provide valuable insights into structural features. including metal ligation.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,One of the most challenging problems facing the field of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy is the lack of generally accepted. uniform criteria for defining the precision and accuracy of structures derived from NMR data. Although widely cited. metrics such as residual constraint violations. constraints per residue. and convergence across an ensemble of conformers [root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs)] provide necessary. but not sufficient. criteria for defining a good-quality solution NMR structure. Most importantly. none of these measures have standard conventions by which they are computed; each measure is assessed somewhat differently in different laboratories. using subjective criteria which may not be possible to reproduce in another laboratory. Owing to the lack of widely accepted algorithms and conventions for making these assessments. the same structure analyzed by different groups will often yield different structure quality assessment statistics.Two articles in this issue of Proteins demonstrate the pressing need for establishing community-wide standards for defining the accuracy and precision of NMR-derived protein structures. In one article. Snyder and Montelione present a method for determining internally well-defined “core atom set (s)” based on distance variance matrices. and for calculating a “joint RMSD” quantifying the precision of an ensemble of NMR-derived structures.

Typically. the RMSD. as minimized in superimposing the ensemble of structures. is the preferred measure of precision. However. the presence of poorly determined atomic coordinates and multiple “RMSD‐stable domains”—locally well‐defined regions that are not aligned in global superimpositions—complicate RMSD calculations. In this paper. we present a method. based on a novel. structurally defined order parameter. for identifying a set of core atoms to use in determining superimpositions for RMSD calculations.

However. direct observation of certain kinds of correlations can be very time-consuming due to limitations in sensitivity and resolution. Covariance NMR derives correlations between spins via the calculation of a (symmetric) covariance matrix. from which a matrix-square root produces a spectrum with enhanced resolution. Recently. the covariance concept has been adopted to the reconstruction of nonsymmetric spectra from pairs of 2D spectra that have a frequency dimension in common. Since the unsymmetric covariance NMR procedure lacks the matrix-square root step. it does not suppress relay effects and thereby may generate false positive signals due to chemical shift degeneracy.

DnaJ. is to co-chaperone the binding of misfolded or alternatively folded proteins to bacterial Hsp70. DnaK. which is an ATP-fuelled unfolding chaperone. In addition to its DnaK targeting activity. DnaJ has a weak thiol-reductase activity. In between the substrate-binding domain and the J-domain anchor to DnaK. DnaJ has a unique domain with four conserved CXXC motives that bind two Zn2+ and partly contribute to polypeptide binding. Here. we deleted in DnaJ this Zn-binding domain. which is characteristic to type I but not of type II or III J-proteins. This caused a loss of the thiol-reductase activity and strongly reduced the ability of DnaJ to mediate the ATP- and DnaK-dependent unfolding/refolding of mildly oxidized misfolded polypeptides. an inhibition that was alleviated in the presence of thioredoxin or DTT. We suggest that in addition to their general ability to target misfolded polypeptide substrates to the Hsp70/Hsp110 chaperone machinery. Type I J-proteins carry an ancillary protein dithiol-isomerase function that can synergize the unfolding action of the chaperone. in the particular case of substrates that are further stabilized by non-native disulfide bonds.

1076810,Mechanistic insights into cytosolic molecular chaperones in protein unfolding and disaggregation,2014,Rayees Ul Hassan Mattoo,,,,,,Under optimal non-physiological conditions of low concentrations and low temperatures. proteins may spontaneously fold to the native state. as all the information for folding lies in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. However. under conditions of stress or high protein crowding as inside cells. a polypeptide may misfold and enter an aggregation pathway resulting in the formation of misfolded conformers and fibrils. which can be toxic and lead to neurodegenerative illnesses. such as Alzheimer’s. Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases and aging in general. To avert and revert protein misfolding and aggregation. cells have evolved a set of proteins called molecular chaperones. Here. I focussed on the human cytosolic chaperones Hsp70 (DnaK) and Hsp110. and co-chaperone Hsp40 (DnaJ). and the chaperonin CCT (GroEL). The cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsp70s/Hsp110s and the chaperonins are highly upregulated in bacterial and human cells under different stresses and are involved both in the prevention and the reversion of protein misfolding and aggregation. Hsp70 works in collaboration with Hsp40 to reactivate misfolded or aggregated proteins in a strict ATP dependent manner. Chaperonins (CCT and GroEL) also unfold and reactivate stably misfolded proteins but we found that it needed to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis in order to evict oversticky misfolded intermediates that inhibited the unfoldase catalytic sites.In this study. we initially characterized a particular type of inactive misfolded monomeric luciferase and rhodanese species that were obtained by repeated cycles of freeze-thawing (FT).

This seminal finding implied that the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide suffices to determine its native biologically active conformation (Anfinsen. 1973). Yet Anfinsen also observed that following artificial unfolding by urea. the yield of recovered native proteins decreased significantly as the temperature and protein concentration increased. suggesting that alternative nonproductive misfolding and aggregation pathways can compete with the physiological native refolding pathway of proteins.

These comparisons were performed to identify if an elevated fraction existed in Gammagard. which reported small putative benefits in a recent Phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer’s Disease. The fraction of anti-oligomeric Aβ IgG was found to be higher in Octagam. for which no cognitive benefits were reported. The fraction and location of surface-accessible sialic acid in the Fab domain was found to be similar between Gammagard and Octagam.

To prevent potential errors in protein synthesis caused by misactivation of noncognate amino acids. some synthetases have evolved editing mechanisms to hydrolyze misactivated amino acids (pre-transfer editing) or misacylated tRNAs (post-transfer editing). In the case of post-transfer editing. synthetases employ a separate editing domain that is distinct from the site of amino acid activation. and the mechanism is believed to involve shuttling of the flexible CCA-3′ end of the tRNA from the synthetic active site to the site of hydrolysis.

Here. we reviewed the current knowledge about the role of oxidative stress on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. We focused on the impact of antioxidants. like NADPH and glutathione. and redox proteins. such as thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase. that maintain the disulfide-thiol balance in the cell.

DNA and protein integrity and larval survival. To reduce the loss of sperm quality due to freezing-thawing. it is necessary to improve these procedures. In the present study we investigated the ability of two antifreeze proteins (AFPI and AFPIII) to reduce the loss of quality of sea bream spermatozoa due to cryopreservation. To do so. we compared viability. motility. straight-line velocity and curvilinear velocity of fresh and (AFPs)-cryopreserved spermatozoa. AFPIII addition to cryopreservation medium improved viability. motility and straight-line velocity with respect to DMSO or DMSO plus AFPI. To clarify the molecular mechanism(s) underlying these findings. the protein profile of two different cryopreserved sperm domains. flagella and head plasma membranes. was analysed. The protein profiles differed between fresh and frozen-thawed semen and results of the image analysis demonstrated that. after cryopreservation. out of 270 proteins 12 were decreased and 7 were increased in isolated flagella. and out of 150 proteins 6 showed a significant decrease and 4 showed a significant increase in head membranes.

T3 and T2. on hepatic fatty acids: differences in metabolic effects and molecular mechanisms,2017,Fabrizio Damiano and Alessio Rochira and Antonio Gnoni and Luisa Siculella,18,,4,744,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The thyroid hormones (THs) 3. 3′. 5. 5′-tetraiodo-l-thyronine (T4) and 3. 5. 3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) influence many metabolic pathways. The major physiological function of THs is to sustain basal energy expenditure. by acting primarily on carbohydrate and lipid catabolism. Beyond the mobilization and degradation of lipids. at the hepatic level THs stimulate the de novo fatty acid synthesis (de novo lipogenesis. DNL). through both the modulation of gene expression and the rapid activation of cell signalling pathways. 3. 5-Diiodo-l-thyronine (T2). previously considered only a T3 catabolite. has been shown to mimic some of T3 effects on lipid catabolism. However. T2 action is more rapid than that of T3. and seems to be independent of protein synthesis. An inhibitory effect on DNL has been documented for T2. Here. we give an overview of the mechanisms of THs action on liver fatty acid metabolism. focusing on the different effects exerted by T2 and T3 on the regulation of the DNL. The inhibitory action on DNL exerted by T2 makes this compound a potential and attractive drug for the treatment of some metabolic diseases and cancer.

The F1 moiety of the complex protrudes at the inner side of the membrane. the Fo sector spans the membrane reaching the outer side. The IF1 component of the mitochondrial complex is a basic 10 kDa protein. which inhibits the FoF1-ATP hydrolase activity.

1076963,Hydroxytyrosol ameliorates endothelial function under inflammatory conditions by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction,2018,Nadia Calabriso and Antonio Gnoni and Eleonora Stanca and Alessandro Cavallo and Fabrizio Damiano and Luisa Siculella and Maria Annunziata Carluccio,2018,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,,,Hindawi,Mitochondria are fundamental organelles producing energy and reactive oxygen species (ROS); their impaired functions play a key role in endothelial dysfunction. Hydroxytyrosol (HT). a well-known olive oil antioxidant. exerts health benefits against vascular diseases by improving endothelial function. However. the HT role in mitochondrial oxidative stress in endothelial dysfunction is not clear yet. To investigate the HT effects on mitochondrial ROS production in the inflamed endothelium. we used an in vitro model of endothelial dysfunction represented by cultured endothelial cells. challenged with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). an inflammatory. prooxidant. and proangiogenic agent. We found that the pretreatment of endothelial cells with HT (1–30 μmol/L) suppressed inflammatory angiogenesis. a crucial aspect of endothelial dysfunction. The HT inhibitory effect is related to reduced mitochondrial superoxide production and lipid peroxidation and to increased superoxide dismutase activity. HT. in a concentration-dependent manner. improved endothelial mitochondrial function by reverting the PMA-induced reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. ATP synthesis. and ATP5β expression. In PMA-challenged endothelial cells. HT also promoted mitochondrial biogenesis through increased mitochondrial DNA content and expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha. nuclear respiratory factor-1. and mitochondrial transcription factor A. These results highlight that HT blunts endothelial dysfunction and pathological angiogenesis by ameliorating mitochondrial function. thus suggesting HT as a potential …,True,uZKDT2EAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,29,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2018/9086947/abs/,7825083056885448835,/scholar?cites=7825083056885448835,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2018/9086947/abs/,0,0,0

In the present study. short-term effects of T2 administration to hypothyroid rats on fatty acid oxidation rate and bioenergetic parameters were investigated. Within 1 h following T2 injection. state 3 and state 4 respiration rates. which were reduced in hypothyroid mitochondria. were noticeably increased particularly in succinate- with respect to glutamate/malate-energized mitochondria. Maximal respiratory activity. observed when glutamate/malate/succinate were simultaneously present in the respiratory medium. was significantly stimulated by T2 treatment. A T2-induced increase in respiratory rates was also observed when palmitoyl-CoA or L-palmitoylcarnitine were used as substrates. No significant change in respiratory control index and ADP/O ratio was observed. The activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. especially Complex II. were increased in T2-treated rats. In the latter. Complex V activities. assayed in both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis direction. were enhanced. The rate of fatty acid oxidation. followed by conversion of [14C]palmitate to CO2 and ketone bodies. was higher in hepatocytes isolated from T2-treated rats. This increase occurs in parallel with the raise in the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I. the rate limiting enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation. assayed in situ in digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes. Overall. these results indicate that T2 rapidly increases the ability of mitochondria to import and oxidize fatty acids.

OA and HTyr inhibited both de novo fatty acid and cholesterol syntheses without affecting cell viability. The inhibitory effect of the individual compounds was more pronounced if OA and HTyr were administered in combination. A reduction of polar lipid biosynthesis was also detected. while triglyceride synthesis was marginally affected. To clarify the lipid-lowering mechanism of these compounds. their effects on the activity of key enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase-ACC and fatty acid synthase-FAS) and cholesterologenesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase-HMGCR) were investigated in situ by using digitonin-permeabilized C6 cells. ACC and HMGCR activities were especially reduced after 4 h of 25 μM OA and HTyr treatment. No change in FAS activity was observed.

Methodology/Principal Findings To analyze the role of RubisCO in carboxysome biogenesis in vivo we have created a series of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus RubisCO mutants. We identified the large subunit of the enzyme as an important determinant for its sequestration into α-carboxysomes and found that the carboxysomes of H. neapolitanus readily incorporate chimeric and heterologous RubisCO species. Intriguingly. a mutant lacking carboxysomal RubisCO assembles empty carboxysome shells of apparently normal shape and composition.

They have evolved a CO 2-concentrating-mechanism. of which the central component is the carboxysome. a self-assembling proteinaceous organelle. Two types of carboxysome. α and β. encapsulating form IA and form IB d-ribulose-1. 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. respectively. differ in gene organization and associated proteins. In contrast to the β-carboxysome. the assembly process of the α-carboxysome is enigmatic. Moreover. an absolutely conserved α-carboxysome protein. CsoS2. is of unknown function and has proven recalcitrant to crystallization. Here. we present studies on the CsoS2 protein in three model organisms and show that CsoS2 is vital for α-carboxysome biogenesis. The primary structure of CsoS2 appears tripartite. composed of an N-terminal. middle (M)-. and C-terminal region. Repetitive motifs can be identified in the N-and M-regions. Multiple lines of evidence suggest CsoS2 is highly flexible. possibly an intrinsically disordered protein. Based on our results from bioinformatic. biophysical. genetic and biochemical approaches. including peptide array scanning for protein-protein interactions. we propose a model for CsoS2 function and its spatial location in the α-carboxysome. Analogies between the pathway for β-carboxysome biogenesis and our model for α-carboxysome assembly are discussed.

The current antibiotics used for treating clinical toxoplasmosis are limited. In addition. they exhibit adverse side effects in certain groups of people. Therefore. discovery of novel therapeutics for clinical toxoplasmosis is imperative. The first step of novel antibiotic development is to identify chemical compounds showing high efficacy in inhibition of parasite growth using a high throughput screening strategy. As an obligate intracellular pathogen. Toxoplasma can only replicate within host cells. which prohibits the use of optical absorbance measurements as a quick indicator of growth. Presented here is a detailed protocol for a luciferase-based growth assay. As an example. this method is used to calculate the doubling time of wild-type Toxoplasma parasites and measure the efficacy of morpholinurea-leucyl-homophenyl-vinyl sulfone …,True,SbUOb0QAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599073/,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599073/,0,0,0

Previous studies have shown that genetic ablation of a VAC-residing cysteine protease. cathepsin protease L (CPL). resulted in accumulation of undigested protein in the VAC and loss of parasite viability during the chronic stage of infection. However. since the maturation of another VAC localizing protease. cathepsin protease B (CPB). is dependent on CPL. it remained unknown whether these defects result directly from ablation of CPL or indirectly from a lack of CPB maturation. Likewise. although a previously described cathepsin D-like aspartyl protease 1 (ASP1) could also play a role in proteolysis. its definitive residence and function in the Toxoplasma endolysosomal system was not well defined. Here we demonstrate that CPB is not necessary for protein turnover in the VAC and that CPB deficient parasites have normal growth and viability in both the acute and chronic stages of infection. We also show that ASP1 depends on CPL for correct maturation and it resides in the T. gondii VAC where. similar to CPB. it plays a dispensable role in protein digestion. Taken together with previous work. our findings suggest that CPL is the dominant protease in a hierarchy of proteolytic enzymes within the VAC. This unusual lack of redundancy for CPL in T. gondii makes it a single exploitable target for disrupting chronic toxoplasmosis.,True,SbUOb0QAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/835405v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/11/08/835405.full.pdf,0,0,0

Microbial pathogens can acquire heme by de novo synthesis and incorporation of exogenous heme or heme biosynthetic intermediates1.2. Intracellular pathogenic microbes switch their heme resources by adapting the fluctuation of heme availability during the change of their replicative environment through infections2. Here. we show that the Toxoplasma gondii. an obligate intracellular human pathogen. encodes an active de novo heme biosynthetic pathway for heme supply. Genetical and chemical manipulation of this pathway revealed that T. gondii essentially requires its de novo heme production for its intracellular growth and pathogenesis. Revisit of tetrapyrrole synthesis inhibitors used in weed control identified oxadiazon as an inhibitor of Toxoplasma growth. Two derivatives synthesized in this study showed improved efficacies by 15- to 25-fold compared to oxadiazon. providing evidence that the interference in the de novo heme production in Toxoplasma is a potential therapeutic strategy to control infection. Additionally. due to its tractable genetics. T. gondii has been used as a model for studying the biology of apicomplexan parasites3. Thus. our study can serve as a model to help understand heme metabolism in other pathogenic apicomplexans.,True,SbUOb0QAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/753863v1.full-text,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/753863v1.full-text,0,0,0

The parasites harbor a lysosome-like digestive vacuole. termed the “Vacuolar Compartment/Plant-Like Vacuole” (VAC/PLV). which plays an important role in maintaining the lytic cycle and virulence of T. gondii. The VAC supplies proteolytic enzymes that are required to mature the parasite’s invasion effectors and that digest autophagosomes and endocytosed host proteins. Previous work identified a T. gondii ortholog of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) that localized to the VAC. Here. we show that TgCRT is a membrane transporter that is functionally similar to PfCRT. We also genetically ablate TgCRT and reveal that TgCRT protein plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the parasite’s endolysosomal system by controlling morphology of the VAC. When TgCRT is absent. the VAC dramatically increases in size by ~15-fold and co-localizes with its adjacent endosome-like compartment. Presumably to reduce aberrant swelling. transcription and translation of endolysosomal proteases are decreased in ΔTgCRT parasites. Expression of one endolysosomal subtilisin protease is quite significantly reduced. which impedes trimming of micronemal proteins. and significantly decreases parasite invasion. Chemical and genetic inhibition of proteolysis within the VAC reverses these effects. reducing VAC size and partially restoring the endolysosomal system. micronemal protein trimming. and invasion.

We observed a rapid but steady percent increase in wild-type parasites with regard to both Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt between 2008 and 2011 (p<0.0001). Equally. a significant reciprocate decrease in AQ and CQ median IC50 values occurred (p<0.0001) during the same period. Thus. the data in this study point to a significantly rapid change in parasite response to AQ and CQ in the study period. This may be due to releasing of drug pressure on the parasite from reduced use of AQ in the face of increased Artemisinin (ART) Combination Therapy (ACT) administration following the intervention of the Global Fund in 2008.

Despite health concerns posed by resurgence of these viruses. little is known about EV68 strains circulating in Kenya. In this study. we characterized 13 EV68 strains isolated in Kenya between 2008 and 2011 based on the Hypervariable 3′- end of the VP1 gene. Viral RNA was extracted from the isolates and partial VP1 gene amplified by RT-PCR. followed by nucleotide sequencing. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences revealed substitutions in Kenyan EV68 isolates absent in the prototype reference strain (Fermon). The majority of these changes were present in the BC and DE-loop regions. which are associated with viral antigenicity and virulence. The Kenyan strains exhibited high sequence homology with respect to those from other countries. Natural selection analysis based on the VP1 region showed that the Kenyan EV68 isolates were under purifying selection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that majority (84.6%) of the Kenyan strains belonged to clade A. while a minority belonged to clades B and C. Overall. our results illustrate that although EV68 strains isolated in Kenya were genetically and antigenically divergent from the prototype strain (Fermon). they were closely related to those circulating in other countries. suggesting worldwide transmissibility.

Though studied broadly in several regions of the world. the genetic diversity of human enteroviruses (HEV) circulating in the sub-Saharan Africa remains under-documented. In the current study. we molecularly typed 61 HEV strains isolated in Kenya between 2008 and 2011 targeting the 3′-end of the VP1 gene. Viral RNA was extracted from the archived isolates and part of the VP1 gene amplified by RT-PCR. followed by sequence analysis. Twenty-two different EV types were detected. Majority (72.0 %) of these belonged to Enterovirus B species followed by Enterovirus D (21.3 %) and Enterovirus A (6.5 %). The most frequently detected types were Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68). followed by Coxsackievirus B2 (CV-B2). CV-B1. CV-B4 and CV-B3. Phylogenetic analyses of these viruses revealed that Kenyan CV-B1 isolates were segregated among sequences of global CV-B1 strains. Conversely. the Kenyan CV-B2. CV-B3. CV-B4 and EV-D68 strains generally grouped together with those detected from other countries. Notably. the Kenyan EV-D68 strains largely clustered with sequences of global strains obtained between 2008 and 2010 than those circulating in recent years.

1077078,Structural studies of type I topoisomerases,2009,Nicole M Baker and Rakhi Rajan and Alfonso Mondragón,37,,3,693-701,Oxford University Press,Topoisomerases are ubiquitous proteins found in all three domains of life. They change the topology of DNA via transient breaks on either one or two of the DNA strands to allow passage of another single or double DNA strand through the break. Topoisomerases are classified into two types: type I enzymes cleave one DNA strand and pass either one or two DNA strands through the break before resealing it. while type II molecules cleave both DNA strands in concert and pass another double strand through the break followed by religation of the double strand break. Here we review recent work on the structure of type I enzymes. These structural studies are providing atomic details that. together with the existing wealth of biochemical and biophysical data. are bringing our understanding of the mechanism of action of these enzymes to the atomic level.,True,6TyRb4MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,104,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/37/3/693/1073549,5571728537236353313,/scholar?cites=5571728537236353313,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/37/3/693/1073549,0,0,0

1077112,Conserved DNA motifs in the type II-A CRISPR leader region,2017,Mason J Van Orden and Peter Klein and Kesavan Babu and Fares Z Najar and Rakhi Rajan,5,PeerJ,,e3161,PeerJ Inc.,The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats associated (CRISPR-Cas) systems consist of RNA-protein complexes that provide bacteria and archaea with sequence-specific immunity against bacteriophages. plasmids. and other mobile genetic elements. Bacteria and archaea become immune to phage or plasmid infections by inserting short pieces of the intruder DNA (spacer) site-specifically into the leader-repeat junction in a process called adaptation. Previous studies have shown that parts of the leader region. especially the 3′ end of the leader. are indispensable for adaptation. However. a comprehensive analysis of leader ends remains absent. Here. we have analyzed the leader. repeat. and Cas proteins from 167 type II-A CRISPR loci. Our results indicate two distinct conserved DNA motifs at the 3′ leader end: ATTTGAG (noted previously in the CRISPR1 locus of Streptococcus thermophilus DGCC7710) and a newly defined CTRCGAG. associated with the CRISPR3 locus of S. thermophilus DGCC7710. A third group with a very short CG DNA conservation at the 3′ leader end is observed mostly in lactobacilli. Analysis of the repeats and Cas proteins revealed clustering of these CRISPR components that mirrors the leader motif clustering. in agreement with the coevolution of CRISPR-Cas components. Based on our analysis of the type II-A CRISPR loci. we implicate leader end sequences that could confer site-specificity for the adaptation-machinery in the different subsets of type II-A CRISPR loci.,True,6TyRb4MAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,2,https://peerj.com/articles/3161/,2541049599858233956,/scholar?cites=2541049599858233956,,https://peerj.com/articles/3161/,0,0,0

We previously showed that proline substitutions in the bridge helix (BH) impart target DNA cleavage selectivity in Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) Cas9. Here. we examined a BH variant of Cas12a from Francisella novicida (FnoCas12aKD2P) to test mechanistic conservation. Our results show that for RNA‐guided DNA cleavage (cis‐activity). FnoCas12aKD2P accumulates nicked products while cleaving supercoiled DNA substrates with mismatches. with certain mismatch positions being more detrimental for linearization. FnoCas12aKD2P also possess reduced trans single‐stranded DNA cleavage activity. These results implicate the BH in substrate selectivity in both cis‐ and trans‐ cleavages and show its conserved role in target discrimination among Cas nucleases.,True,6TyRb4MAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,0,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1873-3468.14051,,,,,0,0,0
1077119,The CRISPR-Cas Mechanism for Adaptive Immunity and Alternate Bacterial Functions Fuels Diverse Biotechnologies,2021,Sydney Newsom and Hari Priya Parameshwaran and Lindsie Martin and Rakhi Rajan,10,,,898,Frontiers,Bacterial and archaeal CRISPR-Cas systems offer adaptive immune protection against foreign mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This function is regulated by sequence specific binding of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target DNA/RNA. with an additional requirement of a flanking DNA motif called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in certain CRISPR systems. In this review. we discuss how the same fundamental mechanism of RNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA complementarity is utilized by bacteria to regulate two distinct functions: to ward off intruding genetic materials and to modulate diverse physiological functions. The best documented examples of alternate functions are bacterial virulence. biofilm formation. adherence. programmed cell death. and quorum sensing. While extensive complementarity between the crRNA and the targeted DNA and/or RNA seems to constitute an efficient phage protection system. partial complementarity seems to be the key for several of the characterized alternate functions. Cas proteins are also involved in sequence-specific and non-specific RNA cleavage and control of transcriptional regulator expression. the mechanisms of which are still elusive. Over the past decade. the mechanisms of RNA-guided targeting and auxiliary functions of several Cas proteins have been transformed into powerful gene editing and biotechnological tools. We provide a synopsis of CRISPR technologies in this review. Even with the abundant mechanistic insights and biotechnology tools that are currently available. the discovery of new and diverse CRISPR types holds promise for future technological innovations. which will pave the way for …,True,6TyRb4MAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,0,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.619763/full,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.619763/full,0,0,0

Prokaryotes gain immunity by acquiring short pieces of the invading nucleic acid termed prespacers and inserting them into their CRISPR array. In type II-A systems. Cas1 and Cas2 proteins insert prespacers always at the leader–repeat junction of the CRISPR array. Among type II-A CRISPR systems. three distinct groups (G1.

Clove buds (Syzygium aromaticum L.) are one of the richest sources of dietary polyphenols with many traditional medicinal uses. Hence. the present work attempted to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of a standardized polyphenol-rich extract of clove buds (Clovinol). The experiment was conducted on Wistar rats designated into three groups. First group was vehicle control and hepatotoxicity was induced to the second group by the administration of ethanol at the fixed dose of 12.5 g/kg body wt.. orally for 30 days. Clovinol (100 mg/kg body wt.) was co-administered with ethanol in the third group. The liver toxicity was assessed by the estimation of liver marker enzymes in addition to which. assays of antioxidant enzymes. inflammatory markers. and liver histopathology studies were also conducted. Ethanol treatment significantly increased (p< 0.05) liver function markers (SGOT and SGPT) and reduced (p< 0.05) the antioxidant enzymes (SOD. CAT. and GPx) and GSH. It also increased the WBC count. inflammatory markers (nitrite. CRP. COX-2. IL-6 and TNF-α) and lipid peroxidation. significantly (p< 0.05). Supplementation of Clovinol showed significant (p< 0.05) reversal of all these biochemical and molecular variables indicating the efficacy of Clovinol in the downregulation of alcohol-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory changes. bringing about a significant reduction in the associated liver pathology.

The biochemical experiments show that TREX proteins are potent enzymes. TREX1 recognize and catalyze ssDNA 100 times efficiently than that of TREX2. In order to explore the biochemical and structural differences between the TREX1 and TREX2 enzymes. the mTREX1 and hTREX2 has been crystallized as substrate or product complexes. Structures of complexes with both proteins show specific interactions that are essential for recognition of 3'termini of DNA as well as distinguishing damaged or modified nucleotides from normal nucleotides. The mTREX1 structure also shows a polyproline type II helix. a protein--protein interaction motif. that may play a role in interactions with the SET protein. The DNA in the crystal lattice of the hTREX2 structure suggests how the TREX proteins interact with double stranded DNA. Binding studies of TREX proteins using fluorescence anisotropy show differences on how the dimeric TREX1 and TREX2 interact with DNA. The TREX1 protein seems to bind DNA with equal affinity to each monomer. In contrast. TREX2 displays an asymmetry to binding. which is also seen in the crystal structure. Finally. comparisons of DEDDh and DEDDy subfamilies of DnaQ family members point to subtle differences that distinguish them on their catalytic mechanism.

In addition. proximity measurements support formation of preassembled apo-GHSR1a:DRD1:Gαq heteromeric complexes in hippocampal neurons.

The main hormone regulating the production of corticosterone is the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). Adrenals of POMC-deficient (POMC-/-) mice do not produce corticosterone. neither at basal levels nor in response to acute stimulation with ACTH. However. pharmacological amounts of ACTH delivered continuously elicit corticosterone production over time. To define the relative effects of ACTH on individual factors involved in corticosterone production. parameters of adrenal cholesterol metabolism and steroidogenesis were examined in POMC-/-mice in comparison to wildtype and ACTH-treated mutant mice. POMC-/-adrenals lack cholesterol esters (CE); adrenal CE is restored with ACTH treatment. However. discontinuation of ACTH treatment stops corticosterone production despite presence of adrenal CE. Failure of corticosterone production by POMC-/-adrenals occurs despite the constitutive presence of transcripts of genes required for cholesterol metabolism and steroidogenesis. Levels of key proteins involved in selective-cholesterol uptake and steroidogenesis were attenuated; ACTH treatment increased these protein levels. most significantly those of the receptor responsible for selective uptake of CE. scavenger receptor class B. type I (SR-BI).

To address this challenge. we developed a hydrogel-based encapsulation system for GMMs that incorporates a biocompatible multilayer tough shell and an alginate-based core. This DEployable Physical COntainment Strategy (DEPCOS) allows no detectable GMM escape. bacteria to be protected against environmental insults including antibiotics and low pH. controllable lifespan. and easy retrieval of genetically recoded bacteria. To highlight the versatility of a DEPCOS. we demonstrate that robustly encapsulated cells can execute useful functions. including performing cell-cell communication with other encapsulated bacteria and sensing heavy metals in water samples from the Charles River. We envision that our multilayered physical and chemical containment strategy will facilitate the realization of a wide range of real-world applications for 9living9 biosensors.,True,bkYCje4AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,5,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.941120v1.abstract,10168412846581416633,/scholar?cites=10168412846581416633,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/13/2020.02.11.941120.full.pdf,0,0,0

InTech",,269-308,,Each year billions of dollars are spent worldwide on insect control in agriculture [1]. Despite this expenditure. up to 40% of a crop can be lost to insect damage. particularly in developing countries [2]. Some of the most damaging insect species belong to the Lepidoptera. the second largest insect order comprised of moths and butterflies. The larval stage of moths cause major damage to an array of economically valuable crops including cotton. tobacco. tomato. corn. sorghum. lucerne. sunflower. pulses. and wheat [3]. Until recently. broad spectrum chemical insecticides have been the primary control agent for agricultural pests. with about 40% targeted to the control of lepidopteran insects [4]. Over the years the widespread use of pesticides has led to pesticide resistant insects. a reduction in beneficial insect populations and harmful effects to humans and the environment [5-8]. These problems have led researchers to develop different insect control strategies using both synthetic and natural molecules that are more environmentally friendly.One such approach has been the use of transgenic plants expressing plant defence molecules. Genetic modification can potentially provide a much larger array of novel insecticidal genes that are otherwise beyond the scope of conventional breeding. The first transgenic plant that expressed an insecticidal gene was produced in 1987. The transgenic tobacco plant produced cowpea trypsin inhibitor at levels of up to 1% of the soluble protein and had enhanced protection against the lepidopteran pest Heliothis virescens [9. 10].

In metazoan cells. most if not all cohesin dissociates from chromatin during mitotic prophase. leading to the formation of metaphase chromosomes with two cytologically discernible chromatids. This process. known as sister chromatid resolution. is believed to be a prerequisite for synchronous separation of sister chromatids in subsequent anaphase. To dissect this process at a mechanistic level. we set up an in vitro system. Sister chromatid resolution is severely impaired upon depletion of Wapl from Xenopus egg extracts. Exogenously added human Wapl can rescue these defects and. remarkably. it can do so in a very short time window of early mitosis.

When the relative ratio of condensin I to II is forced to be smaller. embryonic chromosomes become shorter and thicker. being reminiscent of somatic chromosomes. Further depletion of condensin II unveils its contribution to axial shortening of chromosomes.

To address this question. we have established a biochemically tractable system in which mitotic chromatids can be reconstituted in vitro by mixing a simple substrate (sperm nucleus) and a limited number of purified factors. The minimum set of required factors includes core histones. three histone chaperones. topoisomerase II. and condensin I.

It has long been a big mystery how long stretches of DNA might be folded into rod-shaped chromosomes or how such an elaborate process might be accomplished at a mechanistic level.

Moreover. the core part of the chromosome assembly reaction can now be reconstituted with a limited number of purified factors.

Plants have the additional requirement to sort protein between mitochondria and plastids. and yet there are also many cases of dual-targeted proteins. The machinery that achieved this process. the mitochondrial protein import apparatus. is composed of a variety of multi-subunit protein complexes on the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. In plant mitochondria. there are differences in protein composition and/or function in the translocase of the outer membrane and in the intermembrane space. Furthermore. whereas the inner membrane translocases appear more conserved. there is an expansion in the preprotein and amino acid transporter (PRAT) family of proteins that …,True,HD1EDFUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123942791000119,10870210725554180606,/scholar?cites=10870210725554180606,,,0,0,0

This study identified two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) proteins. Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component). which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA insertion lines displayed a severely delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-binding domain of Tric1 and Tric2. a sterile-a-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein. was required to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The purified predicted tRNA-binding domain binds the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine with conserved lysine residues required for binding. T-DNA inactivation of both Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in organello protein synthesis. which was mediated by a reorganization of the nuclear transcriptome. in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and supports the theory that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting protein import apparatus.Mitochondria are essential organelles found in almost all eukaryotic cells and are involved in multiple critical functions.

Anthropometric. clinical and biochemical parameters as well as genotyping for 894G> T.-786T> C variants of eNOS gene by PCR-RFLP and 4a/b by direct PCR were performed in 886 Saudi Arabians (477 MetS and 409 Non-MetS). The genotype distribution (TT. p= 0.001; TC. p= 0.001; TC+ CC. p= 0.001) and allele (T. p= 0.007; C. p= 0.007) frequency of the-786T> C SNP were significantly different between Non-MetS and MetS subjects which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Moreover: 1) the GT and GT+ TT genotypes of the 894G> T SNP were associated with elevated blood pressure (p= 0.017. and p= 0.022. respectively); 2) the ab variant of 4a/b polymorphism was associated with decreased HDL levels (p= 0.044); and 3) the TC+ CC genotype and C allele of the-786T> C SNP were associated with increased fasting glucose levels (p= 0.039. and p= 0.028. respectively). Also. GaC was identified as the risk haplotype for MetS susceptibility (p= 0.034). The results suggest a significant association of 894G> T. 4a/b and-786T> C polymorphisms with MetS and its components is present in an Arab population.

The mechanisms by which DIM and ring-DIMs induce autophagy have not been elucidated. As DIM is a mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor. we hypothesized that DIM and ring-DIMs induce autophagy via alteration of intracellular AMP/ATP ratios and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in prostate cancer cells. We found that DIM and ring-DIMs induced autophagy was accompanied by increased autophagic vacuole formation and conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII in LNCaP and C42B human prostate cancer cells.

However. the influence of pro-inflammatory adipokines on blood pressure in the obese hypertensive phenotype has not been well established in Saudi subjects. As such. our study investigated whether inflammatory factors may represent useful biomarkers to delineate hypertension risk in a Saudi cohort with and without hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2). Subjects were subdivided into four groups: healthy lean controls (age: 47.9±5.1 yr; BMI: 22.9±2.1 Kg/m2). non-hypertensive obese (age: 46.1±5.0 yr; BMI: 33.7±4.2 Kg/m2). hypertensive obese (age: 48.6±6.1 yr; BMI: 36.5±7.7 Kg/m2) and hypertensive obese with DMT2 (age: 50.8±6.0 yr; BMI: 35.3±6.7 Kg/m2). Anthropometric data were collected from all subjects and fasting blood samples were utilized for biochemical analysis. Serum angiotensin II (ANG II) levels were elevated in hypertensive obese (p<0.05) and hypertensive obese with DMT2 (p<0.001) compared with normotensive controls.

This review focuses on the potentials of extracts and biologically active compounds derived from microalgal biomass for the treatment and management of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Microalgal research has gained much attention recently due to its contribution to the production of renewable fuels and the ability of alga cells to produce several secondary metabolites such as carotenoids. polyphenols. sterols. polyunsaturated fatty acids and polysaccharides. These compounds exhibit several pharmacological activities and possess neuroprotective potential. The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves complex mechanisms that are associated with oxidative stress. cholinergic dysfunction. neuronal damage. protein misfolding and aggregation. The antioxidant. anticholinesterase activities as well as the inhibitory effects of some bioactive compounds from microalgae extracts on β-amyloid aggregation and neuronal death are discussed extensively. Phytochemical compounds from microalgae are used as pharmaceuticals. nutraceuticals and food supplements. and may possess neuroprotective potentials that are relevant to the management and/or treatment of AD.

Evidence suggests that pathological mechanisms involved in the development of AD are associated with cholinergic deficit. glutamate excitotoxicity. beta-amyloid aggregation. tau phosphorylation. neuro-inflammation. and oxidative damage to neurons. Currently there is no cure for AD; however. synthetic therapies have been developed to effectively manage some of the symptoms at the early stage of the disease. Natural products from plants and marine organisms have been identified as important sources of bioactive compounds with neuroprotective potentials and less adverse effects compared to synthetic agents. Seaweeds contain several kinds of secondary metabolites such as phlorotannins. carotenoids. sterols. fucoidans. and poly unsaturated fatty acids. However. their neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of action have not been fully explored. This review discusses recent investigations and/or updates on interactions of bioactive compounds from seaweeds with biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of AD using reports in electronic databases such as Web of science. Scopus. PubMed. Science direct. Scifinder. Taylor and Francis. Wiley. Springer. and Google scholar between 2015 and 2019.

The enzyme could also accept halide ions as substrates. The estimated molecular masses of the purified isoforms ranged between 26 and 31 kDa. The three most abundant isoforms of the enzyme could all catalyze the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methylation of thiocyanate. a number of organic thiols and iodide. However. the kinetic properties of these forms toward various substrates differed widely. None of the isoforms examined methylated the O-and N-equivalents of the thiol substrates. The three isoforms also had distinct pH optima. covering the range from 5 to 9. Their kinetic analysis indicated …,True,0mCBXTkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,60,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986100918964,1545987373591651613,/scholar?cites=1545987373591651613,,,0,0,0
1077509,Evidence implicating a novel thiol methyltransferase in the detoxification of glucosinolate hydrolysis products in Brassica oleracea L.,2000,J Attieh and KF Kleppinger‐Sparace and C Nunes and SA Sparace and Hargurdeep S Saini,23,"Plant, Cell & Environment",2,165-174,Blackwell Science Ltd,The physiological relevance of a novel thiol methyltransferase from cabbage. and its possible role in sulphur metabolism have been investigated. The enzyme was absent from the chloroplast. the site of sulphate reduction. and was localized in the cytosol. Potential substrates were initially screened on the basis of their ability to inhibit the methylation of iodide. a previously known substrate for the enzyme. Thiocyanate. 4.4′‐thiobisbenzenethiol. thiophenol. and thiosalicylic acid were identified as possible substrates. Methylation of these thiols by the purified enzyme using [Methyl‐3H]S‐adenosyl‐      L‐methionine confirmed their nature as substrates. The purified enzyme strongly preferred thiocyanate as a methyl acceptor. The enzyme had Km values of 11. 51. 250 and 746 mmol m−3 for thiocyanate. 4.4′‐thiobisbenzenethiol. thiophenol and thiosalicylic acid. respectively. The identity of methylthiocyanate as the …,True,0mCBXTkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,53,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00541.x,17468247797581205304,/scholar?cites=17468247797581205304,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00541.x,0,0,0

Correlation analysis and cluster analysis are applied to tree-ring data and gridded climate data to assess the climate signal embedded in the network in preparation for climate field reconstructions and formal proxy/model intercomparison experiments. The lengths of the 79 combined chronologies range from 89 to 990 years. The monthly correlations and partial correlations reveal a pervasive positive association with May. June. and sometimes July precipitation. positive correlations with winter and spring (December through April) temperatures. and negative relationships with May through July temperature. although as expected. there are site-to-site exceptions to these general patterns …,True,0mCBXTkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,38,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0959683613518594,12315346070988607430,/scholar?cites=12315346070988607430,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladimir_Shishov/publication/267266194_Spatial_patterns_of_eastern_Mediterranean_climate_influence_on_tree_growth/links/5448e9230cf2f14fb8145170/Spatial-patterns-of-eastern-Mediterranean-climate-influence-on-tree-growth.pdf,0,0,0
