1095209,Supporting frequent updates in r-trees: A bottom-up approach,2003,Mong Li Lee and Wynne Hsu and Christian S Jensen and Bin Cui and Keng Lik Teo,,,,608-619,Morgan Kaufmann,This paper proposes a generalized bottom-up update strategy for R-trees. This strategy is motivated by the class of monitoring applications. which are characterized by large volumes of updates. and the increasingly important role of indexing. This update strategy can easily be applied to the members of the family of R-tree-based indexing techniques. as it preserves the index structure and takes into account concurrency control. The strategy improves the robustness of R-trees by supporting different levels of index reorganization—ranging from local to global—during updates. thus using expensive top-down updates only when necessary. This chapter presents a compact main-memory summary structure along with efficient bottom-up algorithms that reduce the numbers of disk accesses and CPU resources used for update and querying. Empirical studies indicate that the new strategy outperforms …,True,IJAU8KoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,285,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780127224428500604,18365601950061565267,/scholar?cites=18365601950061565267,,https://dl.comp.nus.edu.sg/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1900.100/1444/report.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0
1095210,Challenging the long tail recommendation,2012,Hongzhi Yin and Bin Cui and Jing Li and Junjie Yao and Chen Chen,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1205.6700,,,,"The success of"" infinite-inventory"" retailers such as this http URL and Netflix has been largely attributed to a"" long tail"" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventory is not in high demand. these niche products. unavailable at limited-inventory competitors. generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition. tail product availability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of"" one-stop shopping"" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However. most of existing recommender systems. especially collaborative filter based methods. can not recommend tail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to recommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this paper. we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail recommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected edge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying Hitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve recommendation diversity and accuracy. we extend Hitting Time and propose efficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail items. Finally. we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two entropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on different user-item rating pairs. which further enhances the effectiveness of long tail recommendation.

The concept of cloud computing incorporates web infrastructure. software as a service (SaaS). Web 2.0 and other emerging technologies. and has attracted more and more attention from industry and research community. In this paper. we describe our experience and lessons learnt in construction of a cloud computing platform.

One important observation in these online social platforms is that users' interests and the popularity of topics shift very fast. which poses great challenges on existing recommender systems to provide the right topics at the right time. In this paper. we extend the online ranking technique and propose a temporal recommender system - TeRec. In TeRec. when posting tweets. users can get recommendations of topics (hashtags) according to their real-time interests. they can also generate fast feedbacks according to the recommendations.

A skyline query retrieves from a set of multidimensional data points a subset of interesting points. compared to which no other points are better. Skyline queries play an important role in multi-criteria decision making and user preference applications. In this paper. we address the skyline computing problem in a structured P2P network. We exploit the iMinMax(thetas) transformation to map high-dimensional data points to 1-dimensional values. All transformed data points are then distributed on a structured P2P network called BATON. where all peers are virtually organized as a balanced binary search tree.

As most environments are inhabited by multiple users. the true potential of WiFi based gesture recognition can be unleashed only when each user can independently define the actions that the system should take when the user performs a certain predefined gesture. To enable this. a gesture recognition system should not only be able to recognize any given predefined gesture. but should also be able to identify the user that performed it. Unfortunately. none of the prior WiFi based gesture recognition systems can identify the user performing the gesture.

The anonymity allowed by IP networking. together with the distributed. large scale nature of the Internet. makes DDoS attacks stealthy and difficult to counter. To make the problem worse. attack traffic is often indistinguishable from normal traffic. As various attack tools become widely available and require minimum knowledge to operate. automated antiDDoS systems become increasingly important.

For example. sensors may be added to these tags to gather real-time information about the state of the objects or about the environment where these objects reside. This leads to the problem of designing efficient protocols to collect such information from the tags. It is a new problem that the existing work cannot solve well.

1095279,Routing with topology aggregation in delay-bandwidth sensitive networks,2004,King-Shan Lui and Klara Nahrstedt and Shigang Chen,12,IEEE/ACM transactions on networking,1,17-29,IEEE,Routing is a process of finding a network path from a source node to a destination node. The execution time and the memory requirement of a routing algorithm increase with the size of the network. In order to deal with the scalability problem. large networks are often structured hierarchically by grouping nodes into different domains. The internal topology of each domain is then aggregated into a simple topology that reflects the cost of routing across that domain. This process is called topology aggregation. For delay-bandwidth sensitive networks. traditional approaches represent the property of each link in the aggregated topology as a delay-bandwidth pair. which corresponds to a point on the delay-bandwidth plane. Since each link after aggregation may be the abstraction of many physical paths. a single delay-bandwidth pair results in significant information loss.

MPLS path selection. ATM circuit routing. and traffic engineering. The problem is to find the cheapest path that satisfies certain constraints. In particular. finding the cheapest delay-constrained path is critical for real-time data flows such as voice/video calls. Because it is NP-complete. much research has been designing heuristic algorithms that solve the epsiv-approximation of the problem with an adjustable accuracy. A common approach is to discretize (i.e.. scale and round) the link delay or link cost. which transforms the original problem to a simpler one solvable in polynomial time. The efficiency of the algorithms directly relates to the magnitude of the errors introduced during discretization.

We point out the fairness problem in the current design of sensor networks. which may cause extremely biased bandwidth allocations. It is a challenge to design a fully distributed fairness solution due to the lack of global knowledge about the distribution of data sources and their routing paths. This paper proposes a new aggregate fairness model and a localized algorithm (called AFA) that implements the model. AFA is designed to work with any routing protocol. In particular. it allows the packets from a data source to follow an arbitrary set of forwarding paths to the base stations.

With rapid development of the precision medicine era. a series of new therapies targeting EGFR are underway. Four EGFR monoclonal antibody drugs (cetuximab. panitumumab. nimotuzumab. and necitumumab) are already on the market. and a dozen other EGFR monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trials. Here. we comprehensively review the newly identified biological properties and anti-tumor mechanisms of EGFR monoclonal antibodies. We summarize recently completed and ongoing clinical trials of the classic and new EGFR monoclonal antibodies. More importantly. according to our new standard. we re-classify the complex evolving tumor cell resistance mechanisms. including those involving exosomes. non-coding RNA and the tumor microenvironment. against EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Finally. we analyzed the limitations of EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy. and discussed the current strategies overcoming EGFR related drug resistance.

It is hypothesized that gastrointestinal TICs (giTICs) might originate from cell-cell fusion. Here. we systemically evaluate the evidence that supports or opposes the hypothesis of giTIC generation from cell-cell fusion both in vitro and in vivo. We review giTICs that are capable of initiating tumors in vivo with 5000 or fewer in vivo fused cells. Under this restriction. there is currently little evidence demonstrating that giTICs originate from cell-cell fusion in vivo. However. there are many reports showing that tumor generation in vitro occurs with more than 5000 fused cells. In addition. the mechanisms of giTIC generation via cell-cell fusion are poorly understood. and thus. we propose its potential mechanisms of action. We suggest that future research should focus on giTIC origination from cell-cell fusion in vivo. isolation or enrichment of giTICs that have tumor-initiating capabilities with 5000 or less in vivo fused cells. and further clarification of the underlying mechanisms.

OVs represent a new class of therapeutic agents that promote anti-tumour responses through a dual mechanism of action that is dependent on selective tumor cell killing and the induction of systemic anti-tumour immunity. Among OVs. HSVs preferentially replicate in and lyse cancer cells. leading to in situ autovaccination. adaptive anti-virus and anti-tumor immunity. Suppression of antitumor immunity after OV therapy has been observed and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action are recently reported. ICP47. a small protein produced by the herpes simplex virus. is considered as an important factor in the evasion of cellular immune responses in HSV-infected cells.

Using ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to perform high-speed packet classification has become the  de facto  standard in industry. TCAMs classify packets in constant time by comparing a packet with all classification rules of ternary encoding in parallel. Despite their high speed. TCAMs suffer from the well-known range expansion problem. As packet classification rules usually have fields specified as ranges. converting such rules to TCAM-compatible rules may result in an explosive increase in the number of rules.

In this paper. we propose LLAP. a device-free gesture tracking scheme that can be deployed on existing mobile devices as software. without any hardware modification. We use speakers and microphones that already exist on most mobile devices to perform device-free tracking of a hand/finger.

1095316,Structured firewall design,2007,Mohamed G Gouda and Alex X Liu,51,Computer networks,4,1106-1120,Elsevier,A firewall is a security guard placed at the point of entry between a private network and the outside Internet such that all incoming and outgoing packets have to pass through it. The function of a firewall is to examine every incoming or outgoing packet and decide whether to accept or discard it. This function is conventionally specified by a sequence of rules. where rules often conflict. To resolve conflicts. the decision for each packet is the decision of the first rule that the packet matches. The current practice of designing a firewall directly as a sequence of rules suffers from three types of major problems: (1) the consistency problem. which means that it is difficult to order the rules correctly; (2) the completeness problem. which means that it is difficult to ensure thorough consideration for all types of traffic; (3) the compactness problem. which means that it is difficult to keep the number of rules small (because some rules …,True,qRjO51UAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,208,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128606001988,10787717040530102515,/scholar?cites=10787717040530102515,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.388.5713&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

That is usually violated in practice. inspiring us to explore the Very Low Resolution Recognition (VLRR) problem. Typically. the ROI in a VLRR problem can be smaller than 16 x16 pixels. and is challenging to be recognized even by human experts. We attempt to solve the VLRR problem using deep learning methods. Taking advantage of techniques primarily in super resolution. domain adaptation and robust regression. we formulate a dedicated deep learning method and demonstrate how these techniques are incorporated step by step. Any extra complexity. when introduced. is fully justified by both analysis and simulation results. The resulting Robust Partially Coupled Networks achieves feature enhancement and recognition simultaneously. It allows for both the flexibility to combat the LR-HR domain mismatch. and the robustness to outliers.

This decision is made according to a sequence of rules. where some rules may be redundant. Redundant rules significantly degrade the performance of firewalls.

Each stateful firewall consists of two sections: a stateful section and a stateless section. Upon receiving a packet. the firewall processes it in two steps. In the first step. the firewall augments the packet with an additional field called the tag. and uses the stateful section to compute the value of this field according to the current state of the firewall. In the second step. the firewall compares the packet together with its tag value against a sequence of rules in the stateless section to identify the first rule that the packet matches: the decision of this rule determines the fate of the packet.

Due to economics and the large area of the ocean. UWA-SNs are mainly sparsely deployed networks nowadays. The limited battery resources is a big challenge for the deployment of such long-term sensor networks. Unbalanced battery energy consumption will lead to early energy depletion of nodes. which partitions the whole networks and impairs the integrity of the monitoring datasets or even results in the collapse of the entire networks. On the contrary. balanced energy dissipation of nodes can prolong the lifetime of such networks. In this paper. we focus on the energy balance dissipation problem of two types of sparsely deployed UWA-SNs: underwater moored monitoring systems and sparsely deployed two-dimensional UWA-SNs. We first analyze the reasons of unbalanced energy consumption in such networks. then we propose two energy balanced strategies to maximize the lifetime of networks both in shallow and deep water. Finally. we evaluate our methods by simulations and the results show that the two strategies can achieve balanced energy consumption per node while at the same time prolong the networks lifetime.

Tor suffers from a variety of performance problems that continue to inhibit its wide scale adoption. One reason why Tor is slow is due to the manner in which clients select Tor relays. There have been a number of recent proposals for modifying Tor’s relay selection algorithm. often to achieve improved bandwidth. latency. and/or anonymity. This paper explores the anonymity and performance trade-offs of the proposed relay selection techniques using highly accurate topological models that capture the actual Tor network’s autonomous system (AS) boundaries. points-of-presence. inter-relay latencies. and relay performance characteristics.Using realistic network models. we conduct a wholenetwork evaluation with varying traffic workloads to understand the potential performance benefits of a comprehensive set of relay selection proposals from the Tor literature.

This difficulty is compounded when some machines in the network are compromised. since these compromised machines may use deception or tamper with data to frustrate forensic analysis. Recently proposed forensic tools enable administrators to learn the causes of some system states in a partially compromised network. but these tools are inherently unable to (1) observe covert communication between compromised nodes or (2) detect attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data.In this paper. we observe that the emergence of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers interesting new opportunities for network forensics. We sketch the design of an SDN-based forensic system that can be used to investigate a wide variety of faults in data center networks. including previously unobservable attacks such as data exfiltration and collusion between compromised nodes. Our key insight is that the network itself can be used as a point of observation. which gives us a holistic view of network activity.

In contrast to traditional node-based path techniques in which relay selection is biased by relays’ node-characteristics (i.e.. bandwidth). this paper presents the case for link-based path generation in which relay selection is weighted in favor of the highest performing links. Link-based relay selection supports more flexible routing. enabling anonymous paths with low latency. jitter. and loss. in addition to high bandwidth. Link-based approaches are also more secure than node-based techniques. eliminating “hotspots” in the network that attract a disproportionate amount of traffic.

A large body of work has attempted to solve these problems without a complete understanding of where congestion occurs in Tor. In this paper. we first study congestion in Tor at individual relays as well as along the entire end-to-end Tor path and find that congestion occurs almost exclusively in egress kernel socket buffers. We then analyze Tor’s socket interactions and discover two major issues affecting congestion: Tor writes sockets sequentially. and Tor writes as much as possible to each socket. We thus design. implement. and test KIST: a new socket management algorithm that uses real-time kernel information to dynamically compute the amount to write to each socket while considering all writable circuits when scheduling new cells. We find that. in the medians. KIST reduces circuit congestion by over 30 percent. reduces network latency by 18 percent. and increases network throughput by nearly 10 percent. We analyze the security of KIST and find an acceptable performance and security trade-off. as it does not significantly affect the outcome of well-known latency and throughput attacks.

Following this trend. the next generation Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is expected to replace traditional data gathering–a distributed network of Remote Terminal Units (RTU) or Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). with devices such as the wireless sensing devices. Before these intelligent systems can be deployed in critical infrastructure such as emergency rooms and power plants. the security properties of sensors must be fully understood. Existing wisdom has been to apply the traditional security models and techniques to sensor networks: as in conventional computing environments. the goal has been to protect physical entities: devices. packets. links. and ultimately networks.Sensors have unique characteristics that warrant novel security considerations: the geographic distribution of the devices allows an attacker to physically capture nodes and learn secret key material. or to intercept or inject messages; the hierarchical nature of sensor networks and their route maintenance protocols permit the attacker to determine where the root node is placed.

This difficulty is compounded when some machines in the network are compromised. since these compromised machines may use deception or tamper with data to frustrate forensic analysis. Recently proposed forensic tools enable administrators to learn the causes of some system states in a partially compromised network. but these tools are inherently unable to (1) observe covert communication between compromised nodes or (2) detect attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data.In this paper. we observe that the emergence of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers interesting new opportunities for network forensics. We sketch the design of an SDN-based forensic system that can be used to investigate a wide variety of faults in data center networks. including previously unobservable attacks such as data exfiltration and collusion between compromised nodes. Our key insight is that the network itself can be used as a point of observation. which gives us a holistic view of network activity.

1095427,Finite abstractions of stochastic max-plus-linear systems,2014,Dieky Adzkiya and Sadegh Esmaeil Zadeh Soudjani and Alessandro Abate,,,,74-89,Springer International Publishing,This work investigates the use of finite abstractions to study the finite-horizon probabilistic invariance problem over Stochastic Max-Plus-Linear (SMPL) systems. SMPL systems are probabilistic extensions of discrete-event MPL systems that are widely employed in the engineering practice for timing and synchronisation studies. We construct finite abstractions by re-formulating the SMPL system as a discrete-time Markov process. then tailoring formal abstraction techniques in the literature to generate a finite-state Markov Chain (MC). together with precise guarantees on the level of the introduced approximation. This finally allows to probabilistically model check the obtained MC against the finite-horizon probabilistic invariance specification. The approach is practically implemented via a dedicated software. and elucidated in this work over numerical examples.,True,jxd84eQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10696-0_7,10108080225396142958,/scholar?cites=10108080225396142958,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.5550&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Abstractions are characterized as finite-state labeled transition systems (LTS) and are obtained by first partitioning the state space of the MPL and associating states of the LTS to the partitions. then by defining relations among the vertices of the LTS. corresponding to dynamical transitions between the MPL state partitions. and finally by labeling the LTS edges according to one-step time properties of the events of the MPL model. In order to establish formal equivalences. the finite LTS abstraction is proven to either simulate or to bisimulate the original MPL model. the difference depending on its determinism.

In this final project. the sigma class corvet ship is adopted as an example. To address the constraint violation for ship heading control in wave fields. the Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller has been proposed to satisfy the state constraints in the presence of environmental disturbances. The simulation results show good performance of the proposed controller in terms of satisfying yaw velocity and actuator saturation constraint.,True,xUo-olQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Virga_Fatari/project/Paper-Mathematical-Modeling/attachment/585280eb08aeee4d64ec7ef4/AS:439523445350400@1481801963831/download/APPLICATION+OF+MODEL+PREDICTIVE+CONTROL+FOR+SHIP+HEADING+CONTROL.pdf?context=projectUpdateDetail,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Virga_Fatari/project/Paper-Mathematical-Modeling/attachment/585280eb08aeee4d64ec7ef4/AS:439523445350400@1481801963831/download/APPLICATION+OF+MODEL+PREDICTIVE+CONTROL+FOR+SHIP+HEADING+CONTROL.pdf?context=projectUpdateDetail,0,0,0

Knowing the number is crucial for developing policy responses. There are generally two types of such a number. ie. basic and effective (or instantaneous). While basic reproduction number is the average expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible. effective reproduction number is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper. we exploit the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease in the country.

Three different types of lattices are considered. ie square. honeycomb. and triangular lattices. The equation admits uniform and localised states. We can obtain localised solutions by combining two different states of uniform solutions. which can develop a snaking structure in the bifurcation diagrams.

Simple (and naive) methods of estimating the reproduction number,2020,H Susanto and VR Tjahjono and A Hasan and MF Kasim and N Nuraini and ERM Putri and R Kusdiantara and H Kurniawan,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.15706,,,,This is a pedagogical paper on estimating the number of people that can be infected by one infectious person during an epidemic outbreak. known as the reproduction number. Knowing the number is crucial for developing policy responses. There are generally two types of such a number. ie. basic and effective (or instantaneous). While basic reproduction number is the average expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible. effective reproduction number is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper. we exploit the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease in the country. We see that the effect of the national lockdown in slowing down the disease exponential growth appeared about two weeks after the implementation date. We also discuss available improvements to the simple (and naive) methods that have been made by researchers in the field.,True,831IDHUAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15706,7030556862151441641,/scholar?cites=7030556862151441641,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15706,0,0,0
1095494,Stock loans valuation,2014,Endah RM Putri,,,,,,Stock loans have been recognized as a popular financial contract and considered as an alternative for investors to increase liquidity. Consequently. an accurate and efficient valuation of stock loans is necessary. Although there are some existing literatures on the valuation of stock loans. to the best of our knowledge. most are for perpetual loans. In reality. stock loan contracts mostly last for less than 10 years. It is. therefore. important to develop accurate and efficient evaluation methods for stock loans of finite maturity.

The two free boundaries corresponding to the states divide the pricing domain into two regions: a common continuation region and a transition region. Non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) systems are derived under the Black–Scholes framework for each region. The Laplace transform method is used to solve the PDE systems. Equations for determining the optimal exercise prices are obtained analytically and solved numerically in the Laplace space.

The switching response is triggered by suddenly switching on the gain in the Bragg grating to create a PT-symmetric Bragg grating. Transient and dynamic behaviors of the PT Bragg gratings are analyzed using the time-domain numerical transmission line modeling method including a simple gain saturation model. The on/off ratio and the switching time of the PT Bragg grating optical switch are analyzed in terms of the level of gain introduced in the system and the operating frequency. The paper also discusses the effect the gain saturation has on the operation of the PT-symmetric Bragg gratings.,True,mMVDv64AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,44,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-30-11-2984,6129891254317308756,/scholar?cites=6129891254317308756,,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/718418/ultrafast-optical-switching-using-parity-time-symmetric-bragg-gratings,0,0,0

In this paper. the existence and stability regimes of dipole. quadrupole. and vortex soliton structures in two-dimensional lattices induced with a defocusing nonlinearity are examined by the theoretical and numerical analysis of a generic envelope nonlinear lattice model. In particular. we find that the stability of such high-order-mode solitons is quite different from that with self-focusing nonlinearity. As a simple example. a dipole (“twisted”) mode soliton with adjacent excited sites which may be stable in the focusing case becomes unstable in the defocusing regime.

The master VCSEL is subject to variable-polarization optical feedback. Two injection schemes. the polarization-preserved optical injection (PPOI) and variable-polarization optical injection (VPOI) are considered for the slave VCSELs. The influences of unpredictability degree on the synchronization quality and the synchronization properties of unpredictability-enhanced chaos are focused on. For the PPOI scheme. the synchronization quality is hardly affected by the unpredictability degree; high-quality synchronization can be achieved between unpredictability-enhanced chaos due to injection locking.

The research is performed using a novel estimator. which calculates the peak-to-mean ratio on the basis of the autocorrelation function (ACF). It is shown that the TD signature of mutually coupled VCSELs with VPOI at intermediate polarizer angles can be better concealed than that of mutually coupled VCSELs with conventional polarization-selected optical injection.

A Lamarckian method is developed which perceives the layout optimization as one of force transmission problem. and a dimensional method perceives it as a selection problem. The proposed design approach can include buckling constraints. Furthermore. the layout of a structure may provide multiple failure paths so that its system reliability is an important criterion in the search for the optimal configuration.

Thus. the mathematical model has many state variables that affect the computation time. In addition. generally not all variables are known. so estimations are needed to measure the magnitude of the system that cannot be measured directly. In this paper. we discuss the model reduction and estimation of state variables in the river system to measure the water level. The model reduction of a system is an approximation method of a system with a lower order without significant errors but has a dynamic behaviour that is similar to the original system. The Singular Perturbation Approximation method is one of the model reduction methods where all state variables of the equilibrium system are partitioned into fast and slow modes. Then.

1095629,Performance Analysis of Linear Quadratic Regulator Method in Microalga Growth with Control of Light Intensity,2020,A Fadhillah and L Hanafi,1463,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,1,012004,IOP Publishing,Microalgae is an alternative energy source that considered capable of answering fuel oil scarcity problem. The growth of microalgae plays an important role in biomass production. One of the factors that influence the growth of microalgae is the control of light intensity so that it is necessary to adjust the intensity of the incoming light to produce maximum biomass. Control the intensity of light on the microalgae growth can be modelled in the form of differential equations and can be seen as a system. The control method chosen in this study was a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). as well as a comparison with the previous method. namely Pontryagin minimum principle (PMP). The simulation results show that at LQR an increase in the amount of biomass reaches 91.77% from initial condition.

Risks exist in every stage of production carried out by each of the actors along the production chain. This implies that the success of improving the performance of the agricultural business will mostly rely on the actors’ ability to manage risks. This paper reports the results of an exploratory study on the risks that the milk supply chain in Indonesia faces. The focus is to identify the sources of risks that may appear in the existing milk supply chain and their implication on production behavior of the chain. Informal interviews and focus group discussion were conducted with farmers. farmer’s organizations. and dairy manufacturers in a milk-producing area in West Java Indonesia.These reveal some early findings concerning the sources of risks in the milk supply chain. and the likely consequences for the actors of the upstream and downstream segments.

Studi ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui berapa besar proporsi pemotongan sapi betina umur produktif. kelayakan kondisi fisik RPH. dan perlakuan pemotongan ternak lokal maupun impor serta rantai pasok sapi dan daging sapi di Pulau Jawa dan Nusa Tenggara. Kegunaan studi ini. diharapkan memberikan kontribusi pada upaya meningkatkan daya saing produk daging sapi domestik. melalui peningkatan populasi dan produktivitas sapi potong lokal. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah survey terhadap jumlah pemotongan sapi betina umur produktif di RPH. Data yang terkumpul dianalisis secara deskriptif.Berdasarkan diskusi dan pembahasan. maka hasil penelitiannya adalah sebagai berikut:(a) Selama periode studi. terjadi pemotongan sapi lokal betina umur produktif 31. 04% dari jumlah sapi lokal yang dipotong. RPH yang banyak memotong betina umur produktif berada di wilayah produsen dibandingkan di wilayah konsumen. Pemotongan sapi lokal betina umur produktif mengalami peningkatan yang cukup tinggi menjelang bulan puasa. dan pada hari raya. sedangkan pada rentang waktu yang lainnya (saat bulan puasa dan setelah hari raya) pemotongan betina produktif secara proporsional mengikuti arus fluktuasi pemotongan sapi di setiap RPH.(b) Kondisi RPH di lokasi studi menunjukkan tidak ada yang termasuk kategori sangat layak. hanya sebesar 20% yang termasuk kategori layak. 40 …,True,eAXLLkcAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,17,https://www.academia.edu/download/32311478/PEMOTONGAN_BETINA_PRODUKTIF.pdf,1563676718274490546,/scholar?cites=1563676718274490546,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32311478/PEMOTONGAN_BETINA_PRODUKTIF.pdf,0,0,0

Hasil kajian ini menunjukkan bahwa : ancaman terhadap peluang terjadinya PMK bisa secara langsung maupun tidak langsung. Secara spesifik bahwa ancaman penyakit PMK adalah sebagai berikut : (1) Hambatan utama adalah sulitnya mencapai target angka pertumbuhan populasi ternak apabila terjadi wabah dan prevalensi PMK yang persisten. (2) Pada ternak dewasa umumnya akan meningkatkan risiko abortus dadakan di antara ternak-ternak bunting dan kematian anak sapi.

The review begins by analysing the characteristics of the models and modelling reported in the literature. It illustrates that existing modelling research features extensive use of: single echelon supply chains; cases from high and middle income countries; unprocessed food products. empirical (as opposed to hypothetical) data; decision-making related to production planning and investment; and the use of black box validation. The second part of the review uses bibliographic mapping to analyse areas in ASC research which are yet to be addressed using ABS.

Improving data collection methodologies can help in developing a more realistic agent’s decision rule and increasing the validity and credibility of the final model. This study uses a dairy supply chain case because the actors in this context can have one to one correspondence with the agents in the simulation. This study begins by presenting a literature review on the applications of agent-based simulation in the agri-food supply chain. This literature review highlights existing agent-based modelling practices in the agri-food supply chain such as the scope of the modelling. data collection. validation and sensitivity analysis techniques. This study then proposes some improvements to the existing data collection methodologies namely questionnaire survey and role-playing game. This study proposes the use of a scenariobased questionnaire to improve the benefits of a questionnaire survey for decision rules calibration.

1095792,Second-order attention network for single image super-resolution,2019,Tao Dai and Jianrui Cai and Yongbing Zhang and Shu-Tao Xia and Lei Zhang,,,,11065-11074,,Recently. deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely explored in single image super-resolution (SISR) and obtained remarkable performance. However. most of the existing CNN-based SISR methods mainly focus on wider or deeper architecture design. neglecting to explore the feature correlations of intermediate layers. hence hindering the representational power of CNNs. To address this issue. in this paper. we propose a second-order attention network (SAN) for more powerful feature expression and feature correlation learning. Specifically. a novel train-able second-order channel attention (SOCA) module is developed to adaptively rescale the channel-wise features by using second-order feature statistics for more discriminative representations. Furthermore. we present a non-locally enhanced residual group (NLRG) structure. which not only incorporates non-local operations to capture long-distance spatial contextual information. but also contains repeated local-source residual attention groups (LSRAG) to learn increasingly abstract feature representations.

We propose a new perspective for understanding DNN generalization for such datasets. by investigating the dimensionality of the deep representation subspace of training samples. We show that from a dimensionality perspective. DNNs exhibit quite distinctive learning styles when trained with clean labels versus when trained with a proportion of noisy labels. Based on this finding. we develop a new dimensionality-driven learning strategy. which monitors the dimensionality of subspaces during training and adapts the loss function accordingly. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is highly tolerant to significant proportions of noisy labels. and can effectively learn low-dimensional local subspaces that capture the data distribution.,True,koAXTXgAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC,143,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ma18d,13671594748199391279,/scholar?cites=13671594748199391279,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ma18d/ma18d.pdf,0,0,0

However. labeling large-scale data can be very costly and error-prone. and even high-quality datasets are likely to contain noisy (incorrect) labels. Existing works usually employ a closed-set assumption. whereby the samples associated with noisy labels possess a true class contained within the set of known classes in the training data. However. such an assumption is too restrictive for many applications. since samples associated with noisy labels might in fact possess a true class that is not present in the training data. We refer to this more complex scenario as the open-set noisy label problem and show that it is nontrivial in order to make accurate predictions. To address this problem. we propose a novel iterative learning framework for training CNNs on datasets with open-set noisy labels. Our approach detects noisy labels and learns deep discriminative features in an iterative fashion. To benefit from the noisy label detection. we design a Siamese network to encourage clean labels and noisy labels to be dissimilar. A reweighting module is also applied to simultaneously emphasize the learning from clean labels and reduce the effect caused by noisy labels. Experiments on CIFAR-10.

Constant dimension codes are equivalent to the so-called linear authentication codes introduced by Wang. Xing and Safavi-Naini when constructing distributed authentication systems in 2003. In this paper. we study constant dimension codes. It is shown that Steiner structures are optimal constant dimension codes achieving the Wang-Xing-Safavi-Naini bound.

When some of the r coordinates are also erased. the r-local LRC cannot accomplish the local repair. which leads to the concept of (r. δ)-locality.

The (r. δ)-LRC can tolerate δ-1 erasures in every local code (i.e.. punctured subcode). which degenerates to an r-local LRC when δ = 2.

1095799,Skip connections matter: On the transferability of adversarial examples generated with resnets,2020,Dongxian Wu and Yisen Wang and Shu-Tao Xia and James Bailey and Xingjun Ma,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.05990,,,,Skip connections are an essential component of current state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) such as ResNet. WideResNet. DenseNet. and ResNeXt. Despite their huge success in building deeper and more powerful DNNs. we identify a surprising security weakness of skip connections in this paper. Use of skip connections allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically. in ResNet-like (with skip connections) neural networks. gradients can backpropagate through either skip connections or residual modules. We find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather than the residual modules according to a decay factor. allows one to craft adversarial examples with high transferability. Our method is termed Skip Gradient Method (SGM). We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against state-of-the-art DNNs including ResNets. DenseNets. Inceptions. Inception-ResNet. Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) and robustly trained DNNs. We show that employing SGM on the gradient flow can greatly improve the transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore. SGM can be easily combined with existing black-box attack techniques. and obtain high improvements over state-of-the-art transferability methods.

The major drawback of BF is that its range kernel is sensitive to noise. To address this issue. we propose an entropy-based BF (EBF) with a new range kernel which contains a new range distance. The new range distance is robust to noise by exploiting the information from the denoised estimate and the corresponding method noise. i.e.. the difference between the noisy image and its denoised estimate. Moreover. in order to consider the local statistics of images. local entropy is applied to adaptively guide the range parameter selections.

If a code symbol can be repaired respectively by t disjoint groups of other symbols. each of which has size at most r. we say that the code symbol has (r. t)-locality. LDPC codes are linear block codes defined by low-density parity-check matrices. A regular (τ. p)-LDPC code has the parity-check matrix with uniform column weight τ and uniform row weight p. In this letter. we employ regular LDPC codes to construct optimal binary LRCs with (r. t)-locality for information symbols. After proposing construction frameworks. three detailed constructions of binary LRCs with information locality are obtained. all of which have a single parity symbol in each repair group. All our codes attain the distance bounds of LRCs when each repair group contains a single parity symbol and thus are optimal.

Analysis. and SignatureGeneration of Exploits on Commodity Software.,2005,James Newsome and Dawn Xiaodong Song,5,NDSS,,3-4,,Software vulnerabilities have had a devastating effect on the Internet. Worms such as CodeRed and Slammer can compromise hundreds of thousands of hosts within hours or even minutes. and cause millions of dollars of damage [32. 51]. To successfully combat these fast automatic Internet attacks. we need fast automatic attack detection and filtering mechanisms. In this paper we propose dynamic taint analysis for automatic detection and analysis of overwrite attacks. which include most types of exploits. This approach does not need source code or special compilation for the monitored program. and hence works on commodity software. To demonstrate this idea. we have implemented TaintCheck. a mechanism that can perform dynamic taint analysis by performing binary rewriting at run time. We show that TaintCheck reliably detects most types of exploits. We found that TaintCheck produced no false positives for any of the many different programs that we tested. Further. we show how we can use a two-tiered approach to build a hybrid exploit detector that enjoys the same accuracy as TaintCheck but have extremely low performance overhead. Finally. we propose a new type of automatic signature generation—semanticanalysis based signature generation. We show that by backtracing the chain of tainted data structure rooted at the detection point. TaintCheck can automatically identify which original flow and which part of the original flow have caused the attack and identify important invariants of the payload that can be used as signatures.

In order to evade detection. malware writers (hackers) frequently use obfuscation to morph malware. Malware detectors that use a pattern-matching approach (such as commercial virus scanners) are susceptible to obfuscations used by hackers.

The problem becomes more complex in common settings where other receivers of the data are not trusted. and where lost packets are not retransmitted. Several source authentication schemes for multicast have been suggested in the past. but none of these schemes is satisfactorily efficient in all prominent parameters. We recently proposed a very efficient scheme. TESLA. that is based on initial loose time synchronization between the sender and the receivers. followed by delayed release of keys by the sender.This paper proposes several substantial modifications and improvements to TESLA. One modification allows receivers to authenticate most packets as soon as they arrive (whereas TESLA requires buffering packets at the receiver side. and provides delayed authentication only). Other modifications improve the scalability of the scheme. reduce the space overhead for multiple instances. increase its resistance to denial-of-service attacks. and more.,True,84WzBlYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,924,https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Efficient_secure_source_authentication.pdf,1177161234559883961,/scholar?cites=1177161234559883961,,https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Efficient_secure_source_authentication.pdf,0,0,0

These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work. we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset. and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples. and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find. targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore. we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches. we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples.

1095854,Testing robustness against unforeseen adversaries,2019,Daniel Kang and Yi Sun and Dan Hendrycks and Tom Brown and Jacob Steinhardt,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.08016,,,,Considerable work on adversarial defense has studied robustness to a fixed. known family of adversarial distortions. most frequently L_p-bounded distortions. In reality. the specific form of attack will rarely be known and adversaries are free to employ distortions outside of any fixed set. The present work advocates measuring robustness against this much broader range of unforeseen attacks---attacks whose precise form is not known when designing a defense.We propose a methodology for evaluating a defense against a diverse range of distortion types together with a summary metric UAR that measures the Unforeseen Attack Robustness against a distortion. We construct novel JPEG. Fog. Gabor. and Snow adversarial attacks to simulate unforeseen adversaries and perform a careful study of adversarial robustness against these and existing distortion types. We find that evaluation against existing L_p attacks yields highly correlated information that may not generalize to other attacks and identify a set of 4 attacks that yields more diverse information. We further find that adversarial training against either one or multiple distortions. including our novel ones. does not confer robustness to unforeseen distortions. These results underscore the need to study robustness against unforeseen distortions and provide a starting point for doing so.,True,czyretsAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,46,https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08016,5689579238074536026,/scholar?cites=5689579238074536026,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08016,0,0,0

We thus propose a new weight initialization by correcting for the influence of dropout rates and an arbitrary nonlinearity's influence on variance through simple corrective scalars. Since Batch Normalization trained with dropout estimates the variance of a layer's incoming distribution with some inputs dropped. the variance also differs between train and test.

In existing interpretation methods for NLP. a word's importance is determined by either input perturbation---measuring the decrease in model confidence when that word is removed---or by the gradient with respect to that word. To understand the limitations of these methods. we use input reduction. which iteratively removes the least important word from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments. the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label. but models still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these counterintuitive results. we draw connections to adversarial examples and confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in interpreting neural models trained with maximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies. we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on reduced examples. Fine-tuned models become more interpretable under input reduction without accuracy loss on regular examples.,True,SgST3LkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,115,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07781,2162241359621078854,/scholar?cites=2162241359621078854,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07781,0,0,0

We study the impact of model size in this setting. focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration. wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover. this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore. the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations. This leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However. we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models.

We first show that black-box MT systems can be stolen by querying them with monolingual sentences and training models to imitate their outputs. Using simulated experiments. we demonstrate that MT model stealing is possible even when imitation models have different input data or architectures than their victims. Applying these ideas. we train imitation models that reach within 0.6 BLEU of three production MT systems on both high-resource and low-resource language pairs. We then leverage the similarity of our imitation models to transfer adversarial examples to the production systems. We use gradient-based attacks that expose inputs which lead to semantically-incorrect translations. dropped content. and vulgar model outputs.

Reformulating tasks as fill-in-the-blanks problems (eg. cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging such knowledge. however. its usage is limited by the manual effort and guesswork required to write suitable prompts. To address this. we develop AutoPrompt. an automated method to create prompts for a diverse set of tasks. based on a gradient-guided search. Using AutoPrompt. we show that masked language models (MLMs) have an inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language inference without additional parameters or finetuning. sometimes achieving performance on par with recent state-of-the-art supervised models. We also show that our prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs than the manually created prompts on the LAMA benchmark. and that MLMs can be used as relation extractors more effectively than supervised relation extraction models. These results demonstrate that automatically generated prompts are a viable parameter-free alternative to existing probing methods. and as pretrained LMs become more sophisticated and capable. potentially a replacement for finetuning.,True,SgST3LkAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980,11841875696103103485,/scholar?cites=11841875696103103485,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15980,0,0,0

We show that this type of few-shot learning can be unstable: the choice of prompt format. training examples. and even the order of the training examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to near state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises from the bias of language models towards predicting certain answers. eg. those that are placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data. To mitigate this. we first estimate the model's bias towards each answer by asking for its prediction when given the training prompt and a content-free test input such as"" N/A"". We then fit calibration parameters that cause the prediction for this input to be uniform across answers.

To address the relevant performance and scalability challenges. approximation methods are employed for large-scale similarity computation. A common characteristic among all privacypreserving approximation protocols based on sketching is that the sketching is performed locally and is based on common randomness.In the semi-honest model the input to the sketching algorithm is independent of the common randomness. We. however. consider a new threat model where a party is allowed to use the common randomness to perturb her input 1) offline. and 2) before the execution of any secure protocol so as to steer the approximation result to a maliciously chosen output.

1095894,Response-Hiding Encrypted Ranges: Revisiting Security via Parametrized Leakage-Abuse Attacks,2021,Evgenios M Kornaropoulos and Charalampos Papamanthou and Roberto Tamassia,,,,,,Despite a growing body of work on leakage-abuse attacks for encrypted databases. attacks on practical responsehiding constructions are yet to appear. Response-hiding constructions are superior in that they nullify access-pattern based attacks by revealing only the search token and the result size of each query. Response-hiding schemes are vulnerable to existing volume attacks. which are. however. based on strong assumptions such as the uniform query assumption or the dense database assumption. More crucially. these attacks only apply to schemes that cannot be deployed in practice (ones with quadratic storage and increased leakage) while practical response-hiding schemes (Demertzis et al.[SIGMOD’16] and Faber et al.[ESORICS’15]) have linear storage and less leakage. Due to these shortcomings. the value of existing volume attacks on response-hiding schemes is unclear. In this work. we close the aforementioned gap by introducing a parametrized leakage-abuse attack that applies to practical response-hiding structured encryption schemes. The use of nonparametric estimation techniques makes our attack agnostic to both the data and the query distribution. At the very core of our technique lies the newly defined concept of a counting function with respect to a range scheme. We propose a twophase framework to approximate the counting function for any range scheme. By simply switching one counting function for another. ie. the so-called “parameter” of our modular attack. an adversary can attack different encrypted range schemes.

In this work. we propose an algorithm for evaluating the adversarial robustness of -nearest neighbor classification. ie. finding a minimum-norm adversarial example. Diverging from previous proposals. we take a geometric approach by performing a search that expands outwards from a given input point.

This novel angle for a decades-old problem has inspired numerous exciting results in the intersection of machine learning and data structures. However. the main advantage of learned index structures. ie. the ability to adjust to the data at hand via the underlying ML-model. can become a disadvantage from a security perspective as it could be exploited.In this work. we present the first study of poisoning attacks on learned index structures. The required poisoning approach is different from all previous works since the model under attack is trained on a cumulative distribution function (CDF) and. thus. every injection on the training set has a cascading impact on multiple data values. We formulate the first poisoning attacks on linear regression models trained on the CDF. which is a basic building block of the proposed learned index structures. We generalize our poisoning techniques to attack a more advanced two-stage design of learned index structures called recursive model index (RMI). which has been shown to outperform traditional B-Trees.

In an OPRF protocol a receiver has an input r; the sender gets output s and the receiver gets output F (s; r). where F is a pseudorandom function and s is a random seed. Our protocol uses a novel adaptation of 1-out-of-2 OT-extension protocols. and is particularly efficient when used to generate a large batch of OPRF instances. The cost to realize m OPRF instances is roughly the cost to realize 3: 5m instances of standard 1-out-of-2 OTs (using state-of-the-art OT extension). We explore in detail our protocol's application to semihonest secure private set intersection (PSI). The fastest state-of-the-art PSI protocol (Pinkas et al..

Many countries and research groups have launched or announced mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random tokens. which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users' phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been diagnosed with the disease. However. prior approaches do not provide end-to-end privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular. these approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token metadata. linkage attacks by the server. or false reporting by users.In this work. we introduce Epione. a lightweight system for contact tracing with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their contacts have been diagnosed with the disease. while protecting the privacy of users' contacts from both central services and other users. and provides protection against false reporting. As a key building block. we present a new cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA). which allows two parties. each holding a set of items. to learn the intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.,True,esITaOoAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,35,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13293,7809964428434988833,/scholar?cites=7809964428434988833,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13293,0,0,0
1095904,PIR-PSI: Scaling Private Contact Discovery,2018,Daniel Demmler and Peter Rindal and Mike Rosulek and Ni Trieu,,18th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS),,,,An important initialization step in many social-networking applications is contact discovery. which allows a user of the service to identify which of its existing social contacts also use the service. Naïve approaches to contact discovery reveal a user’s entire set of social/professional contacts to the service. presenting a significant tension between functionality and privacy. In this work. we present a system for private contact discovery. in which the client learns only the intersection of its own contact list and a server’s user database. and the server learns only the (approximate) size of the client’s list. The protocol is specifically tailored to the case of a small client set and large user database. Our protocol has provable security guarantees and combines new ideas with state-of-the-art techniques from private information retrieval and private set intersection.We report on a highly optimized prototype implementation of our system. which is practical on real-world set sizes.

The fundamental theory of ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technology is offered. along with practical limitations as related to two factors (wave types and transducers). The focus is limited to the two main techniques used in pipe plants: First. straight beam evaluation and second. angle beam evaluation. The depth of defect (DD) is calculated using straight beam ultrasonic in six different materials according to their relative longitudinal wave (LW) velocities. The materials and respective velocities of LW are: rolled aluminum (6420 m/s). mild steel (5960 m/s). stainless steel-347 (5790 m/s). rolled copper (5010 m/s). annealed copper (4760 m/s). and brass (4700 m/s). In each material eight defects are modeled; the first represents l00% of the material thickness (D). 50.8 mm. The other seven cases represent the DD. as 87.5% of the material thickness. 75%. 62.5%. 50%. 37.5%. 25%. and 12.5%. respectively. Using angle beam evaluation. several parameters are calculated for six different reflection angles (βR) (45°. 50°. 55°. 60°. 65° and 70°).

Then the computation of the inverse kinematics for these points is accomplished with the help of a new proposed geometrical method to solve the problem of multi-solution caused by redundancy. The advantage of this method is that the angles between the adjacent links are the same. it makes controlling these links easier and the movement of the manipulator itself more stable. This method can be used for the equal length links planar manipulators.

1095965,Redundant manipulators kinematics inversion,2011,Samer Yahya and M Moghavvemi and Haider AF Mohamed,6,,26,5462-5470,Academic Journals,A robotic system is kinematically redundant when it possesses more degrees of freedom than those required to execute a given task. This paper reviews the well-known methods used to find the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators. Because redundant manipulators have infinite solutions for their inverse kinematics. therefore the conventional method that was used to calculate the inverse kinematics of non-redundant manipulators cannot be used. The methods used to calculate the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators are divided into three main categories in this paper: pseudoinverse. artificial intelligence and geometrical methods.

As the complexity of robot increases. obtaining the inverse kinematics solution requires the solution of non linear equations having transcendental functions are difficult and computationally expensive. This paper proposed a new geometrical method to find the inverse kinematics of the planar redundant manipulators.

Minimizing the computational complexity of torque optimization and the ability to calculate the magnitude of the joint torque accurately will result in a safe operation without overloading the joint actuators. This paper presents a mechanical design for a three dimensional planar redundant manipulator with the advantage of the reduction in the number of motors needed to control the joint angle. leading to a decrease in the weight of the manipulator. Many efforts have been focused on decreasing the weight of manipulators. such as using lightweight joints design or setting the actuators at the base of the manipulator and using tendons for the transmission of power to these joints. By using the design of this paper. only three motors are needed to control any n degrees of freedom in a three dimensional planar redundant manipulator instead of n motors. Therefore this design is very effective to decrease the weight of the manipulator as well as the number of motors needed to control the manipulator. In this paper. the torque of all the joints are calculated for the proposed manipulator (with three motors) and the conventional three dimensional planar manipulator (with one motor for each degree of freedom) to show the effectiveness of the proposed manipulator for decreasing the weight of the manipulator and minimizing driving joint torques.

FEDERICO II University 21 Claudio Naples I 80125 Italy,This paper reviews the methods used to find the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators. with focus on the secondary performance criteria of singularity avoidance. Redundant manipulators have infinite solutions for its inverse kinematics; therefore. one solution among these infinite solutions should be chosen. Consequently. secondary performance criteria such as singularity avoidance or obstacles avoidance optimization gain importance. This paper focuses on the methods used to optimize singularity avoidance of manipulators. Most of these methods based on the manipulator Jacobian Pseudoinverse. but in the case of hyper redundant manipulators with a high number of degrees of freedom. the computational burden of pseudoinverse Jacobian becomes prohibitive. despite proposed improvements. Therefore. this paper presents all the well-know methods that deal with inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators and using to optimize the singularity avoidance and no matter whether this method is based on Jacobian Pseudoinverse or not.

1096008,Decoupled and Descattered Monopole MIMO Antenna Array with Orthogonal Radiation Patterns,2019,Hussain Al-Rizzo and Ayman A Isaac and Sulaiman Z Tariq and Samer Yahya,,,,,IntechOpen,This chapter introduces a novel design concept to reduce mutual coupling among closely-spaced antenna elements of a MIMO array. This design concept significantly reduces the complexity of traditional/existing design approaches such as metamaterials. defected ground plane structures. soft electromagnetic surfaces. parasitic elements. matching and decoupling networks using a simple. yet a novel design alternative. The approach is based on a planar single decoupling element. consisting of a rectangular metallic ring resonator printed on one face of an ungrounded substrate. The decoupling structure surrounds a two-element vertical monopole antenna array fed by a coplanar waveguide structure. The design is shown both by simulations and measurements to reduce the mutual coupling by at least 20 dB. maintain the impedance bandwidth over which S11. is less than− 10 dB. and reduce the envelope correlation coefficient to below 0.001. The boresight of the far-field radiation patterns of the two vertical monopole wire antennas operating at 2.4 GHz and separated by 8 mm (λo/16). where λo is the free-space wavelength at 2.45 GHz. is shown to be orthogonal and inclined by 45 with respect to the horizontal (azimuthal) plane while maintaining the shape of the isolated single antenna element.,True,z8rvZfoAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,1,https://www.intechopen.com/books/modern-printed-circuit-antennas/decoupled-and-descattered-monopole-mimo-antenna-array-with-orthogonal-radiation-patterns,15105683760849681619,/scholar?cites=15105683760849681619,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/modern-printed-circuit-antennas/decoupled-and-descattered-monopole-mimo-antenna-array-with-orthogonal-radiation-patterns,0,0,0

However. the computational time and resources required to rigorously analyze the capacity offered by a base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antenna elements increase with the increase of the number of antenna elements in the array. In this paper. we present a novel approximation approach for modeling large microstrip antenna arrays in BSs of massive MIMO systems. The approach subdivides an  M  ×  N  array into columns. rows. rectangular. or square subarrays. each consisting of a group of elements. The coupling is rigorously taken into account within each subarray. but it is ignored between subarrays. using just an array factor instead.

Unfortunately. kernel vulnerabilities are not rare and are continuously being introduced with new kernel features. Once the kernel is compromised. attackers can bypass any access control checks. escalate their privileges. and hide the evidence of attacks. Many protection mechanisms have been proposed and deployed to prevent kernel exploits. However. a majority of these techniques only focus on preventing control-flow hijacking attacks; techniques that can mitigate noncontrol-data attacks either only apply to drivers/modules or impose too much overhead. The goal of our research is to develop a principled defense mechanism against memory-corruption-based privilege escalation attacks. Toward this end. we leverage dataflow integrity to enforce security invariants of the kernel access control system. In order for our protection mechanism to be practical. we develop two new techniques: one for automatically inferring data that are critical to the access control system without manual annotation. and the other for efficient DFI enforcement over the inference results. We have implemented a prototype of our technology for the ARM64 Linux kernel on an Android device.

However. existing approaches are not effective in informing users and security analysts about potential privacy leakage threats.

AAPL is based on multiple special static analysis techniques that we’ve developed for Android apps. including conditional flow identification and joint flow tracking. Furthermore.

1096067,How to Make ASLR Win the Clone Wars: Runtime Re-Randomization.,2016,Kangjie Lu and Wenke Lee and Stefan Nürnberger and Michael Backes,,,,,,Existing techniques for memory randomization such as the widely explored Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) perform a single. per-process randomization that is applied before or at the process’ load-time. The efficacy of such upfront randomizations crucially relies on the assumption that an attacker has only one chance to guess the randomized address. and that this attack succeeds only with a very low probability. Recent research results have shown that this assumption is not valid in many scenarios. eg. daemon servers fork child processes that inherent the state–and if applicable: the randomization–of their parents. and thereby create clones with the same memory layout. This enables the so-called clone-probing attacks where an adversary repeatedly probes different clones in order to increase its knowledge about their shared memory layout.In this paper. we propose RUNTIMEASLR–the first approach that prevents clone-probing attacks without altering the intended semantics of child process forking. The paper makes the following three contributions. First. we propose a semantics-preserving and runtime-based approach for preventing clone-probing attacks by re-randomizing the address space of every child after fork () at runtime while keeping the parent’s state. We achieve this by devising a novel. automated pointer tracking policy generation process that has to be run just once. followed by a pointer tracking mechanism that is only applied to the parent process. Second. we propose a systematic and holistic pointer tracking mechanism that correctly identifies pointers inside memory space.

1096070,Unleashing Use-Before-Initialization Vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel Using Targeted Stack Spraying.,2017,Kangjie Lu and Marie-Therese Walter and David Pfaff and Stefan Nümberger and Wenke Lee and Michael Backes,,,,,,A common type of memory error in the Linux kernel is using uninitialized variables (uninitialized use). Uninitialized uses not only cause undefined behaviors but also impose a severe security risk if an attacker takes control of the uninitialized variables. However. reliably exploiting uninitialized uses on the kernel stack has been considered infeasible until now since the code executed prior to triggering the vulnerability must leave an attacker-controlled pattern on the stack. Therefore. uninitialized uses are largely overlooked and regarded as undefined behaviors. rather than security vulnerabilities. In particular. full memorysafety techniques (eg. SoftBound+ CETS) exclude uninitialized use as a prevention target. and widely used systems such as OpenSSL even use uninitialized memory as a randomness source.In this paper. we propose a fully automated targeted stackspraying approach for the Linux kernel that reliably facilitates the exploitation of uninitialized uses. Our targeted stack-spraying includes two techniques:(1) a deterministic stack spraying technique that suitably combines tailored symbolic execution and guided fuzzing to identify kernel inputs that user-mode programs can use to deterministically guide kernel code paths and thereby leave attacker-controlled data on the kernel stack. and (2) an exhaustive memory spraying technique that uses memory occupation and pollution to reliably control a large region of the kernel stack. We show that our targeted stack-spraying approach allows attackers to reliably control more than 91% of the Linux kernel stack. which. in combination with uninitialized-use vulnerabilities. suffices for a privilege …,True,1F9N6icAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,37,https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ndss2017_09-2_Lu_paper.pdf,1103432039126666355,/scholar?cites=1103432039126666355,,https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ndss2017_09-2_Lu_paper.pdf,0,0,0

1096076,Where does it go? refining indirect-call targets with multi-layer type analysis,2019,Kangjie Lu and Hong Hu,,,,1867-1881,,System software commonly uses indirect calls to realize dynamic program behaviors. However. indirect-calls also bring challenges to constructing a precise control-flow graph that is a standard pre-requisite for many static program-analysis and system-hardening techniques. Unfortunately. identifying indirect-call targets is a hard problem. In particular. modern compilers do not recognize indirect-call targets by default. Existing approaches identify indirect-call targets based on type analysis that matches the types of function pointers and the ones of address-taken functions. Such approaches. however. suffer from a high false-positive rate as many irrelevant functions may share the same types.,True,1F9N6icAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,15,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319535.3354244,10669939897950143123,/scholar?cites=10669939897950143123,,https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/mlta.pdf,0,0,0
1096077,Check it again: Detecting lacking-recheck bugs in os kernels,2018,Wenwen Wang and Kangjie Lu and Pen-Chung Yew,,,,1899-1913,,Operating system kernels carry a large number of security checks to validate security-sensitive variables and operations. For example. a security check should be embedded in a code to ensure that a user-supplied pointer does not point to the kernel space. Using security-checked variables is typically safe. However. in reality. security-checked variables are often subject to modification after the check. If a recheck is lacking after a modification. security issues may arise. eg. adversaries can control the checked variable to launch critical attacks such as out-of-bound memory access or privilege escalation. We call such cases lacking-recheck (LRC) bugs. a subclass of TOCTTOU bugs. which have not been explored yet.

Intuitively. enforcing multiple security mechanisms on a target program will improve its overall security.

As a result. the security threats of memory disclosures are now significantly aggravated---they break not only data confidentiality but also the effectiveness of security mechanisms.

1096084,Precisely Characterizing Security Impact in a Flood of Patches via Symbolic Rule Comparison,2020,Qiushi Wu and Yang He and Stephen McCamant and Kangjie Lu,,,,,,A bug is a vulnerability if it has security impacts when triggered. Determining the security impacts of a bug is important to both defenders and attackers. Maintainers of large software systems are bombarded with numerous bug reports and proposed patches. with missing or unreliable information about their impact. Determining which few bugs are vulnerabilities is difficult. and bugs that a maintainer believes do not have security impact will be de-prioritized or even ignored. On the other hand. a public report of a bug with a security impact is a powerful first step towards exploitation. Adversaries may exploit such bugs to launch devastating attacks if defenders do not fix them promptly. Common practice is for maintainers to assess the security impacts of bugs manually. but the scaling and reliability challenges of manual analysis lead to missed vulnerabilities.We propose an automated approach. SID. to determine the security impacts for a bug given its patch. so that maintainers can effectively prioritize applying the patch to the affected programs. The insight behind SID is that both the effect of a patch (either submitted or applied) and security-rule violations (eg. out-of-bound access) can be modeled as constraints that can be automatically solved. SID incorporates rule comparison. using under-constrained symbolic execution of a patch to determine the security impacts of an un-applied patch. SID can further automatically classify vulnerabilities based on their security impacts. We have implemented SID and applied it to bug patches of the Linux kernel and matching CVE-assigned vulnerabilities to evaluate its precision and recall.

To date. it is however still challenging to compare fuzzers due to the inconsistency of the benchmarks. performance metrics. and/or environments for evaluation. which buries the useful insights and thus impedes the discovery of promising fuzzing primitives. In this paper. we design and develop UNIFUZZ. an open-source and metrics-driven platform for assessing fuzzers in a comprehensive and quantitative manner. Specifically. UNIFUZZ to date has incorporated 35 usable fuzzers. a benchmark of 20 real-world programs. and six categories of performance metrics. We first systematically study the usability of existing fuzzers. find and fix a number of flaws. and integrate them into UNIFUZZ. Based on the study. we propose a collection of pragmatic performance metrics to evaluate fuzzers from six complementary perspectives. Using UNIFUZZ. we conduct in-depth evaluations of several prominent fuzzers including AFL [1]. AFLFast [2]. Angora [3]. Honggfuzz [4]. MOPT [5]. QSYM [6]. T-Fuzz [7] and VUzzer64 [8]. We find that none of them outperforms the others across all the target programs. and that using a single metric to assess the performance of a fuzzer may lead to unilateral conclusions. which demonstrates the significance of comprehensive metrics. Moreover. we identify and investigate previously overlooked factors that may significantly affect a fuzzer's performance. including instrumentation methods and crash analysis tools.

However. it is vulnerable to false negative errors caused by implicit flows. situations in which tainted data values affect control flow. which in turn affects other data. We propose DTA++. an enhancement to dynamic taint analysis that additionally propagates taint along a targeted subset of control-flow dependencies. Our technique first diagnoses implicit flows within information-preserving transformations. where they are most likely to cause undertainting.

1096099,Evaluating SFI for a CISC Architecture.,2006,Stephen McCamant and Greg Morrisett,,,,,,Executing untrusted code while preserving security requires that the code be prevented from modifying memory or executing instructions except as explicitly allowed. Software-based fault isolation (SFI) or “sandboxing” enforces such a policy by rewriting the untrusted code at the instruction level. However. the original sandboxing technique of Wahbe et al. is applicable only to RISC architectures. and most other previous work is either insecure. or has been not described in enough detail to give confidence in its security properties. We present a new sandboxing technique that can be applied to a CISC architecture like the IA-32. and whose application can be checked at load-time to minimize the TCB. We describe an implementation which provides a robust security guarantee and has low runtime overheads (an average of 21% on the SPECint2000 benchmarks). We evaluate the utility of the technique by applying it to untrusted decompression modules in an archive tool. and its safety by constructing a machine-checked proof that any program approved by the verification algorithm will respect the desired safety property.,True,xx3cu9EAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,271,https://www.usenix.org/event/sec06/tech/mccamant/mccamant.pdf,10319175292629858775,/scholar?cites=10319175292629858775,,https://www.usenix.org/event/sec06/tech/mccamant/mccamant.pdf,0,0,0

In contrast to previous techniques based on reachability from secret inputs (tainting). it achieves a more precise quantitative result by computing a maximum flow of information between the inputs and outputs. The technique uses static control-flow regions to soundly account for implicit flows via branches and pointer operations. but operates dynamically by observing one or more program executions and giving numeric flow bounds specific to them (eg."" 17 bits""). The maximum flow in a network also gives a minimum cut (a set of edges that separate the secret input from the output). which can be used to efficiently check that the same policy is satisfied on future executions.

Binary code reutilization is useful for a number of security applications. including reusing the proprietary cryptographic or unpacking functions from a malware sample and for rewriting a network dialog. In this paper we conduct the first systematic study of automated binary code reutilization and its security applications. The main challenge in binary code reutilization is understanding the code fragments interface. We propose a novel technique to identify the prototype of an undocumented code fragment directly from the programs binary. without access to source code or symbol information. Further. we must also extract the code itself from the binary so that it is self-contained and can be easily reused in another program. We design and implement a tool that uses a combination of dynamic and static analysis to automatically identify the prototype and extract the instructions of an assembly function into a form that can be reused by other C code. The extracted function can be run independently of the rest of the programs functionality and shared with other users. We apply our approach to scenarios that include extracting the encryption and decryption routines from malware samples. and show that these routines can be reused by a network proxy to decrypt encrypted traffic on the network. This allows the network proxy to rewrite the malwares encrypted traffic by combining the extracted encryption and …,True,xx3cu9EAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,161,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA538737,14851895939588648142,/scholar?cites=14851895939588648142,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA538737.pdf,0,0,0

There are a variety of different techniques available to try to find such vulnerabilities. One of the most common techniques is fuzzing. Of the different approaches to fuzzing. one of the simplest and also most successful is mutation based fuzzing. which amounts to making random changes to an input and testing it within the application. One of the major limitations with this type of approach is not that it doesnʼt find problems. but rather it can find too many problems. The limiting factor in finding and exploiting (or fixing) security vulnerabilities in this case is not finding the vulnerabilities. but rather prioritizing the ones found and determining their root cause. This is a problem for two sets of people. One group is security researchers and exploit developers who donʼt know which crashes to look at and have the time consuming task of trying to determine the root cause of the problem from an invalid input and a crash. The other group are developers who are also interested in the underlying cause of the crash. but instead of trying to exploit it. they are trying to fix it. Understanding the cause of the vulnerability is important to fixing it correctly. otherwise the fix may correct one aspect of the vulnerability or code path to the bug. but not all code paths. For developers. even with source code in hand. this is not always an easy task.This whitepaper attempts to alleviate this problem by introducing a solution using BitBlaze. a binary analysis tool.

1096120,Transformation-aware Exploit Generation using a HI-CFG,2013,Dan Caselden and Alex Bazhanyuk and Mathias Payer and Laszlo Szekeres and Stephen McCamant and Dawn Song,,,UCB/EECS-2013-85,,California Univ Berkeley Dept of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,A common task for security analysts is to determine whether potentially unsafe code constructs as found by static analysis or code review can be triggered by an attacker-controlled input to the program under analysis. We refer to this problem as proof-of-concept POC exploit generation. Exploit generation is challenging to automate because it requires precise reasoning across a large code base in practice it is usually a manual task. An intuitive approach to exploit generation is to break down a programs relevant computation into a sequence of transformations that map an input value into the value that can trigger an exploit. We automate this intuition by describing an approach to discover the buffer structure the chain of buffers used between transformations of a program. and use this structure to construct an exploit input by inverting one transformation at a time. We propose a new program representation. a hybrid information-and control-flow graph HI-CFG. and give algorithms to build a HI-CFG from instruction traces. We then describe how to guide program exploration using symbolic execution to efficiently search for transformation pre-images. We implement our techniques in a tool that operates on applications in x86 binary form. In two case studies we discuss how our tool creates POC exploits for 1 a vulnerability in a PDF rendering library that is reachable through multiple different transformation stages and 2 a vulnerability in the processing stage of a specific document format in AbiWord.Descriptors:,True,xx3cu9EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,26,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA587051,164860847244232247,/scholar?cites=164860847244232247,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA587051.pdf,0,0,0

Programming languages and system software manipulate data in one set of formats in volatile main memory (DRAM) using a load/store interface. while storage systems maintain persistence in another set of formats in non-volatile memories. such as Flash and hard disk drives in traditional systems. using a file system interface. Unfortunately. such an approach suffers from the system performance and energy overheads of locating data. moving data. and translating data between the different formats of these two levels of storage that are accessed via two vastly different interfaces. Yet today. new non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies show the promise of storage capacity and endurance similar to or better than Flash at latencies comparable to DRAM. making them prime candidates for providing applications a persistent single-level store with a single load/store interface to access all system data. Our key insight is that in future systems equipped with NVM. the energy consumed executing operating system and file system code to access persistent data in traditional systems becomes an increasingly large contributor to total energy. The goal of this work is to explore the design of a Persistent Memory Manager that coordinates the management of memory and storage under a single hardware unit in a single address space.

With such a performance improvement. however. power consumption of GPU systems is dramatically increased. Up to 30% of the total power of a GPU system is consumed by the graphic memory itself. Therefore. reducing graphics memory power consumption is critical to mitigate the power challenge.In this article. we propose an energy-efficient reconfigurable 3D die-stacking graphics memory design that integrates wide-interface graphics DRAMs side-by-side with a GPU processor on a silicon interposer. The proposed architecture is a “3D+2.5D” system. where the DRAM memory itself is 3D stacked memory with through-silicon via (TSV). whereas the integration of DRAM and the GPU processor is through the interposer solution (2 …,True,MDuCskIAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,57,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2541228.2541231,2598312131549246814,/scholar?cites=2598312131549246814,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2541228.2541231,0,0,0

FPGAs using non-volatile memories have been the focus of attention with zero boot-up delay. real-time reconfigurability. and superior energy efficiency. This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) non-volatile FPGA architecture (3D-Non-FAR) using phase change memory (PCM) and 3D die stacking techniques. Basic structures in a conventional FPGA architecture are renovated with PCM. and components are repartitioned and reorganized in 3D-NonFAR to allow an efficient 3D integration of PCM elements. 3D-NonFAR not only preserves the advantages of existing non-volatile FPGAs. but also provides high integration density. high performance. and bit-level programmability. which enable PCM as a universal memory replacement in FPGAs.

However. as graph computing continues to scale. it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve a high bandwidth on generic computing architectures. The primary reasons include: the random access pattern causing local bandwidth degradation. the poor locality leading to unpredictable global data access. heavy conflicts on updating the same vertex. and unbalanced workloads across processing units. Processing-in-memory (PIM) has been explored as a promising solution to providing high bandwidth. yet open questions of graph processing on PIM devices remain in: 1) how to design hardware specializations and the interconnection scheme to fully utilize bandwidth of PIM devices and ensure locality and 2) how to allocate data and schedule processing flow to avoid conflicts and balance workloads.

1096143,DeepInspect: A Black-box Trojan Detection and Mitigation Framework for Deep Neural Networks.,2019,Huili Chen and Cheng Fu and Jishen Zhao and Farinaz Koushanfar,,,,4658-4664,,Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to Neural Trojan (NT) attacks where the adversary injects malicious behaviors during DNN training. This type of ‘backdoor’attack is activated when the input is stamped with the trigger pattern specified by the attacker. resulting in an incorrect prediction of the model. Due to the wide application of DNNs in various critical fields. it is indispensable to inspect whether the pre-trained DNN has been trojaned before employing a model. Our goal in this paper is to address the security concern on unknown DNN to NT attacks and ensure safe model deployment. We propose DeepInspect. the first black-box Trojan detection solution with minimal prior knowledge of the model. DeepInspect learns the probability distribution of potential triggers from the queried model using a conditional generative model. thus retrieves the footprint of backdoor insertion. In addition to NT detection. we show that DeepInspect’s trigger generator enables effective Trojan mitigation by model patching. We corroborate the effectiveness. efficiency. and scalability of DeepInspect against the state-of-the-art NT attacks across various benchmarks.

1096144,Steal but no force: Efficient hardware undo+ redo logging for persistent memory systems,2018,Matheus Almeida Ogleari and Ethan L Miller and Jishen Zhao,,,,336-349,IEEE,Persistent memory is a new tier of memory that functions as a hybrid of traditional storage systems and main memory. It combines the benefits of both: the data persistence of storage with the fast load/store interface of memory. Most previous persistent memory designs place careful control over the order of writes arriving at persistent memory. This can prevent caches and memory controllers from optimizing system performance through write coalescing and reordering. We identify that such write-order control can be relaxed by employing undo+redo logging for data in persistent memory systems. However. traditional software logging mechanisms are expensive to adopt in persistent memory due to performance and energy overheads. Previously proposed hardware logging schemes are inefficient and do not fully address the issues in software.

These problematic layout configurations need to be efficiently detected and eliminated from a design layout to enable better yield.

The system features a pre-coarsening stage which is equipped with a fast congestion-driven L-pattern global routing followed by the rvia-driven detailed routing. The L-pattern global routing benefits a lot to the reduction of vias and thus relieves the burden of redundant via addition. Then the rvia-driven maze routing algorithm considers the addition of redundant vias during routing. Finally the redundant via placement heuristic also contributes to improve the completion rate.

Physical design for flow-based biochips determines the number of flow-channel intersections. and thus affects the number of microvalves.

Consequently. the efficacy of such logging—how often and how well error causes can be determined via postmortem log messages—is a matter of significant practical importance. However. there is little empirical data about how well existing logging practices work and how they can yet be improved. We describe a comprehensive study characterizing the efficacy of logging practices across five large and widely used software systems. Across 250 randomly sampled reported failures. we first identify that more than half of the failures could not be diagnosed well using existing log data. Surprisingly. we find that majority of these unreported failures are manifested via a common set of generic error patterns (eg. system call return errors) that. if logged. can significantly ease the diagnosis of these unreported failure cases. We further mechanize this knowledge in a tool called Errlog. that proactively adds appropriate logging statements into source code while adding only 1.4% performance overhead.

Smartphones have gone from closed platforms containing only pre-installed applications to open platforms hosting a variety of thirdparty applications. Unfortunately. this change has also led to a rapid increase in Abnormal Battery Drain (ABD) problems that can be caused by software defects or misconfiguration. Such issues can drain a fully-charged battery within a couple of hours. and can potentially affect a significant number of users.This paper presents eDoctor. a practical tool that helps regular users troubleshoot abnormal battery drain issues on smartphones. eDoctor leverages the concept of execution phases to capture an app’s time-varying behavior. which can then be used to identify an abnormal app. Based on the result of a diagnosis. eDoctor suggests the most appropriate repair solution to users. To evaluate eDoctor’s effectiveness. we conducted both in-lab experiments and a controlled user study with 31 participants and 17 realworld ABD issues together with 4 injected issues in 19 apps.

Since such configurations are not needed for initialization. many systems do not check their settings early (eg. at startup time). Consequently. the errors become latent until their manifestations cause severe damage. such as breaking the failure handling.

For this reason. the major availability breakdowns and performance anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle underlying faults. ie. gray failure rather than fail-stop failure. In this paper. we discuss our experiences with gray failure in production cloud-scale systems to show its broad scope and consequences. We also argue that a key feature of gray failure is differential observability: that the system's failure detectors may not notice problems even when applications are afflicted by them. This realization leads us to believe that. to best deal with them. we should focus on bridging the gap between different components' perceptions of what constitutes failure.,True,2y-8usQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,63,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3102980.3103005,4369373863260707505,/scholar?cites=4369373863260707505,,https://jaylorch.net/static/publications/grayfailure.pdf,0,0,0

Unfortunately. these failures are not well understood. Nor can they be effectively detected. In this paper. we first study 100 real-world partial failures from five mature systems to understand their characteristics. We find that these failures are caused by a variety of defects that require the unique conditions of the production environment to be triggered. Manually writing effective detectors to systematically detect such failures is both time-consuming and error-prone. We thus propose OmegaGen. a static analysis tool that automatically generates customized watchdogs for a given program by using a novel program reduction technique. We have successfully applied OmegaGen to six large distributed systems. In evaluating 22 real-world partial failure cases in these systems. the generated watchdogs can detect 20 cases with a median detection time of 4.2 seconds. and pinpoint the failure scope for 18 cases.

We particularly advocate a notion of intrinsic software watchdogs and propose an abstraction for it.

In an effort to build an automatic solution for a leading data warehousing company to improve the comparative performance analysis efficiency. we implemented machine learning approaches proposed by existing research.

1096262,Toward Understanding and Dealing with Failures in Cloud-Scale Systems,2016,Peng Huang,,,,,,In cloud-scale systems. fault is a fact of life. To tolerate faults and provide highly-available service is arguably the single most important task for cloud builders. Yet. despite the considerable efforts into fault-tolerance and software engineering for reliability. all cloud scale services continue to experience costly failures. A natural question to ask is: why do cloud-scale services still fail despite the abundant fault-tolerance and how we can further improve? This thesis attempts to shed light on this question.In the first part of this thesis. we study a set of 34 publically disclosed cloud service outages that we gathered and consider them from the point of view of fault-tolerance mechanisms. We present a novel taxonomy to categorize why the mechanisms may be ineffective; it includes faults that cannot be handled by replication. insufficient redundancy. and undetected faults. We also explore the root causes of failures. and investigate the interactions of system components in failures that were caused by multiple faults.We find that. in many cases. while cloud systems are robust to tolerate traditional faults. they are fragile under misconfiguration. which is a major source of service unavailability. To further improve cloud service quality. it is crucial to reduce misconfiguration.In the second half of this thesis. we propose a framework. ConfValley. to systematically validate configuration and catch errors before production.

Ltd.,Osteogenic cultures of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are predominately derived from three‐dimensional cell spheroids called embryoid bodies (EBs). An alternative method that has been attempted and merits further attention avoids EBs through the immediate separation of ESC colonies into single cells. However. this method has not been well characterized and the effect of omitting the EB step is unknown. Herein. we report that culturing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) without the EB stage leads to a sevenfold greater number of osteogenic cells and to spontaneous bone nodule formation after 10–12 days. In contrast. when hESCs were differentiated as EBs for 5 days followed by plating of single cells. bone nodules formed after 4 weeks only in the presence of dexamethasone.

The appropriate scaffold for a hard tissue such as bone has a high degree of interconnected macroporosity and allows the rapid invasion of cells while maintaining a rigid structure. Several approaches are described for constructing tissue-engineering scaffolds for bone.

Low and inefficient homing of systemically delivered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). for example. is thought to be a major limitation of existing MSC-based therapeutic approaches. caused predominantly by inadequate expression of cell surface adhesion receptors. Using a platform approach that preserves the MSC phenotype and does not require genetic manipulation. we modified the surface of MSCs with a nanometer-scale polymer construct containing sialyl Lewisx (sLex) that is found on the surface of leukocytes and mediates cell rolling within inflamed tissue.

1096433,Mechanism of the stereocomplex formation between enantiomeric poly (lactide) s,1996,Davide Brizzolara and Hans-Joachim Cantow and Kay Diederichs and Egbert Keller and Abraham J Domb,29,Macromolecules,1,191-197,American Chemical Society,Poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(d-lactide) (PDLA) crystallize into a stereocomplex with a melting point 50 °C higher than the crystals of the enantiomers. The racemic crystal is formed by packing β-form 31-helices of opposite absolute configuration alternatingly side by side. Single crystals of the stereocomplex exhibit triangular shape. The drastic difference of the powder patterns evidences the different packing of the β-form in the stereocomplex and in crystals of the pure lactides. By force field simulation of the stereocomplex and the PLLA unit cells and of their powder patterns. the reasons for the different packing could be clarified.
