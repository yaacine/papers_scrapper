For the thermal steady state. the impact is negligible and for short-time temperature reductions. as know from night temperature set-back. the found differences are also not significant. However. if a room is dynamically heated. for example while charging its thermal mass as a measure of load shifting. distinct temperature differences between empty and furnished rooms are detected. After just 4 hours of increased set temperature. an empty massive room was 1.2 K warmer than the same modelled room with laminate flooring and furniture inside.

However. the estimation of time constants for a very slowly reacting system such as underfloor heating is not easy in practice. In this work. different methods were used to estimate the time constants for underfloor heating. Graphical estimation and transfer function fitting were the core approaches. Measurement data and simulations on a calibrated model were used for the estimations. The resulting time constant values for the graphical method depended clearly on the setback duration and the values differed up to a factor of 100.

It is known that proportional–integral (PI) controllers can regulate most processes more precisely. However. hydronic UFH systems have long time constants. especially in low-energy buildings. and PI parameters are not easy to set manually. In this work. several potential PI parameter estimation methods were applied. including optimizing the parameters in GenOpt. calculating the parameters based on simplified models. and tuning the parameters automatically in Matlab. For all found parameter combinations. the energy consumption and control precision were evaluated. Simpler methods were compared to the optimal solutions to find similar parameters. Compared with an on–off controller with a 0.5 K dead-band. the best PI parameter combination found was with a proportional gain of 18 and an integration time of 2300 s. which could decrease the energy consumption for heating by 9% and by 5% compared with default PI parameters. Moreover. while GenOpt was the best method to find the optimal parameters. it was also possible with a simple automatic test and calculation within a weekend. The test can be. for example. 6-h setbacks applied during the nights or weekend-long pseudo-random changes in the setpoint signal. The parameters can be calculated based on the simplified model from these tests using any well-known simple method.

This paper analyses low energy buildings incorporating high-efficiency heating systems with limited power. as additional power for district heating and heat pump systems will need costly investments. The setback efficiency is estimated for different types of heating systems. Underfloor heating is compared to radiators both for limited and excess power. Based on estimated time constants. suitable heat-up time is calculated to minimise the time when temperatures stay below setpoint during occupancy. The energy saving potential of night-time and weekend setback periods in an office are analysed. It is found that the energy saving potential of setback is low under given constraints.

Although initially mostly installed for improving comfort. their energy saving potential has become a renowned topic. The main potential lies in temperature reduction during the times people are not home. which can be detected by positioning their phones. Even if the locating is precise. the maximum time people are away from home is short in comparison to the buildings’ time constants. The gaps are shortened by the smart thermostats. which start to heat up hours before occupancy to ensure comfort temperatures at arrival. and low losses through high insulation and heat-recovery ventilation in new buildings. which slow down the cool-down process additional to the thermal mass.

As a result. the heating systems. designed assuming steady-state conditions with no heat gains. are over-dimensioned for most of the heating period.

The problem setting can be considered as an extension and generalization of the well-known Kirsch problem of the classical elasticity theory which is here extended with respect to the external loadings and generalized with respect to the continuum framework. A closed-form solution in terms of displacements is derived for the problem within the strain gradient elasticity theory on plane stress/strain assumptions. The main characters of the total and Cauchy stress fields are analyzed near the circumference of the hole for different combinations of bi-axial tensions and for different parameter values. For the original Kirsch problem concerning a uni-axially stretched plate. the analytical solution fields for stresses and strains are …,True,3Gv2gUMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,16,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768316303171,16391352980575025506,/scholar?cites=16391352980575025506,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768316303171,0,0,0

Isogeometric analysis provides a high accuracy when finding the normal to the reaction front. and it is applied with the use of Abaqus to a numerical simulation of the front propagation.

The chemical reaction front also affects the mechanical stress-strain behavior via chemical transformation strains. As a result. one faces a complex coupled problem of mechanochemistry with a moving chemical reaction front. Recently it was shown that the configurational force driving the reaction front is the normal component of the chemical affinity tensor and that the reaction rate depends on the orientation of the surface element at which the reaction takes place (see. eg.[3] and references therein). A kinetic equation was formulated in terms of the reaction front velocity depending on the normal component of the affinity tensor. In this approach the stresses affect the front velocity through the chemical affinity tensor.In a numerical simulation. the front propagation is realized as a front movement in the normal direction proportionally to the front velocity by utilizing the chemical affinity tensor concept. The simulation is based on isogeometric analysis [4] together with ABAQUS user defined subroutines and elements [5]. By solving various boundary value problems numerically we demonstrate a variety of front behaviors depending on material parameters. boundary conditions. and the initial configuration. We show that the reaction front can be retarded and even blocked by mechanical stresses.

Early treatment is based on surgery and thyroid remnant ablation (TRA) by means of radioiodine therapy. Despite radioiodine being widely used for decades. the choice of ablative activity is generally empirical and no consensus has been reached to date. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and safety of different radioiodine activities. In addition. we compared the ablation rate in patients treated in the hypothyroid state or after recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) administration. retrospectively reviewing the records of 471 patients affected by differentiated thyroid cancer.,True,Mfn1cGsAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,14,https://journals.lww.com/nuclearmedicinecomm/Fulltext/2015/11000/Thyroid_remnant_ablation_in_differentiated_thyroid.5.aspx,15644719278244463237,/scholar?cites=15644719278244463237,,,0,0,0

In the Norwegian definition of the passive house standard (NS3700). the current building code TEK10 or existing concepts of ZEB residential buildings. building envelopes are so-called super-insulated in order to drastically reduce the space-heating needs. Given this high level of insulation. it is theoretically possible to simplify the space-heating distribution inside the building by reducing the number of heat emitters. There is currently a lack of theoretical knowledge about the design of simplified distribution systems and lack of evidence-based feedbacks about their actual performance during real operation. The present work investigates the performance of simplified space-heating distribution in superinsulated residential buildings using one radiator per floor. The case with less than one heat emitter per floor is not considered here. In all investigated cases. the building was equipped with balanced mechanical ventilation with one centralized heat recovery and one set-point temperature for the supply ventilation air (sometimes called one-zone mechanical ventilation).

Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Engineering. ICEE,,1,Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. Department of Construction Economics & Property,Little attention has been paid to the heat conductivity of internal walls and floors as it does not significantly affect heat losses of a building. However. it is important to study heat transfer between apartments. In the framework of the current study. on site heat conductivity measurements were transmitted to support the results received by energy simulations. Increasing energy efficiency of buildings has become one of the severe problems that has to be solved in the near future. The goal of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 20% by the year 2020 has been set to all EU members states. As residential sector is responsible for a large part of energy consumption. it is clear that refurbishing dwellings is an effective means of reducing CO2 emissions. In case of old apartment buildings. space heating is the single most common contributor to greenhouse gas emissions [1]. Space heating consumption of apartment buildings can mainly be reduced by insulating the envelope and installing windows with low heat conductivity. As heat losses of buildings are reduced. thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) must be installed. Studies show that TRVs can contribute greatly to reducing heating consumption. however it is also noted that they must be used correctly [2. 3]. The use of thermostats has been studied by Karjalainen and it was concluded that due to different reasons. large part of people do not know how to use TRVs [4. 5].One means of drawing more dwelling residents’ attention to TRVs is implementing energy allocation systems that record the energy consumption and divide it between flats [6].

The losses of the direct normal irradiance between the heliostat field and receiver in a solar tower plant are mainly caused by atmospheric scattering and absorption by aerosol and water vapor concentration in the atmospheric boundary layer. Due to a high aerosol particle number. radiation losses can be significantly larger in desert environments compared to the standard atmospheric conditions which are usually considered in ray-tracing or plant optimization tools. Information about on-site atmospheric extinction is only rarely available. To measure these radiation losses. two different commercially available instruments were tested. and more than 19 months of measurements were collected and compared at the Plataforma Solar de Almería. Both instruments are primarily used to determine the meteorological optical range (MOR). The Vaisala FS11 scatterometer is based on a monochromatic near-infrared light source emission and measures the strength of scattering processes in a small air volume mainly caused by aerosol particles. The Optec LPV4 long-path visibility transmissometer determines the monochromatic attenuation between a light-emitting diode (LED) light source at 532 nm and a receiver and therefore also accounts for absorption processes.

Ground measured data are necessary to obtain the required level of accuracy and are often obtained with Rotating Shadowband Irradiometers (RSI) that use photodiode pyranometers and correction functions to account for systematic effects. The uncertainty of Si-pyranometers has been investigated. but so far basically empirical studies were published or decisive uncertainty influences had to be estimated based on experience in analytical studies.

The primordial lower accuracy of their photodiode sensor. usually a LI-200 pyranometer from LI-COR Inc.. is mainly caused by restrictions of their spectral sensitivity and temperature dependence. However accuracy is notably increased by application of corrections to the raw sensor response.

However. measuring circumsolar radiation is demanding and only very limited data sets are available. As a step to bridge this gap. a method was developed which allows for determination of circumsolar radiation from cirrus cloud properties retrieved by the geostationary satellites of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) family. The method takes output from the COCS algorithm to generate a cirrus mask from MSG data and then uses the retrieval algorithm APICS to obtain the optical thickness and the effective radius of the detected cirrus. which in turn are used to determine the circumsolar radiation from a pre-calculated look-up table. The look-up table was generated from extensive calculations using a specifically adjusted version of the Monte Carlo radiative transfer model MYSTIC and by developing a fast yet precise parameterization. APICS was also improved such that it determines the surface albedo. which is needed for the cloud property retrieval. in a self-consistent way instead of using external data. Furthermore. it was extended to consider new ice particle shapes to allow for an uncertainty analysis concerning this parameter. We found that the nescience of the ice particle shape leads to an uncertainty of up to 50%.

The common yield analysis software packages system advisor model (SAM) and greenius only allow the input of a constant mean nfield and constant cleaning costs. This oversimplifies real conditions because soiling is a highly time-dependent parameter and operators might adjust cleaning activities depending on factors such as soiling rate and irradiance.

For concentrating solar technologies the focus of the resource assessment lies on direct beam irradiation. Unfortunately. high accuracy irradiance data are scarcely available in regions which are attractive for solar energy applications. Satellite data can only be used in combination with ground data to estimate inter-annual variability and long-term mean values. Hence. new ground measurements have to be collected for solar plant projects. Ground measurement data usually show significantly higher accuracies than satellite derived irradiance data. when general guidelines regarding site selection and preparation. instrument selection and maintenance and data quality monitoring are respected. These best practices for Rotating Shadowband Irradiometers (RSIs) are presented in this document. Appropriate irradiance sensors for ground measurements must be selected in consideration of general surrounding conditions for equipment and maintenance to gain and maintain the necessary accuracy over the entire operation period. Thermopile instruments like pyrheliometers as specified in ISO standard 9060 [ISO9060 1990] are severely affected by soiling [Pape2009] and also require expensive and maintenance- intensive support devices such as solar trackers and power supply. Thus. the uncertainty of resource assessment with pyrheliometers depends heavily on the maintenance personnel and cannot be determined accurately in many cases.

1235545,Circumsolar radiation and beam irradiance measurements for focusing collectors,2012,Stefan Wilbert and Robert Pitz-Paal and Joachim Jaus,,,,,,Depending on the present atmospheric conditions a considerable part of the direct solar radiation can be scattered into the circumsolar region closely surrounding the solar disk. This forward scattered radiation. the circumsolar radiation. is widely detected by pyrheliometers. while concentrating solar collectors can only use a concentrator specific fraction of it. This lower response to circumsoalr radiation can lead to systematic overestimations of the collector performance. when thin clouds mask the sun. this overestimation can be greater than 10% although the direct normal irradiance (DNI) is often above 200 W/M2 in such case. The fraction of the measured DNI that is caused by circumsolar radiation varies depending on the day conditions. The average of this fraction depends also on the location. Thus. representativ site specific information on the circumsolar radiation is necessary for the accurate calcuation of the expected yield of a concentrating solar plant. Beam irradiance data for concentrating solar collectors should be accompanied with information on the circumsolar radiation. However. such information is not available for locations that are now of particular interest for concentrating solar power (CSP) or concentrating photovoltaics (CPV). As a first step to overcome this complication. a reference system consisting of the Sun and Aureole Measurement System (SAM). an Aeronet sun photometer and post processing software has been developed and is used at a small number of sites.

In all cases. to obtain high efficiencies. high absorptivity in the visible and near infrared range has to be combined with a high porosity to create large surfaces for convective heat transfer from the solid absorber to the fluid. However. it can be shown that especially high performance absorbers tend to be sensitive to inhomogeneous flux distributions. which may cause local overheating of the material.

Pressurized volumetric receivers have proven their feasibility and good performance. and their integration into gas turbine cycles has been demonstrated. One disadvantage of this system is the necessity to use secondary concentrators.

Computation time for performance estimation is saved by using a simplified mathematical model for the concentrator optics: the reflected image of each heliostat is described by a circular normal distribution. This approximation is justified when the standard deviation of the statistical mirror error exceeds 1 mrad. The paper shows details about the mathematical model and its validation.

However. the variable nature of this energy source poses an operational challenge for solar power plants and electrical grids. Intra hour solar irradiance nowcasts with a high temporal and spatial resolution could be used to tackle this challenge. All sky imager (ASI) based nowcasting systems fulfill the requirements in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. However. ASI nowcasts can only be used if the required accuracies for applications in solar power plants and electrical grids are fulfilled. Scalar error metrics. such as mean absolute deviation. root mean square deviation. and skill score are commonly used to estimate the accuracy of nowcasting systems. However. these overall error metrics represented by a single number per metric are neither suitable to determine the real time accuracy of a nowcasting system in the actual weather situation. nor suitable to describe any spatially resolved nowcast accuracy. The performance of ASI-based nowcasting systems is strongly related to the prevailing weather conditions. Depending on weather conditions. large discrepancies between the overall and current system uncertainties are conceivable. Furthermore. the nowcast accuracy varies strongly within the irradiance map as higher errors may occur at transient zones close to cloud shadow edges.

The measurement uncertainty caused by the calibration is the most relevant contribution to the overall uncertainty of radiometers. During the outdoor calibration of radiometers the meteorological conditions have to be observed carefully and data points collected under unfavorable conditions must be rejected. The rejection criteria concern the level of the involved irradiances. wind speed and –direction. and also the cloud conditions. The latter are quantified in terms of the minimum angular distance of clouds from the sun and are usually determined visually by an observer. A purely manual visual determination of the cloud’s angular distance from the sun is time consuming and often inaccurate. We developed an algorithm for whole sky imagers (WSIs) that allows the determination of the minimum angular distance of clouds from the sun and the automatic filtering of the calibration data. The high importance of the cloud filtering for pyranometer calibration is shown with an exemplary calibration result for nine pyranometers.

An option for such measurement campaigns is the use of thoroughly calibrated rotating shadowband irradiometers (RSIs). Calibration of RSIs and Si-sensors is complex because of the inhomogeneous spectral response of these sensors and incorporates the use of several correction functions. One calibration for a given atmospheric condition and air mass might not be suitable under different conditions. This paper covers procedures and requirements of two calibration methods for the calibration of rotating shadowband irradiometers. The necessary duration of acquisition of test measurements is examined with regard to the site-specific conditions at Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) in Spain. Seven data sets of long-term test measurements were collected. For each data set. calibration results of varying durations were compared to its respective long-term result. Our findings show that seasonal changes of environmental conditions are causing small but noticeable fluctuation of calibration results. Calibration results within certain periods (ie November to January and April to May) show a higher likelihood of deviation. These effects can partially be attenuated by including more measurements from outside these periods. Consequently. the duration of calibrations at PSA can now be selected depending on the time of year in which measurements commence.,True,ld2NhF4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,5,https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/9/1601/2016/,3788236580043057387,/scholar?cites=3788236580043057387,,https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/9/1601/2016/amt-9-1601-2016.pdf,0,0,0

Configurations consisting of two all-sky imagers can be used to derive cloud heights for weather stations. aviation and nowcasting of solar irradiance. One key question for such systems is the optimal distance between the all-sky imagers. This problem has not been studied conclusively in the literature. To the best of our knowledge. no previous in-field study of the optimal camera distance was performed. Also. comprehensive modeling is lacking.Here. we address this question with an in-field study on 93 days using 7 camera distances between 494 m and 2562 m and one specific cloud height estimation approach.

An option for such measurement campaigns are Rotating Shadowband Irradiometers (RSIs) with a thorough calibration. Calibration of RSIs and Si-sensors in general is complex because of the inhomogeneous spectral response of such sensors and incorporates the use of several correction functions. A calibration for a given atmospheric condition and air mass might not work well for a different condition. This paper covers procedures and requirements for two calibration methods for the calibration of Rotating Shadowband Irradiometers. The necessary duration of acquisition of test measurements is examined in regard to the site specific conditions at Plataforma Solar de Almeria (PSA) in Spain. Data sets of several long-term calibration periods from PSA are used to evaluate the deviation of results from calibrations with varying duration from the long-term result. The findings show that seasonal changes of environmental conditions are causing small but noticeable fluctuation of calibration results. Certain periods (i.e. November to January and April to May) show a higher likelihood of particularly adverse calibration results. These effects can partially be compensated by increasing the inclusions of measurements from outside these periods.,True,ld2NhF4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://elib.dlr.de/98526/,17667810853804800899,/scholar?cites=17667810853804800899,,https://elib.dlr.de/98526/1/amtd-8-10249-2015.pdf,0,0,0

Intra-hour and intra-minute variabilities of the DNI. mainly caused by passing clouds. pose an operational challenge for parabolic trough power plants. Under perfect circumstances a solar field controller would adjusts the mass flow in such a way. that the design temperature is always maintained constant with a maximized focus rate. However. heterogeneous irradiance conditions or flow distribution may cause some solar field sections to temporarily overheat while others may not reach the set point temperature. which in turn leads to an economic loss.

Forecasting future changes in the irradiance might help to cost-efficiently manage this variability both for photovoltaic and concentration solar plants as well as grids with high solar penetrations. So far. for shortest-term forecasts with lead times of a few minutes. all-sky imager based nowcasting systems are used. However. due to the complexity of dynamically changing 3d cloud shapes as well as certain geometrical effects such as self-occlusion or near-horizon saturation. all-sky imager based nowcasting systems exhibit inherent weaknesses. Here. we present a novel system to generate shortest-term solar forecasts. which is located at Plataforma Solar de Almería in southern Spain. This approach is based on downward-facing cameras (shadow cameras). taking images of the ground. From these images. spatially resolved irradiance maps are derived. By tracking cloud shadows. future irradiances are predicted. A demonstration system is achieved. which provides shortest-term forecasts for the next 2min. To the best of our knowledge. this is the first time such a system is developed. We benchmark several possible algorithmic approaches on 16 days and compare the deviations to a state-of-the-art all-sky imager based nowcasting system on 22 days. The root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of this shadow camera based nowcasting system for direct normal irradiance (DNI) and 1-min temporal averages is 15.6% for lead times of 2min (MAD. DNI: 9.6 %).

Such automatized optimizations require a deep understanding of the accuracy in the nowcasting system at any given moment. State of the art validation procedures of ASI based nowcasting systems use scalar error metrics without regards to the actual weather conditions.

Golden. CO (United States),As the world looks for low-carbon sources of energy. solar power stands out as the single most abundant energy resource on Earth. Harnessing this energy is the challenge for this century. Photovoltaics. solar heating and cooling. and concentrating solar power (CSP) are primary forms of energy applications using sunlight.

Reliable information about the solar resource is required for every solar energy application. This holds true for small installations on a rooftop as well as for large solar power plants; however. solar resource information is of particular interest for large installations. because they require substantial investment. sometimes exceeding 1 billion dollars in construction costs.

It is currently applied in an operational way with dyadic wavelet transforms that limit the merging of images whose ratio of their resolution is a power of 2. Nevertheless. provided some conditions rational discrete wavelet transforms can be approximated numerically by rational filter banks which would enable a more general merging.

It is composed of two models based on abaci. also called look-up tables: the already-published McClear model calculating the irradiance under cloud-free conditions and the new McCloud model calculating the extinction of irradiance due to clouds. Both have been realized by using the libRadtran radiative transfer model. The main inputs to Heliosat-4 are aerosol properties. total column water vapour and ozone content as provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) every 3 h. Cloud properties are derived from images of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites in their 15 min temporal resolution using an adapted APOLLO (AVHRR Processing scheme Over cLouds. Land and Ocean) scheme. The 15 min means of irradiance estimated by Heliosat-4 are compared to corresponding measurements made at 13 stations within the Baseline Surface Radiation Network and being located in the field of view of MSG and in various climates. The bias for global irradiance is comprised between 2 and 32 W m −2. The root mean square error (RMSE) ranges between 74 and 94 W m −2.

The uncertainty estimates include sources that reflect realistic long‐term operation conditions. The uncertainties are derived using the methodology specified by the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement.” The differences between redundant determinations of direct. diffuse. and global irradiance are analyzed and are shown to be compatible with the uncertainties. In addition. the signatures of some uncertainty sources are sought within the error statistics to find out if corrections can be applied and what their magnitude is.

GSA allows establishing a ranking among the input parameters. according to their influence on the variability of the output. Such feature is of high interest in particular when aiming at defining parameterized LCA models.When performing a GSA. the description of the variability of each input parameter may affect the results. This aspect is critical when studying new products or emerging technologies. where data regarding the model inputs are very uncertain and may cause misleading GSA outcomes. such as inappropriate input rankings.

Changes in clear-atmosphere properties have negligible effect on the latter so that both terms can be calculated independently. The error made in using this approximation depends mostly on the solar zenith angle. the ground albedo and the cloud optical depth. In most cases. the maximum errors (95th percentile) on global and direct surface irradiances are less than 15 W m−2 and less than 2–5% in relative value. These values are similar to those recommended by the World Meteorological Organization for high-quality measurements of the solar irradiance. Practically. the results mean that a model for fast calculation of surface solar irradiance may be separated into two distinct and independent models. possibly abacus-based. whose input parameters and resolutions can be different. and whose creation requires less computation time and resources than a single model.,True,l0tNZQcAAAAJ:hKjooKYXoHIC,41,https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/1661/2014/,12765873046853002127,/scholar?cites=12765873046853002127,,https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/1661/2014/gmd-7-1661-2014.pdf,0,0,0

To handle the increasing penetration rate of solar energy. grid managers require accurate forecasts of incident solar irradiance. This work discusses standard and new procedures to assess the quality of solar forecasting models and highlights the limitations of some widely used metrics in concrete situations. The paper recommends practices for characterizing the quality of a forecast. i.e. a quality control to reject any suspicious data; classifications to relate each performance criterion to the nature of the solar irradiance variability; and a wide selection of established and new metrics.

Measuring slope deviations in the parabolic shape of the mirror panels in the accuracy and resolution required for these applications is a challenge as it is not required with the same characteristics in other industries. Photogrammetry and deflectometry are the two optical measurement methods that are typically used to measure this shape accuracy of mirror panels used in CSP applications.

Their optical properties and tracking accuracy have great influence on the power plant efficiency and need to be monitored both at plant start up and during operation. Up to now. there are few efficient and fast measurement techniques to access the heliostat properties. Flux density measurements and close-range photogrammetry are possible approaches. yet they do not fulfill the requirement to be accurate. inexpensive and fast at the same time. In this paper. we present a non-contact measurement principle. which uses edge detection to extract the heliostat and facet vertices. This information is used to calculate the surface normals. Furthermore. the corners can replace retroreflective targets generally used in close-range photogrammetry. thus enabling a fast and completely automatic evaluation of the three-dimensional heliostat structure. The pictures are provided by a digital camera which is mounted on a pan tilt head on top of the central receiver tower. offering visibility to all heliostats and allowing the automated qualification of whole heliostat fields in a short period of time. It is shown that measurement uncertainties in heliostat orientation for the investigated heliostat are below 4 mrad in 80% of the relevant heliostat positions. Heliostat orientation is available within three minutes. Photogrammetric measurements based on edge detection at a 40-m2 CESA-1 heliostat at the Plataforma Solar de Almerìa (PSA) exhibit an accuracy of 1.6 mrad for a single-facet normal vector with the results being available within 30 minutes.

The measurement uncertainty caused by the calibration is the most relevant contribution to the overall uncertainty of radiometers. During the outdoor calibration of radiometers the meteorological conditions have to be observed carefully and data points collected under unfavorable conditions must be rejected. The rejection criteria concern the level of the involved irradiances. wind speed and –direction. and also the cloud conditions. The latter are quantified in terms of the minimum angular distance of clouds from the sun and are usually determined visually by an observer. A purely manual visual determination of the cloud’s angular distance from the sun is time consuming and often inaccurate. We developed an algorithm for whole sky imagers (WSIs) that allows the determination of the minimum angular distance of clouds from the sun and the automatic filtering of the calibration data. The high importance of the cloud filtering for pyranometer calibration is shown with an exemplary calibration result for nine pyranometers.

1235648,QFoto: Automatic inline measurement system for parabolic trough structures: Experiences and development,2011,Klaus Pottler and Markus Mützel and Jan Engelke and Christoph Prahl and Marc Röger,,Proceedings SolarPACES 2011,,,,Digital close range photogrammetry has proven to be a precise and efficient measurement technique for the assessment of shape accuracies of solar concentrators and their components. The flexibility of photogrammetry to provide high accuracy 3d-coordinate measurements over almost any scale resulted in the development of the QFoto system for inline quality control of support structures in parabolic trough collector assembly lines before the mirror panels are attached. The paper gives an overview of the capabilities of the QFoto system. its layout and measurement adapters and a description of the employed in-situ camera calibration. Special attention is given to the internal quality control of the system and features like the statistical process control. and the evaluation of the angles of all mirror brackets within one single measurement using specific measurement adapters.,True,S1gHYFIAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,https://elib.dlr.de/72963/,17181662218840629168,/scholar?cites=17181662218840629168,,https://elib.dlr.de/72963/1/ID40223_QFOTO_Automatic_Inline_Measurement_System_final.pdf,0,0,0
1235649,A new concept for line-concentrating CSP collectors,2009,Christoph Prahl and Andreas Pfahl,,,,,,Line-concentrating systems like the Parabolic Trough or the Linear Fresnel Collector are now ready for deployment and there are several solar thermal power plants planned. under construction or connected to the grid using these types of concentrators. Yet. both concepts comprise some disadvantages and there is little chance for cost-reduction and performance-enhancement when the concentrators shape is not altered.  In this paper. a different approach is presented. characterized by the collector’s focal line interfering with the center of mass. This is achieved by the segmentation of the mirror surface. which enables the implementation of a Fixed Focus Parabolic Trough. The structure is integrated into the reflective area by what the wind loads are considerably reduced. Expensive and frail key-components like flexible tube connectors can be omitted. The length of the reflected light rays is considerably shorter compared to other collectors with the same aperture. thus promising an excellent optical efficiency.,True,S1gHYFIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,7,https://elib.dlr.de/61638/,11466485175315755902,/scholar?cites=11466485175315755902,,,0,0,0

1235651,Flux density measurement on large-scale receivers,2011,Marc Röger and Patrik Herrmann and Miriam Ebert and Christoph Prahl and Steffen Ulmer and Felix Göhring,,Proc. of SolarPACES 2011,,,,Commercial solar tower plants have much larger aperture surfaces than the receiver prototypes tested in earlier R&D projects. Existing methods to measure the solar flux density in the receiver aperture face new challenges regarding the receiver size. Also. the requirements regarding costs. accuracy. spatial resolution. and measuring speed are different. Flux density measurement delivers the spatial distribution of the concentrated solar radiation on a receiver aperture. measures receiver input power. and monitors and might control heliostat aimpoints. This paper resumes existent concepts. presents new ones and evaluates them against a catalogue of requirements. Direct and indirect moving bar techniques offer high measurement accuracy. but also have the disadvantage of large moving parts on a solar tower. In the case of external receivers. measuring directly on receiver surfaces avoids moving parts and allows continuous measurement. but is not as precise. This promising technique requires. due to specific reflectance properties of current receiver materials. proper scientific evaluation. Measurement-supported simulation techniques can also be applied to cavity receivers without installing moving parts. They have reasonable uncertainties under ideal conditions and require comparatively low effort.,True,S1gHYFIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,5,https://elib.dlr.de/72959,5947625984642154846,/scholar?cites=5947625984642154846,,https://elib.dlr.de/72959/1/SolarPACES2011_FluxDensity_R%C3%B6ger_final.pdf,0,0,0

The major source of vitamin D in humans is ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced dermal synthesis of cholecalciferol. whereas food sources are believed to play a lesser role. Our objectives were to assess UVB availability (Jm− 2) across several European locations ranging from 35 N to 69 N. and compare these UVB data with representative population serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) data from Ireland (51–54 N). Iceland (64 N) and Norway (69 N). as exemplars. Vitamin D-effective UVB availability was modelled for nine European countries/regions using a validated UV irradiance model. Standardized serum 25 (OH) D data was accessed from the EC-funded ODIN project. The results showed that UVB availability decreased with increasing latitude (from 35 N to 69 N). while all locations exhibited significant seasonal variation in UVB. The UVB data suggested that the duration of vitamin D winters ranged from none (at 35 N) to eight months (at 69 N). The large seasonal fluctuations in serum 25 (OH) D in Irish adults was much dampened in Norwegian and Icelandic adults. despite considerably lower UVB availability at these northern latitudes but with much higher vitamin D intakes. In conclusion. increasing the vitamin D intake can ameliorate the impact of low UVB availability on serum 25 (OH) D status in Europe.

Our calculations show the influence of ozone depletion and recovery on erythemal irradiance. In addition. we investigate UV-Ery changes caused by climate change due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. The latter include effects of both stratospheric ozone and cloud changes. The derived estimates provide a global picture of the likely changes in erythemal irradiance during the 21st century. Uncertainties arise from the assumed scenarios. different parameterizations – particularly of cloud effects on UV-Ery – and the spread in the CCM projections. The calculations suggest that relative to 1980. annually mean UV-Ery in the 2090s will be on average ~12 % lower at high latitudes in both hemispheres. ~3 % lower at mid latitudes. and marginally higher (~1 %) in the tropics. The largest reduction (~16 %) is projected for Antarctica in October. Cloud effects are responsible for 2–3 % of the reduction in UV-Ery at high latitudes. but they slightly moderate it at mid-latitudes (~1 %). The year of return of erythemal irradiance to values of certain milestones (1965 and 1980) depends largely on the return of column ozone to the corresponding levels and is associated with large uncertainties mainly due to the spread of the model projections.

We examined the relative effects of iron addition (+1 nM) and increased temperature (+4°C) on plankton assemblages of the Ross Sea. Antarctica. a region characterized by annual algal blooms and an active microbial community. Increased iron and temperature individually had consistently significant but relatively minor positive effects on total phytoplankton abundance. phytoplankton and microzooplankton community composition. as well as photosynthetic parameters and nutrient drawdown. Unexpectedly. increased iron had a consistently negative impact on microzooplankton abundance. most likely a secondary response to changes in phytoplankton community composition. When iron and temperature were increased in concert. the resulting interactive effects were greatly magnified. This synergy between iron and temperature increases would not have been predictable by examining the effects of each variable individually. Our results suggest the possibility that if iron availability increases under future climate regimes. the impacts of predicted temperature increases on plankton assemblages in polar regions could be significantly enhanced.

The spectral effect of the limb darkening to the global. direct irradiance and actinic flux measurements was investigated. This effect leads to wavelength dependent changes in the measured solar spectra showing a much more pronounced decrease in the radiation at the lower wavelengths. Radiative transfer model results were used for the computation of a correction for the total ozone measurements due to the limb darkening. This correction was found too small to explain the large decrease in total ozone column derived from the standard Brewer measurements. which is an artifact in the measured irradiance due to the increasing contribution of diffuse radiation against the decreasing direct irradiance caused by the eclipse. Calculations of the Extraterrestrial spectrum and the effective sun's temperatures. as measured from ground based direct irradiance measurements. showed an artificial change in the calculations of both quantities due to the fact that radiation coming from the visible part of the sun during the eclipse phases differs from the black body radiation described by the Planck's law.,True,BmzBAloAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,53,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/7/5775/2007/,1138563300905990141,/scholar?cites=1138563300905990141,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/7/5775/2007/acp-7-5775-2007.pdf,0,0,0

The aim of this study is to validate the TOMS UV irradiances and to investigate the origin of disagreements with ground‐based data. Comparisons showed that TOMS overestimates summertime noon CIE‐weighted irradiances from 6.6% at the high‐latitude site of Sodankyla up to 19% for the three other sites. The influence of clouds and aerosols on the observed differences was investigated. For the other three sites (Bilthoven. Ispra. and Thessaloniki).

Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite. a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of measuring sites for the newly built Hellenic Network of Solar Energy (www.helionet.gr). The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 22 ground-based instruments.

The constitutive pigment in skin determines skin type. observed as white. brown. or black skin. The melanin pigment absorbs ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and protects underlying skin from damage caused by UVR. It also reduces the UVR available for vitamin D synthesis in the skin. It has been shown that the white-skinned population of the UK are able to meet their vitamin D needs with short. daily lunchtime exposures to sunlight. We have followed the same methodology. based on a 10-year UK all-weather UVR climatology. observation (sun exposure. diet. vitamin D status). and UVR intervention studies with Fitzpatrick skin type V (brown) adults. to determine whether sunlight at UK latitudes could provide an adequate source of vitamin D for this section of the population. Results show that to meet vitamin D requirements. skin type V individuals in the UK need~ 25 min daily sunlight at lunchtime. from March to September. This makes several assumptions. including that forearms and lower legs are exposed June–August; only exposing hands and face at this time is inadequate. For practical and cultural reasons. enhanced oral intake of vitamin D should be considered for this population.

Greece. The calibration history of the two instruments was re-examined and data flaws were identified by comparing quasi synchronous measurements. Analysis of the sensitivity of both instruments to variations of their internal temperature revealed that they have temperature coefficients of different sign. These coefficients exhibit small variability during the 15-year period. Using averaged temperature coefficients. we corrected both datasets. Corrections were applied for the angular response error using two different approaches depending on the availability of required ancillary data. The uncertainties associated with the measurements have been estimated and presented.

The minutely cloud radiative effect (CRE) is examined in relevance to the cloud cover and type as well as the percentage of the solar disk covered by clouds and the relative position of Sun and clouds in the sky. CRE increases with the cloud cover and decreases with the solar zenith angle (SZA). The minimum instantaneous values can reach −900 W m−2 while enhancement events are found to reach up to +200 W m−2.

Here we present aerosol optical depth measurements from six specific locations and surface irradiance measurements from a large number of radiation sites in Northern Germany and Switzerland. The measurements show a decline in aerosol concentration of up to 60%. which have led to a statistically significant increase of solar irradiance under cloud‐free skies since the 1980s. The measurements confirm solar brightening and show that the direct aerosol effect had an approximately five times larger impact on climate forcing than the indirect aerosol and other cloud effects. The overall aerosol and cloud induced surface climate forcing is ∼+1 W m−2 dec−1 and has most probably strongly contributed to the recent rapid warming in Europe.,True,gRMFNbsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,179,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008gl034228,5371195971373409821,/scholar?cites=5371195971373409821,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL034228,0,0,0

With the increasing debate on anthropogenic influences on climatic processes during the 1980s the need for accurate radiometric measurements with higher temporal resolution was identified. and it was determined that the existing measurement networks did not have the resolution or accuracy required to meet this need. In 1988 the WMO therefore proposed the establishment of a new international Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). which should collect and centrally archive high-quality ground-based radiation measurements in 1 min resolution. BSRN began its work in 1992 with 9 stations; currently (status 2018-01-01). the network comprises 59 stations (delivering data to the archive) and 9 candidates (stations recently accepted into the network with data forthcoming to the archive) distributed over all continents and oceanic environments. The BSRN database is the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC). It is hosted at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven. Germany. and now offers more than 10 300 months of data from the years 1992 to 2017.

Therefore. a proper assessment of available solar resource is particularly important to determine the placement and operation of solar thermal power plants. To perform this analysis correctly. it is necessary to determine the main factors influencing the radiation reaching the earth’s surface. such as the earth’s geometry. terrain. and atmospheric attenuation by gases. particles and clouds. Among these factors. it is important to emphasise the role of clouds as the main attenuating factor of radiation.

In our setting. electricity is generated from PV and is used to supply the demand from loads. Excess electricity generated from the PV can be either sold back to the grid or stored in a battery. and electricity must be purchased from the electric grid if the PV generation and battery discharging cannot meet the demand. Due to the time-of-use electricity pricing and net metered PV systems. electricity can also be purchased from the grid when the price is low. and be sold back to the grid when the price is high. The objective is to minimize the cost associated with net power purchase from the electric grid and the battery capacity loss while at the same time satisfying the load and reducing the peak electricity purchase from the grid.

A new classification algorithm was developed that compares the pixel red-blue ratio (RBR) to the RBR of a clear sky library (CSL) generated from images captured on clear days. The difference. rather than the ratio. between pixel RBR and CSL RBR resulted in more accurate cloud classification. High correlation between TSI image RBR and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measured by an AERONET photometer was observed and motivated the addition of a haze correction factor (HCF) to the classification model to account for variations in AOD. Thresholds for clear and thick clouds were chosen based on a training image set and validated with set of manually annotated images.

Central to the WVM method is a correlation scaling coefficient (A) that calibrates the decay of correlation of wavelet modes as a function of distance and timescale. and which varies by day and geographic location. Previously. a local irradiance sensor network was required to derive A. In this work. we determine A from cloud speeds. Cloud simulator results indicated that the A value is linearly proportional to the cloud speed (CS): A= 1 2 CS.

The formation of pores. pits. rough surface and ceramics particles agglomerations in AMCs microstructures are manifestations of severe corrosion of the composites in different environments. The microstructural characteristics of corroded composite samples are aggravated by the harshness of the corrosion environments and increase in the percentage weight fractions of most ceramic reinforcement particles. The type of ceramic reinforcement particles used in AMCs has been well reported in the literature to have immense influence on its microstructural characteristics.

However. it is imperative that DGs are sited such that the quality of power delivered is optimized and the total real power loss within the system minimized. This paper proposes an approach for optimum sizing and siting of DGs sizing in a power distribution system using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. To validate the algorithm the IEEE 30 bus standard test system was employed. A 92% decrease in real power loss within the system relative to the value before the connection of DGs was observed. while the minimum bus voltage increased from 0.656 per unit to 0.965 per unit. The results obtained from ACO are further verified by creating an ETAP model of the IEEE 30 bus system and simulating the impact of DG on the …,True,sawlu1cAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-021-04226-y,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-021-04226-y,0,0,0

Recent studies have shown that the use of some specialised alloying elements can be explored for enhancing properties of monolithic alloys. This study focuses on the production and characterisation of Al-Mg-Cr alloy suitable for machine tool applications. Al-Mg-Cr alloy was developed using sand mould and two-step stir-casting method. Chromium was added to Al-Mg alloy at varying contents of 0.5. 1.0. 1.5 and 2.0%. Tensile tests were carried out in accordance with ASTM E8 to determine ultimate tensile strength (UTS). percentage elongation and modulus of elasticity at varying chromium contents. The evolved microstructures were examined using an optical microscope (OPM). The study revealed that the alloy containing 1.5% chromium exhibited maximum ultimate tensile strength of 135.15 MPa and percentage elongation of 3.76%. However. Al-Mg-Cr alloy containing 1.0% chromium exhibited best combination of UTS (123.98 MPa). percentage elongation (3.32%). modulus of elasticity (12.11 GPa) and microstructural features. Five samples of Al-Mg-1.0 Cr alloy were thereafter heat treated at different temperatures from 250 C to 450 C. The heat treated samples were also subjected to tensile tests and optical microscopy. The results were compared with the as-cast Al-Mg-1.0 Cr alloy. The results showed that heat treatment of Al-Mg-Cr alloy had adverse effect on their mechanical and microstructural properties.

For the numerical analysis. three working fluids (engine oil. water and air) were successively utilised on the shell-side of heat exchangers with 30. 35. 40 and 45% convex-cut (CeC_STHE) and 25% segmental (SS_STHE) baffles. and the resulting models were solved in COMSOL Multiphysics. Experiments were carried out on 30% CeC_STHE and SS_STHE exclusively running on water. The data obtained were used to determine the weighted shell-side heat transfer coefficient and weighted performance factor of each heat exchanger. Hence. the results for all the ranges of Reynolds number indicate that the shell-side heat transfer coefficients of all the CeC_STHEs are lower than that of SS_STHE except for the 30% CeC_STHE. However. the SS_STHE showed greater pressure drop than the CeC_STHEs. The choice of working fluid had more influenced on the weighted shell-side heat transfer coefficient CeC_STHE. Moreover. the weighted performance factors of the CeC_STHEs indicated positive values.

Three plate surfaces were prepared (smooth. evenly distributed spherical dimples and unevenly distributed spherical dimples) and were placed successively in a channel. The unevenly distributed dimpled plate had the same dimple density with the evenly distributed dimpled plate but had varying transverse pitches to concentrate the dimples at mid-plate in flow direction. Data obtained from the experiment were analysed to determine the performance of each dimpled plate channel. It was observed that the average Nusselt number due to the heat interaction with the air-flow increases with the Reynolds number.

The  modeled heat exchanger had 37 tubes. shell internal diameter of 200 mm. 6 baffles with baffle spacing of 100 mm. The results from the effect of mass flow rate and baffle cut on heat transfer rate and pressure drop in the shell side of the heat exchanger were compared with the circular segmental baffle cut of 25% and that of the parabolic baffle cut of 25 and  30%  of  the  inner  shell  diameter.

Applying the velocity profile obtained for the plane Coutte-Poiseuille laminar flow. the energy equation with the viscous dissipation term was exactly solved for the boundary conditions of constant wall heat flux at one wall with the other insulated. Special attention is given to the shear produced by the movable top plate over and above the viscous dissipation due to internal fluid friction. The reason behind the behaviour exhibits by the temperature profile obtained at different velocities can be attributed to the effect of viscous dissipation coming into play due to the shear stress within the fluid layer induced by the movement of the upper plate.,True,sawlu1cAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=15842665&AN=131841559&h=JN6tMrDrX0RI%2B3sstz7ufLiiY5tElLkEvqWBe5LDGlTyAChxoJ70smU2izYc3rIiMlra3b7bunENLOUeushOsw%3D%3D&crl=c,,,,,0,0,0

It gives no information about the effect of irreversibilities on performance that occurs inherently during any thermodynamic process. On the other hand. exergy analysis. based on the second law of thermodynamics recognizes magnitudes and locations of the losses due to these irreversibilities. Therefore. the application of exergy analysis for thermodynamic evaluation of conventional power plants is steadily growing. This paper deals with the exergy analysis performed on a 144 MW combined cycle power plant situated at Kotri. Pakistan. The exergy destruction models are used to assess the losses occurred in the key components of the power plant. The results indicate that the total exergy destruction of the power plant is around 288.5 MW; combustion chambers contribute a major share of 168 MW (58.2%) followed by heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) with 43 MW (14.8%).

The controller uses remote signals. selected suitably from the whole system. as supplementary inputs. The wide area or global signals have been obtained where the oscillations in the remote network locations could be well observed. The PSS controller uses only those local and remote input signals in which the assigned single inter-area mode is most observable and is located at a generator which is most effective in controlling that mode. A long timedelay due to remote signal transmission and processing in WAMS (Wide Area Measurement System) can cause system instability and degradation of system robustness.

This situation is mainly due to a lack of sustainable energy planning and policy formulation. In this context. energy models can be of great help but only a handful of such efforts have been undertaken in Pakistan. Two key shortcomings pertaining to energy models lead to their low utilization in developing countries. First. the models do not effectively make decisions. but rather provide a set of alternatives based on modeling parameters; and secondly. the complexity of these models is often poorly understood by the decision makers. As such. in this study. the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) has been used for the sustainability assessment of energy modeling results for long-term electricity planning. The four scenario alternatives developed in the energy modeling effort. Reference (REF). Renewable Energy Technologies (RET). Clean Coal Maximum (CCM) and Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC). have been ranked using the Expert Choice® tool based on the AHP methodology. The AHP decision support framework of this study revealed the EEC scenario as the most favorable electricity generation scenario followed by the REF. RET and CCM scenarios.

The existing electricity generation also largely depends on the imported fossil fuels. which is a huge burden on the national economy alongside causing colossal loss to the environment. It is also evident from existing government plans that electricity generation from low-cost coal fuels in the near future will further increase the emissions. As such. in this study. following the government’s electricity demand forecast. four supply side scenarios for the study period (2013–2035) have been developed using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) software tool.

The country is believed to have abundant energy resources. however. coping substantial electricity supply gap of over 5000 MW. This paper analyses country’s energy and power planning studies conducted since its independence in 1947 and policies announced so far. It is found that water resources management attained more emphasis in early decades of post-independence rather than energy concerns. The first energy and power planning study was conducted in late 1960s and since then various studies were undertaken to supplement five yearly medium term development plans of government. However. it is pertinent to mention that formal energy and power policies were only announced from 1994 onwards owing to growing electricity demand and progressing industrialization.

This situation is mainly due to a lack of sustainable energy planning and policy formulation. In this context. energy models can be of great help but only a handful of such efforts have been undertaken in Pakistan. Two key shortcomings pertaining to energy models lead to their low utilization in developing countries. First. the models do not effectively make decisions. but rather provide a set of alternatives based on modeling parameters; and secondly. the complexity of these models is often poorly understood by the decision makers. As such. in this study. the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) has been used for the sustainability assessment of energy modeling results for long-term electricity planning. The four scenario alternatives developed in the energy modeling effort. Reference (REF). Renewable Energy Technologies (RET). Clean Coal Maximum (CCM) and Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC). have been ranked using the Expert Choice® tool based on the AHP methodology. The AHP decision support framework of this study revealed the EEC scenario as the most favorable electricity generation scenario followed by the REF. RET and CCM scenarios. Besides that. this study proposes policy recommendations to undertake integrated energy modeling and decision analysis for sustainable energy planning in Pakistan.

The increased number of building in cities accounts for an ever increasing demand for energy. Buildings all over the world. consume around 40% of the energy generated by all the available resources. When it comes to meeting the cooling and heating needs of the dwellings in large skyscrapers. buildings in particular are notorious for devouring the lion’s share of the electricity supplied by the grid. Efforts in this regard are being made to reduce the net energy consumption by buildings and this area of study concerning management of energy in buildings has been one of the most attractive topics for researchers all around the world. specially the 1st world countries. where the number of tall structures is relatively higher than those in rest of the other countries. The intricate and costly piping configurations of HVAC system. industrial and chemical process plant are the main source of transporting heat energy.

1235895,Aerodynamic Performance Analysis of Rough Rectangular Aircraft Wing for Subsonic Flow,2017,I Ali and S Samo and D Kumar and M Abro and T Hussain,49,Sindh University Research Journal-SURJ (Science Series),2,,,Present research aims to analyze the effect of surface roughness on the aerodynamic performance of aircraft wing. Sand grain roughness was introduced over the wing surface through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool. Surface roughness effect was reported at two different plane velocity one of them lies in the range of incompressible flow while other is in the range of compressible flow regime. Turbulences were modeled through k ε-realizable and k ω-SST model for incompressible and compressible flows respectively. CFD simulation results estimated that drag increases and lift decreases with increase in roughness height for incompressible flow. In case of compressible flow. analysis results showed that increase in roughness height causes significant increment in drag along with some increase in lift force. On the basis of obtained results it is concluded that wing performance is highly sensitive to roughness along with that it is also analyzed that increase in roughness height causes decrease in lift to drag ratio.,True,BtVH844AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://sujo-old.usindh.edu.pk/index.php/SURJ/article/download/3332/2414,4189554022521852680,/scholar?cites=4189554022521852680,,https://sujo-old.usindh.edu.pk/index.php/SURJ/article/download/3332/2414,0,0,0

A heating-degree method was used to calculate the heat losses through the building wall. In analysis rock wool was used as insulation material. electricity as energy source and fifteen wall construction materials. An appropriate mathematical model was used and simulated in Engineering Equation Solver to calculate cost savings and payback period of an initial investment. The results reveals that the light concrete materials saves negligible life cycle cost of just under 2$/m2-year with minimum payback period of 6-47 years. while the heavy concrete materials. laterite bricks and concrete block are found most cost effective in terms of respective savings ie 12-16$/m2-year with minimum payback period of 3 years. As a result. it is concluded that the wall made of light concrete materials and fire bricks should be uninsulated because the payback of insulation cost is too long. whilst. the wall construed from heavy concrete block. laterite bricks and concrete block must be insulated with minimum optimum insulation thickness of 54 to 98 mm as it has the lowest rate of return.,True,BtVH844AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dileep_Kumar106/publication/333564899_Impact_of_Construction_Material_on_Building_Wall's_Thermal_Optimization/links/5cf4aa7b92851c4dd02412d7/Impact-of-Construction-Material-on-Building-Walls-Thermal-Optimization.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dileep_Kumar106/publication/333564899_Impact_of_Construction_Material_on_Building_Wall's_Thermal_Optimization/links/5cf4aa7b92851c4dd02412d7/Impact-of-Construction-Material-on-Building-Walls-Thermal-Optimization.pdf,0,0,0

Pakistan,2018,Syed Ahsan Ali Shah and Gordhan Das Valasai and Asif Ali Memon and Abdul Nasir Laghari and Nabi Bux Jalbani and Jody L Strait,11,Energies,7,1777,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Rural electrification is a fundamental step towards achieving universal access to electricity by 2030. On-grid rural electrification remains a costly proposition. therefore the need to consider off-grid renewable energy solutions is inevitable. However. the critical issue pertaining to local power generation through renewable energy is the absence of area-specific production capacity and economic viability data for the different renewable energy technologies. This paper addresses this issue for Pakistan’s Balochistan province by assessing the area’s potential and economic feasibility of using solar PV for rural electrification. The results suggest that the Balochistan province has the best solar irradiance value in the world. Furthermore. optimal tilt angles calculated for respective regions can significantly increase solar energy yield. The economic feasibility study. carried out for solar PV systems. reveals that the electricity generated using solar PV costs Rs. 7.98 per kWh and is considerably cheaper than conventional electricity. which costs approximately Rs. 20.79 per kWh. Similarly. solar PV systems could mitigate 126.000 metric tons of CO 2 annually if 100% of the unelectrified households adopted solar PV systems. Based on these research findings. this paper proposes a policy that would serve as a guideline for the government to extend solar PV-based off-grid rural electrification projects in Balochistan as well as on a national scale.

This study. therefore. addresses this problem by evaluating the solar energy potential and economic viability for the remote rural regions of the Sindh province. Pakistan. The results recommended that the rural regions of Sindh have suitable solar irradiance to generate electricity. An appropriate tilt angle has been computed for the selected rural regions. which significantly enhances the generation capacity of solar energy. Moreover. economic viability has been undertaken in this study and it was revealed that the off-grid solar PV power generation system provides electricity at the cost of Pakistani Rupees (PKR) 6.87/kWh and is regarded as much cheaper than conventional energy sources. ie. around PKR 20.79/kWh.

Hydrogen. if produced efficiently. can play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the global energy systems. Therefore. this study develops a framework which evaluates hydrogen production processes and quantifies deficiencies for improvement. The framework integrates slack-based data envelopment analysis (DEA). with fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS). The proposed framework is applied to prioritize the most efficient and sustainable hydrogen production in Pakistan. Eleven hydrogen production alternatives were analyzed under five criteria. including capital cost. feedstock cost. O&M cost. hydrogen production. and CO 2 emission. FAHP obtained the initial weights of criteria while FTOPSIS determined the ultimate weights of criteria for each alternative. Finally. slack-based DEA computed the efficiency of alternatives. Among the 11. three alternatives (wind electrolysis. PV electrolysis. and biomass gasification) were found to be fully efficient and therefore can be considered as sustainable options for hydrogen production in Pakistan. The rest of the eight alternatives achieved poor efficiency scores and thus are not recommended.

This paper deals with the exergy analysis performed on a 144 MW combined cycle power plant situated at Kotri. Pakistan. The exergy destruction models are used to assess the losses occurred in the key components of the power plant. The results indicate that the total exergy destruction of the power plant is around 288.5 MW; combustion chambers contribute a major share of 168 MW (58.2%) followed by heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) with 43 MW (14.8%). The energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the power plant are calculated as 34.41 and 33.40% respectively.

The conductive process within these media is described using a simple parallel-series model. Spectral volumetric absorption and scattering coefficients as well as the spectral phase function are predicted using a combination of geometric optics laws and diffraction theory to model the interaction of radiation with the particles forming the foam. The particles considered are both struts formed at the juncture of three cells and strut junctures. The radiative properties can then be utilized to obtain a weighted extinction coefficient. which can be used in the Rosseland equation to obtain the radiative flux. The innovative part of the work lies in the radiative properties predictive model.

Owing to their very low density. both conductive and radiative heat transfers are significant. However. only few studies have already been conducted in the modeling of heat transfer in this kind of medium. This is due to their complex porous structure characterized by a double-scale porosity which has always been ignored by the previous works. In this study. we present a model of one-dimensional steady state heat transfer in these foams based on a numerical resolution of the radiation-conduction coupling.

However. while the thermal properties of this porous material have been widely studied at ambient temperature and are. at present. well-known. their thermal behaviour at fire temperatures remains relatively unexplored.

The method is restricted to the geometric optic objects and neglects the wave effects. The effective radiative properties such as the absorption and scattering coefficients. and phase function are retrieved from the calculation of mean-free paths of scattering and absorption. and the angular scattering probability of radiation propagating in the dispersed medium.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling is probably the most suitable method to achieve this as it provides detailed information about the airflow pattern but is still time-consuming although processor speed has tremendously increased during the past years. Consequently. parametric studies aimed at characterizing the influence of parameters such as the location of the air inlets and outlets or furniture on the air velocity. temperature and concentration distributions within the building are seldom achieved.

The roof design and its opening system is a key factor of the thermal performance. Skylights and radiative properties of roof coating have a direct impact on solar gains. thermal losses and natural ventilation potential. The overall performance depends on the combination of these design parameters (solar reflectance and opening size). on the weather conditions and on the inertia given by the slab on the ground. The roof design performance depends on the ground which determines the dynamic behavior of these buildings. A generic case study is modeled and an extensive parametric study (about 840 annual simulations) is performed to point out these key parameters’ impacts on energy demand and comfort.

1236030,Infiltration heat recovery in building walls: computational fluid dynamics investigations results,2002,Marc O Abadie and Elizabeth U Finlayson and Ashok J Gadgil,,,,,,Conventional calculations of heating (and cooling) loads for  buildings assume that conduction heat loss (or gain) through walls is  independent of air infiltration heat loss (or gain). During passage through  the building envelope. infiltrating air substantially exchanges heat wall  insulation leading to partial recovery of heat conducted through the wall. The  Infiltration Heat Recovery (IHR) factor was introduced to quantify the heat  recovery and correct the conventional calculations. In this study.  Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to calculate infiltration heat recovery  under a range of idealized conditions. specifically to understand factors that  influence it. and assess its significance in building heat load calculations.  This study shows for the first time the important effect of the external  boundary layers on conduction and infiltration heat loads. Results show (under  the idealized conditions studied here) that (1) the interior details of the  wall encountered in the leakage path (i.e.. insulated or empty walls) do not  greatly influence the IHR. the overall relative location of the cracks (i.e..  inlet and outlet locations on the wall) has the largest influence on the IHR  magnitude. (2) external boundary layers on the walls substantially contribute  to IHR and (3) the relative error in heat load calculations resulting from the  use of the conventional calculational method (i.e.. ignoring IHR) is between 3  percent and 13 percent for infiltrating flows typically found in residential  buildings.,True,z4bvXlIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,23,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6qd1b6bh,16614150714002626399,/scholar?cites=16614150714002626399,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6qd1b6bh/qt6qd1b6bh.pdf,0,0,0

PID controllers have the advantage of simple structure. good stability. and high reliability. A relevant issue for PID controllers design is the accurate and efficient tuning of parameters. In this context. several approaches have been reported in the literature for tuning the parameters of PID controllers using evolutionary algorithms. mainly for single-input single-output systems. The systematic design of multi-loop (or decentralized) PID control for multivariable processes to meet certain objectives simultaneously is still a challenging task. This paper proposes a new chaotic firefly algorithm approach based on Tinkerbell map (CFA) to tune multi-loop PID multivariable controllers.

The aim of this study was to determine the success rate of miniscrew use for lower molar uprighting and to compare the use of direct and indirect anchorage. One hundred and eighty-one miniscrews were inserted in 102 rehabilitation patients. mean age 42.24 years. In 71 patients. indirect anchorage was used (116 miniscrews); in the other 31 patients. direct anchorage was employed (65 miniscrews). The choice of direct or indirect anchorage was determined by the orthodontist according to the force system that would be used for the movement and the bone availability. The overall success rate for miniscrews was 90.05%; 18 miniscrews failed. including 15 that were used as indirect anchorage and 3 that were used as direct anchorage.

METHODS: Eighty loops used to close spaces were submitted to mechanical tests. The magnitudes of horizontal force. the moment/force ratio. and the load/deflection ratio produced by the specimens were quantified. Loops were submitted to a total activation of 5.0 mm and the values were registered for each 1.0 mm of activation. For statistic data analysis. a analysis of variance was performed and a Tukey's Multiple Comparison test was used as supplement. considering a 5% level of significance. RESULTS: In general. teardrop loops with helix produced lower magnitudes of horizontal force and load/deflection ratio. and higher moment/force ratio than teardrop loops without helix. Among all analyzed variables. metal alloy composition presented greater influence in the horizontal force and in the load/deflection ratio. The moment/force ratio showed to be more influenced by the preactivation of loops for space closure.,True,0QC9YCgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,11,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S2176-94512013000200007&script=sci_arttext,6909807829174424670,/scholar?cites=6909807829174424670,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S2176-94512013000200007&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Methods: A total of 40 T-loop springs (TLS) hand-bent from 0.017 x 0.025-in β-Ti were randomly divided into four groups according to wire brand: TMATM (G1). BETA FLEXYTM (G2). BETA III WIRETM (G3) and BETA CNATM (G4). Forces and moments were recorded by a moment transducer. coupled to a digital extensometer indicator adapted to a testing machine. every 0.5 mm of deactivation from 5 mm of the initial activation. The moment-to-force (MF) ratio. the overlapping of the vertical extensions of the TLSs and the load-deflection (LD) ratio were also calculated. To complement the results. the Young’s module (YM) of each wire was determined by the slope of the load-deflection graph of a tensile test. The surface chemical composition was also evaluated by an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Results: All groups. except for G2. produced similar force levels initially. G3 produced the highest LD rates and G1 and G4 had similar amounts of overlap of the vertical extensions of the TLSs in “neutral position”. G1 and G3 delivered the highest levels of moments. and G2 and G3 produced the highest MF ratios. β-Ti wires from G3 produced the highest YM and all groups showed similar composition. except for G2.

(2) miniscrews implants (MSI)-related factors (length and diameter) and (3) location-related factors [bone (maxilla or mandible) and area (buccal. lingual and alveolar ridge)] that may be associated with MSI loss of stability. A total of 1356 MSI were installed in 570 patients (423 females and 147 males) with mean age of 42.7 during a 10-year period and were clinically evaluated once a month until the end of the proposed movement. Length (5. 7. 9 and 11 mm) and diameter (1.3. 1.4 and 1.6 mm) of the MSI were selected according to insertion site. The evidence of clinical mobility during treatment or fracture during insertion was considered as failure. A total success rate of 89.1% was observed. There was no statistically significant difference in loss of stability when considering age. sex. craniofacial pattern or smoking habit. Considering diameter. there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.645). but the shorter miniscrews (5 mm) showed higher failure rates (p < 0.001) than the longer ones. There were more loses (p < 0.001) in the mandible than in the maxilla. but the area (buccal. lingual or alveolar ridge) did not interfere in the results (p = 0.421). It can be concluded that MSIs are effective for skeletal anchorage in orthodontics. Patient-related factors. such as sex. age. smoking habit and craniofacial pattern. did not affect MSI success.

CE was recorded in a polyurethane resin blank and end wear (VB Bmax) was analyzed under stereo microscopy.Results:After osteotomies in beef ribs. CE for the Ø2. 0-mm drill decreased 10.2% in SG and 10.9% in ZG; for the Ø3. 0-mm drill. CE decreased 30.6% in SG. 8.5% in ZG. and improved in EG. The greatest wear occurred in Ø2. 0-mm drills; ZG drills (Ø3. 0 mm) exhibited only edge frittering. as confirmed on scanning electron microscopy.Conclusion:After 50 exposures to mechanical loads. steel and ceramic drills lost CE. Whereas cutting and thermal performance improved in experimental drills. the Ø2. 0-mm drill exhibited the most signs of wear proportional to use.

Nos últimos anos tem sido utilizada como uma opção aos implantes dentários metálicos. principalmente pelas qualidades estéticas e periointegração. O propósito desta revisão bibliográfica é destacar as características das cerâmicas Y-TZP (zircônia tetragonal policristalina estabilizada com ítria) e ATZ (zircônia tenacificada por alumina). citando algumas limitações do uso como materiais alternativos na Implantodontia. baseadas em evidências científicas. Muitas pesquisas in vitro e in vivo demonstraram que as cerâmicas Y-TZP apresentam vantagens estéticas e biológicas sobre outros biomateriais. Os valores de resistência à fratura são clinicamente aceitáveis. sendo mais elevados nos compósitos ATZ. Alguns testes de carga cíclica com implantes dentários ATZ mostraram resistência igual ou superior aos de titânio (Ti). Novos tratamentos de superfície na cerâmica estão abreviando o tempo de cura. possibilitando carga imediata. Os experimentos com animais confirmaram o bom potencial de osseointegração das cerâmicas. com quantidade de BIC equiparável ao Ti e com menor acúmulo de biofilme. Estudos de até 5 anos com implantes dentários Y-TZP de peça única em humanos apresentaram índices de sucesso de 84. 4 a 100%. enquanto que a taxa de sobrevida em 7 anos com ATZ foi de 99%. Apesar dos bons resultados com implantes dentários Y-TZP e ATZ. os autores sugerem cautela nas indicações e mais estudos prospectivos de longo prazo.,True,IzYVS6MAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,3,http://www.topodontologia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Art.-3-Full-Science-2014.pdf,11829866707011419852,/scholar?cites=11829866707011419852,,http://www.topodontologia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Art.-3-Full-Science-2014.pdf,0,0,0

1236123,Jet energy measurement and its systematic uncertainty in proton–proton collisions at√ s= 7TeV with the ATLAS detector,2015,Melissa Franklin and John Huth and L Jeanty and D Lopez Mateos and Kevin Mercurio and Masahiro Morii and William Spearman and Andy Yen and G Zevi Della Porta,,The European Physical Journal C,,,Springer Nature,The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton–proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s√=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb −1 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 . and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson. for  20≤pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |η|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton–proton interactions is corrected for. and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |η|<1.2 ) for jets with  55≤pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT . the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton–proton collisions and test-beam data. which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |η|=4.5 .

Biological processes using microorganisms have proven useful to remediate PW contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. complex organic chemicals. and solvents. In particular. the bioremediation of PW using algae is an eco-friendly and low-cost approach due to algae’s ability to utilize certain pollutants as nutrient sources. Therefore. the utilization of PW as an algal growth medium has a great potential to eliminate chemicals from the PW and minimize the large volumes of freshwater needed for cultivation. Although several reviews describing the bioremediation of PW have been published. to the best of our knowledge. no review has exclusively focused on the algae-based PW treatment. Therefore. the present review is dedicated to filling this gap by portraying the many different facets of the algae cultivation in PW. Several algal species that are known to thrive in a wide range of salinity and the critical steps for their cultivation in hypersaline PW have been identified. Overall. this comprehensive review highlights the PW bioremediation using algae and brings attention to utilizing PW to grow biomass that can be processed to generate biofuels and useful bioproducts.

The organism is capable of oxidative metabolism using a broad range of organic substrates under both light (mixotrophic) and dark (heterotrophic) conditions. A major benefit of mixotrophic metabolism is the potential for metabolic gas exchanges to reduce or eliminate the need for acquisition and supplementation of CO 2 for photosynthesis. which in turn supplements O 2 needed for oxidative metabolism while potentially reducing the cost and complexity of outdoor photobioreactor systems. We will show that outdoor cultivation on 35 mM glucose/xylose mixtures derived from corn stover yields 5-10 fold higher biomass producitiviy than autotrophy with simultaneous uptake of both sugars. The combination of low pH and elevated temperatures dramatically limits contamination of uni-algal outdoor cultures under xenic conditions. G. sulphuraria also grows directly on undiluted. acidified wastewater from anaerobic digester systems containing NH 4+ concentrations as high as 1.400 PPM (78 mM). leading to effective nutrient and BOD recovery to meet water discharge standards. The strain has also been demonstrated to effectively treat primary. settled municipal wastewater.

J. of Thermal & Environmental Engineering,2,89-93,,Meeting the demand for food. energy. and water to sustain the worldwide growth of urban population is a major challenge. Several recent reports have concluded that one approach to overcome this challenge is to recover and recycle resources within the food-energywater (FEW) nexus in urban settings. Urban wastewaters (UWW) are now being recognized as a resource. rich in nutrients and energy. rather than a waste stream that has to be treated and disposed of at the expense of significant energy input and associated environmental emissions. Reclaiming reusable water. nutrients. and energy from UWWs can contribute to autarky of FEW nexus and render the wastewater management process sustainable and potentially profitable. This paper presents a novel approach to treat UWW with the potential for high recovery of energy. nutrients. and water from UWW for use in food crop production. This approach entails cultivation of energy-rich algal biomass in primary-settled UWW followed by extraction of biocrude and nutrients from the algal biomass by hydrothermal liquefaction. A fraction of the recovered nutrients is recycled to boost biomass production while the rest can be stockpiled for use as fertilizer. Results from a pilot scale field study conducted at a local wastewater treatment plant confirmed that the algal system can achieve> 80% removal of organic carbon. ammoniacal-nitrogen. and phosphates in UWW. meeting the respective discharge standards in a single step. with a batch process time of three days.,True,GFXJBOkAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,0,http://iasks.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/IJTEE-1402001.pdf,,,,http://iasks.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/IJTEE-1402001.pdf,0,0,0

However. their efficacy for in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) is limited by oxidant decay and reactivity. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) was examined for its ability to stabilize aqueous-phase ozone (O3) and prolong oxidation potential through inclusion complex formation. Partial transformation of HPβCD by O3 was observed. However. HPβCD proved to be sufficiently recalcitrant. because it was only partially degraded in the presence of O3. The formation of a HPβCD:O3 clathrate complex was observed. which stabilized decay of O3. The presence of HPβCD increased the O3 half-life linearly with increasing HPβCD:O3 molar ratio.

The energies associated with these binding interactions afford high adsorption capacity (2.1 millimoles per gram at 0.025 bar) and selectivity (39.7 to 44.8) for acetylene at ambient conditions. Their efficiency for the separation of acetylene/ethylene mixtures is demonstrated by experimental breakthrough curves (0.73 millimoles per gram from a 1/99 mixture).,True,cKqtQ0MAAAAJ:R22Rs3tN8aoC,625,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6295/141.abstract,16650060243560914041,/scholar?cites=16650060243560914041,,https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=920794,0,0,0

The carbon numbers of the alkanes ranged from four to nine. For branched alkanes inflection behavior was observed for all carbon numbers studied. The inflection was found to occur at a loading of four molecules per unit cell. Below this loading the branched alkanes are seen to be located predominantly at the intersections of the straight and zigzag channels. To obtain loadings higher than four. the branched alkane must seek residence in the channel interiors which is energetically more demanding and therefore requires disproportionately higher pressures; this leads to the inflection behavior. Linear alkanes with six and more carbon atoms also were found to exhibit inflection behavior. Hexane and heptane show inflection due to commensurate …,True,cKqtQ0MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,550,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp982736c,6582018439841853663,/scholar?cites=6582018439841853663,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200661/files/4051108609vlu991.pdf,0,0,0

For the foreseeable future. however. it seems that the ever-growing energy demand will most likely necessitate the consumption of these indispensable sources of energy. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). a process to separate CO2 from the flue gas of coal-fired power plants and then store it underground. has been proposed to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Current CO2 capture processes employed in power plants worldwide are post-combustion “wet scrubbing” methods involving the chemical adsorption of CO2 by amine solutions such as monoethanolamine (MEA). The formation of carbamate from two MEA molecules and one CO2 molecule endows the scrubber with a high capacity and selectivity for CO2.

To address this aim:(1) beers manufactured worldwide. which were commercially available on the US market were obtained;(2) the concentration of concerning metals in the beers was analyzed; and (3) data were examined and correlated to explore any US maximum contaminant level (MCL) exceedances and determine whether geographic or grain-related trends exist. The results showed that there are no significant differences between the concerning metal concentrations of imported vs. domestic beers in the US market. Some specific heavy metals. like arsenic. are present in both imported and domestic beers in concentrations that exceed the national primary drinking water standards MCLs.

To address this hypothesis. nano-enabled hybrid media were fabricated and its removal performances were assessed for two model contaminants under multi-point batch pseudo-equilibrium and continuous-flow conditions. Calculation of simultaneous removal capacity indices (SRC) demonstrated that the more resource demanding continuous-flow tests are able to generate the same performance rankings as the ones obtained by conducing the simpler pseudo-equilibrium tests.

The microstructure evolution of the supported zeolite films during calcination for template removal was studied by high-temperature X-ray diffraction and in situ gas permeance. Removal of the template from the zeolite films occurs at 350–500°C and is accompanied by a substantial shrinkage in the zeolite framework. After the template is removed from the zeolite at high temperatures. the zeolite crystals expand on cooling while the support shrinks. A compressive stress develops in the zeolite film during the cooling process when the zeolite crystallites are bound to the support after template removal. Without annealing prior to template removal. this stress induces cracks in the YZ-supported MFI films.

1236459,Synthesis and Gas Transport Properties of Graphene Oxide Membranes,2018,Amr Fatehy Muhammad Ibrahim,,,,,,Graphene oxide membranes have shown promising gas separation characteristics specially for hydrogen that make them of interest for industrial applications. However. the gas transport mechanism for these membranes is unclear due to inconsistent permeation and separation results reported in literature. Graphene oxide membranes made by filtration. the most common synthesis method. contain wrinkles affecting their gas separation characteristics and the method itself is difficult to scale up. Moreover. the production of graphene oxide membranes with fine-tuned interlayer spacing for improved molecular separation is still a challenge. These unsolved issues will affect their potential impact on industrial gas separation applications.In this study. high quality graphene oxide membranes are synthesized on polyester track etch substrates by different deposition methods and characterized by XRD. SEM. AFM as well as single gas permeation and binary (H2/CO2) separation experiments. Membranes are made from large graphene oxide sheets of different sizes (33 and 17 μm) using vacuum filtration to shed more light on their transport mechanism. Membranes are made from dilute graphene oxide suspension by easily scalable spray coating technique to minimize extrinsic wrinkle formation. Finally. Brodie’s derived graphene oxide sheets were used to prepare membranes with narrow interlayer spacing to improve their (H2/CO2) separation performance.,True,eNq_LX0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/158456792.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/158456792.pdf,0,0,0

Golden. CO (United States),This report reviews the use of higher alcohols and several cellulose-derived oxygenates as blend components in gasoline. Material compatibility issues are expected to be less severe for neat higher alcohols than for fuel-grade ethanol. Very little data exist on how blending higher alcohols or other oxygenates with gasoline affects ASTM Standard D4814 properties. Under the Clean Air Act. fuelsused in the United States must be'substantially similar'to fuels used in certification of cars for emission compliance. Waivers for the addition of higher alcohols at concentrations up to 3.7 wt% oxygen have been granted. Limited emission testing on pre-Tier 1 vehicles and research engines suggests that higher alcohols will reduce emissions of CO and organics. while NOx emissions will stay thesame or increase. Most oxygenates can be used as octane improvers for standard gasoline stocks.

Their high octane numbers. relatively high energy density. low water solubility. and minimal effect on gasoline blend volatility are potentially significant advantages over alcohol-based fuels. However. prior studies have reported poor oxidative stability for furanic compound-gasoline blends. as well as the potential for the formation of dangerous organic peroxides. We show that alkylated furans have very low oxidative stability compared to conventional gasoline.

However. the application of natural methanotrophic strains to large-scale production of value-added chemicals/biofuels requires a number of physiological and genetic alterations. An accurate metabolic model coupled with flux balance analysis can provide a solid interpretative framework for experimental data analyses and integration. A stoichiometric flux balance model of Methylomicrobium buryatense strain 5G(B1) was constructed and used for evaluating metabolic engineering strategies for biofuels and chemical production with a methanotrophic bacterium as the catalytic platform. The initial metabolic reconstruction was based on whole-genome predictions. Each metabolic step was manually verified. gapfilled. and modified in accordance with genome-wide expression data. The final model incorporates a total of 841 reactions (in 167 metabolic pathways). Of these. up to 400 reactions were recruited to produce 118 intracellular metabolites. The flux balance simulations suggest that only the transfer of electrons from methanol oxidation to methane oxidation steps can support measured growth and methane/oxygen consumption parameters. while the scenario employing NADH as a possible source of electrons for particulate methane monooxygenase cannot.

Methanotrophic bacteria have the potential to enable commercial methane bioconversion to value-added products such as fuels and chemicals. A strain of interest for such applications is Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1. due to its robust growth characteristics. However. to take advantage of the potential of this methanotroph. it is important to generate comprehensive bioreactor-based datasets for different growth conditions to compare bioprocess parameters. Datasets of growth parameters. gas utilization rates. and products (total biomass. extracted fatty acids. glycogen. excreted acids) were obtained for cultures of M. buryatense 5GB1 grown in continuous culture under methane limitation and O2 limitation conditions. Additionally. experiments were performed involving unrestricted batch growth conditions with both methane and methanol as substrate. All four growth conditions show significant differences. The most notable changes are the high glycogen content and high formate excretion for cells grown on methanol (batch). and high O2:CH4 utilization ratio for cells grown under methane limitation. The results presented here represent the most comprehensive published bioreactor datasets for a gamma-proteobacterial methanotroph.

While rejuvenators may be able to restore the thermomechanical properties of aged asphalt. the rejuvenators’ susceptibility to moisture damage is a rising concern as various types and dosages of biorejuvenators gain traction in the market.

In this study. a three-dimensional transport model was used to simulate the advection and dispersiontransport of contaminant in the subsurface. Stochastic data assimilation schemes were coupled with the subsurface contaminant transport model to predict the state of the contaminant. Three data assimilation techniques namely the conventional Ensemble KalmanFilter. the Adaptive Ensemble Kalman Filter and the Hybrid Adaptive Ensemble Kalman Filter were adopted to improve the prediction of the contaminant fate and transport in the groundwater. The Ensemble Kalman Filter applies a Monte Carlo approach to the filtering problem. The adaptive filtering technique employs the diagnostic approach to fine tune the model and observation covariance matrix.

Aged asphalt such as recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) contain various amounts of asphalt binder. However. the asphalt binder in RAS and RAP is severely aged and inferior in properties compared to a virgin binder. To address this issue. liquid additives have been used under the general title of rejuvenators. That poses an additional challenge associated with the lack of clear metrics to differentiate between softeners and rejuvenators. Therefore. there is a need for a thorough study of rejuvenators. In this study. diverse-sourced rejuvenators have been used in RAS and RAP-modified binders as well as laboratory-prepared aged binders. The properties of the rejuvenated aged binder were characterized at a macro-level and molecular level. The study showed that the performance of the RAS-modified binder was significantly improved after bio-modification by a bio-rejuvenator. This study further evaluated laboratory-prepared aged asphalt rejuvenated with different rejuvenators. The results found that oxidized bitumen became soft after adding rejuvenators. regardless of their source.

However. recycled asphalt is highly aged and when blended with neat asphalt at high percentages. it can negatively impact the overall blend’s performance. Rejuvenators have been used to improve certain properties of aged asphalt and consequently the performance of the overall blend. This paper investigates the merits of introducing different types of rejuvenators to a laboratory aged asphalt while examining the overall blend’s rheological and surface properties. Accordingly. the dynamic shear rheometer was used to determine the rheological properties of several blends containing aged asphalt and rejuvenators. The surface properties were evaluated using the contact angles of each blend subjected to water conditioning; the latter was specifically used to investigate the moisture susceptibility of each blend. Study results showed that all rejuvenators were able to reduce complex modulus of aged asphalt binder.

Asphalt aging occurs due to two main processes: a loss of volatile components and a reduction of the malthene phase and oxidation of certain functional groups in asphalt. increasing the concentration of asphalt’s polar components. Performing SARA (saturate. aromatic. resin. and asphaltene) analysis and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy on the crude oil shows that the ratio of polar components to nonpolar ones is higher in oxidized asphalt compared to virgin asphalt. However. when a biomodifier is introduced to virgin asphalt. the rate of carbonyl (as a polar functional) formation is reduced. which may indicate a delayed oxidation due to the presence of biomodifier molecules in the asphalt.

However. moisture can still diffuse into the binder over time. reducing binder adhesion to aggregate or causing other changes that increase asphalt susceptibility to further water damage. Accordingly. this paper investigates the effects of water exposure at elevated temperature or extended duration on bituminous asphalt binder.

The true nature of the micelles. and the asphaltenic core in particular. has always been a debatable issue among asphalt researchers. One of the frequently asked questions is whether asphaltenes exist as stacked layers within the micelles or as single molecular units stabilized by resin molecules. In this paper. we investigate the correlation between the number of asphaltene sheets and the final stability of the system in a medium of asphaltene and resin components.

Based on how the “bees” flattened and fractured under applied tensile strain. the “bee” structures were hypothesized to be the result of wrinkling of very thin surface films on the order of 10 nm thick. Theories of thin film deformation suggest that the wavelength and amplitude of the “bees” may be related to the stiffness and thermal expansion coefficient of the bitumen. The study also showed that “bee” structures exhibited topological evolution over time depending on humidity and temperature in a manner consistent with the idea of the “bees” being composed of crystallized hydrophobic wax.

1236543,Characterization and application of manure-based bio-binder in asphalt industry,2010,Elham H Fini and Shih-Hsien Yang and Shuangning Xiu,,,10-2871,,,This paper introduces an environmentally friendly material. bio-binder to be used as partial replacement and modifier for asphalt binder on highways and airport pavements. This new binder is produced from thermochemical conversion of swine manure. To maintain a sustainable development. the highway paving industry has long been actively searching for a renewable alternative for petroleum-based asphalt binder. Production and application of bio-binder can address this need in addition to finding a solution for manure and its waste management. Application of bio-binder will improve asphalt binder’s properties while reducing asphalt pavements construction cost. Production of bio-oil (including bio-fuel and bio-binder) will reduce the need for landfills and lagoons to store swine manure and reduce environmental pollution. Moreover. bio-oil production reduces US dependence on petroleum resources by supplementing 9 million barrels of bio-oil per year. This becomes even more significant taking into account the relatively low cost of bio-binder production ($0.54/gallon) while asphalt binder costs $2/gallon. Furthermore. social and environmental benefits will be gained by adding value to the waste management system and reducing carbon emissions otherwise made by gasoline. Hence. the findings of this study can benefit the economy. the environment. and energy independence. This study showed that addition of bio-binder can improve low temperature properties of asphalt binder significantly. It will also enhance binder’s wetability and workability allowing asphalt producers to conduct mixing and compaction at relatively lower temperature.,True,Msrkbm4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,52,https://trid.trb.org/view/910772,3928955901148452602,/scholar?cites=3928955901148452602,,,0,0,0

Nitrogen-containing compounds have been found to be effective for decreasing the size of molecular agglomerates which are intensified during aging provided they adequately penetrate into the oxidized asphaltene agglomerations. The enhancement effect is mainly attributed to their electronic structures. including the polar head and hydrocarbon tail which can interact with asphaltene with CH−π interactions.

Wax-based additives reduce viscosity at high temperatures. facilitating the mixing and compaction of asphalt mixtures. However. the added wax leads to increased stiffness and physical hardening at low temperatures. In addition. wax may have an interplay with other bitumen additives and modifiers such as polyphosphoric acid (PPA). which is typically used by refineries and asphalt blending terminals. PPA has been shown to enhance high-temperature properties without negatively impacting the low-temperature performance of asphalt pavement.

It is a common practice to use modifiers to impart certain properties to asphalt binder; however. in order to facilitate the synthesis and design of highly effective sustainable modifiers. it is critical to thoroughly understand their underlying molecular level mechanisms in combination with micro and macro-level behavior. Therefore. this study incorporates a multi-scale approach using computational modeling and laboratory experiments to provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between selected modifiers and the constituents of asphalt binder. at aged and unaged conditions. This study investigated the effect of paraffinic wax as a modifier for virgin binder in warm-mix asphalt that can reduce the environmental burden of asphalt pavements. The addition of wax was shown to reduce the viscosity of bitumen by reducing the self-interaction of asphaltene molecules and penetrating the existing nano agglomerates of asphaltenes. This study further examined how the interplay of various modifiers affects the modified binder’s thermomechanical properties. It was found that the presence of wax-based modifiers has a disrupting effect on the role of polyphosphoric acid that is another modifier of bitumen and its interactions with resin-type molecules. This study was further extended to using nanozeolite as a mineral carrier for wax to better disperse wax in bitumen and reduce the wax's adverse effects such as physical hardening at low service temperatures and rutting at high service temperatures.

Although paraffin wax is one of the prevalent components of many recycling agents and rejuvenators commonly used in the asphalt industry. its effect on performance characteristics of asphalt binder has not been thoroughly understood. This paper uses combination of computational and experimental approach to study properties of aged asphalt binder specimens in presence of 1. 3. 5 and 10% paraffin wax. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed introduction of paraffin wax to aged asphalt significantly reduced glass transition temperature of aged asphalt. with 10% wax-doped aged asphalt having 9 degrees lower glass transition temperature than the control asphalt. The above observations can be attributed to plausible role of straight alkane chains of wax to disturb asphaltene clusters and increase overall asphaltene mobility. The latter was also reflected in wax-doped aged asphalt’s rheology with its percent recovery reducing by 50% in presence of 10% wax compared to the control. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that addition of wax to aged asphalt binder increased the onset temperature of degradation; an increase of 25 degrees was recorded when wax dosage was increased from 1 to 10%. However. the overall thermal stability of asphalt binder was reduced as evidenced by the lower residual mass in samples with higher wax content.

A comprehensive laboratory investigation combined with computational analysis was performed on an unaged liquid asphalt binder doped with four different percentages (1%. 3%. 5%. and 10%) paraffin wax. For each wax-modified asphalt binder. rheological and fracture properties were studied at different temperatures. A rotational viscometer was used to determine viscosity at specific shear rate. A dynamic shear rheometer was used to investigate effect of wax on high and intermediate asphalt binders' performance by generating complex modulus master curves. Furthermore. crossover temperature was calculated for each scenario to track the transition temperature from a viscous to elastic behavior. To further investigate the effect of wax on molecular conformation of binder. a molecular simulation was performed on the wax-asphaltene complex to study changes in the interactions of asphaltene (an asphalt component most influencing bituminous binder rheology). The results of molecular simulations shed light on interaction mechanism underlying the rheological changes showing a reduction in self-association of asphaltene molecules as the amount of wax increased in the wax-asphaltene matrix.

The most stringent requirement is the dependability. defined as the ability to provide uninterrupted relay communication during a recovery in the communication network due to a fiber break or component failure. Dependability relates to the ability to issue and receive a valid command in the presence of interference and/or noise. by minimizing the probability of missing a command. This requires the use of redundant backup communication paths. With the aim of increasing the availability of the communication path. optimal alternative communication paths for the teleprotection signals were considered within the company JP EMS (Serbian Transmission System and Market Operator). Considering the existing network infrastructure in order to reach the optimal solution. several possibilities were analyzed which differ in the type of the communication path used. and interfaces on the teleprotection terminal. The main communication path for teleprotection in JP EMS is OPGW. Analyzing the availability of the existing JP EMS communication network. the most suitable solutions are considered to be: E12 (ITU-T G. 703-2 Mbps) and Ethernet interfaces. and TDM and Ethernet communication paths. Using Ethernet interface with the transmission of the packets over the SDH network was concluded as the best solution for the redundant path in most cases.

Електротехнички факултет,Za razliku od klasičnih muzičkih instrumenata. zvuk zvona nastaje oscilovanjem trodimenzionalne osnosimetrične mase. Udarom bata pobuđuju se sopstveni modovi oscilovanja. čija su posledica diskretne komponente u zvuku zvona. takozvani parcijali. a čije frekvencije nisu u harmonijskom odnosu. Iako bi se očekivalo da ovako složena struktura parcijala u ljudskom uhu stvara složenu zvučnu sliku u kojoj se prepoznaje više različitih tonova. ipak se subjektivno najčešće izdvaja jedan ton koji se naziva udarni ton. i on u muzičkom smislu predstvalja osnovnu karakteristiku zvuka zvona. Udarni ton. zajedno sa još jednim tonom (koji se nekad može prepoznati i naziva se sekundarni udarni ton) i višim parcijalima. stapa se u jedinstvenu zvučnu sliku koja čini karakterističan zvuk zvona.

Zbog njihovog karakterističnog zvuka. kao i činjenice da se zvono obično sluša u vrlo specifičnim duhovnim prilikama. zvuk zvona kod slušaoca izaziva karakterističan subjektivni doživljaj. Stoga je pitanje kako definisati zvono koje prijatno zvuči veoma staro. Ljudi su pokušavali da daju odgovor na ovo pitanje uzimajući u obzir fizičke mogućnosti samog zvona kao fizičkog tela zadatog specifičnog oblika. kao i poredeći zvuk različitih zvona. Prema istorijski gledano najstarijem pravilu koje i danas predstavlja osnovnu smernicu u savremenim livnicama. prvih pet parcijala dominantno utiču na subjektivni doživljaj zvuka zvona i određuju udarni ton. Smatra se da je idealan odnos frekvencija prvih pet parcijala 1 : 2 : 2.4 : 3 : 4. koji obezbeđuje udarni ton koji se jasno i čisto čuje. što je …,True,CZn7XcIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://nardus.mpn.gov.rs/handle/123456789/6063,,,,https://nardus.mpn.gov.rs/bitstream/handle/123456789/6063/Disertacija4025.pdf?sequence=6,0,0,0

Based on the data regarding the prevalence of epilepsy in other countries. about 12.000 individuals under the age of 18 are estimated to suffer from active epilepsy. Children with epilepsy are a high risk group for oral diseases primarily due to psychiatric and psycho-social consequences of the primary disorder as well as the adverse effects of anti-epileptic therapy. Due to the primary disorder. children with epilepsy have reduced motivation for a number of activities. reduced mental and physical abilities. neglected social contacts. more difficult adoption of knowledge. skills. positive attitudes and behavior as well as general and oral healthcare. In children with epilepsy. there is an additional risk for oral diseases due to the adverse effects of anti-epileptic therapy such as gingival hyperplasia.

The aim of this study was to detect oral lesions in patients hospitalized in psychiatric institutions with the confirmed diagnosis of psychiatric illness and mood disorder with psychotic characteristics. as well as to discover the factors that can influence these oral lesions. Methods. Cross-section study consisted of 186 hospitalized patients with psychiatric disorders in the experimental group. out of whom 87 were males and 99 females. Patients were aged from 18 to 59 years. mean age 46.0±8.0 years. The control group consisted of 186 healthy persons matched for age and gender. Data on oral lesions were obtained within history and clinical examination of the oral cavity. Other medical data were collected from medical documentation. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t-test. chi-square test and logistic regression. Results. Dry mouth was registered in 78.5% of patients. The difference in tongue and lip lesions. burning and stinging symptoms. bruxism. facial pain. low saliva rates. halitosis. taste changes and swallowing difficulties between the patients and healthy persons was highly statistically significant (p<0.001).

Transitional character of these states also demonstrates why these phenomena are short-lasting and poorly reproducible. and also why they are most easily mentally controlled shortly before a waking/sleeping transitional state. This might be also an explanation for extraordinary efficiency of prayer accomplished shortly before sleeping. which is recommended by all religious traditions. and its significance in mutual reprogramming of psychic conflicts (as a germ of the future interpersonal fights. as well as of potential psychosomatic and psychological disorders of the persons in conflict) during transpersonal interactions of the persons in conflict in transitional states of the praying person (with direct mental addressing to the person conflicted with. or energetically more efficient indirect mental addressing via ionically abundant disembodied archetype structures from religious traditions).

Therefore. renal biopsy and histopathologic classification by the activity and chronicity assessment of LN are considered necessary before the initiation of the treatment. In this paper 311 renal biopsies in patients with LN were analyzed and classified according to the WHO Classification published in 1974. Renal biopsy specimens were routinely processed for standard analysis by light microscopy (LM). immunofluorescent (IF). and electron microscopy (EM). Biopsy findings were compared with the common clinical symptoms. It is important to recognize that histopathologic lesions in the analyzed tissue might precede the symptoms and clinical manifestations. and therefore are an important factor in the appropriate therapeutic approach. Histopathological assessment of the class of LN represents an important predictor in most patients because the lesions of LN class I and class II most often have no progression and consequently do not require an aggressive treatment. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (class IV) as a severe form of renal lesion requires the application of high doses of corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicaments.

In this scheme. nodes are dynamically organized into clusters. where each cluster operates under NDMA random access protocol with FH on a per packet slot basis using a cell-specific FH pattern. In a moderately loaded system. collisions between packets from different clusters are not negligible. In order to guard against such collisions. we propose NDMA with a fixed retransmission margin of M slots. For this system. we derive a sufficient condition for stability using a deterministic fluid arrivals model. We also analyze the steady-state. and obtain useful formulas for approximating mean packet delay.,True,V_RjB1QAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1202594/,17338459466411991171,/scholar?cites=17338459466411991171,,,0,0,0

First. a model of total transceiver power consumption as a function of transmit power is reviewed. Assuming adaptive transmission power control with perfect knowledge of channel loss. the total transceiver power consumption becomes a function of the channel loss. We derive the ratio between two-hop and single-hop energy consumption as a function of channel loss along each of the three links. The equipotential planes of this ratio are compared with the operating region of the transceivers. in the space of channel losses.

To understand the benefits that a particular signal processing method offers. the researchers must be aware of the theory underlying the method. as well as the limitations thereof.At first glance. there is a wide range of excellent introductory books. primers. and tutorials on signal processing. Unfortunately. many such texts assume that the reader is familiar with mathematics and stochastic processes theory at university level and sometimes with fundaments of communications theory. The reader should be fluent in mathematical terms. theorems. and lemmas in order to benefit from such material. On the one hand. signal processing penetrates all aspects of contemporary life. but on the other. a would-be consumer of the benefits that signal processing offers may find this material challenging. The aim of this chapter is to describe the introductory topics of signal processing using no mathematical terms and no mathematical expression. Another important issue is to show that signal processing is not a magic wand that gives a solution at a single sweep. Signal processing has its limitations and wielding the powerful tools it offers requires carefulness and understanding. A correct approach is based on interdisciplinary teamwork.

1236711,What is the global potential for renewable energy?,2012,Patrick Moriarty and Damon Honnery,16,,1,244-252,Pergamon,World energy demand is projected to rise to 1000 EJ (EJ = 1018 J) or more by 2050 if economic growth continues its course of recent decades. Both reserve depletion and greenhouse gas emissions will necessitate a major shift from fossil fuels as the dominant energy source. Since nuclear power is now unlikely to increase its present modest share. renewable energy (RE) will have to provide for most energy in the future. This paper addresses the questions of what energy levels RE can eventually provide. and in what time frame. We find that when the energy costs of energy are considered. it is unlikely that RE can provide anywhere near a 1000 EJ by 2050. We further show that the overall technical potential for RE will fall if climate change continues. We conclude that the global shift to RE will have to be accompanied by large reductions in overall energy use for environmental sustainability.,True,lx3_b18AAAAJ:YXeC4bxG7-IC,295,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032111003984,7681413016971101807,/scholar?cites=7681413016971101807,,http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2018/pdfs/global.pdf,0,0,0

It considers four illustrative cases: a high (1000 EJ) and a low (300 EJ) energy future. and for each of these conditions. a high (80%) and low (20%) fossil fuel energy share. We argue that neither high energy future is probable. because of resource limitations. and rising energy. environmental and money costs per unit of delivered energy as annual energy demand rises far beyond present levels. The low energy/low fossil case is most likely. followed by the low energy/high fossil case. although both require large cuts in energy use. and most probably. lifestyle changes in high energy use countries.

However. RE sources differ in many important ways from fossil fuels. particularly in that they are energy flows rather than stocks.

1236718,Rise and Fall of the Carbon Civilisation: Resolving Global Environmental and Resource Problems,2011,Patrick Moriarty and Damon Honnery,,,,,Springer Verlag,A vast amount has been written on climate change and what should be our response. Rise and Fall of the Carbon Civilisation suggests that most of this literature takes a far too optimistic position regarding the potential for conventional mitigation solutions to achieve the deep cuts in greenhouse gases necessary in the limited time frame we have available. In addition. global environmental problems. as exemplified by climate change. and global resource problems–such as fossil fuel depletion or fresh water scarcity–have largely been seen as separate issues. Further. proposals for solution of these problems often focus at the national level. when the problems are global. The authors argue that the various challenges the planet faces are both serious and interconnected. Rise and Fall of the Carbon Civilisation takes a global perspective in its treatment of various solutions:• renewable energy;• nuclear energy;• energy efficiency;• carbon sequestration; and• geo-engineering. It also addresses the possibility that realistic solutions cannot be achieved until the fundamentally ethical question of global equity–both across nations today and also inter-generational–is fully addressed. Such an approach will also involve reorienting the global economy away from an emphasis on growth and toward the direct satisfaction of basic human needs for all the Earth’s people.

Clearly. the longer we delay deep reductions in CO2. the greater the risk that total greenhouse gas emissions will exceed prudent limits for avoiding dangerous anthropogenic change. We evaluate the three possible technical approaches for climate change mitigation: emission reduction methods. post-emission draw down of CO2 from the atmosphere. and geoengineering. We find that the first two approaches are unlikely to deliver the timely reductions in CO2 needed. while geoengineering methods either deliver too little or are too risky.

In this paper we examine whether RE can provide anywhere near the levels of primary energy forecast by various official organisations in a business-as-usual world. We find that the energy costs of energy will rise in a non-linear manner as total annual primary RE output increases. In addition. increasing levels of RE will lead to increasing levels of ecosystem maintenance energy costs per unit of primary energy output.

1236725,Future cities in a warming world,2015,Patrick Moriarty and Damon Honnery,66,Futures,,45-53,Elsevier,More than half the global population are already urban. and the UN and other organisations expect this share to rise in future. However. some researchers argue that the future of cities is far from assured. Cities are not only responsible for 70% or more of the world's CO2 emissions. but because of their dense concentration of physical assets and populations. are also more vulnerable than other areas to climate change. This paper attempts to resolve this controversy by first looking at how cities would fare in a world with average global surface temperatures 4 °C above pre-industrial levels. It then looks at possible responses. either by mitigation or adaptation. to the threat such increases would entail. Regardless of the mix of adaptation and mitigation cities adopt in response to climate change. the paper argues that peak urbanism will occur over the next few decades. This fall in the urban share of global population …,True,lx3_b18AAAAJ:UFuRdyijzaAC,42,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328714002031,13979885848456653201,/scholar?cites=13979885848456653201,,http://www.regionalclimateperspectives.com/uploads/4/4/2/5/44250401/linksfuturecities.pdf,0,0,0
1236726,A hydrogen standard for future energy accounting?,2010,Patrick Moriarty and Damon Honnery,35,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,22,12374-12380,Pergamon,Present methods of energy accounting include both primary energy and final energy consumption. Both these methods have inconsistencies. although today their impact is minor. Some level of inconsistency and approximation in energy accounting is unavoidable when energy inputs come from such heterogeneous sources. We argue that in the decades to come. renewable energy will probably come to dominate the energy supply system. with most from intermittent energy sources. particularly wind and solar. In such an energy system. existing measures will become increasingly irrelevant for tracking energy use over time. for assessing a renewable energy source’s technical potential. and in determining future energy infrastructure needs. Further. conversion of most primary electricity to a storable energy form will be needed. with some then perhaps converted back to electricity as needed.

To avoid the risk of serious climate change. very recent research suggests that emission reductions will need to be both large and rapidly implemented. We argue that technical solutions—improving energy efficiency. use of renewable and nuclear energy. and carbon capture and sequestration—can only be of minor importance. mainly given the limited time available to take effective climate action. Only curbing energy use. perhaps through ‘social efficiency’ gains. particularly in the high-energy consumption countries. can provide the rapid emissions reductions needed. The social efficiency approach requires a basic rethinking in how we can satisfy our human needs with low environmental impacts. Large cuts in emissions could then occur rapidly. but only if resistance to such changes can be overcome.

Over the past century. vehicular passenger transport has experienced hypergrowth in terms of task. energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. For a variety of reasons. future decades may well see a significantly reduced global passenger transport task. as well as a widespread phasing-out of internal combustion engine vehicles. especially in cities. In contrast. the global freight transport task is unlikely to decline much. and could even grow. so that freight transport will dominate total transport energy use. Even if the world does finally respond seriously to climate change. likely policies will not favour hydrogen for private passenger vehicles for many decades.

We find that although both increased use of renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements are desirable. they will be unable to reduce significantly fossil fuel use by 2050.

Most of the technical potential for RE is in intermittently available sources. mainly wind and solar. As penetration from these sources rises. conversion to another energy form. and energy storage. will be needed. Here we assume the energy carrier is hydrogen. This paper examines the consequences for net energy output over time for various rates of growth of wind-hydrogen systems. Wind energy is chosen for this case study because its output is presently far greater than solar. and because its costs are lower. We find that high growth rates of turbine-hydrogen installations lead to ‘boom and bust’ cycles in both equipment manufacture. and in net energy output.

1236735,A global perspective on biomass gasification,2009,Patrick Moriarty and Honnery Damon,,,,,Nova Science Publishers. Inc.,Biomass is a unique renewable energy fuel in that unlike other renewables. it is naturally available as a solid fuel. but can be converted into liquid or gaseous fuels. The world in 2005 used around 48 EJ of biomass energy. nearly all of which was combusted at low thermal efficiency as fuelwood in developing countries. Around 4.6 EJ was used in modern biomass systems. either as liquid transport fuels or as a solid fuel for boilers in power stations or heating units. At present. very little is gasified. The future use of gasified biomass will increasingly depend on its ability to deliver higher greenhouse gas savings at lower costs than other ways of using bioenergy. Because of the high efficiencies possible for combined cycle gas turbines. the potential for gasification is considerable. but cost reductions and further technical progress are still needed. Its potential could be enhanced if gasification combined with carbon capture becomes feasible.INTRODUCTION: PRESENT AND FUTURE FOR BIOMASS FUELS,True,lx3_b18AAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,26,https://www.academia.edu/download/39261656/2009_Nova-BIOGASIFICATION-PM-DH.pdf,4475835095840849141,/scholar?cites=4475835095840849141,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39261656/2009_Nova-BIOGASIFICATION-PM-DH.pdf,0,0,0

While the contradiction has always been clear to the simplest of folks. the publication of the Limits to Growth report nearly half a century ago gave us the means to better understand the complex system dynamics that would characterise humanity’s overshoot of global limits. Because these understandings coincided with the oil crises and resultant recessions. in affluent Western countries there was some public discourse. and even early action. to consider the possibility of futures other than ones of continuous growth. On the fringes of society a flourishing counterculture gave birth to lifestyles and concepts (including permaculture) that have been the source of a continuous lineage …,True,0I1PqH0AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,50,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-13-2131-3.pdf,2173162196554140293,/scholar?cites=2173162196554140293,,,0,0,0
1236748,Basic and maximum income,2015,Samuel Alexander,,Degrowth: A vocabulary for a new era,,146-148,Routledge,To eliminate poverty. capitalist societies generally rely on growing the economic pie. not slicing it differently. If the pursuit of growth were given up. however. and a degrowth process of planned economic contraction were embraced. poverty would have to be confronted more directly. Among other things. this would require a restructuring of the property and tax systems for the purpose of redistributing wealth and ensuring everyone had ‘enough’(Alexander 2011). The Basic Income and the Maximum Income are two policies that could help achieve these important egalitarian goals. without relying on growth. Although there is considerable variety in forms of Basic Income. the core idea is relatively straightforward. In its idealised and most radical form. every person living permanently in a nation would receive from the state a periodic (eg fortnightly) payment. and this payment would be sufficient for an individual to live at a minimal though dignified standard of economic security. Advocates typically argue that a Basic Income payment should be guaranteed by the state. unconditional on the performance of any labour. and universal.Within a fully developed Basic Income system. some advocates argue that other state transfers could be abolished–such as unemployment benefits. family allowances. pensions. etc.–since the Basic Income grant would be sufficient to provide everyone with a decent. though minimal. subsistence. Existing ‘social welfare’has proven unable to eliminate poverty. even in the richest nations. so the powerful moral attraction of a Basic Income lies in how directly it confronts poverty. It is a policy based on the idea that the distribution …,True,0I1PqH0AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,43,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JhxWBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA146&dq=info:tSo1kUkPvvgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=kFJv5x1znK&sig=iSdO2F9ewLzHyvme3U97w-I2ykU,17923780375624362677,/scholar?cites=17923780375624362677,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Federico_Demaria/publication/309291920_DEGROWTH_A_Vocabulary_for_a_New_Era_E-BOOK/links/5808829f08ae63c48fec833e.pdf#page=175,0,0,0

1236750,Prosperous Descent,2015,Samuel Alexander,,,,,Simplicity Institute,I sometimes tell my students that I am an ‘apocaloptimist’. While. in truth. I am neither apocalyptic nor optimistic. this neologism serves as a fruitful conversation starter. It allows me to begin stating the case for why we. the human species. are facing overlapping crises of unprecedented magnitude–crises that are threatening the very persistence of our civilisation. At the same time. I explain why all of these problems are of our own making and. indeed. that their solutions already exist and are within our grasp. if only we decide that solving them is seriously what we want. I also maintain that the process of solving or at least responding appropriately to these problems can be both meaningful and fulfilling. if only we are prepared to let go of dominant conceptions of the good life. This means embracing very different ways of living. while also restructuring our societies to support a very different set of values–especially the values of frugality. moderation. and sufficiency. In short. I argue that the problems we face today are as grave as the solutions are available and attractive. and this tension is reflected in the title of this book–PROSPEROUS DESCENT–which I use provocatively to signify a paradox whose meaning will be unpacked in the following pages and chapters. Before outlining the content of the following chapters. let me introduce some of the basic themes which shape all the essays collected in this book (and its companion volume. SUFFICIENCY ECONOMY).

1236752,A critique of techno-optimism: Efficiency without sufficiency is lost,2014,Samuel Alexander,1,"Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, Working Paper (WP)",,14,,As the human species evolved. one of our most significant evolutionary advantages proved to be our opposable thumbs. which made it is easier for us to make fire and other basic tools. like knives and spears. These early ‘technological’advances. primitive though they seem to us today. nevertheless shaped the course of human history. They helped solve some of our problems. such as staying warm and gaining advantage over other species. as well as securing a more reliable source of food. especially protein. which contributed to the development of our brains. With larger brains. we came to understand the world better and were able to manipulate it to our apparent advantage. Thus the conscious development of technology is arguably what defines us as humans and separates us from all other forms of life.Science and technology have continued to play a central role in the development of civilisation. Through their advancement human beings have been able to produce electricity. cure diseases. spilt the atom. travel into space. invent computers and the internet. and map the human genome. among an unending list of other things that often seem like miracles. Notably. these scientific and technological advancements have also assisted in the unprecedented expansion of our productive capacities. primarily through harnessing the energy in fossil fuels and developing machines to augment human labour. This has allowed many people. primarily in the developed nations. to achieve lifestyles of material comfort that would have been unimaginable even a few generations ago.

This is surely one of the central questions for those of us who are animated by what Charles Eisenstein calls ‘the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible’; a central question for those of us with the fire of ecological democracy burning in our eyes. Yet. it is a question that demands engagement with three preliminary questions. the answers to which provide the necessary guidance for effective practical action. First. we must adequately understand the nature and extent of the overlapping crises that confront us today. Secondly. we must envision the alternative world. or matrix of alternative worlds. that would adequately dissolve the current crises and provide the foundations for a flourishing human civilisation into the deep future. And thirdly. having provided an accurate critique and having envisioned an appropriate and effective alternative. we must meditate deeply on the question of strategy–the question of how best to direct our energies and resources if we are to maximise our chances of building the new world we have imagined. Then. and only then. are we in a position to ask ourselves the ultimate question: what is to be done? If that question is asked prematurely. or if it is asked having answered any one of the preliminary questions inadequately. then there is a great risk that one’s action. motivated by the best of intentions. is directed in ways that fail to effectively produce any positive effect and. indeed. may even be counter-productive to the cause.

1236760,The sufficiency economy: Envisioning a prosperous way down,2012,Samuel Alexander,,Available at SSRN 2210170,,,,After briefly summarising the critique of growth. this essay describes in some detail an alternative economic system. which I will call ‘the sufficiency economy.’This term is typically applied to so-called ‘developing economies.’which either have not yet industrialised or are still in the early phases of industrialisation. These economies are sometimes called sufficiency economies because they do not or cannot produce material abundance. or do not seek material abundance. Instead. sufficiency economies are focused on meeting mostly local needs with mostly local resources. without the society being relentlessly driven to expand by the growth-focused ethics of profit-maximisation. My point of differentiation in this essay will be to consider the notion of a sufficiency economy within the context of the most highly developed regions of the world–where an economics of sufficiency is most desperately needed–and to explore what such an economy would look like. how it might function. and how the transition to such an economy might transpire.,True,0I1PqH0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,24,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2210170,12074886747608314852,/scholar?cites=12074886747608314852,,http://ww.hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Nature_Technology_and_Soceity_Spring_2013/Alexander%20-%20The%20Sufficiency%20Economy.pdf,0,0,0

The ELD problem is considered as a non-linear constrained optimisation problem. The problem becomes non-convex and non-smooth when the generators’ prohibited zones and valve-point effect are considered. The purpose of this work is to present a solution strategy to solve ELD problem in an efficient way while considering several aspects of ELD. The strategy employs a hybrid mechanism involving a quantum mechanics inspired particle swarm optimisation (PSO). The conventional PSO is modified by integrating quantum mechanics theory that redefines the particles positions and velocities in more diverse manner and therefore explores more search space.

Microgrids coalitions can (1) minimize the energy burden and dependency on the utility grid. (2) minimize the overall grid network power loss. and (3) maximize intra-coalition energy transfer. In order to form cooperative microgrids. a Hierarchical priority based Coalition Scheme (HRCoalition) is proposed. Given an intra-coalition distance threshold. the proposed HRCoalition mechanism can provide the optimal coalition that achieves the aforementioned objectives. The optimality is realized by reaching a state of cooperative equilibrium for all microgrids and coalitions. The optimality of the formed coalitions is proved by Coalitional Game Theory.

Microgrids coalitions can minimize the energy burden and dependency on the utility grid by maximizing intra-coalition energy transfer. A Hierarchical Coalition Formation (HR Coalition) mechanism is designed to form cooperative microgrids by determining optimal coalition among microgrids. The optimality is realized by reaching a state of cooperative equilibrium where sticking to the associated coalitions is the best response for all microgirds. We argued that the proposed HR Coalition scheme contains the optimality property and is proved to be scalable enough to participate in real-time operation.
