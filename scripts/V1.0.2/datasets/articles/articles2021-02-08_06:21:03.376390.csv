81928,Regulated portals of entry into the cell,2003,Sean D Conner and Sandra L Schmid,422,,6927,37-44,Nature Publishing Group,The plasma membrane is the interface between cells and their harsh environment. Uptake of nutrients and all communication among cells and between cells and their environment occurs through this interface.‘Endocytosis’ encompasses several diverse mechanisms by which cells internalize macromolecules and particles into transport vesicles derived from the plasma membrane. It controls entry into the cell and has a crucial role in development. the immune response. neurotransmission. intercellular communication. signal transduction. and cellular and organismal homeostasis. As the complexity of molecular interactions governing endocytosis are revealed. it has become increasingly clear that it is tightly coordinated and coupled with overall cell physiology and thus. must be viewed in a broader context than simple vesicular trafficking.,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4138,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01451,13458419135424189094,/scholar?cites=13458419135424189094,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandra_Schmid2/publication/10870479_Conner_SD_Schmid_SL_Regulated_portals_of_entry_into_the_cell_Nature_422_37-44/links/55100e2e0cf21287416cb96a/Conner-SD-Schmid-SL-Regulated-portals-of-entry-into-the-cell-Nature-422-37-44.pdf,0,0,0

Here we present a tracking algorithm that addresses the principal challenges of SPT. namely high particle density. particle motion heterogeneity. temporary particle disappearance. and particle merging and splitting. The algorithm first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle trajectories throughout a movie. Using this approach. we show that the GTPase dynamin differentially affects the kinetics of long-and short-lived endocytic structures and that the motion of CD36 receptors along cytoskeleton-mediated linear tracks increases their aggregation probability.

It self-assembles into ‘collars’ in vitro which also form in vivo at the necks of invaginated coated pits. This self-assembly stimulates dynamin's GTPase activity and it has been proposed that dynamin hydrolyses GTP in order to generate the force needed to sever vesicles from the plasma membrane. A mechanism is now described in which self-assembly of dynamin is coordinated by a domain of dynamin with a GTPase-activating function. Unexpectedly. when dynamin mutants defective in self-assembly-stimulated GTPase activity are overexpressed. receptor-mediated endocytosis is accelerated.

The “GTPase switch” paradigm. in which a GTPase acts as a bimodal switch that is turned “on” and “off” by external regulatory factors. has been used to interpret the regulatory mechanism of many GTPases for more than two decades. Nevertheless. recent work has unveiled an emerging class of “multistate” regulatory GTPases that do not adhere to this classical paradigm. Instead of relying on external nucleotide exchange factors or GTPase activating proteins to switch between the on and off states. these GTPases have the intrinsic ability to exchange nucleotides and to sense and respond to upstream and downstream factors.

Although highly enriched in neurons. dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is. in fact. widely expressed along with Dyn2 but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) kinase. Here. we study the differential. isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual- and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1. and that Dyn2 but not Dyn1 exhibits a pronounced burst of assembly. presumably into supramolecular collar-like structures that drive membrane scission and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3β results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors. increased rates of CCP initiation. and decreased CCP lifetimes but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus. activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME that occur well upstream of fission. even when present at low. substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2. Under physiological conditions. Dyn1 is activated downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to alter CCP dynamics.

82073,Dynamin-catalyzed membrane fission requires coordinated GTP hydrolysis,2013,Ya-Wen Liu and Juha-Pekka Mattila and Sandra L Schmid,8,PLoS One,1,e55691,Public Library of Science,Dynamin is the most-studied membrane fission machinery and has served as a paradigm for studies of other fission GTPases; however. several critical questions regarding its function remain unresolved. In particular. because most dynamin GTPase domain mutants studied to date equally impair both basal and assembly-stimulated GTPase activities. it has been difficult to distinguish their respective roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or in dynamin catalyzed membrane fission. Here we compared a new dynamin mutant. Q40E. which is selectively impaired in assembly-stimulated GTPase activity with S45N. a GTP-binding mutant equally defective in both basal and assembly-stimulated GTPase activities. Both mutants potently inhibit CME and effectively recruit other endocytic accessory proteins to stalled coated pits. However. the Q40E mutant blocks at a later step than S45N. providing additional evidence that GTP binding and/or basal GTPase activities of dynamin are required throughout clathrin coated pit maturation. Importantly. using in vitro assays for assembly-stimulated GTPase activity and membrane fission. we find that the latter is much more potently inhibited by both dominant-negative mutants than the former. These studies establish that efficient fission from supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir (SUPER) templates requires coordinated GTP hydrolysis across two rungs of an assembled dynamin collar.,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,20,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055691,2484523701162425369,/scholar?cites=2484523701162425369,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055691,0,0,0

How does dynamin use the energy of GTP hydrolysis for membrane remodeling? By monitoring the ionic permeability through lipid nanotubes (NT) interacting with dynamin and GTP we detected cyclic localized squeezing and relaxation of NT. ultimately yielding leak-free fission stochastically. Our calculations revealed that critical local narrowing of NT induces cooperative lipid tilting. leading to self-merger of the inner monolayer of NT (hemi-fission). consistent with the absence of leakage. We found that dynamin pre-assembled on NT without GTP produces stable curvature which. depending upon lipid composition. approaches the hemi-fission threshold. GTP addition causes gradual disassembly of dynamin. triggering either spontaneous fission or curvature relaxation.

Dynamin. a large multidomain GTPase. is a key regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It assembles at the necks of invaginated clathrin-coated pits and. through GTP hydrolysis. catalyzes scission and release of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane. Several small molecule inhibitors of dynamin’s GTPase activity. such as Dynasore and Dyngo-4a. are currently available. although their specificity has been brought into question. Previous screens for these inhibitors measured dynamin’s stimulated GTPase activity due to lack of sufficient sensitivity. hence the mechanisms by which they inhibit dynamin are uncertain. We report a highly sensitive fluorescence-based assay capable of detecting dynamin’s basal GTPase activity under conditions compatible with high throughput screening. Utilizing this optimized assay. we conducted a pilot screen of 8000 compounds and identified several “hits” that inhibit the basal GTPase activity of dynamin-1. Subsequent dose-response curves were used to validate the activity of these compounds. Interestingly. we found neither Dynasore nor Dyngo-4a inhibited dynamin’s basal GTPase activity. although both inhibit assembly-stimulated GTPase activity.

82116,FCHSD2 controls oncogenic ERK1/2 signaling outcome by regulating endocytic trafficking,2020,Guan-Yu Xiao and Sandra L Schmid,18,PLoS biology,7,e3000778,Public Library of Science,The evolution of transformed cancer cells into metastatic tumors is. in part. driven by altered intracellular signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The surface levels and activity of RTKs are governed mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). endosomal recycling. or degradation. In turn. oncogenic signaling downstream of RTKs can reciprocally regulate endocytic trafficking by creating feedback loops in cells to enhance tumor progression. We previously showed that FCH/F-BAR and Double SH3 Domain-Containing Protein (FCHSD2) has a cancer-cell specific function in regulating CME in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here. we report that FCHSD2 loss impacts recycling of the RTKs. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proto-oncogene c-Met (MET). and shunts their trafficking into late endosomes and lysosomal degradation. Notably. FCHSD2 depletion results in the nuclear translocation of active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). leading to enhanced transcription and up-regulation of EGFR and MET. The small GTPase. Ras-related protein Rab-7A (Rab7). is essential for the FCHSD2 depletion-induced effects. Correspondingly. FCHSD2 loss correlates to higher tumor grades of NSCLC. Clinically. NSCLC patients expressing high FCHSD2 exhibit elevated survival. whereas patients with high Rab7 expression display decreased survival rates.

Dynamin. a large multidomain GTPase. is a key regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It assembles at the necks of invaginated clathrin-coated pits and. through GTP hydrolysis. catalyzes scission and release of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane. Several small molecule inhibitors of dynamin’s GTPase activity. such as Dynasore and Dyngo-4a. are currently available. although their specificity has been brought into question. Previous screens for these inhibitors measured dynamin’s stimulated GTPase activity due to lack of sufficient sensitivity. hence the mechanisms by which they inhibit dynamin are uncertain. We report a highly sensitive fluorescence-based assay capable of detecting dynamin’s basal GTPase activity under conditions compatible with high throughput screening. Utilizing this optimized assay. we conducted a pilot screen of 8000 compounds and identified several “hits” that inhibit the basal GTPase activity of dynamin-1. Subsequent dose-response curves were used to validate the activity of these compounds. Interestingly. we found neither Dynasore nor Dyngo-4a inhibited dynamin’s basal GTPase activity. although both inhibit assembly-stimulated GTPase activity. This assay provides the basis for a more extensive search for robust dynamin inhibitors.,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/153106v1.abstract,5839064920271279426,/scholar?cites=5839064920271279426,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/21/153106.full.pdf,0,0,0

To create such membrane stress the GTPase dynamin-1. protein orchestrating membrane fission in endocytosis. assembles into helical scaffolds that constrict the necks of endocytic vesicles. We found that under constant GTP turnover two-rung dynamin scaffold is sufficient to produce fission of lipid nanotubes. Analyzing membrane fission by short dynamin scaffolds. we reveal a catalytic cycle which translates constriction stresses into fission. Upon constriction. coordinated membrane wedging by the scaffold facilitates reversible merger of the inner leaflet of the nanotube. the hemifission.

We recently reported that signaling reciprocally regulates CME in cancer cells and that the crosstalk can contribute to cancer progression. To further explore the nature and extent of the crosstalk between signaling and CME in cancer cell biology. we analyzed a panel of oncogenic signaling kinase inhibitors for their effects on CME. Inhibition of several kinases selectively affected CME function in cancer cells. Among these. ERK1/2 inhibition selectively inhibited CME in cancer cells by decreasing the rate of CCP initiation. We identified an ERK1/2 substrate. the FCH/F-BAR and SH3 domain-containing protein. FCHSD2. as being essential for the ERK1/2-dependent effects on CME and CCP initiation. ERK1/2 phosphorylation activates FCHSD2 and regulates EGFR endocytic trafficking as well as downstream signaling activities. Loss of FCHSD2 activity in non-small-cell lung cancer cells leads to increased cell surface expression and altered signaling downstream of EGFR. resulting in enhanced cell proliferation and migration.

It is often assumed that carbon storage in trees is largely a consequence of surplus carbon supply (reserve accumulation). In contrast. carbon storage might also occur against prevailing carbon demand from other sink activities. like growth (reserve formation). in which case carbon reserve pools might increase even at carbon limitation. and thus. cannot be used as indicators for a tree's carbon supply status. Such a situation might be severe defoliation by herbivores. Especially in evergreen tree species. it has been shown that natural and experimental defoliation leads to a reduction of growth that is proportional to the lost leaf area.

Receptors are concentrated in specialized"" coated pit"" regions of the cell surface which invaginate and pinch-off to form coated vesicles carrying receptors and bound ligands into the cell. At the molecular level. most of the constituents of the protein coat are known (although new coat constituents are still being identified. Ahle and Ungewickell. 1990) and a growing number of these have been cloned allowing primary sequence determination (for reviews see Pearse and Crowther. 1987. Brodsky. 1988. Morris et al.. 1989). The major coat proteins are clathrin triskelions which consist of three 180kD clathrin heavy chains each with a tightly associated~ 30kD light chain. Assembly protein (AP) complexes or'adaptins' appear to mediate the binding of the clathrin coat to the plasma membrane perhaps through direct interaction with the cytoplasmic domains of receptors (Keen. 1987; Virshup and Bennett. 1988; Glickman et al. 1989). These complexes consist of two~ 110kD. two~ 50kD and two~ 20 kD subunits and are present at a 3: 2 molar ratio to triskelions in the coat (reviewed by Morris et al.. 1989). Two distinct protein kinases have also been identified as constituents of the coat structure. the 50kD kinase subunit of the assembly protein complex AP1 and a casein kinase II-activity. An additional light chain B kinase activity has also been identified.

82153,Department of Cell Biology The Scripps Research Institute,2013,TE Redelmeier and CJ Lamaze and SL Schmid,74,Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Traffic,,317,Springer Science & Business Media,Endocytosis of many essential nutrients and growth factors is mediated by transmembrane receptors which bind to coated pits and are internalized via clathrin coated vesicles (for a recent review see Smythe and Warren). The receptors can be classified on the basis of whether ligand binding is required to promote efficient internalization. For example. the nutrient hormone receptors LDL and Tfn are internalized efficiently in the absence of ligands whereas EGF stimulates the endocytosis of the EGF receptor. These observations imply that the factors responsible for the efficientendocytosis of receptors maybe different for different classes of receptors.Recent work in our laboratory has indicated that adaptors are involved in the sequestration of the Tfn receptor into clathrin coated pits (Smythe et al.. 1992). Using cell free assays which measure the ATP. temperature and cytosol dependent internalization of the Tfn receptor into plasma membrane derived elongated coated pits. Smythe and co-workers have established that purified adaptors stimulate the sequestration of labelled Tfn into structures which are inaccessible to added anti-Tfn antibodies but accessible to the low molecular weight reducing agent Mesna. These results provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that adaptors mediate the binding of receptors (perhaps via internalization signals residing in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor) to clathrin coated pits (Pearse and Robinson. 1990).,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=V-ztCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA317&dq=info:wDGvMmkhezkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=51wwMVfuVi&sig=Kn1xdzV_W4_37Ff-f2ZGM6j5Ysg,,,,,0,0,0

The guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) dynamin builds up membrane stress by polymerizing into a helical collar that constricts the neck of budding vesicles. How this curvature stress mediates nonleaky membrane remodeling is actively debated. Using lipid nanotubes as substrates to directly measure geometric intermediates of the fission pathway. we found that GTP hydrolysis limits dynamin polymerization into short. metastable collars that are optimal for fission. Collars as short as two rungs translated radial constriction to reversible hemifission via membrane wedging of the pleckstrin homology domains (PHDs) of dynamin.

March 6. 2011 role of the dynamin GTPase activity in controlling fusion pore expansion and post-fusion granule membrane topology was investigated using the powerful membrane curvature-imaging technique of polarized TIRF microscopy and amperometry.

The experiments indicate that the GTPase activity of dynamin functions as a timer determining the rapidity of fusion pore expansion from 10’s of milliseconds to seconds after fusion. in addition to its role in endocytosis.

82178,CVAK104 Is a Novel Poly-L-lysine-stimulated Kinase That Targets the ß2-Subunit of AP2,2005,Sean D Conner and Sandra L Schmid,,,,,,Isolated clathrin adaptor protein (AP) preparations are known to co-fractionate with endogenous kinase activities. including poly-L-lysine-stimulated kinases that target various constituents of the clathrin coat. We have identified CVAK104 (a coated vesicle-associated kinase of 104 kDa) using a mass spectroscopic analysis of adaptor protein preparations. CVAK104 is a novel serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the SCY1-like family of protein kinases. previously thought to be catalytically inactive. We found that CVAK104 co-fractionates with adaptor protein preparations extracted from clathrincoated vesicles and directly binds to both clathrin and the plasma membrane adaptor. AP2. CVAK104 binds ATP. and kinase assays indicate that it functions in vitro as a poly-L-lysine-stimulated kinase that is capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylating the ß2-adaptin subunit of AP2.Endocytosis involves the invagination of specialized regions of the plasma membrane. which pinch off to form cargo-containing vesicles that are transported into the cell. Although several diverse endocytic pathways are present in eukaryotic cells. the clathrin-mediated pathway is ubiquitous and the most efficient mechanism. This internalization pathway is key to a variety of biological processes that range from the downregulation of activated signaling receptors to synaptic vesicle recycling (1).,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandra_Schmid2/publication/7927573_CVAK104_Is_a_Novel_Poly-L-lysine-stimulated_Kinase_That_Targets_the_2-Subunit_of_AP2/links/5765497108ae1658e2f4a394/CVAK104-Is-a-Novel-Poly-L-lysine-stimulated-Kinase-That-Targets-the-2-Subunit-of-AP2.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandra_Schmid2/publication/7927573_CVAK104_Is_a_Novel_Poly-L-lysine-stimulated_Kinase_That_Targets_the_2-Subunit_of_AP2/links/5765497108ae1658e2f4a394/CVAK104-Is-a-Novel-Poly-L-lysine-stimulated-Kinase-That-Targets-the-2-Subunit-of-AP2.pdf,0,0,0

GTP Hydrolysis. and Clathrinmediated Endocytosis.,2004,Byeong Doo Song and Marilyn Leonard and Sandra L Schmid,279,Journal of Biological Chemistry,39,40431-40436,Baltimore [etc.],The GTPase dynamin is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Unlike most GTPases. dynamin has a low affinity for nucleotide. a high rate of GTP hydrolysis. and can self-assemble. forming higher order structures such as rings and spirals that exhibit up to 100-fold stimulated GTPase activity. The role(s) of GTP binding and/or hydrolysis in endocytosis remain unclear because mutations in the GTPase domain so far studied impair both. We generated a new series of GTPase domain mutants to probe the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis and to further test the role of GTP binding and/or hydrolysis in endocytosis. Each of the mutations had parallel effects on assembly-stimulated and basal GTPase activities. In contrast to previous reports. we find that mutation of Thr-65 to Ala (or Asp or His) dramatically lowered both the rate of assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis and the affinity for GTP.

We have been using a tissue culture model system HeLa cells to isolate the activated EGER at distinct stages in the endocytic pathway. Our research has focused on rab5. a small molecular weight GTPase. implicated in the biogenesis of the early endosome. Mutations to modulate the guanine nucleotide binding properties of this protein have been reported for constitutively internalized receptors. but little is known about its role in EGFR endocytic trafficking. In the past year. we have discovered that expression of a dominant negative rab5 rab5S34N. has no effect on EGFR endocytosis. but inhibits entry of the EGFR into the early endosome. The functional consequence of this mutation is slowed rate of EGER degradation. Additionally. we have found that the guanine nucleotide binding state of the rab5 proteins dictates the ability of the cells to mediate EGER-dependent cell growth. Cells expressing rab5 that preferentially bindings GDP growth significantly better than cells expressing rab5 that binds GTP.Descriptors:,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADB284022,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADB284022.pdf,0,0,0

To this end. I developed a novel cell-free assay which reconstitutes the ligand-induced and EGFR tyrosine kinase-dependent recruitment of EGFR into cathrine coated pits. I also showed that activation of small Rho-family GTPases. which occurs in response to growth factors. can negatively regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis. In following up this discovery I have provided new and direct evidence for the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in early events in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Finally. I have begun to explore the role of an EGFR tyrosine kinase substrate. Eps15. in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Eps15 is the prototype member of a growing family of EH Eps15-homology domain-containing proteins required for intracellular membrane trafficking. This successful training period has resulted in five manuscripts published in first-rate journals and one manuscript currently under review.

The basic features of this pathway include: the binding of extracellular ligands to specific receptors on the plasma membrane. the accumulation and subsequent internalization of the receptor-ligand complex in clathrin coated pits and coated vesicles. and the delivery of these complexes to endosomes -- a heterogeneous population of uncoated vesicles and associated tubules (Marsh et al.. 1986) -- whose mildly acidic internal pH favors the dissociation of ligand from receptor.

Mitochondrial dysfunction gives rise or contributes to a wide variety of human conditions. such as neurodegenerative diseases. developmental disorders. cardiomyopathies. metabolic syndrome. cancer. and obesity [1]. The effects of mitochondrial function on lifespan are complex. Mitochondrial function clearly deteriorates with increasing age and many studies in yeast and metazoans have implicated this decline as a driver in the aging process. Mutations that accelerate mitochondrial DNA damage can reduce the capacity of the mitochondria to eliminate aberrant lumenal proteins. prevent the repair of oxidative damage within mitochondria. and change mitochondrial inheritance. and along with those that cause a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. can result in reduced lifespan [3. 4]. In yeast. mitochondrial function is important for both replicative and chronological lifespan. The respiratory function of the mitochondria is crucial for chronologically aging cells and mutations or interventions with a negative impact on respiration shorten lifespan [3]. During replicative aging. however. the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction may be independent of the respiratory capacity of the organelle [4]. Depending on the strain background. respiratory-deficient rho0 strains can live shorter or longer than their respiratory-proficient counterparts [5]. Similarly. deletion of genes that are required for the regulation of mitochondrial translation increases replicative lifespan despite causing …,True,_WWra9AAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/53317874/Aging_One_Thing_Leads_to_Another20170529-32162-covr8x.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53317874/Aging_One_Thing_Leads_to_Another20170529-32162-covr8x.pdf,0,0,0

Acute activation of dynamin-1 in normal RPE cells by inhibition of GSK3β accelerates CME. alters CCP dynamics and. unexpectedly. increases the rate of CCP initiation.

This resulted in a strong stimulation of the specific glycolytic flux concomitant with a smaller decrease in the growth rate of the cells. By optimizing additional ATP hydrolysis. we increased the flux through glycolysis to 1.7 times that of the wild-type flux.

Such a `turbo' principle is useful but also contains an inherent risk. This is illustrated by a detailed kinetic analysis of a paradoxical Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant; the mutant fails to grow on glucose because of overactive initial enzymes of glycolysis. but is defective only in an enzyme (trehalose 6-phosphate synthase) that appears to have little relevance to glycolysis. The ubiquity of pathways that possess an initial activation step. suggests that there might be many more genes that. when deleted. cause rather paradoxical regulation phenotypes (i.e. growth defects caused by enhanced utilization of growth substrate).,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,272,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000498012055,14119445763699419769,/scholar?cites=14119445763699419769,,http://arquivo.ufv.br/dbv/pgfvg/BVE684/htms/pdfs_revisao/metabolismo/dangerturbodesign.pdf,0,0,0

We maintain that such an increase in the first-encounter rate is too small to be responsible for truly enhanced signal transduction. Instead. the function of membrane localization is to increase the number (or average lifetime) of complexes between cognate signal transduction proteins and hence increase the extent of activation of downstream processes. This is achieved by concentrating the proteins in the small volume of the area just below the plasma membrane. The signal-transduction chain is viewed simply as operating at low default intensity because one of its components is present at a low concentration.

The effects of kinase and phosphatase inhibition on a MAP kinase pathway are first examined in silico. Quantitative measures for the control of signal amplitude. duration and integral strength are introduced. We then identify and prove new principles. such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero. and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal −1. Collectively. kinases control amplitudes more than duration. whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF‐induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude. in particular long after EGF administration.

82255,Acetaldehyde mediates the synchronization of sustained glycolytic oscillations in populations of yeast cells,1996,Peter Richard and Barbara M Bakker and Bas Teusink and Karel Van Dam and Hans V Westerhoff,235,European journal of biochemistry,1‐2,238-241,Blackwell Science Ltd,In the presence of cyanide. populations of yeast cells can exhibit sustained oscillations in the concentration of glycolytic metabolites. NADH and ATP. This study attempts to answer the long‐standing question of whether and how oscillations of individual cells are synchronized. It shows that mixing two cell populations that oscillate 180° out of phase only transiently abolishes the macroscopic oscillation. After a few minutes. NADH fluorescence of the mixed population resumes oscillations up to the original amplitude. At low cell densities. addition of acetaldehyde causes transient oscillations. At higher cell densities. where the oscillations are autonomous. 70 μM acetaldehyde causes phase shifts. Extracellular acetaldehyde is shown to oscillate around the 70 μM level.

The NH3‐oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea expresses nitrite reductase (NirK). an enzyme that has so far been studied predominantly in heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria where it is involved in the production of these nitrogenous gases. The finding of nirK homologues in other NH3‐oxidizing bacteria suggests that NirK is widespread among this group; however. its role in these nitrifying bacteria remains unresolved. We identified a gene. nsrR. which encodes a novel nitrite (NO2–)‐sensitive transcription repressor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of NirK expression in N. europaea.

At present it is impossible to remove the glycosome without changing much of the rest of the cell. It would seem impossible. therefore. to assess the metabolic consequences of this compartmentation. Therefore. we here develop a computer experimentation approach. which we call computational cell biology. A validated molecular kinetic computer replica was built of glycolysis in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Removing the glycosome membrane in that replica had little effect on the steady-state flux. which argues against the prevalent speculation that glycosomes serve to increase flux by concentrating the enzymes.

Explanations of systemic properties are always in terms of the properties of the parts within the system. Nonetheless. systemic properties can still be emergent. If the properties of the components within the system cannot be predicted. even in principle. from the behavior of the system’s parts within simpler wholes then there also will be systemic properties which cannot be predicted. even in principle. on basis of the behavior of these parts.

K+-ATPase. In the present work. it is shown why many transmembrane enzymes can be expected to absorb free energy from an oscillating electric field and transduce that to chemical or transport work. In the theoretical analysis it turned out to be sufficient that (i) the catalytic process be accompanied by either net or cyclic charge translocation across the membrane and (ii) the stability of the enzyme states involved be asymmetric. Calculations based on a four-state model reveal that free-energy transduction occurs with sinusoidal. square-wave. and positive-only oscillating electric fields and for cases that exhibit either linear or exponential field-dependent rate constants.

In spite of a considerable research effort over the past three decades. no combination of signal(s) and kinetic function has emerged with the power to explain ATP homeostasis in all mammalian cells.

We find that the apparent kinetic order of the transduction function of the signal cytosolic ADP concentration ([ADP]) is at least second order and not first order as has been assumed.

This approach is referred to as signal transfer analysis and is based on formalisms that were first developed for the analysis of metabolic networks. Signal transduction is quantified as the sensitivity. known as the response coefficient of a target (e.g. an ion channel or transcription factor) to a signal (e.g. a hormone. growth factor or neurotransmitter). This response coefficient is defined in terms of the fractional change in the activated target brought about by a small fractional change in the signal. Quantifying the signal transduction in this way makes it possible to prove that for an idealized signaling cascade without feedback loops. the total response equals the product of all the local response coefficients. one for each level of the cascade.

Two cases are treated explicitly. The first concerns cascades in the absence of feed-back: in this case the internal control behaviour of each module is unaffected by external regulatory interactions. The second includes one feed-back loop and gives a quantitative expression of how feed-back modifies control properties: the internal control matrix within one module can be calculated as if the elasticity matrix of this module was the sum of its intrinsic elasticity matrix and a cyclic regulation matrix.

Previous modeling studies predicted that either feedback inhibition or compartmentation of glycolysis can protect cells from accumulation of intermediates. The deadly parasite Trypanosoma brucei lacks feedback regulation of early steps in glycolysis yet sequesters the relevant enzymes within organelles called glycosomes. leading to the proposal that compartmentation prevents toxic accumulation of intermediates. Here. we show that glucose 6-phosphate indeed accumulates upon glucose addition to PEX14 deficient trypanosomes. which are impaired in glycosomal protein import. With glycerol catabolism. both in silico and in vivo. loss of glycosomal compartmentation led to dramatic increases of glycerol 3-phosphate upon addition of glycerol.

This property is analyzed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic theory. An explicit demonstration using irreversible thermodynamics. through second order. is given for the case of a simple model enzyme in the presence of a periodic external perturbation. Three reasons for an enzyme to drive a reaction in a nonstationary environment may be identified: the average values of the forces. the root mean square of the external time-dependent perturbation. and the frequency-dependent correlation between the applied perturbation and the enzyme response. The extent to which the output reaction responds to any of these is governed by the kinetic constants of the enzyme.

Under certain conditions the concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates in yeast cells can oscillate. Individual yeast cells in a suspension can synchronize their oscillations to get in phase with each other. Although the glycolytic oscillations originate in the upper part of the glycolytic chain. the signaling agent in this synchronization appears to be acetaldehyde. a membrane-permeating metabolite at the bottom of the anaerobic part of the glycolytic chain. Here we address the issue of how a metabolite remote from the pacemaking origin of the oscillation may nevertheless control the synchronization.

Here we report that randomly pulsed electric fields can also lead to work being done. giving rise to speculation as to whether appropriately designed enzymes can extract and convert free energy from the inherent fluctuations in their environment. The paradox is resolved by showing that equilibrium electrical noise resulting from the environment around an enzyme cannot be completely random but is correlated to the state that the enzyme is in. If the noise has the appropriate reciprocal interaction with the enzyme. its potential to serve as a free-energy source disappears. This is shown by Monte Carlo and other numerical calculations and is proven analytically by use of the diagram method.

82292,Protein burden in Zymomonas mobilis: negative flux and growth control due to overproduction of glycolytic enzymes,1995,Jacky L Snoep and Lorraine P Yomano and Hans V Westerhoff and Lonnie O Ingram,141,Microbiology,9,2329-2337,Microbiology Society,Increasing the expression of various glycolytic operons in Zymomonas mobilis caused a significant decrease rather than increase in the glycolytic flux and growth rate. Because the relative decrease depended on the amount of overexpressed protein. and was independent of which enzyme was overexpressed. we attributed it to a protein burden effect. More specifically. we examined if the decrease in glycolytic flux could be explained by a decreased concentration of other glycolytic enzymes (for which glucokinase was used as a marker enzyme). Using the summation theorem of metabolic control theory we predicted the extent of this protein burden effect. The predictions were in good agreement with the experimental observations.

Here we discuss two hypotheses: (i) the structure of the Escherichia coli nucleoid is determined by DNA binding proteins and DNA supercoiling. representing a compaction force on the one hand. and by the coupled transcription/translation/ translocation of plasma membrane and cell wall proteins. representing an expansion force on the other hand; (ii) the two forces are important for the partitioning process of chromosomes.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,132,https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/131/3/235/511514,13152112991428659273,/scholar?cites=13152112991428659273,,https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3801010/1357_13585y.pdf,0,0,0

The dependence of the flux on the protein concentration was more than linear but less than quadratic. The combined flux–response coefficient of the four enzymes constituting the glucose PTS decreased slightly from values of ≈1.8 with increasing protein concentrations in the assay. Addition of the macromolecular crowding agents polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 and PEG 35000 led to a sharper decrease in the combined flux–response coefficient. in one case to values of ≈1.

The goal of this study was to investigate if the generation of ROS in a discrete region of a cardiomyocyte could serve to propagate RIRR-mediated mitochondrial depolarizations throughout a cell. Our experiments revealed that localized RIRR activated either RIRR-mediated fluctuations in mitochondrial membrane potential (time period: 3–10 min) or a traveling wave of depolarization of the cell’s mitochondria (velocity: ∼5 μm/min). Both phenomena appeared to be mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and eventually encompassed the majority of the mitochondrial population of both isolated rat and rabbit cardiomyocytes.

Ltd,Biochemical networks are characterized by recurrent patterns and motifs. but the design principles underlying the dynamics of the mammalian intracellular signalling network remain unclear. We systematically analysed decay rates of 134 signalling proteins and investigated their gene expression profiles in response to stimulation to get insights into transcriptional feedback regulation. We found a clear separation of the signalling pathways into flexible and static parts: for each pathway a subgroup of unstable signal inhibitors is transcriptionally induced upon stimulation. while the other constitutively expressed signalling proteins are long‐lived. Kinetic modelling suggests that this design principle allows for swift feedback regulation and establishes latency phases after signalling. and that it might be an optimal design due to a trade‐off between energy efficiency and flexibility.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC,124,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2008.29,9459564797557917752,/scholar?cites=9459564797557917752,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/msb.2008.29,0,0,0

The alternative use of the two promoters leads to an expression range which should make it suitable for the use in control analysis of many enzymes. The lacUV5 promoter should be used when the wild‐type expression level is low. the tacI promoter when the latter is high.

The kinetics of processes and their wiring in molecular networks can modulate this molecular noise. Here we present a theoretical framework to study the principles of noise management by the molecular networks in living cells. The theory makes use of the natural. hierarchical organization of those networks and makes their noise management more understandable in terms of network structure. Principles governing noise management by ultrasensitive systems. signaling cascades. gene networks and feedback circuitry are discovered using this approach. For a few frequently occurring network motifs we show how they manage noise. We derive simple and intuitive equations for noise in molecule copy numbers as a determinant of physiological heterogeneity. We show how noise levels and signal sensitivity can be set independently in molecular networks. but often changes in signal sensitivity affect noise propagation. Using theory and simulations. we show that negative feedback can both enhance and reduce noise. We identify a trade-off; noise reduction in one molecular intermediate by negative feedback is at the expense of increased noise in the levels of other molecules along the feedback loop. The reactants of the processes that are strongly (cooperatively) regulated. so as to allow for negative feedback with a high strength. will display enhanced noise.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,89,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000506,12752789282787601545,/scholar?cites=12752789282787601545,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000506,0,0,0

Moreover. when the same model was later applied to different experimental steady-state conditions. it often exhibited unrestrained metabolite accumulation. Here we resolve this issue by showing that the results of such ab initio modeling are improved substantially by (i) including appropriate allosteric regulation and (ii) measuring the enzyme kinetic parameters under conditions that resemble the intracellular environment. The following modifications proved crucial: (i) implementation of allosteric regulation of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase. (ii) implementation of Vmax values measured under conditions that resembled the yeast cytosol. and (iii) redetermination of the kinetic parameters of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase under physiological conditions. Model predictions and experiments were compared under five different conditions of yeast growth and starvation. When either the original model was used (which lacked important allosteric regulation). or the enzyme parameters were measured under conditions that were. as usual. optimal for high enzyme activity. fructose 1.6-bisphosphate and some other glycolytic intermediates tended to accumulate to unrealistically high concentrations.

Frequency. relative phase. average concentrations and amplitudes of the oscillations were well approximated by writing the two remaining metabolic variables of the core model (representing [ATP] and [hexose]) as harmonic functions of time and by requiring them to fulfill the differential equations.The extent to which an enzyme (-conglomerate) controls the frequency in a sustained oscillation is defined as the log-log derivative of that frequency with respect to enzyme activity.

The dominant form of signal transduction in prokaryotic microorganisms proceeds via so-called two-component regulatory systems. These systems constitute phosphoryl transfer pathways. consisting of two or more components. Most of these pathways are linear. but some converge and some are divergent. The molecular properties of some of the well-characterised representatives of two-component systems comply with the requirements to be put upon the elements of a neural network: they function as logical operators and show the phenomenon of autoamplification. Because there are many phosphoryl transfer pathways in parallel and because there also appears to be cross-talk between these pathways. the total …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,83,https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-abstract/16/4/309/465158,14861305543257335190,/scholar?cites=14861305543257335190,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/207126377.pdf,0,0,0

82335,How to recognize monofunctional units in a metabolic system,1996,Johann M Rohwer and Stefan Schuster and Hans V Westerhoff,179,Journal of Theoretical Biology,3,213-228,Academic Press,In intracellular metabolic networks. it is often useful to discern subsystems (modules) of which the metabolites are only produced or consumed by reactions within that subsystem or by a limited number of fluxes crossing the borders of the subsystem. In many cases such subsystems function as units with respect to their effect on the remainder of the system. In this paper we show that the co-response of two metabolic variables outside that subsystem to a perturbation of a subsystem reaction does not depend on which subsystem reaction is perturbed if three conditions are fulfilled:(1) the reactions outside the subsystem are not affected directly by metabolites belonging to the subsystem;(2) there are no conservation relations linking the subsystem to the rest; and(3) the subsystem is linked to the remainder of the system onlyviaone degree of freedom in fluxes.We propose the name “monofunctional units” for subsystems …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,81,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519396900624,8059033560667790024,/scholar?cites=8059033560667790024,,,0,0,0

After oscillations had damped out macroscopically. a significant fraction of the cells still exhibited oscillatory dynamics. slightly out-of-phase. At cell concentrations higher than 107cells ml-1the dependence upon cell-density of (i) the damping of glycolytic oscillations and (ii) the amplitude per cell suggested that cell-to-cell interaction occurred.

Well-known examples are the DNA–mRNA–enzyme–metabolism cascade and the signal transduction cascades consisting of covalent modification cycles. The reaction network that constitutes each level can be viewed as a “module” in which reactions are linked by mass transfer. Although in principle all of these cellular modules are ultimately linked by mass transfer. in practice they can often be regarded as “isolated” from each other in terms of mass transfer.

This mechanistic derivation provides a framework to assess how accurately frequency–dependent incidence portrays the pair–based transmission known to underlie STD dynamics. This accuracy depends strongly on the disease being studied: frequency–dependent formulations are more suitable for chronic less–transmissible infections than for transient highly transmissible infections.

The notion of organization. as a defining characteristic of life. is fundamental to all levels of the biological hierarchy. The molecular complexity of cellular microenvironments varies with their size and nature. The design of metabolism in terms of such organelles serves as a kind of gross segregation of groups of generally related metabolic processes.

For high sensitivities to arise. not only substrate saturation (zero-order) but also high equilibrium constants and low product saturation are required.

This then spares the limited solvent capacity of the cell. and reduces the loss of pathway flux due to leakage or instability of the free intermediate.

The difficulty of the problem stems from the fact that the synchronization phenomenon involves the entire metabolic network of glycolysis and fermentation. and consequently it cannot be addressed at the level of a single enzyme or a single chemical species. In this paper it is shown how this system in a CSTR (continuous flow stirred tank reactor) can be modelled quantitatively as a population of Stuart–Landau oscillators interacting by exchange of metabolites through the extracellular medium. thus reducing the complexity of the problem without sacrificing the biochemical realism. The parameters of the model can be derived by a systematic expansion from any full-scale model of the yeast cell kinetics with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation.

Through these two routes. PII regulates both amount and activity of glutamine synthetase. GlnK is the recently discovered paralogue of PII. with a similar trimeric x-ray structure.

The control on the flux through a metabolic pathway or subsystem can be quantified by the control coefficients of the individual enzymes or components which reflects the extent to which the component is rate-limiting. The perturbation of an individual step is measured by its elasticity coefficient. The effect of perturbation of a single step on the entire pathway or subsystemis. in turn. measured by the response coefficient.

With respect to the control of periodic phenomena MCA has not been equally successful. This paper shows why in case of autonomous (self-sustained) oscillations for the concentrations and reaction rates. time-dependent control coefficients are not useful to characterize the system:  they are neither constant nor periodic and diverge as time progresses. This is because a controlling parameter tends to change the frequency and causes a phase shift that continuously increases with time.

Using metabolic control analysis. it is possible to identify reaction networks that exhibit temperature compensation. Because most activation enthalpies are positive. temperature compensation of a flux can occur when certain control coefficients are negative.

Glycolytic oscillations were triggered after a pulse of glucose by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with KCN. myxothiazol and antimycin A or in mutants in the bc1 complex (ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase) that were largely deficient in respiratory capacity. Inhibition of the adenine nucleotide translocator by preincubation with bongkrekic acid also triggered a train of damped sinusoidal oscillations after glucose addition.

Evaluation of indicators for BV was carried out by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V5-V7 region. a tailor-made 16S rRNA oligonucleotide-based microarray. and a PCR-based profiling technique termed IS-profiling. which is based on fragment variability of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. An inventory of vaginal bacterial species was obtained from 40 females attending a Dutch sexually transmitted infection outpatient clinic. of which 20 diagnosed with BV (Nugent score 7–10). and 20 BV negative (Nugent score 0–3). Analysis of the bacterial communities by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed two clusters in the BV negative women. dominated by either Lactobacillus iners or Lactobacillus crispatus and three distinct clusters in the BV positive women.

The conversion of glucose into 3-phosphoglycerate takes place in specialized peroxisomes. called glycosomes. Further conversion of this intermediate into pyruvate occurs in the cytosol. Due to this compartmentation. many regulatory mechanisms operating in other cell types cannot work in trypanosomes. This is reflected by the insensitivity of the glycosomal enzymes to compounds that act as activity regulators in other cell types. Several speculations have been raised about the function of compartmentation of glycolysis in trypanosomes.

To examine the role of DNA supercoiling as nucleoid compaction force we modulated the activity of DNA gyrase by electronic. genetic. and chemical means. A model based on physical properties of DNA and other cell components predicts that relaxation of supercoiling expands the nucleoid.

However. when cells depleted their carbon and energy source. the ensuing drop in energy state was accompanied by a strong increase in linking number. This increase was not due to reduced transcription of the DNA in the absence of growth substrate. since rifampin had virtually no effect on the plasmid linking number.

82401,How molecular competition influences fluxes in gene expression networks,2011,Dirk De Vos and Frank J Bruggeman and Hans V Westerhoff and Barbara M Bakker,6,PloS one,12,e28494,Public Library of Science,Often. in living cells different molecular species compete for binding to the same molecular target. Typical examples are the competition of genes for the transcription machinery or the competition of mRNAs for the translation machinery. Here we show that such systems have specific regulatory features and how they can be analysed. We derive a theory for molecular competition in parallel reaction networks. Analytical expressions for the response of network fluxes to changes in the total competitor and common target pools indicate the precise conditions for ultrasensitivity and intuitive rules for competitor strength. The calculations are based on measurable concentrations of the competitor-target complexes. We show that kinetic parameters. which are usually tedious to determine. are not required in the calculations. Given their simplicity. the obtained equations are easily applied to networks of any dimension. The new theory is illustrated for competing sigma factors in bacterial transcription and for a genome-wide network of yeast mRNAs competing for ribosomes. We conclude that molecular competition can drastically influence the network fluxes and lead to negative response coefficients and ultrasensitivity. Competitors that bind a large fraction of the target. like bacterial σ70. tend to influence competing pathways strongly. The less a competitor is saturated by the target. the more sensitive it is to changes in the concentration of the target. as well as to other competitors. As a consequence. most of the mRNAs in yeast turn out to respond ultrasensitively to changes in ribosome concentration.

This has the following implications: (i) the relative contributions of a pathway enzyme to the regulation of the pathway (output) flux and of any flux or concentration outside are identical; therefore. the control analysis of the pathway ‘in isolation’ allows one to determine the control exerted by any pathway enzyme on the rest of the cell by estimation of the control efficient of just one. arbitrarily chosen enzyme; (ii) the relative control of any two metabolic variables outside the pathway (measured as the ratio of the control coefficients over these two variables outside) is the same for all pathway enzymes.

For pharmaceuticals. such effects often emerge unexpectedly in man even when absent from trials in vitro and in animals. Although drugs and xenobiotics act on molecules. it is their perturbation of intracellular networks that matters. The tremendous complexity of these networks makes it difficult to understand the effects of xenobiotics on their ability to function. Because systems biology integrates data concerning molecules and their interactions into an understanding of network behaviour. it should be able to assist toxicology in this respect.

The classical metabolic control analysis (MCA). which quantifies the influence of an individual process on a system variable as the control coefficient. cannot be applied to spatially separated protein networks. The present paper unravels the principles that govern the control over the fluxes and intermediate concentrations in spatially heterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results are two types of control summation theorems. The first type is a non-trivial generalization of the classical theorems to systems with spatially and temporally varying concentrations.

XCI is a stochastic process. in which each X chromosome has a probability to be inactivated. To obtain more insight in the factors setting up this probability. we studied the role of the X to autosome (X∶A) ratio in initiation of XCI. and have used the experimental data in a computer simulation model to study the cellular population dynamics of XCI.  Methodology/Principal Findings To obtain more insight in the role of the X∶A ratio in initiation of XCI. we generated triploid mouse ES cells by fusion of haploid round spermatids with diploid female and male ES cells. These fusion experiments resulted in only XXY triploid ES cells. XYY and XXX ES lines were absent. suggesting cell death related either to insufficient X-chromosomal gene dosage (XYY) or to inheritance of an epigenetically modified X chromosome (XXX). Analysis of active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosomes in the obtained triploid XXY lines indicated that the initiation frequency of XCI is low. resulting in a mixed population of XaXiY and XaXaY cells. in which the XaXiY cells have a small proliferative advantage. This result. and findings on XCI in diploid and tetraploid ES cell lines with different X∶A ratios. provides evidence that the X∶A ratio determines the probability for a given X chromosome to be inactivated. Furthermore. we found that the kinetics of the XCI process can be simulated using a probability for an X chromosome to be inactivated that is proportional to the X∶A ratio.

82434,Dupuytren's: a systems biology disease,2011,Samrina Rehman and Royston Goodacre and Philip J Day and Ardeshir Bayat and Hans V Westerhoff,13,,5,1-12,BioMed Central,Dupuytren's disease (DD) is an ill-defined fibroproliferative disorder of the palm of the hands leading to digital contracture. DD commonly occurs in individuals of northern European extraction. Cellular components and processes associated with DD pathogenesis include altered gene and protein expression of cytokines. growth factors. adhesion molecules. and extracellular matrix components. Histology has shown increased but varying levels of particular types of collagen. myofibroblasts and myoglobin proteins in DD tissue. Free radicals and localised ischaemia have been suggested to trigger the proliferation of DD tissue. Although the existing available biological information on DD may contain potentially valuable (though largely uninterpreted) information. the precise aetiology of DD remains unknown. Systems biology combines mechanistic modelling with quantitative experimentation in studies of networks and better understanding of the interaction of multiple components in disease processes. Adopting systems biology may be the ideal approach for future research in order to improve understanding of complex diseases of multifactorial origin. In this review. we propose that DD is a disease of several networks rather than of a single gene. and show that this accounts for the experimental observations obtained to date from a variety of sources. We outline how DD may be investigated more effectively by employing a systems biology approach that considers the disease network as a whole rather than focusing on any specific single molecule.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC,38,https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar3438,14781131055021393924,/scholar?cites=14781131055021393924,,https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar3438,0,0,0

For a cell of bacterial size. diffusion limitation of glucose influx was negligible. Nevertheless. a significant concentration gradient for one of the enzyme species. nonphosphorylated IIAGlc. was found. This should have consequences because the phosphorylation state of IIAGlc is an important intracellular signal. For mammalian cell sizes we found significant diffusion limitation. as well as strong concentration gradients in many PTS components. and strong effects on glucose and energy signaling.

In this paper. we develop a method to quantify to which extent any enzyme determines the occurrence of oscillations. Principles extrapolated from metabolic control analysis are applied to calculate the control exerted by individual enzymes on the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. We propose that the control exerted by an enzyme on the real part of the smallest eigenvalue. in terms of absolute value. quantifies to which extent that enzyme contributes to the emergence of instability.

Existing drugs either have too many side effects for the patients. or they tend to lose effectiveness due to the development of resistant parasite strains. The difficulty of the development of new antiparasitic compounds lies in the strong biochemical similarity between parasites and their mammalian hosts. A promising approach to tackle this problem is structure-based drug design [1]. This approach is based on the comparison of 3-dimensional structures of the active sites of target enzymes in the parasite and its host and the subsequent design of molecules that bind specifically to the parasite enzyme.

The size and complexity of such networks impose limits on what types of analyses one can perform. Constraint-based modelling overcomes some of these restrictions by using physicochemical constraints to describe the potential behaviour of an organism. FBA (flux balance analysis) highlights flux patterns through a network that serves to achieve a particular objective and requires a minimal amount of data to make quantitative inferences about network behaviour. Even though FBA is a powerful tool for system predictions. its general formulation sometimes results in unrealistic flux patterns.

During nitrogen starvation. unspecific bulk degradation of cytosolic proteins and small organelles (autophagy) occurs. If this is the primary cause of loss of glycolytic capacity. one would expect the cells to regulate their glycolytic capacity through decreasing simultaneously and proportionally the capacities of the enzymes in the first hour of nitrogen starvation.

The aim of systems biology is to understand how functional properties and behavior of living organisms are brought about by the interactions of their constituents. It treats cells as organized. or organizing. molecular systems having both molecular and cellular properties. It is concerned with how life or the functional properties thereof. which are not yet in the molecules. emerge from the particular organization and interactions among its molecular processes. It uses models to describe particular cells. and generalizes over various cell types and organisms to arrive at new theories of cells as molecular systems.

82455,Control of DNA structure and gene expression.,1990,HV Westerhoff and M Van Workum,49,Biomedica biochimica acta,8-9,839-853,,In the usual metabolic control theory. the concentrations of enzymes are considered to be parameters rather than variables. ie. they remain constant as the system relaxes to a new steady state. They can only be reset by interventions. This type of control analysis is useful for understanding principles of metabolic control. and for understanding metabolic changes that are too quick or in too limited a metabolic system to involve changes in gene expression. In actual living systems. metabolic changes are often accompanied by changes in gene expression. In this contribution we shall illustrate how metabolic control analysis is enriched when gene expression is variable. To discuss the new principles emerging in control analysis with variable gene expression. we shall first discuss theoretical model systems. In the first. the number of genes is fixed. but the concentrations of mRNA and enzymes are determined by the activities of RNA polymerase. RNAases. ribosomes and proteases. In a second. there is feedback repression by a metabolite at the level of translation. New coefficients quantifying the strength of regulatory loops will be defined. Also coefficients that indicate to what extent these regulatory strengths themselves are controlled by system parameters. are defined and provided with a summation theorem. The experimental model system we employ. addresses the phenomenon that in prokaryotes. transcription rates are influenced by the extent of supercoiling of the DNA. This includes the transcription of the genes encoding the two enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I) involved in the regulation of DNA supercoiling.

In the present work we developed a mathematical model of coupled functioning of the bc1 complex and ATP producing processes that allows one to obtain the dependence of superoxide production rate on membrane potential (DeltaPsi). Assuming that electron transfer between hemes of cytochrome b is the main electrogenic step of the Q-cycle. we found that rate of superoxide production increased dramatically with increase in DeltaPsi in the range from 170 to 200 mV. This explains experimental observation of a dramatic decrease in the superoxide production with decrease in DeltaPsi in the range from 200 to 170 mV.

The dependence of the electron‐flow rate to oxygen on the fraction of quinol in the Q‐pool was determined in membrane fractions and in intact cells of the wild‐type strain. a bc1‐negative mutant and a quinol oxidase‐negative mutant. Membrane fractions of the bc1‐negative mutant consumed oxygen at significant rates only at much higher extents of Q reduction than did the wild‐type strain or the quinol oxidase‐negative mutant.

In many cases. the concentrations of the intermediates are constrained by moiety conservations. for example those requiring that all intermediate forms of any enzyme sum to the conserved total concentration of that enzyme. In this study. we show how responses to changes in the internal state are related to responses to changes in the total amounts of conserved moieties. The relationship between these two different measures of control leads to a generalisation of the connectivity theorems.

It is still unclear how these metabolic rearrangements. which may involve different molecular events in different cells. contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation. To ascertain which metabolic pathways are used to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced energy and biomass production. we performed systematic constraint-based simulations of a model of human central metabolism. Sampling of the feasible flux space allowed us to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that. in the limited subset of proliferating cells. most displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of glutamine. oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased. while the production of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. Under the latter conditions. standard Flux Balance Analysis indicated that: this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production; it requires the activity of a branched TCA cycle. in which glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of lipids and proteins; it is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic reactions.

As a result of increases in the prevalences of obesity. insulin resistance. and hyperlipidemia. the number of people with hepatic steatosis continues to increase. Differences in susceptibility to steatohepatitis and its progression to cirrhosis have been attributed to a complex interplay of genetic and external factors all addressing the intracellular network. Increase in sugar or refined carbohydrate consumption results in an increase of insulin and insulin resistance that can lead to the accumulation of fat in the liver. Here we demonstrate how a multidisciplinary approach encompassing cellular reprogramming. transcriptomics. proteomics. metabolomics. modeling. network reconstruction and data management can be employed to unveil the mechanisms underlying the progression of steatosis. Proteomics revealed reduced AKT/mTOR signaling in fibroblasts derived from steatosis patients and further establishes that the insulin-resistant phenotype is present not only in insulin-metabolizing central organs. e.g. the liver. but is also manifested in skin fibroblasts. Transcriptome data enabled the generation of a regulatory network based on the transcription factor SREBF1. linked to a metabolic network of glycerolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis including the downstream transcriptional targets of SREBF1 which include LIPIN1 (LPIN) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR).

However. in vivo. this condition is often violated. In the present study. we show that. under conditions of realistic yet high enzyme concentrations. the quasi‐steady‐state approximation may readily be off by more than a factor of four when predicting concentrations. We then present a novel extension of the quasi‐steady‐state approximation based on the zero‐derivative principle. which requires considerably less theoretical work than did previous such extensions. We show that the first‐order zero‐derivative principle. already describes much more accurately the true enzyme dynamics at enzyme concentrations close to the concentration of their substrates.

In this paper we mimicked one aspect of this nonideal behaviour by imposing a low and oscillating extracellular glucose concentration on nonoscillating suspensions of yeast cells. The extracellular dynamics changed the intracellular dynamics – which was monitored through NADH fluorescence – from steady to equally dynamic; the latter followed the extracellular dynamics at the frequency of glucose pulsing. Interestingly. the amplitude of the oscillation of the NADH fluorescence increased with time. This increase in amplitude was sensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis. and was due to a change in the cells rather than in the medium; the cell population was ‘trained’ to respond to the extracellular dynamics.

Soc. Trans,,90-91,,The question of whether the adenine-nucleotide translocator (AT) is rate-limiting in oxidative phosphorylation has led to confusion because of different interpretations of the term ‘rate-limiting’. Higgins (1965) defined the extent to which an enzyme controls the flux through a pathway [its ‘flux Control’(H. V. Westerhoff.

Moreover. the sum of all controls on a metabolic flux equals 1 (Kacser & Burns. 1973; Heinrich & Rapoport. 1974). We experimentally established the distribution of the control on respiration among the different enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Groen el al.. 1982); the flux control exerted by any one enzyme rarely exceeded 50% and the controls depended on the work load imposed on the mitochondria. Kacser & Burns (1973) showed that the distribution of flux controls among enzymes is largely determined by the ratio of their ‘elasticities’. ie by the degrees to which their reactions would be accelerated by increases in the concentrations of,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC,26,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/682b/f1fa09d833575139baa4c2c540e833d9e8f8.pdf,12414429030942110907,/scholar?cites=12414429030942110907,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/682b/f1fa09d833575139baa4c2c540e833d9e8f8.pdf,0,0,0

By using all the known data on hepatocyte mitochondria. we have revealed the correlation between the rate of superoxide generation by the bc1 complex and the transmembrane potential (delta psi). If the main electrogenic stage of the Q cycle is suggested to be the electron transfer between the cytochrome b hemes. then the rate of superoxide generation sharply increases when delta psi grows from 150 mV to 180 mV. However. this interrelation is ambiguous. Indeed. the increase of the generation rate with the growth of the potential can occur faster when succinate dehydrogenase is inhibited by malonate than when external ADP is exhausted. When the potential is changed by adding phosphate or potassium (K+). the rate of O2.-production remains constant. although the comparison of the rate values at the same delta psi reveals the effect of phosphate or potassium. It turned out that the rate of O2.-generation is a function of delta mu H rather than any of its components. Phosphate and K+ have practically no influence on delta mu H. since the change in delta psi is compensated by delta pH. The rate of superoxide generation by the bc1 complex is a multiple function of the electron-transfer activity of enzymes. the processes determining the membrane potential (eg. loading). and of the oxygen concentration. The kinetic model proposed in this work may serve a tool to understand how the superoxide production is regulated.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC,25,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11771135,15329747707727941935,/scholar?cites=15329747707727941935,,,0,0,0

Complete genomes of ‘primitive’living organisms seem to be substantially larger than necessary for metabolism and gene expression alone. This is in line with the findings of silent phenotypes for supposedly important genes. apparent redundancy of functions. and variegated networks of signal transduction and transcription factors. Here we propose that evolutionary optimization has been much more intensive than to lead to the bare minima necessary for autonomous life. Much more complex organisms prevail. Much of this complexity arises in the nonlinear interactions between cellular macromolecules and in subtle differences between paralogs (isoenzymes). The complexity can only be understood when analyzed quantitatively. for which quantitative experimentation is needed in living systems that are as simple and manipulatable as possible. yet complex in the above sense. We illustrate this for the glutamine synthetase cascade in Escherichia coli.

Cells grown on a glass coverslip were loaded with a fluorescent substrate. Thereafter. the coverslip was installed outside the light path in a stirred and thermostated cuvette of a fluorometer.

A metabolic pathway in which two sequential enzymes can form a dynamic complex catalysing the direct transfer of an intermediate is compared with the analogous pathway lacking a channel (an ‘ideal’ pathway). In an ideal pathway a proportional increase in protein content does not result in a change in the steady-state concentration of the bulk-phase intermediate. whereas in a channelling pathway the bulk-phase intermediate either decreases or increases depending on the elemental rate constants within the enzyme mechanisms.

One of these is the increase in 5-oxoproline and ophthalmic acid concentrations with increased dosage of paracetamol. Experimental studies have thus far failed to resolve these paradoxes and the robustness of how these proposed biomarkers correlate with liver glutathione levels has been questioned. To better understand how these biomarkers behave in the glutathione system a kinetic model of this pathway was made.

Understanding the dynamics arising from such a network can be greatly enhanced by the construction of a computational model that embodies the properties of the respective system. Such models aim to incorporate mechanistic details of cellular interactions to mimic the temporal behavior of the biochemical reaction system and usually require substantial knowledge of kinetic parameters to allow meaningful conclusions. Several approaches have been suggested to overcome the severe data requirements of kinetic modeling. including the use of approximative kinetics and Monte-Carlo sampling of reaction parameters. In this work. we employ a probabilistic approach to study the response of a complex metabolic system. the central metabolism of the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis. subject to perturbations and brief periods of starvation. Supplementing existing methodologies. we show that it is possible to acquire a detailed understanding of the control properties of a corresponding metabolic pathway model that is directly based on experimental observations. In particular. we delineate the role of enzymatic regulation to maintain metabolic stability and metabolic recovery after periods of starvation.

Chromatin modifications appear to play a guiding role in protein-complex assembly on chromatin. Together. these processes give rise to stochastic. often bursting. transcriptional activity. Here we present a model of eukaryotic transcription that aims to integrate those mechanisms. We use stochastic and ordinary-differential-equation modeling frameworks to examine various possible mechanisms of gene regulation by multiple transcription factors. We find that the assembly of large transcription factor complexes on chromatin via equilibrium-binding mechanisms is highly inefficient and insensitive to concentration changes of single regulatory proteins. An alternative model that lacks these limitations is a cyclic ratchet mechanism. In this mechanism. small protein complexes assemble sequentially on the promoter. Chromatin modifications mark the completion of a protein complex assembly. and sensitize the local chromatin for the assembly of the next protein complex. In this manner. a strict order of protein complex assemblies is attained. Even though the individual assembly steps are highly stochastic in duration. a sequence of them gives rise to a remarkable precision of the transcription cycle duration. This mechanism explains how transcription activation cycles. lasting for tens of minutes. derive from regulatory proteins residing on chromatin for only tens of seconds. Transcriptional bursts are an inherent feature of such transcription activation cycles. Bursting transcription can cause individual cells to remain in …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC,20,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004236,365283276141701532,/scholar?cites=365283276141701532,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004236,0,0,0

However. the biological adaptations to minimize this risk are poorly understood. Using a computational model based upon realistic kinetic parameters we are able to reproduce the interaction of the stress hormone cortisol with its two nuclear receptors. the high-affinity glucocorticoid receptor and the low-affinity pregnane X-receptor.

One model is representative of near-equilibrium free-energy transducers in general. the other is a special case of far-from-equilibrium free-energy transduction. reminiscent of proton pumping by bacteriorhodopsin. It turns out that the relationship between efficiency and free-energy dissipation depends strongly on what varies. In some cases. free-energy dissipation increases as the efficiency increases. It is suggested that this is one reason why biological evolution has not resulted in high efficiencies and low rates of free-energy dissipation.

Its deletion leads to fully respiratory growth at high glucose concentrations where the wild type ferments profusely. Here we describe that deletion of the HXK2 gene resulted in a 75% reduction in fermentative capacity. Using regulation analysis we found that the fluxes through most glycolytic and fermentative enzymes were regulated cooperatively by changes in their capacities (Vmax) and by changes in the way they interacted with the rest of the metabolism.

Nowadays many components of the system are monitored simultaneously in a search for a correlation with fermentative capacity. However. this strategy has not yet proven fruitful either. Here we investigate an element previously neglected. the glucose transporter. and find that a loss of glucose transport capacity correlates with a decrease of fermentative capacity during nutrient starvation. However the correlation is not unique. suggesting that the loss of fermentative capacity cannot be attributed to an inactivation of glucose transport alone.

82551,Understanding complexity in neurodegenerative diseases: in silico reconstruction of emergence,2012,Alexey Kolodkin and Evangelos Simeonidis and Rudi Balling and Hans Westerhoff,3,Frontiers in physiology,,291,Frontiers,Healthy functioning is an emergent property of the network of interacting biomolecules that comprise an organism. It follows that disease (a network shift that causes malfunction) is also an emergent property. emerging from a perturbation of the network. On one hand. the biomolecular network of every individual is unique and this is evident when similar disease-producing agents cause different individual pathologies. Consequently. a personalized model and approach for every patient may be required for therapies to become effective across mankind. On the other hand. diverse combinations of internal and external perturbation factors may cause a similar shift in network functioning. We offer this as an explanation for the multi-factorial nature of most diseases: they are ‘systems biology diseases’. or ‘network diseases’. Here we focus on neurodegenerative diseases. like Parkinson’s disease. as an example. Because of the inherent complexity of these networks. it is difficult to understand multi-factorial diseases using simply our ‘naked brain’. When describing interactions between biomolecules through mathematical equations and integrating those equations into a mathematical model. we try to reconstruct the emergent properties of the system in silico. The reconstruction of emergence from interactions between huge numbers of macromolecules is one of the aims of systems biology. Systems biology approaches enable us to break through the limitation of the human brain to perceive the extraordinarily large number of interactions. but this also means that we delegate the understanding of reality to the computer.

If performed under conditions that resemble the conditions in vivo. they may also reveal some of the capacities and properties of the same enzymes in vivo; we shall call this the ex vivo approach. The kinetic characterization of purified enzymes has yet a different utility for systems biology. as does the in vivo determination of enzyme activities. All these approaches are different. and it is becoming important that the appropriate approach be used for the intended purpose.

Two important theories are biochemical systems theory developed by Savageau (1969) and metabolic control analysis formulated independently by Kacser & Bums (1973) and Heinrich & Rapoport (1974). Crabtree & Newsholme (1985. 1987) have combined aspects of these two theories in their treatment of control of metabolism. (This theory has been called flux-oriented theory by Savageau and colleagues. for example in Chapters 4 and 5 of this book. but no name is in general use).

UK,The uptake of methyl α‐D‐glucopyranoside by the phosphoenolpyruvate‐dependent phosphotransferase system of Salmonella typhimurium could be inhibited by prior incubation of the cells with glycerol. Inhibition was only observed for glycerol preincubation times longer than 45 s and required the preinduction of both the glucose and the glycerol‐catabolizing systems. Larger extents of inhibition by glycerol correlated with higher intracellular levels of glycerol kinase when the glp regulon had been induced to different extents. Preincubation with lactate did not inhibit methyl α‐D‐glucopyranoside uptake significantly. although both lactate and glycerol were oxidized by the cells.

Particularly. we analyse the approaches for reconstructing the emergent properties of physical or biological systems. We propose approaches to scale emergence according to the degree of state-dependency of the system's component properties. Since the component properties of biological systems are state-dependent to a high extent. biological emergence should be considered as very strong emergence – i.e. its reconstruction would require a lot of information about state-dependency of its component properties. However. due to its complexity and volume. this information cannot be handled in the naked human brain. or on the back of an envelope. To solve this problem. biological emergence can be reconstructed in silico based on experimentally determined rate laws and parameter values of the living cell.According to some rough …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610712001095,11922514668193369105,/scholar?cites=11922514668193369105,,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/1595/1/Kolodkin%20et%20al.%20-%202012%20-%20Computing%20life%20Add%20logos%20to%20biology%20and%20bios%20to%20p.pdf,0,0,0

Given that circadian rhythms profoundly affect the response to a variety of anticancer drugs. circadian chronotherapy is used clinically in cancer treatment. Assessing the relative cytotoxicity of various temporal patterns of administration of anticancer drugs requires a model for the cell cycle. since these drugs often target specific phases of this cycle. Here we use an automaton model to describe the transitions through the successive phases of the cell cycle. The model accounts for the progressive desynchronization of cells due to the variability in duration of the cell cycle phases. and for the entrainment of the cell cycle by the circadian clock. Focusing on the cytotoxic effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). which kills cells exposed to this anticancer drug during the S phase. we compare the effect of continuous …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:MNNNGtAgD4EC,11,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9783527622672#page=293,90866948701929604,/scholar?cites=90866948701929604,,,0,0,0

82601,The energy balance of oxidative phosphorylation,2012,K Van Dam and RP Casey and R Van der Meer and AK Groen and HV Westerhoff,1,Electrons to Tissues V1,,430,Elsevier,Using the principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics. we derived a number of equations describing oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria or gluconeogenesis in whole cells. Al—though these equations give a fair approximation of the rela—tion between reaction rates and reaction affinities (AG). cri—tical tests show that the simple model used is not completely satisfactory. It is concluded that in mitochondria a localized gradient of protons exists near the respiratory-chain plus ATPase complexes. In intact cells a linear relationship exists between oxygen uptake and glucose production. but the slope of the line relating these two parameters is different for different gluconeogenic substrates. This leads to the suggestion that in the cell variable rates of dissipative ATP hydrolysis exist. depending on the available substrate.In recent years renewed interest has arisen in a thermody—namic description of the reactions occurring in cells. In this context. the use of linear irreversible thermodynamics has proven useful to describe oxidative phosphorylation (1. 2). This approach is important. since it allows us to derive quantitative predictions concerning reaction rates and affi—nities. based on different models of energy transduction. Ex—perimental verification of these predictions eventually will make it possible to choose between these models.

Mechanisms for such phenomena may reside at the level of individual proton pumps. or consist of rerouting of electrons over parallel pathways.

Because many amino acid residues in proteins carry a net charge and because the a helix has a net dipole moment. such conformational changes cause interactions between the local electric field and the enzymes catalytic cycle. In this chapter it is demonstrated that this phenomenon has at least three consequences. First. membrane enzymes generate a local “oscillating” electric field around them while turning over. Secondly. an oscillating electric field across a membrane will influence the catalytic activity of membranous enzymes. A third consequence is that two membranous enzymes that are close together may influence each others catalytic activity through Coulombic interaction. The latter influence can include the transmission of free energy. We point out that these theoretical …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC,9,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-1968-7_12,1423599494631679479,/scholar?cites=1423599494631679479,,,0,0,0

Essential for its success is the identification of suitable drug targets. Several recent reports have shown that by using control analysis. one can determine which component of a pathway is in control of its output. However. it has not been analyzed how a mutation in an oncogene affects the extent to which the various components are important. Are the same proteins still important after an oncogene has been activated? In the present study. we show that. upon mutation. oncogenes such as mutant kinases tend to lose part of their control on signaling. On the other hand. some of the nonmutated genes may become more important. when compared to the situation before the mutation.

When the modification and demodification steps are carried out by two independent enzymes. the degree of modification can be ultrasensitive to the total concentration of either catalyst. We recently showed that the degree of modification of a target molecule cannot exhibit ultrasensitivity to the free concentrations of effectors that decide whether a bifunctional enzyme acts as modifier or demodifier.

Using all the known data on hepatocyte mitochondria. we have revealed the correlation between the rate of superoxide generation by the bc 1complex and the transmembrane potential (ΔΨ). Assuming that the main electrogenic stage of the Qcycle is the electron transfer between the cytochrome bhemes. then the rate of superoxide generation sharply increases when ΔΨ grows from 150 to 180 mV. However. this interrelation is ambiguous. Indeed. the increase of the generation rate with the growth of the potential can occur faster when succinate dehydrogenase is inhibited by malonate than when external ADP is exhausted.

The starting point is modular (top-down) metabolic control theory. Slipping enzymes are considered as modules with more than one independent flux. Control by the coupled reaction is distinguished quantitatively from control by the extent of slippage. This is achieved by appropriate linear transformation of fluxes or logarithms thereof. Different transformations are proposed and discussed. Our examples include free-energy transducing proton pumps and the Na+. K+–ATPase.

By contrast. for a group-transfer pathway these methods reveal various modes of the control exerted by an enzyme on the flux and on the concentrations of pathway components. Modulation of gene expression allows one to determine the (classical) control coefficient with respect to the enzyme concentration.

For each histone class the number of mRNA molecules per embryo strongly decreased upon ovulation and steadily increased during early development. with a slight decrease at the neurula stage. Variation of the stringency of hybridization revealed that none of the histone genes probed is specifically and uniquely expressed at any time point in embryogenesis. The observed variation of histone mRNA content with time after fertilization is consistent with what is known about rate constants for RNA synthesis and degradation and about histone mRNA storage in the oocyte. provided that approximately 11 h after fertilization a regulatory transition is proposed (KOSTER. DESTREE and WESTERHOFF (1988) J. Theor. Biol. 135. 139-167). Similarly. the observed amounts of histone mRNA could well be sufficient to direct the synthesis of the required amount of histone protein. Control Analysis reveals that late in development. the histone to DNA ratio is controlled virtually equally strongly by the rate constants of DNA replication. transcription and translation. The control coefficient for RNA degradation is only a little smaller. whereas that for proteolysis is negligible. Indeed. the deceleration of DNA synthesis around the Mid Blastula Transition (some 8 h after fertilization in our studies) is a regulatory step that is essential in order to allow Xenopus to synthesize sufficient histones to structure its DNA; otherwise the embryo would run out of histone protein and histone mRNA soon thereafter.

One may be interested in one or more of these products. in which case it is desirable to formulate the conditions under which the efficiency of transformation of substrates into these products is maximal. To this end. a number of model descriptions of bacterial growth and product formation have been formulated. It is the purpose of this review to consider some general aspects of these models. especially in the light of the boundary conditions that thermodynamic laws impose on the chemical reactions involved.If one surveys what is known about microbial physiology. one almost immediately notices a strong dichotomy. On the one hand. much is known (empirically) about the relationships between growth rate and rate of substrate consumption for different microorganisms growing on various substrates. On the other hand. the biochemistry and molecular biology of the microorganisms are known in considerable detail.

This is inappropriate for characterizing the drug pump. as it depends on the extent of amplification of the latter. The reduced RR (RRR) is newly defined as the ratio of the (RR − 1) for one drug to the (RR – 1) for a different drug.

Biochemical systems are also rich in time scales and thus require sophisticated methods for the numerical solution of the differential equations that describe them. Kinetic modelling of metabolic pathways may be carried out by computer software that simulates the behaviour of a real pathway. Simulation then resembles a true experiment: one sets the initial concentration of the metabolites and the software then produces the time evolution and/or the steady state of these concentrations. There is. however. an additional amount of information to be supplied in the case of simulation: the differential equations describing the kinetics of the pathway and values for all the parameters involved in these equations. There are programs that minimize the mathematical effort of setting up these equations. Advantages of simulation over experiment are:(i) it is much cheaper;(ii) it is faster;(iii) students can investigate extreme conditions that are very hard to achieve in the lab;(iv) simulation programs supply the concentrations of all intermediates and all the fluxes. which are very hard to determine experimentally. especially by undergraduates;(v) unnecessary harm to animals is reduced; and (vi) occasionally. simulations can be done for experiments that are impossible with existing technologies.

The engineering and modelling of such a complex network seem impossible because functioning depends critically on a gamut of data known at patchy accuracy. We developed a way out of this predicament. which employs:(i) a constrained optimization-based technology for the simultaneous fitting of models to heterogeneous experimental data sets gathered through diverse experimental set-ups.(ii) a ‘rubber band method’to deal with different degrees of uncertainty. both in experimentally determined or estimated parameter values and in measured transient or steady-state variables (training data sets).(iii) integration of human expertise to decide on accuracies of both parameters …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:5F1dSjz1ScoC,6,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0091-6,4015736485072287055,/scholar?cites=4015736485072287055,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0091-6,0,0,0
82639,Predictable irreversible switching between acute and chronic inflammation,2018,Abulikemu Abudukelimu and Matteo Barberis and Frank A Redegeld and Nilgun Sahin and Hans V Westerhoff,9,Frontiers in immunology,,1596,Frontiers,Many a disease associates with inflammation. Upon binding of antigen-antibody complexes to immunoglobulin-like receptors. mast cells release TNF-α and proteases. causing fibroblasts to release endogenous antigens that may be cross reactive with exogenous antigens. We made a predictive dynamic map of the corresponding extracellular network. In silico. this map cleared bacterial infections. via acute inflammation. but could also cause chronic inflammation. In the calculations. limited inflammation flipped to strong inflammation when cross-reacting antigen (CRA) exceeded an ‘On threshold’. Subsequent reduction of the antigen load to below this ‘On threshold’ did not remove the strong inflammation phenotype unless the antigen load dropped below a much lower and subtler ‘Off’ threshold. In between both thresholds. the network appeared caught either in a ‘low’ or a ‘high’ inflammatory state. This was not simply a matter of bi-stability however: the transition to the ‘high’ state was temporarily revertible but ultimately irreversible: removing antigen after high exposure reduced the inflammatory phenotype back to ‘low’ levels but if then the antigen dosage was increased only a little. the high inflammation state was already re-attained. This property may explain why the high inflammation state is indeed ‘chronic’. whereas only the naive low-inflammation state is ‘acute’. The model demonstrates that therapies of chronic inflammation such as with anti-IgLC should require fibroblast implantation (or corresponding stem cell activation) for permanence in order to redress the irreversible transition.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:L7vk9XBBNxgC,6,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01596/full,2559200965675496290,/scholar?cites=2559200965675496290,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01596/full,0,0,0

We analyzed resistance phenotypes of various human cell lines in which either one. or both. classical human multidrug resistance genes. MDR1 and MDR3. are overexpressed. In addition. RRR values were calculated for MDR phenotypes presented in the literature.

At first. oxidative phosphorylation was seen as a single process. Then. with the chemical and the chemiosmotic coupling hypotheses. the overall process was split up into clearly distinguishable parts. This reductionism has. in both fields. led to an enormous increase in our understanding. Thus. it is now rather well established that protons play the central role in oxidative and photophosphorylation. 1 Electron transfer chains. bacteriorhodopsin. and the ATP synthase (in this chapter we shall use this term ATPase) can all function as proton pumps. If to exclusively they are denote reconstituted the into F0 the F1. same H+-phospholipid vesicle. oxidative-or photophosphorylation is catalyzed. although it remains unclear whether proteinaceous devices additional to the minimal proton pumps are required. 2 Artificial electrochemical potential differences for protons in these and other more physiological systems can drive ATP synthesis. Increased proton permeability of the energy-coupling membranes uncouples phosphorylation from electron transfer. at least to some extent.As the parts of intermediary metabolism were “solved”. interest shifted back to the whole. It was realized that even if the component parts (each corresponding to an enzyme-catalyzed reaction) behaved as independent units solely connected through the concentration of metabolites. the whole was appreciably more complex than the simplest sum of the parts.

Because for oxygen depletion the distance from the nearest blood vessel to depletion will generally be shorter than for glucose depletion. such tumors will contain anoxic living tumor cells. These cells are dangerous. because they are capable of inducing angiogenesis. which will “wake up” the tumor. Anoxic cells are dependent on anaerobic glucose breakdown for ATP generation. The local extracellular glucose concentration gradient is determined by the blood glucose concentration and by consumption by cells closer to the nearest blood vessel.

Substantial progress came when it was discovered that important metabolic processes. such as fermentation of glucose to lactate by erythrocytes or to ethanol by yeast. consisted of series of apparently independent chemical reactions. The independence of these reactions was established by purifying protein fractions that were each capable of uniquely catalysing one of the reactions. Likewise membrane-dependent biological free-energy transduction was reduced to the action of two proton pumps. i.e. one linked to the electron-transfer chain in the mitochondrial or bacterial inner membrane. the other coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Mitchell. 1979).

Dordrecht, Trypanosoma brucei is the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and the related disease nagana in cattle. The development of drugs is hampered by the many similarities between this parasite and the cells of its host. Until now advanced drug-design strategies have focussed on the differences between the three-dimensional structure of trypanosome and human enzymes (Verlinde & Hol. 1994). We propose that the selectivity of a drug can be further enhanced by choosing a target enzyme with a high flux control coefficient in the parasite and a low flux control coefficient in the host cells. Trypanosome glycolysis is a very suitable model system for this approach. In the mammalian bloodstream T. brucei depends completely on glycolysis (Michels. 1988). In many of its host cells glycolysis is also essential.

With network function as the selectable unit. there has been an evolutionary bonus for recombination of functions of and within proteins. Many proteins house a functionality by which they ‘read’ the cell's state. and one by which they ‘write’ and thereby change that state. Should the writer domain lose its cognate function. a ‘pseudoenzyme’ or ‘pseudosignaler’ arises. GlnK involved in Escherichia coli ammonia assimilation may well be a pseudosignaler. associating ‘reading’ the nitrogen state of the cell to ‘writing’ the ammonium uptake activity.

Some (hyper) thermophilic Archaea contain an enzyme. called non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN). which catalyzes the direct oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate omitting adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) formation by substrate-level-phosphorylation via phosphoglycerate kinase. In this study we formulate three hypotheses that could explain functionally why GAPN exists in these Archaea. and then construct and use mathematical models to test these three hypotheses. We used kinetic parameters of enzymes of Sulfolobus solfataricus (S. solfataricus) which is a thermo-acidophilic archaeon that grows optimally between 60 and 90 C and between pH 2 and 4. For comparison. we used a model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). an organism that can live at moderate temperatures. We find that both the first hypothesis. ie. that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plus phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) route (the alternative to GAPN) is thermodynamically too much uphill and the third hypothesis. ie. that GAPDH plus PGK are required to carry the flux in the gluconeogenic direction. are correct. The second hypothesis. ie. that the GAPDH plus PGK route delivers less than the 1 ATP per pyruvate that is delivered by the GAPN route. is only correct when GAPDH reaction has a high rate and 1. 3-bis-phosphoglycerate (BPG) spontaneously degrades to 3PG at a …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:AFXcoJnoRH0C,4,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/4/876,16113569545422312038,/scholar?cites=16113569545422312038,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/4/876/htm,0,0,0

The extensions include (i) a new theorem that relates the control of metabolite concentrations by enzyme activities to flux ratios at branches in metabolic pathways;(ii) a new theorem that does the same for the control of the distribution of the flux over two branches;(iii) a method that expresses these controls into properties (the so-called elasticity coefficients) of the enzymes in the pathway; and (iv) a theorem that relates the effects of changes in metabolite concentrations on reaction rates to the effects of changes in enzyme properties on the same rates. Matrix equations relating the flux control and concentration control coefficients to the elasticity coefficients of enzymes in simple linear and branched pathways incorporating feedback are given. together with their general solutions and a numerical example.

MA,The question of regulation is invariably a question of sensitivity of a system either to changes in its parameters or to fluctuations of its internal state. To investigate quantitative aspects of the regulation of metabolic systems. here we calculate the time-dependent relaxation of a system challenged with a perturbation of an enzyme activity (a parameter). Second we derive the time-dependent relaxation of the system challenged with the fluctuation of the concentration of an internal metabolite (a variable). We show that the response of a system to a transient fluctuation of a metabolite concentration. can be exactly mimicked by an appropriate perturbation of enzyme rates. This allows us to interpret the different terms of the system’s response to a fluctuation of a metabolite concentration. in terms of additive effects exercised by this metabolite on enzyme rates.

A close study has revealed. however. that living cells have a sophisticated machinery of coupling endergonic to exergonic reactions in such a way that the total process of life plus the coupled changes in its surroundings is always associated with dissipation of free energy. The study of such processes. in which this energetic coupling is of prime importance. is called bioenergetics.

Regrettably. the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. Computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap. by estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways. Yet they currently portray the average behavior of intermixed subpopulations. masking their inherent heterogeneity known to hinder cancer diagnosis and treatment. If complemented with the information on single-cell transcriptome. now enabled by RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). metabolic models of cancer populations are expected to empower the characterization of the mechanisms behind metabolic heterogeneity. To this aim. we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate sc-transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes.We show that the integration of scRNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung ade-nocarcinoma and breast cancer patients. into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of cancer population: 1) significantly reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites.The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA. as well as the case study datasets.chiara.damiani@unimib.it,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:wlzmIqt2EaEC,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/256644v1.abstract,8127586630541921414,/scholar?cites=8127586630541921414,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/30/256644.full.pdf,0,0,0

Consequently. interference between incident and reflected light may occur. This paper calculates the heterogeneity to be expected in the resultant light intensity. The pattern is determined by the wavelength-dependent phase shift of light during scattering. We show that in stroma-membranes this heterogeneity may well be responsible for paradoxical polarities of the photovoltaic effect in which flash illumination of a chloroplast suspension generates a macroscopic electric potential opposite to that expected from shading. The grana-stack dimensions are calculated to lead to the classical picture of shading. consistent with a “normal” photovoltaic effect.

MA,Metabolic control analysis (for review see Ref. 1) allows insight in the control properties of complicated enzymatic pathways. It also attempts to clarify the regulatory processes that keep these pathways at their desired operation point2.3. It is based on the concept that enzymes show elasticity for the various metabolites in a pathway. or. from another point of view. that metabolites show regulability for the various enzymes. which is expressed in terms of elasticity coefficients. Elasticity is inversely related with the enzymatic control of maintaining the steady state as well as of keeping the concentration of the metabolites constant. The result of this internal control is that any intrusion into either steady state or metabolite concentration is nullified. so. that the uniqueness of steady states is conserved.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC,3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2962-0_40,9982805771233426167,/scholar?cites=9982805771233426167,,,0,0,0

Maxwell (1871) pointed out that a “being” that could deal with individual molecules. when positioned at a trap door between two compartments at different temperatures. might open the door whenever a molecule with much higher than average kinetic energy would approach from the cold compartment. and whenever a kinetically “cold” molecule would approach from the “hot” compartment (see also Brush. 1976). Consequently. such a “Maxwell’s demon” would cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot compartment and violate the second law.

The observed fluorescence transients can be simulated by appropriate equations accounting for NAD (P) reduction-reoxidation. with NAD (P) as rate-limiting or not. From the above. the rate constants K1 and K2 of NAD (P) reduction and reoxidation can be determined. Other useful parameters in the metabolic evaluation of different cell lines. comprising normal and transformed fibroblasts. glia-glioma. melanoma lines. and a mouse embryo clone. can be derived from the relationship between injected dose of substrate and rise or decay rates of NAD (P) in equilibrium or formed from NAD (P) H transients. Reoxidation of NAD (P) H seems to be a useful target for such studies in view of possible impairment in malignant cells and X-irradiated cells.

However. it is certainly determined by both genetics and an environmental-specific context. The interactions between them lead to profound metabolic specialization. such as consuming glucose and glutamine and producing lactate at prodigious rates. To investigate whether and how glucose and glutamine availability impact metabolic specialization. we integrated computational modeling on the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction with an experimental study on cell lines. We used the most comprehensive human metabolic network model to date. Recon3D. to build cell line-specific models. RNA-Seq data was used to specify the activity of genes in each cell line and the uptake rates were quantitatively constrained according to nutrient availability. To integrated both constraints we applied a novel method. named GENSI (Gene Expression and Nutrients Simultaneous Integration). that translates the relative importance of gene expression and nutrient availability data into the metabolic fluxes based on an observed experimental feature(s). We applied GENSI to study hepatocellular carcinoma addiction to glucose/glutamine. We were able to identify that proliferation. and lactate production is associated with the presence of glucose but does not necessarily increase with its concentration when the latter exceeds the physiological concentration.

No longer can the failure of a model to explain experimental data be attributed to the interference of as yet unknown factors. Any such factor can become known given sufficient experimental effort. In addition. the concentrations of the transcripts of all the genes. of all proteins and soon of a number of organisms can now be measured. This brings cell biology irreversibly into the realm of the physical chemical sciences. where models and hypotheses are scrutinized for consistency with all known principles and experimental data. and then tested by specially designed critical experiments. Does this mean that biology has become a branch of physics (and chemistry)? As functional genomics unfolds. it becomes clearer and clearer that it has not and will not. At least not when ‘physics’ and ‘chemistry’are taken to refer to the archetypical sciences that were so successful in the last century. Physics and chemistry were successful in the selection or dissection of their objects of study. They only considered small. more or less autonomous parts. which were then studied independently. For quite a while (molecular) biology followed suit. also dissecting and then characterizing and understanding the individual macromolecules of living cells in isolation.

For a cell of bacterial size. diffusion limitation of glucose influx was negligible. Nevertheless. a significant concentration gradient for one of the enzyme species. nonphosphorylated IIA Glc. was found. This should have consequences because the phosphorylation state of IIA Glc is an important intracellular signal. For mammalian cell sizes we found significant diffusion limitation. as well as strong concentration gradients in many PTS components. and strong effects on glucose and energy signaling. We calculated that the PTS may sense both extracellular glucose and the intracellular free-energy state. We discuss i). that the effects of diffusion on cell function should prevent this highly effective bacterial system from functioning in eukaryotic cells. ii). that in the larger eukaryotic cell any similar chain of mobile group-transfer proteins can neither sustain the same volumetric flux as in bacteria nor transmit a signal far into the cell. and iii). that systems such as these may exhibit spatial differentiation in their sensitivity to different signals.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC,2,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.75.4685,13811577799315491763,/scholar?cites=13811577799315491763,,,0,0,0

The information explosion is excessive: there are more than 50 000 such processes in a single human being. and these can be compared to similar and other processes in more than 100 other systems that are capable of living and of which the genome sequence is known. However. the new information itself is ‘dead’. Proteins neither assume a linear conformation. nor a single alpha helical structure. Their catalytic properties depend on their three dimensional structure. The latter is partly defined by the primary structure. but the relation between the two types of structure is so complex that the catalytic properties cannot be calculated ab initio from the amino-acid sequence. Presently 3-D structure prediction of proteins focuses on homologies with known structures. Moreover. the functioning of the enzymes in the living cell depends less on their precise 3-D structure than on their kinetic properties. such as KM and Kd. and we are far from calculating these ab initio. In addition. the route to the living cell runs through metabolic pathways. which are subject to hierarchi-,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C,2,http://academic.sun.ac.za/bio_chem/btk/book/Westerhoff.pdf,16770895391990532761,/scholar?cites=16770895391990532761,,http://academic.sun.ac.za/bio_chem/btk/book/Westerhoff.pdf,0,0,0

These are here referred to as homeostatic control mechanisms. After a change in environmental conditions a cell adjusts to return as closely as possible to its previous state. Interestingly. these control mechanisms also function after perturbations of the cellular state itself. Apparently this type of regulatory mechanism is not so much addressed from the extracellular as it is from the intracellular environment. a topic dealt with in this volume in Chapter 26. Although the homeostatic control mechan-isms are by definition beneficial to the biological system. they can be a nuisance when trying to engineer it. Attempts to manipulate the system tend to be largely overruled by subsequent adaptation. Part of such homeostatic control mechanisms is embedded in the nature of the kinetics of the catalytic steps in the system. On activation of such a step the product of the reaction will increase initially but this increase will lead to both an inhibition of the stimulated step and an activation of the subsequent step in the pathway. In this way. both enzymes surrounding the intermediate will tend to keep the concentration of the latter constant. In addition. the concentrations of the enzymes can also be subject to regulation via variable gene expression. We here aim at unravelling the importance of these two regulatory loops in a model system for homeostatic control.

The complexity emerges in the nonlinear interactions of its many components. These interactions occur at the level of enzyme activities (eg. through substrates. products or allosteric regulators). as well as gene expression (involving transcription. translation and degradation of RNA and protein). The latter confer a degree of plasticity to biological systems that is unprecedented by dead systems. Homeostatic control is just a weak example. Some homeostatic control arises already in the kinetics of catalytic steps. The increase in product concentration will inhibit the stimulated step and activate the subsequent step in the pathway. poising the concentration of the product towards constancy. we refer to this as the metabolic part of homeostasis. Also the concentrations of the enzymes can be maintained homeostatically. ie. through regulation of gene expression. which is the other part of homeostasis that we distinguish here.Both types of homeostatic regulation are present in biological systems. However. most scientists focus on either the one (‘metabolic control analysis’) or the other (‘molecular biology’).

The major end product of fermentation is lactate (> 95%). Various other end products are important for the flavour (eg. diacetyl). but are only produced in minute amounts. Some applications require a considerably higher production of these minor products. Metabolic engineering is employed to divert the flux from lactate to these other end-products. For efficient metabolic engineering a thorough understanding of the metabolism is essential. More advanced is the construction of a kinetic model that can be used in combination with metabolic control analysis (MCA) to determine the most cost effective way to engineer the metabolic fluxes.

82756,24 Is the signal transduction network emanating from the EGF receptor bistable in vivo?,2000,FJ Bruggeman and FC Boogerd and JJ Hornberg and J Lankelma and OJG Somsen and HV Westerhoff,,,,,,Complexity abounds in cell biology. For instance it shows up in the number and the organization of eucaryotic signal transduction pathways. So far as many as eleven MAP kinase family members have been identified in mammalian cells. They constitute different groups of kinases that are involved in different signal transducing pathways [1]. These signal transduction pathways provide the cell with a structured informational processing machinery processing multiple signals at the same time. The result is an integrated adaptive response of the cell towards the signals mediated by activation of a diverse range of transcription factors. Due to non-linearity prevailing in the kinetics of signal transduction pathways. various emergent properties might arise. One is the ultrasensitivity of the phosphorylated enzyme concentration towards the concentration of the signal. implying the existence of a threshold response below which the system does not respond [2]. The extent of ultrasensitivity can be quantified using the concentration response coefficient of the phosphorylated enzyme with respect to its signal. complying with metabolic control analysis [3. 4]. Another interesting emergent property is the possible existence of two steady states a phenomenon known as bistability [5. 6. 7].Bistability in signal transduction networks results in two attainable stable steady states characterized by different active regulatory protein concentrations. This may invoke different physiological states or cellular differentiation [7]. The steady state the system will ultimately evolve to depends upon the history of the system. eg. on its initial conditions.

82776,Energy Transduction by Electroconformational Coupling,1988,R Dean Astumian and P Boon Chock and Hans V Westerhoff and TY Tsong,,,,247-260,Springer. New York. NY,Free energy transduction is a fundamental biological process. Virtually everything an organism does involves converting energy from one form to another. and a function of many enzymes is the channeling of free energy through metabolic pathways in which it can be used to do work. The mechanism by which diverse chemical reactions are coupled into driving energy-requiring processes remains the topic of active and lively discussion. Bearing on this problem is the observation that application of an oscillating electric field (≈1 kHz) to a suspension of erythrocytes induced the Na+ .K+ -ATPase to mediate active transport of Rb+ without detectable hydrolysis of ATP (1. 2). although the time average of the field was zero. This phenomenon was explained theoretically by Tsong and Astumian (3). who showed that an enzyme catalytic cycle that includes an electrically sensitive step can transduce energy from an …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-3744-0_30,3698716583854356822,/scholar?cites=3698716583854356822,,,0,0,0

Motivation is the observation. both in silico and in experiments. that this therapy is not robust. Our modelling results demonstrate how (i) the biological phenomena of acute and chronic modes of inflammation may reflect an inherently complex bi-stability with an irrevertible flip between the two modes. (ii) the chronic mode of the model has stable. sometimes unique. steady states. whilst its acute-mode steady states are stable but not unique. (iii) as witnessed by TNF levels. acute inflammation is controlled by multiple processes whereas its chronic-mode inflammation is only controlled by TNF synthesis and washout. (iv) only when the antigen load is close to the acute mode’s flipping point. many processes impact very strongly on cells and cytokines. (v) there is no antigen exposure level below which reduction of the antigen load alone initiates a flip back to the acute mode. (vi) adding healthy fibroblasts makes the transition from acute to chronic inflammation revertible. although (viii) there is a window of antigen load where such a therapy cannot be effective. This suggests that triple therapies may be essential to overcome chronic inflammation. These may comprise (i) anti Immunoglobulin-Light-Chain peptides.

However. within a population of isogenic cells of the same identity. a substantial variability in gene expression and responsiveness is still observed. Transcription bursting is a substantial source of this gene-expression variability or 9noise9. contributing to phenotypic heterogeneity and potentially driving both physiological and pathological processes such as differentiation or tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Identification of transcription-bursting dynamics at a genome-wide scale has been restricted to inferring bursts in mRNA production computationally from the heterogeneity of mRNA levels in single cell transcriptomic data. Systematic characterisation of the genomic and epigenetic chromatin context of genes with defined transcription bursting behaviour has been incomplete. Here. we measured the bursting of transcription itself by genome-wide nascent RNA sequencing of breast cancer MCF-7 cells upon synchronisation of transcription with a transcription elongation inhibitor and by calibration using live cell imaging of nascent PP7-tagged GREB1 transcription. Comparing across the entire genome. we find transcription bursting to be ubiquitous. with burst sizes of up to 160 transcripts. Transcription bursting attributes ~85% to a trend in the variation in steady state gene expression between genes. whereas both burst frequency and nascent transcript degradation attribute minimally. Individual genes deviate strongly from this trend and engage both in anomalous burst size and frequency. We find that the presence of the TATA box or Inr sequence within gene promoters …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:Lo8V22OuN40C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.23.424175v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/12/24/2020.12.23.424175.full.pdf,0,0,0

In Bangladesh the problem extends to rural drinking water wells. where non-biological solutions are not feasible. In serial enrichment cultures of water from various Bangladesh drinking water wells. we found transfer-persistent arsenite oxidation activity under four conditions (aerobic/anaerobic; heterotrophic/autotrophic). This suggests that biological decontamination may help ameliorate the problem. The enriched microbial communities were phylogenetically at least as diverse as the unenriched communities: they contained a bonanza of 16S rRNA gene sequences. These related to Hydrogenophaga. Acinetobacter. Dechloromonas. Comamonas. and Rhizobium/Agrobacterium species. In addition. the enriched microbiomes contained genes highly similar to the arsenite oxidase (aioA) gene of chemolithoautotrophic (eg. Paracoccus sp. SY) and heterotrophic arsenite-oxidizing strains. The enriched cultures also contained aioA phylotypes not detected in the previous survey of uncultivated samples from the same wells. Anaerobic enrichments disclosed a wider diversity of arsenite oxidizing aioA phylotypes than did aerobic enrichments. The cultivatable chemolithoautotrophic and heterotrophic arsenite oxidizers are of great interest for future in or ex-situ arsenic bioremediation technologies for the detoxification of drinking water by oxidizing arsenite to arsenate that should then precipitates with iron oxides. The microbial activities required for such a technology seem present. amplifiable. diverse and hence robust.

To understand the mechanisms underlying the Warburg effect in hepatocellular carcinoma and to investigate whether and how both the essential nutrient concentrations and the cells’ gene expression. impact on this metabolic alteration. we integrated computational genome-wide metabolic modeling with an experimental study on cell lines. We converted transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) data from two hepatocellular carcinoma lines HuH7 and PLC/PRF/5 to flux bounds in the most comprehensive human metabolic network model to date.

Ltd,To understand the functioning of living cells. it is often helpful or even necessary to exploit inherent timescale disparities and focus on long‐term dynamic behaviour. In the present study. we explore this type of behaviour for the biochemical network of the phosphotransferase system. We show that. during the slow phase that follows a fast initial transient. the network reaction rates are partitioned into clusters corresponding to connected parts of the reaction network. Rates within any of these clusters assume essentially the same value: differences within each cluster are vastly smaller than that from one cluster to another. This rate clustering induces an analogous clustering of the reactive compounds: only the molecular concentrations on the interface between these clusters are produced and consumed at substantially different rates and hence change considerably during the slow phase.

For pharmaceuticals. such effects often emerge unexpectedly in man even when absent from trials in vitro and in animals. Although drugs and xenobiotics act on molecules. it is their perturbation of intracellular networks that matters. The tremendous complexity of these networks makes it difficult to understand the effects of xenobiotics on their ability to function. Because systems biology integrates data concerning molecules and their interactions into an understanding of network behaviour. it should be able to assist toxicology in this respect. This review identifies how in silico systems biology tools. such as kinetic modelling. and metabolic control. robustness and flux analyse. may indeed help understanding network-mediated toxicity. It also shows how these approaches function by implementing them vis-a-vis the glutathione network. which is important for the detoxification of reactive drug metabolites. The tools enable the appreciation of the steady state concept for the detoxification network and make it possible to simulate and then understand effects of perturbations of the macromolecules in the pathway that are counterintuitive.

In studying genome-scale metabolic networks. the task of exhaustively assaying and measuring all reaction components can be daunting. because hundreds or even thousands of enzymes (activities and concentrations) need to be considered for the construction of a full-scale. detailed model. There is a clear need for strategies that allow us to systematically select the subsets of pathways and reactions which should be prioritized when studying metabolism. We present a methodology for selecting those reactions that carry the overwhelming majority of the carbon flux through the metabolic network. The recent community-driven reconstruction of the metabolic network of baker’s yeast [1] provides the basis for our analysis. Flux Balance Analysis provides a theoretical flux distribution. Results are constrained with GC-MS exometabolomic measurements of the carbon flux. Flux calculations can also be improved by using 13C measurements to determine intracellular metabolic fluxes. The solution of the constrained FBA problem gives us a ranked list of reactions. based on the amount of carbon flux through each reaction. We improve the specificity of the method further by performing an Elementary Flux Mode analysis. which provides us with target pathways consisting of the reactions that carry the most carbon flux.

82828,Recommendations for Terminology and Databases for Biochemical Thermodynamics,2011,A Cornish-Bowden and RN Goldberg and GG Hammes and K Tipton and HV Westerhoff and Robert A Alberty and Athel Cornish Bowden and Robert N Goldberg and Gordon G Hammes and Keith Tipton,,,,,,Chemical equations are normally written in terms of specific ionic and elemental species and balance atoms of elements and electric charge. However. in a biochemical context it is usually better to write them with ionic reactants expressed as totals of species in equilibrium with each other. This implies that atoms of elements assumed to be at fixed concentrations. such as hydrogen at a specified pH. should not be balanced in a biochemical equation used for thermodynamic analysis. However. both kinds of equations are needed in biochemistry. The apparent equilibrium constant K′ for a biochemical reaction is written in terms of such sums of species and can be used to calculate standard transformed Gibbs energies of reaction∆ rG′ o. This property for a biochemical reaction can be calculated from the standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation∆ fGi′ of reactants. which can be calculated from the standard Gibbs energies of formation of species∆ fGj and measured apparent equilibrium constants of enzymecatalyzed reactions. Tables of∆ rG′ o of reactions and∆ fGi′ o of reactants as functions of pH and temperature are available on the web. as are functions for calculating these properties. Biochemical thermodynamics is also important in enzyme kinetics because apparent equilibrium constants K′ can be calculated from experimentally determined kinetic parameters when initial velocities have been determined for both forward and reverse reactions.

Such signalling networks must be able to both respond to external stimuli and to maintain homeostatic levels of endogenous messengers. To achieve this. a regulatory signal network controls two important aspects of the overall response; first. the physiological response to stimulation. such as increased glucose mobilisation from the liver as part of the fight or flight response; second. a catabolic response that returns glucocorticoid levels to within normal bounds. ensuring homeostasis and terminating the physiological response. Such signalling involves the nuclear receptors. a family of ligand-activated transcription factors that control expression of target gene sets involved in both the physiological and catabolic response to stimuli [1]. using a series of feedforward and feedback loops to coordinate responses [2. 3]. To examine the design principles underlying the performance of this regulatory signal network we have reconstructed the cellular response to glucocorticoid signalling. creating a realistic kinetic model based upon systems biological graphical notation. We demonstrate the utility of both feed-forward and feed-back signals in coordinating the physiological and metabolic responses to stimuli. In addition. we demonstrate that the network is robust to low and medium frequency perturbations. but once the stimulation frequency approaches once per hour. the system is unable to revert to baseline and permanently enhanced physiological responses are …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C,0,https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/2394/1/A%20systems%20aproach.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

However. multiple sources of data in diverse forms are required in the construction of a model in order to define its components and their biochemical reactions. and corresponding parameters. Automating the assembly and use of systems biology models is dependent upon data integration processes involving the interoperation of data and analytical resources.Results: Taverna workflows have been developed for the automated assembly of quantitative parameterised metabolic networks in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). A SBML model is built in a systematic fashion by the workflows which starts with the construction of a qualitative network using data from a MIRIAM-compliant genome-scale model of yeast metabolism. This is followed by parameterisation of the SBML model with experimental data from two repositories. the SABIO-RK enzyme kinetics database and a database of quantitative experimental results. The models are then calibrated and simulated in workflows that call out to COPASIWS. the web service interface to the COPASI software application for analysing biochemical networks. These systems biology workflows were evaluated for their ability to construct a parameterised model of yeast glycolysis. Conclusions: Distributed information about metabolic reactions that have been described to MIRIAM standards enables the automated assembly of quantitative systems biology models of metabolic networks based on userdefined criteria.

82839,Nuclear receptors as controlling factors in chemical metabolism: Determination of regulatory signal network crucial for co-ordinating cellular response to chemicals,2010,Alexey Kolodkin and Anna Phillips and Steve R Hood and Hans V Westerhoff and Frank Bruggeman and Nick J Plant,42,,1,279-280,Taylor & Francis,The body is exposed to a wide range of external chemicals. both deliberately (eg medicines) and accidently (eg environmental contaminants). In addition. the body contains a large number of endogenous chemicals whose levels alter around a physiological mean: This may be as a result of circadian rhythms. normo-or pathophysiological processes. The body responds to changes in these chemical levels by altering flux through metabolic pathways. ensuring healthy physiology. Proteins involved in this biological response include active transport pumps. plus Phase I and Phase II metabolic enzymes. which together act to reduce the level of stimulating chemical through active efflux and metabolism respectively. The expression of many drug metabolising enzymes and drug transport proteins are under control of members of the nuclear receptor superfamily 1. These ligand-activated transcription factors include members who predominantly regulate endogenous functions. including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). the progesterone receptor (PR) and the androgen receptor (AR). and those that act as sensors for external chemical challenge. such as the pregnane X-receptor (PXR) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). However. it is becoming increasingly clear that these nuclear receptors do not function in isolation. but contribute towards a complex regulatory signal network. which allows the control of overlapping target gene sets and the refinement of biological response (s) to individual chemical challenges.

XCI is a stochastic process. in which each X chromosome has a probability to be inactivated. To obtain more insight in the factors setting up this probability. we studied the role of the X to autosome (X: A) ratio in initiation of XCI. and have used the experimental data in a computer simulation model to study the cellular population dynamics of XCI.Methodology/Principal Findings: To obtain more insight in the role of the X: A ratio in initiation of XCI. we generated triploid mouse ES cells by fusion of haploid round spermatids with diploid female and male ES cells. These fusion experiments resulted in only XXY triploid ES cells. XYY and XXX ES lines were absent. suggesting cell death related either to insufficient X-chromosomal gene dosage (XYY) or to inheritance of an epigenetically modified X chromosome (XXX). Analysis of active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosomes in the obtained triploid XXY lines indicated that the initiation frequency of XCI is low. resulting in a mixed population of XaXiY and XaXaY cells. in which the XaXiY cells have a small proliferative advantage. This result. and findings on XCI in diploid and tetraploid ES cell lines with different X: A ratios. provides evidence that the X: A ratio determines the probability for a given X chromosome to be inactivated. Furthermore. we found that the kinetics of the XCI process can be simulated using a probability for an X chromosome to be inactivated that is proportional to the X: A ratio.

Regulation Analysis has shown that regulation is distributed between the gene-expression cascade and metabolism and how this distribution can be quantified [1]. Even within the gene-expression cascade regulation is distributed with regulation taking place not only at transcription. but also at mRNA processing and stability and protein synthesis. modification and breakdown [2. 3]. These new insights should have their impact on systems-based identification of drug targets. Awareness is growing that drug-target validation should involve system analysis of cellular networks.

Plasmamembrane glucose transport exerts a high control over trypanosome glycolysis and hence is a promising drug target. We show that inhibition of trypanosome glucose transport initiates a domino effect in which network adaptations enhance the primary inhibition via (i) metabolic control.(ii) downregulation of the expression of the primary target and its pathway and (iii) expression of an insect-stage coat protein that should be immunogenic in humans.

In vivo. however. these cellular sub-systems are highly integrated to form the complete living organism such as a yeast cell. The ultimate aim of systems biology must be to produce fully integrated kinetic models at the level of the whole organism–eg the ‘virtual human’.As a first step along this path we have developed a dynamic model for yeast built from key modules (Figure 1).

The control on the ﬂux through a metabolic pathway or subsystem can be quantiﬁed by the control coefﬁcients of the individual enzymes or components which reﬂects the extent to which the component is rate-limiting. The perturbation of an individual step is measured by its elasticity coefﬁcient. The effect of perturbation of a single step on the entire pathway or subsystem is. in turn. measured by the response coefﬁcient. Differential control analysis can be used to compare ﬂux through a single metabolic pathway in a pathogen with the same pathway in its host to identify uniquely vulnerable steps with the greatest potential for speciﬁcally inhibiting ﬂux through the pathogen metabolic pathway. The utility of this methodology is illustrated with the glycolysis in Trypanosomes and with oncogenic signaling.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BfSO_PDrTX0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA172&dq=info:qCmbEr8cOycJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9Hf7GEdZn1&sig=2zoYa10CewxBvb2Mq-s-L84F_UI,,,,,0,0,0

Its deletion leads to fully respiratory growth at high glucose concentrations where the wild type ferments profusely. Here we describe that deletion of the HXK2 gene resulted in a 75% reduction in fermentative capacity. Using regulation analysis we found that the fluxes through most glycolytic and fermentative enzymes were regulated cooperatively by changes in their capacities (Vmax) and by changes in the way they interacted with the rest of the metabolism. Glucose transport and phosphofructokinase were regulated purely at the metabolic level. The reduction of fermentative capacity in the mutant was accompanied by a remarkable resilience of the remaining capacity to nutrient starvation. After starvation. the fermentative capacity of the hxk2A mutant was similar to that of the wild type. Based on our results and previous reports. we suggest an inverse correlation between glucose repression and the resilience of fermentative capacity towards nutrient starvation. Only a limited number of glycolytic enzyme activities changed upon starvation of the hxk2A mutant and we discuss to what extent this could explain the stability of the fermentative capacity.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:uPCvBZYD9qUC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/46481914/Mixed_and_diverse_metabolic_and_gene-exp20160614-31267-74tdbi.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46481914/Mixed_and_diverse_metabolic_and_gene-exp20160614-31267-74tdbi.pdf,0,0,0

In the present study. a method is developed to dissect the hierarchical regulation into contributions by transcription. translation. protein degradation. and posttranslational modification. The method was applied to the regulation of fluxes through individual glycolytic enzymes when the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was confronted with the absence of oxygen and the presence of benzoic acid depleting its ATP. Metabolic regulation largely contributed to the10-fold change in flux through the glycolytic enzymes. This contribution varied from 50 to 80%. depending on the glycolytic step and the cultivation condition tested. Within the 50–20% hierarchical regulation of fluxes. transcription played a minor role. whereas regulation of protein synthesis or degradation was the most important. These also contributed to 75–100% of the regulation of protein levels.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:cOfwuRB03ygC,0,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:87ac7063-88c8-4c8e-be69-a54505eb3678,,,,,0,0,0

SB is also an approach to explaining. predicting and controlling the complex cellular and physiological phenomena of living organisms in terms of the underlying chemical and physical processes and the involved feedback regulations on many different time and space scales. A systems approach requires the formation of EU-wide teams to mine and model the wide range and amounts of biological data coming from new technologies. both from high throughput and from detailed quantitative observations. and to direct the design of experiments. The approach is characterised by the use of mathematical modelling and modern simulation and data handling techniques to complement the present strongly empirical approach in the biological sciences. Furthermore. much of current research to combat complex diseases is characterised by very heterogeneous and fragmented efforts. which constitute a major drawback.

They consist of a linear cascade of three kinases that each phosphorylate and thereby activate the next one in line. The kinase reactions are counteracted by phosphatases that dephosphorylate their phosphorylated substrate kinases. The net activity of the pathway is thus a result of the combined action of all kinases and phosphatases. Whether the duration of ERK activation is transient or sustained is important for the outcome of signaling. for instance by influencing different sets of target genes. In human tumors. the MAPK cascade that involves the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 is frequently activated constitutively.

As such. skeletal muscle function can be described using engineering concepts as a chemo-mechano transducer (Fig. 1). The molecular machinery in-volved in this conversion consists. amongst others. of filaments of actin and the motor protein myosin ATPase. and the calcium (Ca2+)-activated switch protein troponin [1]. The non-equilibrium cytosolic ATP/ADP concentration potential is thermodynamically buffered by the cellular pool of mitochondria via oxidative ADP phosphorylation. Kinetically. this cytosolic potential is buffered on a fast (i.e. (sub)second) time scale by creatine kinase (CK) and glycolysis. and on a slow (i.e. minutes) timescale by oxidative phosphorylation [2].

For a cell of bacterial size. diffusion limitation of glucose influx was negligible. Nevertheless. a significant concentration gradient for one of the enzyme species. nonphosphorylated IIAGlc. was found. This should have consequences because the phosphorylation state of IIAGlc is an important intracellular signal. For mammalian cell sizes we found significant diffusion limitation. as well as strong concentration gradients in many PTS components. and strong effects on glucose and energy signaling. We calculated that the PTS may sense both extracellular glucose and the intracellular free-energy state. We discuss i). that the effects of diffusion on cell function should prevent this highly effective bacterial system from functioning in eukaryotic cells. ii). that in the larger eukaryotic cell any similar chain of mobile group-transfer proteins can neither sustain the same volumetric flux as in bacteria nor transmit a signal far into the cell. and iii). that systems such as these may exhibit spatial differentiation in their sensitivity to different signals.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:DPO9WFcz7UcC,0,https://research.vu.nl/files/1903939/PMC1303116.pdf,,,,https://research.vu.nl/files/1903939/PMC1303116.pdf,0,0,0

82882,Control of spatially heterogeneous and time-varying cellular reaction networks: A new summation law,2002,Mark A Peletier and Hans V Westerhoff and Boris N Kholodenko,,arXiv preprint math/0211111,,,,A hallmark of a plethora of intracellular signaling pathways is the spatial separation of activation and deactivation processes that potentially results in precipitous gradients of activated proteins. The classical Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA). which quantifies the influence of an individual process on a system variable as the control coefficient. cannot be applied to spatially separated protein networks. The present paper unravels the principles that govern the control over the fluxes and intermediate concentrations in spatially heterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results are two types of the control summation theorems. The first type is a non-trivial generalization of the classical theorems to systems with spatially and temporally varying concentrations. In this generalization. the process of diffusion. which enters as the result of spatial concentration gradients. plays a role similar to other processes such as chemical reactions and membrane transport. The second summation theorem is completely novel. It states that the control by the membrane transport. the diffusion control coefficient multiplied by two. and a newly introduced control coefficient associated with changes in the spatial size of a system (eg. cell). all add up to one and zero for the control over flux and concentration. Using a simple example of a kinase/phosphatase system in a spherical cell. we speculate that unless active mechanisms of intracellular transport are involved. the threshold cell size is limited by the diffusion control. when it is beginning to exceed the spatial control coefficient significantly.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:e3CVSTJ63dQC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0211111,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0211111,0,0,0

At a very early stage the observed bulk oscillations were interpreted as the result of phase-synchronized oscillations of each individual cell. Phase coherence of independent oscillators will not persist unless the fundamental frequencies are equal. Obviously. the yeast cells are not identical. For example. variations in size and shape are easily,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:LlXTz_FrCmAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7045156249032663235&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
82886,VU Research Portal,2002,CA Reijenga and HV Westerhoff and BN Kholodenko and JL Snoep,82,Biophysical Journal,,99-108,,It has hitherto not been possible to analyze the control of oscillatory dynamic cellular processes in other than qualitative ways. The control coefficients. used in metabolic control analyses of steady states. cannot be applied directly to dynamic systems. We here illustrate a way out of this limitation that uses Fourier transforms to convert the time domain into the stationary frequency domain. and then analyses the control of limit cycle oscillations. In addition to the already known summation theorems for frequency and amplitude. we reveal summation theorems that apply to the control of average value. waveform. and phase differences of the oscillations. The approach is made fully operational in an analysis of yeast glycolytic oscillations. It follows an experimental approach. sampling from the model output and using discrete Fourier transforms of this data set. It quantifies the control of various aspects of the oscillations by the external glucose concentration and by various internal molecular processes. We show that the control of various oscillatory properties is distributed over the system enzymes in ways that differ among those properties.

DC: American Society for Microbiology. 1916-,A gene that encodes a periplasmic copper-type nitrite reductase (NirK) was identified in Nitrosomonas europaea. Disruption of this gene resulted in the disappearance of Nir activity in cell extracts. The nitrite tolerance of NirK-deficient cells was lower than that of wild-type cells. Unexpectedly. NirK-deficient cells still produced nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). the latter in greater amounts than that of wild-type cells. This demonstrates that NirK is not essential for the production of NO and N2O by N. europaea. Inactivation of the putative fnr gene showed that Fnr is not essential for the expression of nirK.

It was then realized that a consistent. standardized gene nomenclature would be vital to the collaborative effort of maintaining databases of human and mouse genes. This challenge is of course the elucidation of the complete DNA sequence for the human genome. Our role. in this age of informatics. is to supply meaningful. useful and unique symbols by which to identify as many of the newly sequenced genes as possible. We began this task with the chromosome 22 project as it approached its final stages. just prior to publication (Dunham et al. 1999).

82903,VU Research Portal,2000,M Bier and BM Bakker and HV Westerhoff,78,Biophysical Journal,,1087-1093,,Of all the lifeforms that obtain their energy from glycolysis. yeast cells are among the most basic. Under certain conditions the concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates in yeast cells can oscillate. Individual yeast cells in a suspension can synchronize their oscillations to get in phase with each other. Although the glycolytic oscillations originate in the upper part of the glycolytic chain. the signaling agent in this synchronization appears to be acetaldehyde. a membrane-permeating metabolite at the bottom of the anaerobic part of the glycolytic chain. Here we address the issue of how a metabolite remote from the pacemaking origin of the oscillation may nevertheless control the synchronization. We present a quantitative model for glycolytic oscillations and their synchronization in terms of chemical kinetics. We show that. in essence. the common acetaldehyde concentration can be modeled as a small perturbation on the “pacemaker” whose effect on the period of the oscillations of cells in the same suspension is indeed such that a synchronization develops.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:oYwriLWYh5YC,0,https://research.vu.nl/files/1625126/124686.pdf,,,,https://research.vu.nl/files/1625126/124686.pdf,0,0,0

Substantial progress came when it was discovered that important metabolic processes. such as fermentation of glucose to lactate by erythrocytes or to ethanol by yeast. consisted of series of apparently independent chemical reactions. The independence of these reactions was established by purifying protein fractions that were each capable of uniquely catalysing one of the reactions. Likewise membrane-dependent biological free-energy transduction was reduced to the action of two proton pumps. ie one linked to the electron-transfer chain in the mitochondrial or bacterial inner membrane. the other coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Mitchell. 1979). Accordingly. biochemistry and molecular biology assimilated the paradigm that each of the physiological processes of the living cell could be understood in terms of a series of independent biochemical reactions (Fig. 1). Although some processes are reluctant to be reduced in this manner this is usually believed to be a matter of practice rather than of principle. In accordance with the independence paradigm. biochemistry and molecular biology further focussed on the elucidation of all the other biochemical reactions that together constitute"" life”.

To address the issue of whether the behavior in vivo of the PTS can be understood in terms of these enzyme kinetics. a detailed kinetic model was constructed. Each overall phosphotransfer reaction was separated into two elementary reactions. the first entailing association of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor into a complex and the second entailing dissociation of the complex into dephosphorylated donor and phosphorylated acceptor. Literature data on the Km values and association constants of PTS proteins for their substrates. as well as equilibrium and rate constants for the overall phosphotransfer reactions. were related to the rate constants of the elementary steps in a set of equations; the rate constants could be calculated by solving these equations …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:g30IDTdgJMgC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17489660326814787289&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
82907,BOX 1–Comparison of the rates of diffusion-limited protein associations in the cell membrane and in the cytosol,2000,Boris N Kholodenko and Jan B Hoek and Hans V Westerhoff,5,,10,173-178,,It has been suggested that localization of signal-transduction proteins close to the cell membrane causes an increase in their rate of encounter after activation. We maintain that such an increase in the first-encounter rate is too small to be responsible for truly enhanced signal transduction. Instead. the function of membrane localization is to increase the number (or average lifetime) of complexes between cognate signal transduction proteins and hence increase the extent of activation of downstream processes. This is achieved by concentrating the proteins in the small volume of the area just below the plasma membrane. The signal-transduction chain is viewed simply as operating at low default intensity because one of its components is present at a low concentration. The steady signalling level of the chain is enhanced 1000-fold by increasing the concentration of that component. This occurs upon ‘piggyback’ binding to a membrane protein. such as the activated receptor. initiating the signal-transduction chain. For the effect to occur. the protein translocated to the membrane cannot be free but has to remain organized by being piggyback bound to a receptor. membrane lipid(s) or scaffold. We discuss an important structural constraint imposed by this mechanism on signal transduction proteins that might also account for the presence of adaptor proteins.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:cdwqcPQS8ssC,0,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-eddb59a4-ac1b-39a6-8c76-6e272a343718,,,,,0,0,0

We have now investigated the regulation and physiological role of this pathway. Primer extension analysis identified the presence of a single promoter upstream of the bkd gene cluster.

Consistent with this was the observation that expression of the bkd gene cluster is repressed in the presence of glucose. fructose. and lactose. It is proposed that the conversion of the branched-chain-keto acids to the corresponding free acids results in the formation of ATP via substrate level phosphorylation. The utilization of the-keto acids resulted in a marked increase of biomass. equivalent to a net production of 0.5 mol of ATP per mol of-keto acid metabolized. The pathway was active under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. However. under anaerobic conditions the presence of a suitable electron acceptor to regenerate NAD from the NADH produced by the branched-chain-keto acid dehydrogenase complex was required for complete conversion of-ketoisocaproate. Interestingly. during the conversion of the branched-chain-keto acids an intermediate was always detected extracellularly. With-ketoisocaproic acid as the substrate this intermediate was tentatively identified as 1. 1-dihydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone. This reduced form of-ketoisocaproic acid was found to serve as a temporary redox sink.The-keto acid dehydrogenases constitute a family …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:KS-xo-ZNxMsC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.9811&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.9811&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Modelling studies have shown that control on both amplitude and frequency can be distributed [2]. We determined the control of the frequency by the glucose transporter by titrating maltose. a competitive inhibitor of glucose transport [3]. and by measuring the transport kinetics. The glucose transport showed at least two kinetic components. The presence of both a high affinity and a low affinity component after starvation of diauxic shift cells may reflect the pre-growth conditions of the cells. In order to calculate the control coefficient. we modified the analysis by Bakker et al.[4]. including the two kinetic components.

Any process which may be described by a kinetic diagram of transitions between states of the system may be analysed by molecular control analysis. and this approach has previously been used to analyse control within enzymes. transporters. enzyme complexes. channelled pathways. and group-transfer pathways.

Pi. and ATP 31P NMR resonances in well perfused human forearm flexor muscle of six consenting. healthy adult volunteers (five males and one female; age. 28–55 years) were measured using high time resolution (7 s) 31P NMR spectroscopy. and data acquisition and analysis methods developed in this laboratory (7. 8). 31P NMR spectra were collected using a CSI spectrometer operating at 2 tesla (General Electric). Different energy balance states were imposed by supramaximal percutaneous nerve stimulation (electric pulse duration. 0.2 ms; amplitude. 250–300 V). which resulted in recruitment of all motor units in the muscle (7). Average PCr. Pi. and ATP levels and intracellular pH (pHi) in muscle fibers during 6 min of twitch contractions were studied over a 2-Hz range of twitch frequencies (0–2.2 Hz). Total cytosolic ATP hydrolysis flux and glyco (geno) lytic ATP synthesis flux (in mmol ATP liter 1 s 1) were calculated at each twitch frequency from the measured time course of PCr and pHi during twitch contractions (8). MOP flux at steady state. Jp MOP (in mmol ATP liter 1 s 1). was calculated as the difference between these fluxes. The concentrations of PCr. Pi. ADP. and pHi at each steady state were calculated assuming concentrations of ATP and total creatine of 8.2 and 42.7 mM. respectively. and creatine kinase near equilibrium (8).

However. the classical theory does not address all complex cases of the organization of cellular metabolism. Here the control theory is extended to include (i) pathways with high enzyme concentrations and moiety conservation and (ii) metabolic channelling in general. The new theory descends the microlevel of elemental steps into the reaction cycle of the enzymes and turns back to the macrolevel of complete enzyme reactions. We showed how the elemental control coefficients are related to the traditional flux control coefficients of the enzymes.

82947,Regulation and control of compartmentalized glycolysis in bloodstream,1995,BM Bakker and HV Westerhoff and PAM Michels,,,,,,Unlike other eukaryotic cells. trypanosomes possess a compartmentalized glycolytic pathway. The conversion of glucose into 3-phosphoglycerate takes place in specialized peroxisomes. called glycosomes. Further conversion of this intermediate into pyruvate occurs in the cytosol. Due to this compartmentation. many regulatory mechanisms operating in other cell types cannot work in trypanosomes. This is reflected by the insensitivity of the glycosomal enzymes to compounds that act as activity regulators in other cell types. Several speculations have been raised about the function of compartmentation of glycolysis in trypanosomes. We calculate that even in a noncompartmentalized trypanosome the flux through glycolysis should not be limited by diffusion. Therefore. the sequestration of glycolytic enzymes in an organelle may not serve to overcome a diffusion limitation. We also search the availabledata for a possible relation between compartmentation and the distribution of control of the glycolytic flux among the glycolytic enzymes. Under physiological conditions. the rate of glycolytic ATP production in the bloodstream form of the parasite is possibly controlled by the oxygen tension. but not by the glucose concentration. Within the framework of Metabolic Control Analysis. we discuss evidence that glucose transport. although it does not qualify as the sole rate-limiting step. does have a high flux control coefficient. This. however. does not distinguish trypanosomes from other eukaryotic cell types without glycosomes.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:tgTmbKTkO1IC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1008.924&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1008.924&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

At the level of protein metabolism there may be cascades of enzymes modifying one another covalently. The glutamine synthetase regulatory cascade in E. coli will be analyzed in the light of the modular metabolic control theory [1]. The modular control analysis of this cascade should give insight into how the control is distributed over the different hierarchical levels of the cascade and how much contribution there is from the metabolic part of the system. In enteric bacteria. assimilation of ammonia occurs primarily via the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) cycle. The activity of GS is regulated by a bicyclic cascade. This contains the modification of GS by adenylyl-transferase (AT) to produce the less active form GS-AMP. The latter can be deadenylylated by the same enzyme AT. The transferase activity is stimulated by the regulatory protein Pll. while the deadenylylase activity is enhanced by the uridylyl form of PM (Pu-UMP). The modification of Pll is catalyzed by uridylyl-transferase (UT). which also has a deuridylylation activity. UT is regulated allosterically by 2-oxoglutarate and glutamine. Thus UT is a sensor for the nitrogen status of the cell.In order to study the control of the signal transducer protein Pll of the GS adenylylation cascade in vivo. a strain (WCH15) was constructed with a lac-type inducible promoter upstream of glnB. the gene encoding Pll. at the wild-type chromosomal location.

With classical models. where most structural properties of the systems such as stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic parameters of the participating reactions are considered to be given quantities. one simulates the behavior of the system variables (concentrations of metabolic intermediates. fluxes etc.) under steady state or time dependent conditions. Recently. a number of theoretical investiga-tions have been performed whose aim is substantially different from that of simulation models (for a review see [1]). Here it is attempted to predict certain structural features of enzymic systems which are fixed during the life span of an organism but have been changed in an evolutionary time scale. The basic assumption of these investigations is that due to natural selection. contemporary metabolic systems may be characterized by optimization principles. One of the main problems of investigations dealing with the optimization of enzymic systems is the formulation of appropriate performance functions whose maximum or minimum value might correspond to the outcome of the evolution. It has often been assumed that the enzymic reaction rates v are the most important targets of natural selection (extremum principle v-max). Other optimization criteria concern the minimization of transient times. the minimization of concentrations of metabolicintermediates and stoichiometric simplicity.

At the level of protein metabolism we study cascades of enzymes modifying one another covalently. To this purpose metabolic control theory (MCT) has been extended explicitly to include regulatory cascades. The resulting modular control theory1. which started from the general formalism of Reder2. will be used to analyze the glutamine synthetase regulatory cascade in Escherichia coli. The modular control analysis of this cascade should give insight into how control is distributed over the different hierarchical levels of the cascade. and to quantitate the relative importance of metabolic and genetic regulation of nitrogen assimilation.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2962-0_61,,,,,0,0,0

A model derived from this study is used to analyze the effects of co-operativity on the reaction rates of enzymes activated by polymeric cofactors that provide multiple binding sites for the enzyme. It is found that in the presence of strong co-operativity. the steady-state reaction rates of polymer-activated enzymes can be very different from the Michaelis-Menten paradigm. By adjusting the co-operativity parameters and the binding constants of the ligands. the model can generate apparent auto-catalytic enhancement by substrates at low substrate concentrations and apparent substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations.

Maxwell (1871) pointed out that a"" being"" that could deal with individual molecules. when positioned at a trap door between two compartments at different temperatures. might open the door whenever a molecule with much higher than average kinetic energy would approach from the cold compartment. and whenever a kinetically"" cold molecule would approach from the moto compartment (see also Brush. 1976). Consequently. such a"" Maxwell's demon"" would cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot compartment and violate the second law. For quite some time. the validity of the second law of thermodynamics seemed to depend on the absence of Maxwellian demons from the systems under consideration. Also. it was deemed plausible that the special property long sought for living systems. was nothing but the presence of Maxwellian demons within them. Whilst Maxwell already argued that beings. other than supernatural. would lack the knowledge about the positions and velocities of the molecules. Szilard (1929). Demers (1945) and Brillouin (1956) have since resolved this paradox: the demon would require a continuous influx of information. which should be counted as a kind of work-input and would violate the required isolation of the system.

Dordrecht,There is no doubt that the chemiosmotic hypothesis for oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation (Mitchell. 1966)has given a powerful impulse to the study and the understanding of membrane associated electron transfer and its coupling to ATP formation. The hypothesis has been of particular importance in emphasizing the vectorial aspects of oxidoreduction reactions in energy conserving membranes and the relevance of protonic activity and electrostatic potential differences for the coupling of energy transducing enzymes. Many basic features of the hypothesis have been experimentally substantiated; such features include the asymmetric distribution of redox carriers across the membranes. the formation of transmembrane differences in pH and/or in electrostatic potential by the various redox complexes and by the ATPase. the possibility of driving ATP synthesis by artificially imposed ΔpH or diffusion …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:lYAcb2jw7qUC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-6368-4_53,,,,http://dbkgroup.org/Papers/melandri_apr84.pdf,0,0,0

By definition. bioenergetics is concerned with the transformations of energy in biological systems. Thermodynamics. though originally focused on the usefulness of heat to steam engines was soon extended to analyze the interconversion of many more forms of energy. Thermodynamics could be extended to the description of non-equilibrium systems. The theory behind the application of this “near-equilibrium” non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NET) to biological systems has been discussed in detail. It provided insight into the thermodynamic implication of the coupling of (in terms of Gibbs free energy) “uphill” to “downhill” processes and into the resulting thermodynamic efficiency of energy coupling.

For example. to understand cell function it is not enough to know the properties of each biomolecule in isolation. but we need to take into account how an enzyme interacts with other components. eg its activators and inhibitors. and how the concentration of all these interacting components are set in the cell by the collective behavior of all enzymes …,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:qSd0DAb9jMoC,0,http://mccmb.belozersky.msu.ru/2013/abstracts/abstracts/144.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

We systematically analysed decay rates of 134 signalling proteins and investigated their gene expression profiles in response to stimulation to get insights into transcriptional feedback regulation. We found a clear separation of the signalling pathways into flexible and static parts: for each pathway a subgroup of unstable signal inhibitors is transcriptionally induced upon stimulation. while the other constitutively expressed signalling proteins are long-lived. Kinetic modelling suggests that this design principle allows for swift feedback regulation and establishes latency phases after signalling. and that it might be an optimal design due to a trade-off between energy efficiency and flexibility.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:U3qCfcK-7lkC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14289846257616154437&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
83015,dependent incidence in models of sexually− Frequency,,James O Lloyd-Smith and Wayne M Getz and Hans V Westerhoff,,,,,,We explore the transmission process for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We derive the classical frequency-dependent incidence mechanistically from a pair-formation model. using an approximation that applies to populations with rapid pairing dynamics (such as core groups or non-pair-bonding animals). This mechanistic derivation provides a framework to assess how accurately frequency-dependent incidence portrays the pair-based transmission known to underlie STD dynamics. This accuracy depends strongly on the disease being studied: frequency-dependent formulations are more suitable for chronic less-transmissible infections than for transient highly transmissible infections. Our results thus support earlier proposals to divide STDs into these two functional classes. and we suggest guidelines to help assess under what conditions each class can be appropriately modelled using frequency-dependent incidence. We then extend the derivation to include situations where infected individuals exhibit altered pairing behaviour. For four cases of increasing behavioural complexity. analytic expressions are presented for the generalized frequency-dependent incidence rate. basic reproductive number (R0) and steady-state prevalence (i) of an epidemic. The expression for R0 is identical for all cases. giving refined insights into determinants of invasibility of STDs. Potentially significant effects of infection-induced changes in contact behaviour are illustrated by simulating epidemics of bacterial and viral STDs. We discuss the application of our results to STDs (in humans and animals) and other infectious diseases.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:cww_0JKUTDwC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/45382343/Frequency-dependent_incidence_in_models_20160505-30099-1wh08zm.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45382343/Frequency-dependent_incidence_in_models_20160505-30099-1wh08zm.pdf,0,0,0

Inhibition was titrated through increasing [inhibitor]/(inhibition constant of the inhibitor)([I]/Ki). Using the [I]/Ki rather than the inhibitor concentration. generalizes the analysis to any inhibitor. irrespective of differences in potency at the molecular level. At each ([I]/Ki value. the steady state flux of the ATPase reaction was calculated which equals the ATP production flux and is plotted compared to the uninhibited flux. The target of the inhibitor and the competing substrate is indicated above each panel. For HXK. the inhibitor affected both the cytosolic and the glycosomal fraction in the T. brucei model. When a HXK inhibitor competitive with ATP was simulated. erythrocyte steady states could only be calculated up to an [I]/Ki of 1.4. The simulations were run up to 90% inhibition for the trypanosome model and this [I]/Ki-value was used to rank the target in Fig 1D. In a few cases the trypanosome model did not reach a steady state beyond a certain [I]/Ki. Then the highest [I]/Ki for which a steady state could be calculated was plotted in Fig 1D. This was the case for PFK-F6P (max [I]/Ki= 248). PFK-ATP (max [I]/Ki= 507) and PGAM-3PGA (max [I]/Ki= 1.1 x106). Note in the comparison with Fig 1D that the shape of the curve in the [I]/Ki range displayed here (0-100) may change at higher doses. For instance. the trypanosome curve for PYK-PEP decreases very slowly beyond [I]/Ki= 100. explaining why it ranks unfavorably in Fig 1D despite the initial flux decline shown here.

Using microarray expression profiling with high temporal resolution. we identified gene regulatory events in early stages of osteogenic and adipogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Data analysis revealed three distinct phases when cells adopt a committed expression phenotype: initiation of differentiation (0–3 hr. phase I). lineage acquisition (6–24 hr. phase II). and early lineage progression (48–96 hr. phase III). Upstream regulator analysis identified 34 transcription factors (TFs) in phase I with a role in hMSC differentiation. Interestingly. expression levels of identified TFs did not always change and indicate additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Functional analysis revealed that forced expression of IRF2 enhances osteogenic differentiation. Thus. IRF2 and other early-responder TFs may control osteogenic cell fate of MSCs and should be considered in mechanistic models that clarify bone-anabolic changes during clinical progression of osteoporosis.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:oldoQiaHq2UC,0,https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/28319688/1_s2.0_S2213671117300851_mmc3.pdf,,,,https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/28319688/1_s2.0_S2213671117300851_mmc3.pdf,0,0,0

83026,Autoamplification of a Two-Component,,Pieter W Postma and Jan Tommassen and Sally M Hoffer and Hans V Westerhoff and Klaas J Hellingwerf,,,,,,We have tested the hypothesis that the autoamplification of two-component regulatory systems results in “learning” behavior. ie. that bacteria respond faster or more extensively to a signal when a similar signal has been perceived in the past. Indeed. the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity upon phosphate limitation was faster if the cultures had been limited for phosphate previously. and this faster response correlated with the autoamplification of the cognate two-component system.The adaptation of bacteria to ffuctuating environmental conditions often proceeds via two-component regulatory systems. which usually consist of a sensor in the cytoplasmic membrane and a cytoplasmic response regulator (16. 24). Upon stimulation. the sensor autophosphorylates and the phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the cognate regulator. eventually resulting in a suitable response. eg. the activation of the transcription of a specific set of genes. An example of a twocomponent regulatory system is found in the pho regulon of Escherichia coli (29). Growth of E. coli under inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation results in the induction of the synthesis of many proteins. including the periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase (28) and the high-affinity uptake systems for Pi (the Pst system)(26) and for sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and sn-glycerophosphoryl diesters (the Ugp system)(15). These proteins function to scavenge traces of Pi or phosphorylated compounds from the extracellular medium.

The cell shape changed from spheroid/ovoid to elongated by which the surface to volume ratio increased. We here developed a quantitative description in terms of modular metabolic control analysis (modular-MCA) with the aim of understanding the implications of these findings. The experimental results can be readily understood if the control of membrane located processes on the maximum specific growth rate of K. marxianus is 0.9. It is hypothesized that the increase in surface area lead to an increased uptake capacity for all kinds of nutrients and that this enabled the cells to grow faster on mineral medium. These results may also have implications for commercial fermentations in which the production process depends on the µmax of the Kluyveromyces strain.

83033,Cluster Genes in nirK Novel,,Rob JM van Spanning and Hubertus JE Beaumont and Sylvia I Lens and Hans V Westerhoff,,,,,,Nitrite reductase (NirK) of Nitrosomonas europaea confers tolerance to nitrite (NO2). The nirK gene is clustered with three genes of unknown physiological function: ncgABC. At present. this organization is unique to nitrifying bacteria. Here we report that the ncgABC gene products facilitate NirK-dependent NO2 tolerance by reversing the negative physiological effect that is associated with the activity of NirK in their absence. We hypothesize that the ncg gene products are involved in the detoxification of nitric oxide that is produced by NirK.Nitrosomonas europaea is a nitrifying bacterium that makes free energy available by the aerobic oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to NO2(12). During nitrification. this organism expresses NirK and nitric oxide reductase. both enzymes that are classically associated with anaerobic respiration in denitrifying bacteria (1. 3). Inactivation of the nirK gene of N. europaea rendered the cells more sensitive to the toxic effects of NO2 produced during nitrification (1). Recently. we demonstrated that this bacterium expresses increasing levels of NirK in response to the accumulation of NO2 in its environment (2). This NirK-dependent tolerance to NO2 might constitute a defense mechanism that protects the cell against the toxic product of aerobic NH3 oxidation (2. 10). The nirK gene of N. europaea is clustered with three other genes (NE0927. NE0926. and NE0925)(1. 5). We have designated these nirK cluster genes ncgA. ncgB. and ncgC. respectively (Fig. 1a).

83034,Recommendations for Terminology and Databases for Biochemical Thermodynamics,,GG Hammes and K Tipton and HV Westerhoff,,,,,,Although chemical equations are normally written in terms of specific ionic and elemental species and balance atoms of elements and electric charge. it is usually better in a biochemical context to write them with ionic reactants expressed as totals of species in equilibrium with each other; this implies that atoms of elements assumed to be at fixed concentrations. such as hydrogen at a specified pH. should not be balanced in a biochemical equation used for thermodynamic analysis. However. both kinds of equations are needed in biochemistry. The apparent equilibrium constant K′ for a biochemical reaction is written in terms of such sums of species and can be used to calculate standard transformed Gibbs energies of reaction ΔrG′ o. This property for a biochemical reaction can be calculated from the standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation ΔfGi′ of reactants. which can be calculated from the standard Gibbs energies of formation of species ΔfGj and measured apparent equilibrium constants of enzymecatalyzed reactions. Tables of ΔrG′ o of reactions and ΔfGi′ o of reactants as functions of pH and temperature are available on the web. as are functions for calculating these properties. Biochemical thermodynamics is also important in enzyme kinetics because apparent equilibrium constants K′ can be calculated from experimentally determined kinetic parameters when initial velocities have been determined for both forward and reverse reactions.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C,0,http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/thermod2/BiochemThermodynamics.pdf,,,,http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/thermod2/BiochemThermodynamics.pdf,0,0,0

This is one of the reasons why the systemic properties emerging from the nonlinear protein-protein interactions are still poorly understood. However. studies on the topology of signal transduction networks have resulted in the concept of subnetworks. ie modules. that each perform an emergent task in the global functioning of the regulatory network [2. 3]. Some modules amplify or attenuate signal responses whereas others integrate and fine tune multiple signals.Here we illustrate how to employ the modular character of signaling networks for studies of their responses to external signals. Signal transfer analysis allows for the determination of the global responses of the total network in terms of the responses of its constituent modules [4. 5]. Signal transfer analysis is an extension of a rigorous theoretical framework of metabolic control analysis. which led to fundamental insights in control and regulation of biochemical pathways and aided experimental metabolic engineering for the last two decades [6].,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.530.6871&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,,0,0,0

83037,29 Can metabolic control analysis be applied to hierarchical regulated metabolism? MCA versus HCA,,A de la Fuente van Bentem and P Mendes and HV Westerhoff and JL Snoep,,,,,,Metabolic control analysis. MCA.(Kacser and Burns. 1974; Heinrich and Rappoport. 1975) has been applied to many metabolic systems and has been proven to be a useful tool in the quantitative description of these systems. In the living cell the level of metabolism is connected to other cellular systems. such as signal-transduction and transcription/translation. which control metabolic reactions via regulatory interactions. Control is therefore not distributed amongst the enzymes in the metabolic pathway only. but also amongst the reactions that occur in these regulatory systems. An extension of MCA. hierarchical control analysis. HCA.(Kahn & Westerhoff. 1991) does take regulatory interactions between different cellular systems into account. Usually these two types of control coefficients do not have the same value. Does this imply that MCA does not provide us correct information of how a set of metabolic reactions is controlled in a living cell? This question will be addressed in this article. Using a model that consists of metabolic reactions and reactions on the transcription/translation level. we show that in a certain time span. a metabolic system can behave in the same way as if it were isolated from the global system. In other words. descriptions of MCA are valid in this time span. On a longer time scale. descriptions with HCA are required.

83039,14 An in vivo assay for metabolic regulation?‘Control’by a metabolic variable,,OJG Somsen and HV Westerhoff,,,,,,Regulation is essential for the dynamics of a physiological system. For example. homeostasis is typically caused by negative feedback. while positive feedback may lead to oscillations and bi-stability [Heinrich et al.. 1977]. Regulation may be studied in vitro for individual enzymes [Torres et al.. 1980]. but because regulation is a subtle phenomenon. it is also necessary to study regulation phenomena in vivo. A fundamental issue is that to define the extent by which a metabolite regulates other metabolic phenomena. appears to be in conflict with metabolic control analysis [Hofmeyr. 1995]: the concentration of a metabolite is a variable and its value is determined by the parameters. Response coefficients are defined with respect to parameters. not with respect to a variable. To demonstrate that the above conflict is indeed apparent. and that regulation can be studied in vivo. we shall illustrate (i) that it is possible to define unambiguously the effect of one metabolite on another.(ii) that this dependence can. at least in principle. be measured in vivo. and (iii) that this dependence provides information on the dynamics of the physiological system.,True,UJCCkB8AAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC,0,http://academic.sun.ac.za/Natural/biochem/btk/book/Somsen.pdf,,,,http://academic.sun.ac.za/Natural/biochem/btk/book/Somsen.pdf,0,0,0

The detail of our knowledge is increasing by the hour. but little progress is being reported on our understanding of life as an integrated process. Here we attempt to rectify this situation. at least to some degree. by discussing our view of cellular metabolism [3] as an integrated molecular economy of coupled supply and demand systems in the context of what we have called multi-level or hierarchical control analysis [4]. Cellular processes are organised in different levels. of which the DNA–mRNA–enzyme–metabolism cascade and the signal transduction cascades consisting of covalent modification cycles are important examples. The reaction network that constitutes each level can be viewed as a ‘module’in which reactions are linked by mass transfer. Although in principle all of these cellular modules are ultimately linked by mass transfer. in practice they can often be regarded as’ isolated’from each other in terms of mass transfer. Here modules can interact with each other only by means of regulatory or catalytic effects—a chemical species in one module may affect the rate of a reaction in another module by binding to an enzyme or transport system or by acting as a catalyst.

A central target of the cell cycle arrest program is the Cdc25A protein phosphatase. Cdc25A is required for S-phase entry and dephosphorylates tyrosine-15 phosphorylated Cdk1 (Cdc2) and Cdk2. positive regulators of cell division. Cdc25A is unstable during S-phase and is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. but its turnover is enhanced in response to DNA damage. Although basal and DNA-damage-induced turnover depends on the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways. how these kinases engage the ubiquitin ligase machinery is unknown.

We show that phosphotyrosine-and phosphothreonine-containing peptides show complicated fragmentation patterns. These phosphopeptides were observed to lose the phosphate moiety in the form of H 3 PO 4 and/or HPO 3. but were also detected with no loss of the phosphate group. The tendency to lose the phosphate moiety depends strongly on the charge state. Thus. the highest observed charge state tends to retain the phosphate moiety with extensive fragmentation along the peptide backbone.

The biological effects of histone methylation are thought to be mediated by effector proteins that recognize and bind to specific patterns of methylation. Using an unbiased in vitro biochemical approach. we have identified ICBP90. a transcription and cell cycle regulator. as a novel methyl K9 H3-specific binding protein. ICBP90 and its murine homologue Np95 are enriched in pericentric heterochromatin of interphase nuclei. and this localization is dependent on H3K9 methylation. Specific binding of ICBP90 to methyl K9 H3 depends on two functional domains. a PHD (plant homeodomain) finger that defines the binding specificity and an SRA (SET- and RING-associated) domain that promotes binding activity.

In this study. we provide biochemical data to demonstrate that two preformed XRCC1 protein complexes exist in cycling HeLa cells.

Because ARF is a very stable protein in most human cell lines. it has been widely assumed that ARF induction is mediated mainly at the transcriptional level and that activation of the ARF–p53 pathway by oncogenes is a much slower and largely irreversible process by comparison with p53 activation after DNA damage.

COUP-TFII-null mice die during the early embryonic development due to angiogenesis and cardiovascular defects. To circumvent the early embryonic lethality and investigate the physiological function of COUP-TFII. we knocked out COUP-TFII gene in a time-specific manner by using a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase. The ablation of COUP-TFII during pre-pubertal stages of male development results in infertility. hypogonadism and spermatogenetic arrest. Homozygous adult male mutants are defective in testosterone synthesis. and administration of testosterone could largely rescue the mutant defects. Notably. the rescued results also provide the evidence that the major function of adult Leydig cell is to synthesize testosterone. Further phenotypic analysis reveals that Leydig cell differentiation is arrested at the progenitor cell stage in the testes of null mice. The failure of testosterone to resumption of Leydig cell maturation in the null mice indicates that COUP-TFII itself is essential for this process. In addition. we identify that COUP-TFII plays roles in progenitor Leydig cell formation and early testis organogenesis. as demonstrated by the ablation of COUP-TFII at E18.5. On the other hand. when COUP-TFII is deleted in the adult stage after Leydig cells are well differentiated. there are no obvious defects in reproduction and Leydig cell function.

The present paper describes a new excitation scheme. which we term red-shifted off-resonance large-amplitude excitation (RSORLAE). that can deposit higher amounts of internal energy in ions than is feasible with conventional resonant excitation. The new method provides an effective means for inducing fragmentation of MALDI-produced peptide ions with m/z values up to 3500. Prior to excitation. it is necessary to isolate ions of interest with high efficiency. We demonstrate that isolation efficiencies of >95% can be achieved by careful design of the rf scan functions used during ion isolation.

While recent studies have identified potential pathways involved in CRPC development. the drivers of CRPC remain largely undefined. Here we determined that nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCoA2. also known as SRC-2). which is frequently amplified or overexpressed in patients with metastatic PCa. mediates development of CRPC. In a murine model. overexpression of NCoA2 in the prostate epithelium resulted in neoplasia and. in combination with Pten deletion. promoted the development of metastasis-prone cancer.

In response to DNA damage. p53 is stabilized and becomes activated to turn on transcriptional programs that are essential for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Activation of p53 leads to accumulation of Mdm2 protein. a direct transcriptional target of p53. It is not understood how p53 is protected from degradation when Mdm2 is up-regulated. Here we report that p53 stabilization in the late phase after ionizing radiation correlates with active ubiquitination. We found that an E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD3 (RNF201/FLJ10520) forms a complex with Mdm2 and p53 to synergistically ubiquitinate p53 and is required to stabilize p53 in the late response to DNA damage.

Ubiquitination is one of the major post-translational modifications that regulate a broad spectrum of cellular functions. The advancement of mass spectrometers as well as the development of new affinity purification tools has greatly expedited proteome-wide analysis of several post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation. glycosylation. and acetylation). In contrast. large-scale profiling of lysine ubiquitination remains a challenge. Most recently. new Ub affinity reagents such as Ub remnant antibody and tandem Ub binding domains have been developed. allowing for relatively large-scale detection of several hundreds of lysine ubiquitination events in human cells. Here we review different strategies for the identification of ubiquitination site and discuss several issues associated with data analysis.

The host lipins (phosphatidate phosphatases) are particularly interesting because these proteins play key roles in cellular decisions about membrane biogenesis versus lipid storage. Therefore. we examined the relationship between host lipins and tombusviruses. based on yeast model host. We show that deletion of PAH1 (phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase). which is the single yeast homolog of the lipin gene family of phosphatidate phosphatases. whose inactivation is responsible for proliferation and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. facilitates robust RNA virus replication in yeast. We document increased tombusvirus replicase activity in pah1Δ yeast due to the efficient assembly of VRCs. We show that the ER membranes generated in pah1Δ yeast is efficiently subverted by this RNA virus. thus emphasizing the connection between host lipins and RNA viruses. Thus. instead of utilizing the peroxisomal membranes as observed in wt yeast and plants. TBSV readily switches to the vastly expanded ER membranes in lipin-deficient cells to build VRCs and support increased level of viral replication. Over-expression of the Arabidopsis Pah2p in Nicotiana benthamiana decreased tombusvirus accumulation. validating that our findings are also relevant in a plant host. Over-expression of AtPah2p also inhibited the ER-based replication of another plant RNA virus. suggesting that the role of lipins in RNA virus replication might include several more eukaryotic viruses.,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC,36,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003944,6461316459908292587,/scholar?cites=6461316459908292587,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003944,0,0,0

However. the catalytic domain expressed in a baculovirus–insect cell system is fully active as isolated without autophosphorylation in vitro. We now show that the expressed catalytic domain is inactivated by incubation with acid phosphatase and regains activity upon autophosphorylation. The state of phosphorylation of all of the hydroxyamino acids in the catalytic domain were determined by mass spectrometry of unfractionated protease digests.

APS-3c was administrated into rat OA knee joints and had protective effects on rat OA cartilage in vivo. Primary rat articular chondrocytes were cotreated with APS-3c and IL-1β  in vitro. 2~50 μg/mL APS-3c had no effect on chondrocytes viability. whereas it increased the proteoglycans (PGs) synthesis inhibited by IL-1β.

RT-PCR confirmed that treatment with APS-3c increased the mRNA expression of aggrecan and glycosyltransferases (GTs) inhibited by IL-1β but did not affect the mRNA expression of matrix-degrading enzymes. These results indicate that APS-3c can improve PGs synthesis of chondrocytes on rat OA model in vivo and IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes in vitro. which is due to the promotion of the expression of aggrecan and GTs involved in PGs synthesis but not the inhibition of the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes.

In this paper. we identified those members of the large cyclophilin family that interacted with the viral replication proteins and inhibited TBSV replication. Further characterization of the most effective cyclophilin. the Cyp40-like Cpr7p. revealed that it strongly inhibits many steps during TBSV replication in a cell-free replication assay. These steps include viral RNA recruitment inhibited via binding of Cpr7p to the RNA-binding region of the viral replication protein; the assembly of the viral replicase complex and viral RNA synthesis. Since the TPR (tetratricopeptide repeats) domain. but not the catalytic domain of Cpr7p is needed for the inhibitory effect on TBSV replication. it seems that the chaperone activity of Cpr7p provides the negative regulatory function. We also show that three Cyp40-like proteins from plants can inhibit TBSV replication in vitro and Cpr7p is also effective against Nodamura virus. an insect pathogen.

Sodium ferulate (SF) has been demonstrated to have anti‐oxidant. anti‐inflammatory and anti‐apoptotic actions in cardiovascular. hepatic and diabetic disorders. These findings suggest that SF may have beneficial effects on OA. Therefore. present study investigated the effects of SF in an in vivo rat OA model. as well as in vitro in human OA chondrocytes.  2 Rats were divided into the following groups: (i) an untreated control group; (ii) papain‐induced OA; (iii) OA rats treated with 0.1 or 0.5% SF; and (iv) normal rats injected with 0.5% SF intra‐articularly. Human chondrocytes from OA patients were cultured before being stimulated with 2 ng/mL interleukin‐1β and subsequently treated with SF (125. 250 and 500 µmol/L).

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) regulates multiple mitotic events by binding to targeting factors at different mitotic structures in a phosphorylation dependent manner.  In this study. we report the identification of a putative ATPase that targets Plk1 to chromosome arms during mitosis. PICH (Plk1-interacting checkpoint “helicase”) displays a temporal localization on chromosome arms and kinetochores during early mitosis.

The vertebrate cohesin complex consists of four core components including structure maintenance of chromosomes proteins SMC1 and SMC3. RAD21. and SA2/SA1. Extensive research suggests that cohesin traps the sister chromatids by a V-shaped SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer bound to the RAD21 protein that closes the ring. Accordingly. the single “ring” model proposes that two sister chromatids are trapped in a single ring that is composed of one molecule each of the 4 subunits. However. evidence also exists for alternative models. The hand-cuff model suggests that each sister chromatid is trapped individually by two rings that are joined through the shared SA1/SA2 subunit.

Sin3A. However. the subunit(s) responsible for specific binding of H3 by NURD has not been defined. In this study. we show among several class I HDAC-containing corepressor complexes only NURD exhibits a substantial H3 tail-binding activity in vitro. We present the evidence that the MTA family proteins within the NURD complex interact directly with H3 tail. Extensive in vitro binding assays mapped the H3 tail-binding domain to the C-terminal region of MTA1 and MTA2. Significantly. although the MTA1 and MTA2 mutant proteins with deletion of the C-terminal H3 tail binding domain were assembled into the endogenous NURD complex when expressed in mammalian cells. the resulting NURD complexes were deficient in binding H3 tail in vitro. indicating that the MTA family proteins are required for the observed specific binding of H3 tail peptide by NURD in vitro. However. chromatin fractionation experiments show that the NURD complexes with impaired MTA1/2-H3 tail binding activity remained to be associated with chromatin in cells. Together our study reveals a novel histone H3-binding activity for the MTA family proteins and provides evidence that the MTA family proteins mediate the in vitro specific binding of H3 tail peptide by NURD complex.

In this paper. we provided evidence to demonstrate a role of UHRF2 in cell motility and invasion through the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process by acting as a transcriptional co-regulator of the EMT-transcription factors (TFs). We ectopically expressed UHRF2 in gastric cancer cell lines and performed multidimensional proteomics analyses. Proteome profiling analysis suggested a role of UHRF2 in repression of cell-cell adhesion; analysis of proteome-wide TF DNA binding activities revealed the up-regulation of many EMT-TFs in UHRF2-overexpressing cells. These data suggest that UHRF2 is a regulator of cell motility and the EMT program.

Nevertheless. the regulation of the p53-p300 interplay is not completely understood. Here. we have identified the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase 24 (DDX24) as a novel regulator of the p300-p53 axis. We found that DDX24 interacts with p300. and this interaction leads to suppression of p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Notably. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous DDX24 significantly increases the acetylation levels of endogenous p53 in human cancer cells and subsequently promotes p53-mediated activation of its transcriptional targets such as p21 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). In contrast. DDX24 expression inhibits the p300-p53 interaction and suppresses p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Moreover.

However. the precise mechanism by which FFAs trigger β cell apoptosis is still unclear. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) is a pseudokinase inhibiting Akt. a key mediator of insulin signaling. and contributes to insulin resistance in insulin target tissues. This paper outlined the role of TRB3 in FFAs-induced INS-1 β cell apoptosis. TRB3 was promptly induced in INS-1 cells after stimulation by FFAs. and this was accompanied by enhanced INS-1 cell apoptosis. The overexpression of TRB3 led to exacerbated apoptosis triggered by FFAs in INS-1-derived cell line and the subrenal capsular transplantation animal model. In contrast. cell apoptosis induced by FFAs was attenuated when TRB3 was knocked down. Moreover. we observed that activation and nuclear accumulation of protein kinase C (PKC) δ was enhanced by upregulation of TRB3. Preventing PKCδ nuclear translocation and PKCδ selective antagonist both significantly lessened the pro-apoptotic effect. These findings suggest that TRB3 was involved in lipoapoptosis of INS-1 β cell. and thus could be an attractive pharmacological target in the prevention and treatment of T2DM.,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096089,6256474990608483285,/scholar?cites=6256474990608483285,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096089,0,0,0

Either overexpression or silencing SMARCAL1 causes the accumulation of replication-associated DNA damage. SMARCAL1 is heavily phosphorylated. Here we identify multiple phosphorylation sites. including S889. which is phosphorylated even in undamaged cells. S889 is highly conserved through evolution and it regulates SMARCAL1 activity. Specifically. S889 phosphorylation increases the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of SMARCAL1 and increases its ability to catalyze replication fork regression. A phosphomimetic S889 mutant is also hyperactive when expressed in cells. while a non-phosphorylatable mutant is less active. S889 lies within a C-terminal region of the SMARCAL1 protein.

The final purpose is that receiptfreeness and coercion-resistance is implemented without physical assumptions. In this paper firstly. a receipt-free coercion-resistant remote Internet voting protocol based on MW deniable encryption scheme and BCP commitment scheme is developed. To our best knowledge the proposed remote Internet voting protocol. which has receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance. is the first remote Internet voting protocol implemented without physical assumptions. Secondly. we analyze receipt-freeness and coercionresistance of the proposed remote Internet voting protocol.

83267,Towards workflow sharing and reuse in the ASKALON grid environment,2008,Jun Qin and Thomas Fahringer and Maximilian Berger,,Proceedings of Cracow Grid Workshop (CGW’08),,,,As more Grid workflow applications are built. workflow sharing and reuse becomes important. because (i) building a Grid workflow application from scratch is still a challenging task for domain scientists. and (ii) reusing of established and validated workflows not only reduces workflow authoring time but also improves the quality of workflows. In this paper. we present a Grid workflow sharing and reuse framework and its implementation in the ASKALON Grid environment. The framework introduces the ASKALON Workflow Hosting Environment (AWHE) for workflow sharing among different research groups. Extensions of the Abstract Grid Workflow Language (AGWL) for simple reuse of Grid workflow components. sub-workflows. and workflows are also presented.

Nevertheless. it remains unclear whether these two enzymatic activities are molecularly intertwined. Here. we report that SETD2 delays prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis via its substrate EZH2. We show that SETD2 methylates EZH2 which promotes EZH2 degradation. SETD2 deficiency induces a Polycomb-repressive chromatin state that enables cells to acquire metastatic traits. Conversely. mice harboring nonmethylated EZH2 mutant or SETD2 mutant defective in binding to EZH2 develop metastatic PCa. Furthermore. we identify that metformin-stimulated AMPK signaling converges at FOXO3 to stimulate SETD2 expression. Together. our results demonstrate that the SETD2-EZH2 axis integrates metabolic and epigenetic signaling to restrict PCa metastasis.,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610820302725,15101020003385242767,/scholar?cites=15101020003385242767,,,0,0,0

However. the detailed process remains largely undefined. It was reported that nuclear receptors COUP-TFII and TR4 are recruited to the enriched GGGTCA variant repeats embedded within ALT telomeres. implicating nuclear receptors in regulating ALT activity. Here. we identified a function of nuclear receptors in ALT telomere maintenance that involves a direct interaction between COUP-TFII/TR4 and FANCD2. the key protein in the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. The COUP-TFII/TR4-FANCD2 complex actively induces the DNA damage response by recruiting endonuclease MUS81 and promoting the loading of the PCNA-POLD3 replication complex in ALT telomeres.

However. the phenomena and mechanisms have remained obscure. This study found that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) leads to persistent bone dysplasia in gestational day 20 and postnatal week 12 offspring rats and increases the susceptibility to osteoporosis in postnatal week 28 offspring rats. In the embryonic period. PCE increases the concentration of serum corticosterone and inhibits the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and osteogenic differentiation genes. After birth. the recovery of IGF1 expression in PCE offspring is unable to completely compensate osteogenic function. and chronic stress can lead to a further decrease in IGF1 expression.

By using tombusviruses. small model viruses of plants. we dissect the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication by cellular WW-domain-containing proteins. which act as CIRFs. By using fusion proteins between the WW domain and the p33 replication protein. we show that the WW domain inhibits the ability of p33 to bind to the viral RNA and to other p33 and p92 replication proteins leading to inhibition of viral replication in yeast and in a cell extract. Overexpression of WW-domain protein in yeast also leads to reduction of several co-opted host factors in the viral replicase complex (VRC). These host proteins. such as eEF1A.

MEN1 is usually caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene that codes for the protein menin. Menin interacts with proteins that regulate transcription.

We describe the identification of FBP1 as an interacting partner of menin in a large-scale pull-down assay that also immunoprecipitated RBBP5. ASH2. and LEDGF. which are members of complex proteins associated with SET1 (COMPASS). a protein complex that methylates histone H3. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and Flag-pull-down assays. Furthermore. menin localized to the FUSE site on the  MYC promoter. a site that is transactivated by FBP1.

Here. we identify a series of ubiquitination-modulating enzymes that are modulated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Notably. TRIM24 is down-regulated through direct transcriptional suppression induced by VSV-activated IRF3. Reducing or ablating TRIM24 compromises type I IFN (IFN-I) induction upon RNA virus infection and thus renders mice more sensitive to VSV infection. Mechanistically. VSV infection induces abundant TRIM24 translocation to mitochondria. where TRIM24 binds with TRAF3 and directly mediates K63-linked TRAF3 ubiquitination at K429/K436. This modification of TRAF3 enables its association with MAVS and TBK1. which consequently activates downstream antiviral signaling.

To address this problem. we sought to develop automated hypothesis generation by networking at scale the MeSH terms curated by the National Library of Medicine. The result is a Mesh Term Objective Reasoning (MeTeOR) approach that tallies associations among genes. drugs and diseases from PubMed and predicts new ones.Comparisons to reference databases and algorithms show MeTeOR tends to be more reliable. We also show that many predictions based on the literature prior to 2014 were published subsequently. In a practical application. we validated experimentally a surprising new association found by MeTeOR between novel Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) associations and CDK2.

Acetylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 was the first example for non-histone protein acetylation 4. Yet the precise role of the CTD acetylation remains elusive. Lysine acetylation often creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing “reader” proteins 5. 6; surprisingly. in a proteomic screen. we identified SET as a major cellular factor whose binding with p53 is totally dependent on the CTD acetylation status.

Phosphorylated DNA-PKcs colocalizes with both gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 after DNA damage. Mutation of Thr2609 to Ala leads to radiation sensitivity and impaired DSB rejoining.

Phosphorylation can modulate enzyme activity. alter affinity to other proteins. and transmit signals through kinase cascades that often are branched and interactive. To understand the molecular basis of these regulatory mechanisms. it is necessary to determine the sites that are phosphorylated in vivo.

Here. we demonstrated that GLUT3 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and negatively linked to CRC patient outcomes. whereas GLUT1 was not associated with CRC prognosis. Under glucose-limiting conditions. GLUT3 expedited CRC cell growth by accelerating glucose input and fuelling nucleotide synthesis. Notably.

In order to profile noninvasive urinary biomarkers that could discriminate acute appendicitis from other acute abdomens. we carried out mass spectrometric experiments on urine samples from patients with different acute abdomens and evaluated diagnostic potential of urinary proteins with various machine-learning models. Firstly. outlier protein pools of acute appendicitis and controls were constructed using the discovery dataset (32 acute appendicitis and 41 control acute abdomens) against a reference set of 495 normal urine samples. Ten outlier proteins were then selected by feature selection algorithm and were applied in construction of machine-learning models using naïve Bayes. support vector machine. and random forest algorithms. The models were assessed in the discovery dataset by leave-one-out cross validation and were verified in the validation dataset (16 acute appendicitis and 45 control acute abdomens). Among the three models. random forest model achieved the best performance: the accuracy was 84.9% in the leave-one-out cross validation of discovery dataset and 83.6% (sensitivity: 81.2%. specificity: 84.4%) in the validation dataset.

However. while many proteins have been reported to undergo LLPS. quantitative and global analysis of chromatin LLPS property remains absent.Here. by combing chromatin associated protein pull-down. quantitative proteomics and 1.6-hexanediol treatment. we developed Hi-MS and defined anti-1.6-HD index of chromatin-associated proteins (AICAP) to quantitative measurement of LLPS property of chromatin-associated proteins in their endogenous state and physiological abundance. The AICAP values were verified by previously reported experiments and were reproducible across different MS platforms. Moreover. the AICAP values were highly correlate with protein functions. Proteins act in active/regulatory biological process often exhibit low AICAP values. while proteins act in structural and repressed biological process often exhibit high AICAP values. We further revealed that chromatin organization changes more in compartment A than B. and the changes in chromatin organization at various levels. including compartments. TADs and loops are highly correlated to the LLPS properties of their neighbor nuclear condensates.Our work provided the first global quantitative measurement of LLPS properties of chromatin-associated proteins and higher-order chromatin structure. and demonstrate that the active/regulatory chromatin components. both protein (trans) and DNA (cis). exhibit more hydrophobicity-dependent LLPS properties than the repressed/structural chromatin components.,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.07.415489v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/12/08/2020.12.07.415489.full.pdf,0,0,0

Activity of CRLs requires neddylation on their Cullin subunit. catalyzed by neddylation enzyme cascades E1. E2 and E3. Ube2m and Ube2f are two neddylation E2s responsible for neddylation of Cullins in CRLs1-4 or CRL5. respectively. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are specialized immunosuppressive CD4+ T lymphocytes. that play pivotal roles in maintaining immune homeostasis in vivo. Whether and how Rbx1-Rbx2/CRLs and Ube2m-Ube2f/neddylation regulate Treg cell homeostasis and function are currently unknown. Here we show that while mice with a Treg-specific deletion of Rbx2/Sag showed no obvious phenotype. mice with Rbx1 deletion in Treg cells developed an early-onset fetal inflammatory disorders and death at day ~25 after birth (~p25). with disrupted homeostasis and functions of Treg cells. indicating Rbx1 as a prominent regulator of Treg cells. Single cell transcriptome assay showed that Rbx1 is essential for the maintenance of the effector subpopulations in Treg cells. The whole genome transcriptome and proteomics analysis revealed that Rbx1 regulates several inflammatory pathways. such as T-cell receptor. IL-17. TNFα.

Although endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been already used for the treatment of human pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). their role in HPH is controversial.Methods: We induced HPH in male Sprague-Dawley rats with chronic hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of lung tissues were carried out and differentially expressed gene products were identified among the control animals. untreated animals and macitentan-treated animals with HPH.Findings: Treatment with the ERA macitentan reduced the PH-related increases in ventricular systolic pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure. reversed the decrease in pulmonary artery acceleration time. and prevented right ventricular hypertrophy. medial wall thickening and pulmonary arterial muscularization. The bioinformatic analysis revealed that macitentan has two modes of action; macitentan not only restores some proteins to nearly normal levels but also induces the overexpression of some proteins normally expressed at low levels to compensate for their lost functions. We chose one typical potential molecule from each mode and confirmed that WNK inhibition and AMPK activation both significantly ameliorated HPH. alleviated pulmonary vascular remodeling. and attenuated right heart hypertrophy.Interpretation: Our study demonstrates that macitentan has two modes of action and that both modes may be useful for mechanism discovery and the detection of new targets or biomarkers of HPH independent of macitentan.,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3378684,,,,,0,0,0

But the lack of method for profiling urine proteome in high throughput and systematic evaluation of variations in urine proteomes based on large number of population have been being the major obstacles for successfully finding new biomarkers from urine. Due to low throughput. only limited number of urine samples can be measured in discovery phase of biomarker studies. which make it hard to determine whether proteins differentially expressed between groups represent actual differences between control and disease states or just physiological variations among individuals. So. candidate biomarkers often fail in validation phase. Here. we report a streamlined workflow with capacity of measuring 8 urine proteomes per day per MS at the coverage of more than 1500 proteins.

The protein expressions of the α1 adrenergic receptor. β-arrestin-2 and Rho kinase-1 (ROCK-1). and the activity of ROCK-1 were measured by western blot. In addition. the interaction of α1-adrenergic receptor with β-arrestin-2 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. Results Compared to normal rats. the dose-response curve of the mesenteric arterioles in response to norepinephrine shifted to the right. and the EC 50 increased in the rats with portal hypertension. PEG-catalase treatment can decrease the hydrogen peroxide level in arteries. thus significantly lowered EC50 and improved the reactivity to norepinephrine of the mesenteric arterioles in portal hypertension rats. No significant difference in the α1-adrenergic receptor amounts was observed among groups. There was remarkable decreases in the protein expressions of β-arrestin-2 and its interaction with the α1-adrenergic receptor in cirrhotic rats with PEG-catalase treatment. PEG-catalase also increased the amount and activity of ROCK-1 in cirrhotic rats.

Biol,2,633,,The PH domain-containing proteins Slm1 and Slm2 were previously identified as effectors of the phosphatidylinositol-4. 5-bisphosphate (PI4. 5P2) and TORC2 signaling pathways. Here. we demonstrate that Slm1 and Slm2 are also targets of sphingolipid signaling during the heat shock response. We show that upon depletion of cellular sphingolipid levels. Slm1 function becomes essential for survival under heat stress. We further demonstrate that Slm proteins are regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle involving the sphingolipid-activated protein kinases Pkh1 and Pkh2 and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. By using a combination of mass spectrometry and mutational analysis. we identified serine residue 659 in Slm1 as a site of phosphorylation. Characterization of Slm1 mutants that mimic dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states demonstrated that phosphorylation at serine 659 is vital for survival under heat stress and promotes the proper polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Finally. we present evidence that Slm proteins are also required for the trafficking of the raft-associated arginine permease Can1 to the plasma membrane. a process that requires sphingolipid synthesis and actin polymerization. Together with previous work. our findings suggest that Slm proteins are subject to regulation by multiple signals. including PI4. 5P2.

A report that catalytically active endonuclear CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha is necessary for cell survival questions whether endonuclear. CDPcholine pathway phosphatidylcholine synthesis may occur in situ. We report that chromatin from human IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells possesses such a biosynthetic pathway. First. membrane-free nuclei retain all three CDPcholine pathway enzymes in proportions comparable to the content of chromatin associated phosphatidylcholine. Second. following supplementation of cells with deuterated choline and using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. both the timecourse and molecular species labelling pattern of newly-synthesised endonuclear and whole cell phosphatidylcholine revealed the operation of spatially separate. compositionally distinct biosynthetic routes. Specifically. endogenous and newly synthesised endonuclear phosphatidylcholine species are both characterised by a high degree of diacyl/alkylacyl chain saturation. This unusual species content and synthetic pattern (evident within 10 minutes of supplementation) is maintained through cell growth arrest by serum depletion and when proliferation is restored. suggesting that endonuclear disaturated phosphatidylcholine enrichment is essential and closely regulated. We propose that endonuclear phosphatidylcholine synthesis may regulate periodic nuclear accumulations of phosphatidylcholine-derived lipid second messengers. Furthermore. our estimates of saturated phosphatidylcholine nuclear volume occupancy of around 10% may imply a significant …,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/51430389/jbc.M009878200.full.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51430389/jbc.M009878200.full.pdf,0,0,0

83417,A Conserved Docking Motif for CK1 Binding,,Jun Qin and David M Virshup and Anjana Rao and Heidi Okamura and Carmen Garcia-Rodriguez and Holly Martinson,,,,,,In resting cells. the NFAT1 transcription factor is kept inactive in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation on multiple serine residues. These phosphorylated residues are primarily contained within two types of serine-rich motifs. the SRR-1 and SP motifs. which are conserved within the NFAT family. Several different kinases have been proposed to regulate NFAT. but no single candidate displays the specificity required to fully phosphorylate both types of motifs; thus. the identity of the kinase that regulates NFAT activity remains unclear. Here we show that the NFAT1 serine motifs are regulated by distinct kinases that must coordinate to control NFAT1 activation. CK1 phosphorylates only the SRR-1 motif. the primary region required for NFAT1 nuclear import. CK1 exists with NFAT1 in a high-molecular-weight complex in resting T cells but dissociates upon activation. GSK3 does not phosphorylate the SRR-1 region but can target the NFAT1 SP-2 motif. and it synergizes with CK1 to regulate NFAT1 nuclear export. We identify a conserved docking site for CK1 in NFAT proteins and show that mutation of this site disrupts NFAT1-CK1 interaction and causes constitutive nuclear localization of NFAT1. The CK1 docking motif is present in proteins of the Wnt. Hedgehog. and circadian-rhythm pathways. which also integrate the activities of CK1 and GSK3.The activity of transcription factors is tightly regulated by a variety of mechanisms. One class of transcription factors achieves strict regulation through control of subcellular localization. existing in an inactive or unstable state in the cytoplasm until they are activated in response to signals transduced from cell surface …,True,yt0jiB8AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jun_Qin2/publication/8583282_A_Conserved_Docking_Motif_for_CK1_Binding_Controls_the_Nuclear_Localization_of_NFAT1/links/54117c720cf2b4da1bec5023/A-Conserved-Docking-Motif-for-CK1-Binding-Controls-the-Nuclear-Localization-of-NFAT1.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jun_Qin2/publication/8583282_A_Conserved_Docking_Motif_for_CK1_Binding_Controls_the_Nuclear_Localization_of_NFAT1/links/54117c720cf2b4da1bec5023/A-Conserved-Docking-Motif-for-CK1-Binding-Controls-the-Nuclear-Localization-of-NFAT1.pdf,0,0,0

The role of sand fly saliva in transmission of the disease was investigated by injecting mice with Leishmania major parasites in the presence of homogenized salivary glands from Lutzomyia longipalpis. This procedure resulted in cutaneous lesions of Leishmania major that were routinely five to ten times as large and contained as much as 5000 times as many parasites as controls. With inocula consisting of low numbers of Leishmania major. parasites were detected at the site of injection only when the inoculum also contained salivary gland material.

Mosquitoes additionally feed on sugar meals and have specialized regions of their glands containing glycosidases and antimicrobials that might help control bacterial growth in the ingested meals. To expand our knowledge on the salivary cocktail of Ædes ægypti. a vector of dengue and yellow fevers. we analyzed a set of 4.232 expressed sequence tags from cDNA libraries of adult female mosquitoes. A nonredundant catalogue of 614 transcripts (573 of which are novel) is described. including 136 coding for proteins of a putative secretory nature. Additionally. a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of salivary gland (SG) homogenates followed by tryptic digestion of selected protein bands and MS/MS analysis revealed the expression of 24 proteins. Analysis of tissue-specific transcription of a subset of these genes revealed at least 31 genes whose expression is specific or enriched in female SG. whereas 24 additional genes were expressed in female SG and in males but not in other female tissues. Most of the 55 proteins coded by these SG transcripts have no known function and represent high-priority candidates for expression and functional analysis as antihemostatic or antimicrobial agents. An unexpected finding is the occurrence of four protein families specific to SG that were probably a product of horizontal transfer from prokaryotic organisms to mosquitoes.

Indeed. non-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes probed for a shorter period than did either sporozoite-infected or saliva-deprived mosquitoes. Salivary apyrase activity is reduced to a third following maturation of sporozoites. Apyrase activity. normally. is confined to those regions invaded by sporozoites.

Perhaps because hosts mount an active immune response against these compounds. the diversity of these compounds is large even among related blood sucking species. Because of these properties. saliva helps blood feeding as well as help the establishment of pathogens that can be transmitted during blood feeding.

Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes now serve as a powerful tool for basic research in comparative. evolutionary and developmental biology. The knowledge generated by these studies is expected to reveal molecular targets for novel vector control and pathogen transmission blocking strategies.

For 5 days. we compared relative daily biting rates of Plasmodium gallinaceum sporozoite-infected mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) and noninfected mosquitoes with an olfactometer. Mosquitoes then were exposed for 5 min to an anesthetized guinea pig. Infected mosquitoes exhibited a significant increase in olfactometer response which was also reflected in a decreased egg output.

In contrast to other hematophagous insects. the triatomine gut is compartmentalized into three segments that perform different functions during blood digestion. Here we report analysis of transcriptomes for each of the segments using pyrosequencing technology. Comparison of transcript frequency in digestive libraries with a whole-body library was used to evaluate expression levels. All classes of digestive enzymes were highly expressed. with a predominance of cysteine and aspartic proteinases. the latter showing a significant expansion through gene duplication. Although no protein digestion is known to occur in the anterior midgut (AM). protease transcripts were found. suggesting secretion as pro-enzymes. being possibly activated in the posterior midgut (PM). As expected. genes related to cytoskeleton. protein synthesis apparatus. protein traffic. and secretion were abundantly transcribed. Despite the absence of a chitinous peritrophic membrane in hemipterans - which have instead a lipidic perimicrovillar membrane lining over midgut epithelia - several gut-specific peritrophin transcripts were found. suggesting that these proteins perform functions other than being a structural component of the peritrophic membrane. Among immunity-related transcripts. while lysozymes and lectins were the most highly expressed. several genes belonging to the Toll pathway - found at low levels in the gut of most insects - were identified. contrasting with a low abundance of transcripts from IMD and STAT pathways.

New tools that target mosquito control may reduce vector populations and break the cycle of dengue transmission. Male mosquito seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are one such target since these proteins. in aggregate. modulate the reproduction and feeding patterns of the dengue vector. Aedes aegypti. As an initial step in identifying new targets for dengue vector control. we sought to identify the suite of proteins that comprise the Ae. aegypti ejaculate and determine which are transferred to females during mating.   Methodology and Principal Findings Using a stable-isotope labeling method coupled with proteomics to distinguish male- and female-derived proteins. we identified Sfps and sperm proteins transferred from males to females. Sfps were distinguished from sperm proteins by comparing the transferred proteins to sperm-enriched samples derived from testes and seminal vesicles. We identified 93 male-derived Sfps and 52 predicted sperm proteins that are transferred to females during mating.

Tick salivary secretion has been shown as important for both blood-meal completion and pathogen transmission. Here we report a duplication event of cystatin genes in its genome that results in a transcription-regulated boost of saliva inhibitory activity against a conserved and relatively limited number of vertebrate papain-like cysteine proteases during blood feeding. We further show that the polypeptide products of the two genes differ in their binding affinity for some enzyme targets. and they display different antigenicity. Moreover. our reverse genetic approach employing RNA interference uncovered a crucial mediation in tick-feeding success.

Populations were simulated with parameter values affecting size. reproductive rate. density-dependence. and transposition efficiency of the mobile element. Simulations indicated that an equilibrium was reached quickly. typically in <50 generations.

Current control strategies almost entirely rely upon insecticides. which increasingly face the problems of high cost. increasing mosquito resistance and negative effects on non-target organisms. Alternative strategies include the proposed use of inherited life-shortening agents. such as the Wolbachia bacterium. By shortening mosquito vector lifespan. Wolbachia could potentially reduce the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations. We have recently been able to stably transinfect Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the life-shortening Wolbachia strain wMelPop. and are assessing various aspects of its interaction with the mosquito host to determine its likely impact on pathogen transmission as well as its potential ability to invade A. aegypti populations.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have examined the probing behavior of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in an attempt to understand both the broader impact of Wolbachia infection on mosquito biology and. in particular. vectorial capacity. The probing behavior of wMelPop-infected mosquitoes at four adult ages was examined and compared to uninfected controls during video-recorded feeding trials on a human hand. Wolbachia-positive insects. from 15 days of age. showed a drastic increase in the time spent pre-probing and probing relative to uninfected controls.

Culicine and anopheline mosquitoes diverged ~150 MYA. and within the anophelines. the New World species diverged from those of the Old World ~95 MYA. While the sialotranscriptome (from the Greek sialo. saliva) of several species of the Cellia subgenus of Anopheles has been described thoroughly. no detailed analysis of any New World anopheline has been done to date. Here we present and analyze data from a comprehensive salivary gland (SG) transcriptome of the neotropical malaria vector Anopheles darlingi (subgenus Nyssorhynchus). A total of 2.371 clones randomly selected from an adult female An. darlingi SG cDNA library were sequenced and used to assemble a database that yielded 966 clusters of related sequences. 739 of which were singletons. Primer extension experiments were performed in selected clones to further extend sequence coverage. allowing for the identification of 183 protein sequences. 114 of which code for putative secreted proteins. Comparative analysis of sialotranscriptomes of An. darlingi and An. gambiae reveals significant divergence of salivary proteins. On average. salivary proteins are only 53% identical. while housekeeping proteins are 86% identical between the two species. Furthermore. An. darlingi proteins were found that match culicine but not anopheline proteins. indicating loss or rapid evolution of these proteins in the old world Cellia subgenus.

Pathogens invade the tick midgut. disseminate through the hemolymph and are transmitted to the vertebrate host via the salivary glands; subverting these processes could be used to interrupt pathogen transfer. Here. we use massive de novo sequencing to characterize the transcriptional dynamics of the salivary and midgut tissues of nymphal and adult I. ricinus at various time points after attachment on the vertebrate host. Members of a number of gene families show stage-and time-specific expression.

Amblyomma americanum. with a glimpse on its time dependent gene expression,2015,Shahid Karim and José MC Ribeiro,10,PLoS One,7,e0131292,Public Library of Science,Hard ticks feed for several days or weeks on their hosts. Blood feeding is assisted by tick saliva. which is injected in the host skin regularly. alternating with blood ingestion. Tick saliva contains hundreds or thousands of different peptides and other bioactive compounds that assist feeding by inhibiting their hosts’ blood clotting. platelet aggregation. vasoconstriction. as well as pain and itching. Immunomodulatory and antimicrobial peptides are also found in tick saliva. Molecular characterization of tick salivary compounds. or its sialome (from the Greek sialos = saliva). helps identification of possible antigens that might confer anti-tick immunity. as well as identifying novel pharmacologically active compounds.

83576,Aedes aegypti: model for blood finding strategy and prediction of parasite manipulation,1985,JMC Ribeiro and PA Rossignol and A Spielman,60,Experimental parasitology,1,118-132,Academic Press,Aedes aegypti mosquitoes salivate during intradermal probing of vertebrate prey before ingesting blood (Griffiths and Gordon 1952). Nonsalivating mosquitoes locate blood more slowly; this difference was ascribed to an anti-platelet activity found in the mosquito's saliva (Ribeiro et al. 1984). Mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium gallinaceum suffer pathology that specifically impairs saliva anti-hemostatic activity but without reducing volume of output (Rossignol et al. 1984). The complexity of the feeding apparatus of mosquitoes provides opportunity for a variety of strategies in which pathogens may produce specific lesions that enhance their transmission. but the variables that affect the duration of probing by mosquitoes have not been defined. We sought to resolve this complexity by identifying and quantifying relevant parameters of probing behavior.

Often these glands are the largest exocrine organs in insects and other arthropods. and they may be essential for successful feeding.

Aedes albopictus,2014,Kathryn E Boes and José MC Ribeiro and Alex Wong and Laura C Harrington and Mariana F Wolfner and Laura K Sirot,8,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,6,e2946,Public Library of Science,The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an important vector for pathogens that affect human health. including the viruses that cause dengue and Chikungunya fevers. It is also one of the world's fastest-spreading invasive species. For these reasons. it is crucial to identify strategies for controlling the reproduction and spread of this mosquito. During mating. seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are transferred from male mosquitoes to females. and these Sfps modulate female behavior and physiology in ways that influence reproduction. Despite the importance of Sfps on female reproductive behavior in mosquitoes and other insects. the identity of Sfps in Ae. albopictus has not previously been reported. We used transcriptomics and proteomics to identify 198 Sfps in Ae. albopictus. We discuss possible functions of these Sfps in relation to Ae. albopictus reproduction-related biology. We additionally compare the sequences of these Sfps with proteins (including reported Sfps) in several other species. including Ae. aegypti. While only 72 (36.4%) of Ae. albopictus Sfps have putative orthologs in Ae. aegypti. suggesting low conservation of the complement of Sfps in these species. we find no evidence for an elevated rate of evolution or positive selection in the Sfps that are shared between the two Aedes species. suggesting high sequence conservation of those shared Sfps. Our results provide a foundation for future studies to investigate the roles of individual Sfps on feeding and reproduction in this mosquito.

Disruption of host responses at the site of the tick bite may also provide an advantage for pathogens to survive and replicate. Thus. the molecules in tick saliva not only aid the tick in securing a nutrient-rich blood meal. but can also enhance the transmission and acquisition of pathogens.

Here we report a NET-destroying molecule (Lundep) from the salivary glands of Lutzomyia longipalpis. Previous analysis of the sialotranscriptome of Lu. longipalpis showed the potential presence of an endonuclease. Indeed. not only was the cloned cDNA (Lundep) shown to encode a highly active ss- and dsDNAse. but also the same activity was demonstrated to be secreted by salivary glands of female Lu. longipalpis. Lundep hydrolyzes both ss- and dsDNA with little sequence specificity with a calculated DNase activity of 300000 Kunitz units per mg of protein. Disruption of PMA (phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate)- or parasite-induced NETs by treatment with recombinant Lundep or salivary gland homogenates increases parasite survival in neutrophils. Furthermore. co-injection of recombinant Lundep with metacyclic promastigotes significantly exacerbates Leishmania infection in mice when compared with PBS alone or inactive (mutagenized) Lundep. We hypothesize that Lundep helps the parasite to establish an infection by allowing it to escape from the leishmanicidal activity of NETs early after inoculation. Lundep may also assist blood meal intake by lowering the local viscosity caused by the release of host DNA and as an anticoagulant by inhibiting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,54,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003923,4826109829251227829,/scholar?cites=4826109829251227829,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003923,0,0,0

Simulium vittatum.,1998,MARY S Cupp and JM Ribeiro and DONALD E Champagne and EDDIE W Cupp,201,Journal of experimental biology,10,1553-1561,The Company of Biologists Ltd,A cDNA was cloned from the salivary glands of a blood-feeding black fly Simulium vittatum. The encoded protein has been given the name Simulium vittatum erythema protein or SVEP. because of its ability to increase blood perfusion in skin capillaries. resulting in the well-characterized erythema of black fly bites. The full-length cDNA contains 548 base pairs which encode 152 amino acid residues of the nascent protein. Post-translational processing produces a mature. secreted protein of 133 residues with a molecular mass of 15.4 kDa. Recombinant SVEP (rSVEP) was produced in a baculovirus expression system and purified by a one-step reversed-phase HPLC procedure. Analyses of physical properties and biological potency demonstrated fidelity of rSVEP to the native protein.

A cellular immune response against a Phlebotomus papatasi salivary protein was shown to protect rodents against Leishmania major infection. In humans. P. papatasi salivary proteins induce a systemic cellular immune response as well as a specific antisaliva humoral immune response. making these salivary proteins attractive targets as markers of exposure for this Leishmania vector. Surprisingly. the repertoire of salivary proteins reported for P. papatasi–a model sand fly for Leishmania-vector-host molecular interactions–is very limited compared with other sand fly species. We hypothesize that a more comprehensive study of the transcripts present in the salivary glands of P. papatasi will provide better knowledge of the repertoire of proteins of this important vector and will aid in selection of potential immunogenic proteins for humans and of those proteins that are highly conserved between different sand fly strains.   Methods and Findings A cDNA library from P. papatasi (Tunisian strain) salivary glands was constructed. and randomly selected transcripts were sequenced and analyzed. The most abundant transcripts encoding secreted proteins were identified and compared with previously reported sequences. Importantly. we identified salivary proteins not described before in this sand fly species.

This increased potency is not due to the fact that the two analogues are not hydrolysed by the mosquito salivary apyrase. but most likely to their greater affinity to the mosquito gustatory receptor protein.

It is proposed that removal of both hydroxyl groups eliminates binding of the stimulant at the ribose moiety. thus allowing the molecule greater freedom to rotate and bind more effectively to its two other binding sites at the amino group on the purine and at the terminal phosphate.

Tick extracts were cultured with cells to enable the isolation of viruses capable of replicating in cultured invertebrate and vertebrate cells. Deep sequencing of the viral RNA isolated from culture supernatants provided the complete coding sequences for the NS3 and NS5 proteins and their molecular characterisation confirmed similarity with the NS3 and NS5 sequences from other flaviviruses. Despite this similarity. phylogenetic analyses revealed that this potentially novel virus may be a highly divergent member of the genus Flavivirus. Interestingly. we detected the divergent NS3 and NS5 sequences in ticks collected from several dairy farms widely distributed throughout three regions of Brazil.

Phlebotomus orientalis serves as the main vector of Leishmania donovani. the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Phlebotomus orientalis is present at two distant localities in Ethiopia; Addis Zemen where VL is endemic and Melka Werer where transmission of VL does not occur. To find out whether the difference in epidemiology of VL is due to distant compositions of P. orientalis saliva we established colonies from Addis Zemen and Melka Werer. analyzed and compared the transcriptomes. proteomes and enzymatic activity of the salivary glands.  Methodology/Principal Findings Two cDNA libraries were constructed from the female salivary glands of P. orientalis from Addis Zemen and Melka Werer. Clones of each P. orientalis library were randomly selected. sequenced and analyzed. In P. orientalis transcriptomes. we identified members of 13 main protein families. Phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignments were performed to evaluate differences between the P. orientalis colonies and to show the relationship with other sand fly species from the subgenus Larroussius. To further compare both colonies. we investigated the humoral antigenicity and cross-reactivity of the salivary proteins and the activity of salivary apyrase and hyaluronidase.  Conclusions This is the first report of the salivary components of P. orientalis. an important vector sand fly. Our study expanded the knowledge of salivary gland compounds of sand fly species in the subgenus Larroussius.

Accordingly. several compounds associated with blood feeding (i.e. vasodilators. anti-clotting. anti-platelets) are found only in female glands. while enzymes associated with sugar feeding or antimicrobials (such as lysozyme) are found in the glands of both sexes. We performed de novo assembly of reads from adult Aedes aegypti female and male salivary gland libraries (285 and 90 million reads. respectively). By mapping back the reads to the assembled contigs. plus mapping the reads from a publicly available Ae. aegypti library from adult whole bodies. we identified 360 transcripts (including splice variants and alleles) overexpressed tenfold or more in the glands when compared to whole bodies. Moreover. among these. 207 were overexpressed fivefold or more in female vs. male salivary glands. 85 were near equally expressed and 68 were overexpressed in male glands.

The most effective vector. Triatoma infestans. has been controlled successfully in much of Latin America using insecticide spraying. Though rarely undertaken. surveillance programs are necessary in order to identify new infestations and estimate the intensity of triatomine bug infestations in domestic and peridomestic habitats. Since hosts exposed to triatomines develop immune responses to salivary antigens. these responses can be evaluated for their usefulness as epidemiological markers to detect infestations of T. infestans.  Methodology/Principal Findings T. infestans salivary proteins were separated by 2D-gel electrophoresis and tested for their immunogenicity by Western blotting using sera from chickens and guinea pigs experimentally exposed to T. infestans. From five highly immunogenic protein spots. eight salivary proteins were identified by nano liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) and comparison to the protein sequences of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and expressed sequence tags of a unidirectionally cloned salivary gland cDNA library from T. infestans combined with the NCBI yeast protein sub-database.

Mosquito saliva also potentiates the transmission of vector borne pathogens. including arboviruses. Culex tarsalis is a bird feeding mosquito vector of West Nile Virus closely related to C. quinquefasciatus. a mosquito relatively recently adapted to feed on humans. and the only mosquito of the genus Culex to have its sialotranscriptome so far described. A total of 1.753 clones randomly selected from an adult female C. tarsalis salivary glands (SG) cDNA library were sequenced and used to assemble a database that yielded 809 clusters of related sequences. 675 of which were singletons. Primer extension experiments were performed in selected clones to further extend sequence coverage. allowing for the identification of 283 protein sequences. 80 of which code for putative secreted proteins.

Amblyomma sculptum is vector of Rickettsia rickettsii. the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. the most lethal rickettsiosis that affects humans. It is known that the transmission of pathogens by ticks is mainly associated with the physiology of the feeding process. Pathogens that are acquired with the blood meal must first colonize the tick gut and later the salivary glands in order to be transmitted during a subsequent blood feeding via saliva. Tick saliva contains a complex mixture of bioactive molecules with anticlotting. antiplatelet aggregation. vasodilatory. anti-inflammatory. and immunomodulatory properties to counteract both the hemostasis and defense mechanisms of the host. Besides facilitating tick feeding. the properties of saliva may also benefits survival and establishment of pathogens in the host.

Methods and Findings We undertook testing Tempol—a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic and pleiotropic intracellular antioxidant—in cells relevant to malaria pathogenesis in the context of coagulation and inflammation. Tempol was also tested in a murine model of CM induced by Plasmodium berghei Anka infection. Tempol was found to prevent transcription and functional expression of procoagulant tissue factor in endothelial cells (ECs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect was accompanied by inhibition of IL-6. IL-8. and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) production. Tempol also attenuated platelet aggregation and human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells oxidative burst. In dendritic cells. Tempol inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-α. IL-6. and IL-12p70. downregulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules. and prevented antigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. Notably. Tempol (20 mg/kg) partially increased the survival of mice with CM. Mechanistically. treated mice had lowered plasma levels of MCP-1. suggesting that Tempol downmodulates EC function and vascular inflammation.

This seminal fluid is transferred together with the spermatozoa during mating and induces post-mating changes in the female. Molecular characterization of seminal fluid proteins in the Mediterranean fruit fly. Ceratitis capitata. is limited. although studies suggest that some of these proteins are biologically active.   Methodology/Principal Findings We report on the functional annotation of 5914 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the testes and male accessory glands. to identify transcripts encoding putative secreted peptides that might elicit post-mating responses in females. The ESTs were assembled into 3344 contigs. of which over 33% produced no hits against the nr database. and thus may represent novel or rapidly evolving sequences. Extraction of the coding sequences resulted in a total of 3371 putative peptides. The annotated dataset is available as a hyperlinked spreadsheet. Four hundred peptides were identified with putative secretory activity. including odorant binding proteins. protease inhibitor domain-containing peptides. antigen 5 proteins. mucins. and immunity-related sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR-based analyses of a subset of putative secretory protein-encoding transcripts from accessory glands indicated changes in their abundance after one or more copulations when compared to virgin males of the same age. These changes in abundance. particularly evident after the third mating. may be related to the requirement to replenish proteins to be transferred to the female …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,35,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046812,356699287938711840,/scholar?cites=356699287938711840,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046812,0,0,0

Mali. The former is a small fishing village by the Niger River with a moderate to high densities of Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) throughout the year. while the latter is a large agricultural community 2 km inland that experiences strong seasonal fluctuation in An. gambiae densities. We estimate the population size of female An. gambiae in Fourda to be in less than 3.000 during the dry season. We found evidence of large population size and migration from Fourda in Kenieroba during the wet season. but very low numbers and no sign of migrants during the dry season. We suggest that malaria vector control measures aimed at adult mosquitoes might be made more efficient in this region and other seasonal riparian habitats by targeting disruption of mosquito populations by the river during the dry season.

Infestation loads with the cattle tick. Rhipicephalus microplus. are heritable: some breeds carry high loads of reproductively successful ticks. whereas in others. few ticks feed and reproduce efficiently. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that result in the different outcomes of infestations with cattle ticks. we examined global gene expression and inflammation induced by tick bites in skins from one resistant and one susceptible breed of cattle that underwent primary infestations with larvae and nymphs of R. microplus. We also examined the expression profiles of genes encoding secreted tick proteins that mediate parasitism in larvae and nymphs feeding on these breeds. Functional analyses of differentially expressed genes in the skin suggest that allergic contact-like dermatitis develops with ensuing production of IL-6. CXCL-8 and CCL-2 and is sustained by HMGB1. ISG15 and PKR. leading to expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that recruit granulocytes and T lymphocytes. Importantly. this response is delayed in susceptible hosts. Histopathological analyses of infested skins showed inflammatory reactions surrounding tick cement cones that enable attachment in both breeds. but in genetically tick-resistant bovines they destabilized the cone.

Haemaphysalis longicornis. We have evaluated the anti-serine protease activity of one of these H. marginatum peptides that has been given the name hyalomin-1. Hyalomin-1 was found to be a selective inhibitor of thrombin. blocking coagulation of plasma and inhibiting S2238 hydrolysis in a competitive manner with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 12 nM at an ionic strength of 150 mM. It also blocks the thrombin-mediated activation of coagulation factor XI. thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation. and the activation of coagulation factor V by thrombin. Hyalomin-1 is cleaved at a canonical thrombin cleavage site but the cleaved products do not inhibit coagulation. However. the C-terminal cleavage product showed non-competitive inhibition of S2238 hydrolysis. A peptide combining the N-terminal parts of the molecule with the cleavage region did not interact strongly with thrombin. but a 24-residue fragment containing the cleavage region and the C-terminal fragment inhibited the enzyme in a competitive manner and also inhibited coagulation of plasma. These results suggest that the peptide acts by binding to the active site as well as exosite I or the autolysis loop of thrombin.

Selenoproteins have diverse functions and many remain uncharacterized. but they are typically associated with antioxidant activity. The incorporation of selenocysteine into the nascent polypeptide chain recodes the TGA stop codon and this process depends upon a number of essential factors including the selenocysteine elongation factor (SEF). The transcriptional expression of SEF did not change significantly in tick midguts throughout the blood meal. but decreased in salivary glands to 20% at the end of the fast feeding phase. Since selenoprotein translation requires this specialized elongation factor. we targeted this gene for knockdown by RNAi to gain a global view of the role selenoproteins play in tick physiology. We found no significant differences in tick engorgement and embryogenesis but detected no antioxidant capacity in tick saliva. The transcriptional profile of selenoproteins in R. parkeri-infected Amblyomma maculatum revealed declined activity of selenoprotein M and catalase and increased activity of selenoprotein O. selenoprotein S. and selenoprotein T. Furthermore. the pathogen burden was significantly altered in SEF-knockdowns. We then determined the global impact of SEF-knockdown by RNA-seq. and mapped huge shifts in secretory gene expression that could be the result of downregulation of the Sin3 histone deacetylase corepressor complex.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082012,1206879068232674500,/scholar?cites=1206879068232674500,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082012,0,0,0

This reproductive strategy results in a large maternal investment and the deposition of a small number of progeny during a female's lifespan. The reproductive biology of tsetse has been studied on a physiological level; however the molecular analysis of tsetse reproduction requires deeper investigation. To build a foundation from which to base molecular studies of tsetse reproduction. a cDNA library was generated from female tsetse (Glossina morsitans morsitans) reproductive tissues and the intrauterine developmental stages. 3438 expressed sequence tags were sequenced and analyzed. Analysis of a nonredundant catalogue of 1391 contigs resulted in 520 predicted proteins. 475 of these proteins were full length.

Approximately 15% of the haploid genome of the parasite (5.15 Mb of genomic sequence) was obtained. A large number of known and putative genes. predicted to be involved in several cellular processes. were identified. Some genomic features were investigated. such as the general G + C content. which was found to be lower than L. major (57% versus 63%). BlastN searches revealed that 60.2% of the clusterized GSS sequences displayed similarity to L. major genomic sequences. while a BlastX search showed that 45.3% of the thus obtained predicted protein sequences showed similarity to annotated proteins of L. major.

We have studied this response using an in vivo model in which IL-12 production by splenic CD8α+ DCs is followed after systemic injection of a soluble extract (STAg) of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Our findings indicate that G-protein-coupled signaling through the chemokine receptor CCR5 plays a major role in the induction of IL-12 from these cells and that downregulation of CCR5 function through endogenously produced lipoxin explains the loss of responsiveness (paralysis) seen upon STAg reinjection.

T. cruzi is transmitted by vector feces deposited close to the wound produced by insect mouthparts. whereas T. rangeli invades salivary glands and is inoculated into the host skin. Bug saliva contains a set of nitric oxide-binding proteins. called nitrophorins. which deliver NO to host vessels and ensure vasodilation and blood feeding. NO is generated by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) present in the epithelium of bug salivary glands. Thus. T. rangeli is in close contact with NO while in the salivary glands.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show by immunohistochemical. biochemical and molecular techniques that inositolphosphate-containing glycolipids from trypanosomatids downregulate NO synthesis in the salivary glands of R. prolixus. Injecting insects with T. rangeli-derived glycoinositolphospholipids (Tr GIPL) or T. cruzi-derived glycoinositolphospholipids (Tc GIPL) specifically decreased NO production. Salivary gland treatment with Tc GIPL blocks NO production without greatly affecting NOS mRNA levels. NOS protein is virtually absent from either Tr GIPL- or Tc GIPL-treated salivary glands. Evaluation of NO synthesis by using a fluorescent NO probe showed that T. rangeli-infected or Tc GIPL-treated glands do not show extensive labeling. The same effect is readily obtained by treatment of salivary glands with the classical protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor. sodium orthovanadate (SO). This suggests that parasite GIPLs induce the inhibition of a salivary gland PTP.

To examine systematically the structural relationships among allergens and proteins of pathogens (helminths. protozoans. fungi and bacteria) as they relate to allergenicity. we compared the amino acid sequence of 499 molecularly-defined allergens with the predicted proteomes of fifteen known pathogens. including Th2 inducing helminths and Th1-inducing protozoans. and humans using a variety of bioinformatic tools. Allergenicity was assessed based on IgE prevalences using publicly accessible databases and the literature. We found multiple homologues of common allergens among proteins of helminths. protozoans. fungi and humans. but not of bacteria. In contrast. 187 allergens showed no homology with any of the microbial genera studied. Interestingly. allergens without homologues or those with limited levels of sequence conservation were the most allergenic displaying high IgE prevalences in the allergic population. There was an inverse relationship between allergenicity and amino acid conservation levels with either parasite. including helminth. or human proteins.

Precocene acted as a feeding deterrent. reducing the amount of blood eaten. and caused a high mortality at high doses. Molting was delayed in a dose-dependent manner and in several cases ecdysis was completely prevented. Large numbers of insects underwent precocious metamorphosis. A significant correlation between the prolongation of the molting cycle and morphogenetic adultoid characteristics was observed.

To guide antigen discovery for a vaccine that targets the gamut of parasitic strategies mediated by tick saliva and enables immunological memory. we exploited a transcriptome constructed from salivary glands from all stages of Rhipicephalus microplus ticks feeding on genetically tick-resistant and susceptible bovines. Different levels of host anti-tick immunity affected gene expression in tick salivary glands; we thus selected four proteins encoded by genes weakly expressed in ticks attempting to feed on resistant hosts or otherwise abundantly expressed in ticks fed on susceptible hosts; these sialoproteins mediate four functions of parasitism deployed by male ticks and that do not induce antibodies in naturally infected. susceptible bovines. We then evaluated in tick-susceptible heifers an alum-adjuvanted vaccine formulated with recombinant proteins. Parasite performance (i.e. weight and numbers of females finishing their parasitic cycle) and titres of antigen-specific antibodies were significantly reduced or increased. respectively. in vaccinated versus control heifers. conferring an efficacy of 73.2%; two of the antigens were strong immunogens. rich in predicted T-cell epitopes and challenge infestations boosted antibody responses against them.

RNA obtained from S. stercoralis L3i and L1 was co-hybridized to each array after labeling the individual samples with different fluorescent tags. Bioinformatic predictions of gene function were developed using a novel cDNA Annotation System software. We identified 935 differentially expressed genes (469 L3i-biased; 466 L1-biased) having two-fold expression differences or greater and microarray signals with a p value<0.01. Based on a functional analysis. L1 larvae have a larger number of genes putatively involved in transcription (p = 0.004). and L3i larvae have biased expression of putative heat shock proteins (such as hsp-90). Genes with products known to be immunoreactive in S. stercoralis-infected humans (such as SsIR and NIE) had L3i biased expression. Abundantly expressed L3i contigs of interest included S. stercoralis orthologs of cytochrome oxidase ucr 2.1 and hsp-90. which may be potential chemotherapeutic targets. The S. stercoralis ortholog of fatty acid and retinol binding protein-1. successfully used in a vaccine against Ancylostoma ceylanicum. was identified among the 25 most highly expressed L3i genes.

Salivary glands (SG) of males are thus much smaller and do not contain many of the antihemostatic and antiinflammatory compounds found in females. In the past 5 years. transcriptome analyses have identified nearly 70 different genes expressed in adult female SG. For most of these. no function can be assigned in either blood or sugar feeding. Exceptionally. Toxorhynchites mosquitoes are unusual in that they never feed on blood. and the SG of adults are identical in both sexes.

While most inhibitors characterized to date were found in the salivary glands. relatively few others have been identified in the midgut. Among those. Boophilin is a 2-Kunitz multifunctional inhibitor targeting thrombin. elastase. and kallikrein. However. the kinetics of Boophilin interaction with these enzymes. how it modulates platelet function. and whether it inhibits thrombosis in vivo have not been determined.   Methodology/Principal Findings Boophilin was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified to homogeneity. Using amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. we have demonstrated that Boophilin behaves as a classical. non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates by a mechanism dependent on both exosite-1 and catalytic site. Inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation. fibrin formation. and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. Notably. we also identified Boophilin as a non-competitive inhibitor of FXIa. preventing FIX activation. In addition. Boophilin inhibits kallikrein activity and the reciprocal activation. indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore. Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Finally.

How infection modulates gene expression. and affects hematophagy remains unclear.  Principal Findings Using Affimetrix chip microarray. we found that at least 43 genes are differentially expressed in the glands of Plasmodium falciparum-infected Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. Among the upregulated genes. one codes for Agaphelin. a 58-amino acid protein containing a single Kazal domain with a Leu in the P1 position. Agaphelin displays high homology to orthologs present in Aedes sp and Culex sp salivary glands. indicating an evolutionarily expanded family. Kinetics and surface plasmon resonance experiments determined that chemically synthesized Agaphelin behaves as a slow and tight inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (KD∼10 nM). but does not affect other enzymes. nor promotes vasodilation. or exhibit antimicrobial activity. TAXIscan chamber assay revealed that Agaphelin inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis toward fMLP. affecting several parameter associated with cell migration. In addition. Agaphelin reduces paw edema formation and accumulation of tissue myeloperoxidase triggered by injection of carrageenan in mice.

However. their transmission may be compromised by host resistance to repeated tick feeding. Increasing host resistance to repeated tick bites is well known in laboratory animals. including intense inflammation at the bite sites. However. it is not known whether this also occurs in wild rodents such as white-footed mice. Peromyscus leucopus and other wildlife. or if it occurs at all. According to the “host immune incompetence” hypothesis. if these wild mice would do not have a strong inflammatory response. they would not reject repeated tick bites by Ixodes scapularis. To test this hypothesis. histopathological studies were done comparing dermal inflammation in P. leucopus versus guinea pigs. Cavia porcellus. repeatedly infested with I. scapularis. In P. leucopus. the immune cell composition was like that seen in laboratory mouse models. with some differences. However. there was a broad sessile lesion with intact dermal architecture. likely enabling the ticks to continue feeding unimpeded. In contrast. in C. porcellus there was a relatively similar mixed cellular profile. but there also was a large. leucocyte-filled cavitary lesion and scab-like hyperkeratotic changes to the epidermal layer. along with itching and apparent pain. Ticks attached to sensitized C. porcellus fed poorly or were dislodged. presumably due to the weakened anchoring of the tick’s mouthparts cemented in the heavily inflamed and disintegrating dermal tissues.

Ae. albopictus females exhibit a generalist host seeking as well as a very aggressive biting behaviour that are responsible for its high degree of nuisance. Several complex mosquito behaviours such as host seeking. feeding. mating or oviposition rely on olfactory stimuli that target a range of sensory neurons localized mainly on specialized head appendages such as antennae. maxillary palps and the mouthparts. With the aim to describe the Ae. albopictus olfactory repertoire we have used RNA-seq to reveal the transcriptome profiles of female antennae and maxillary palps. Male heads and whole female bodies were employed as reference for differential expression analysis.

Immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory components are also found in these organisms' saliva. Blood feeding evolved at least ten times within arthropods. providing a scenario of convergent evolution for the solution of the salivary potion. Perhaps because of immune pressure from hosts. the salivary proteins of related organisms have considerable divergence. and new protein families are often found within different genera of the same family or even among subgenera. Fleas radiated with their vertebrate hosts. including within the mammal expansion initiated 65 million years ago. Currently. only one flea species–the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis–has been investigated by means of salivary transcriptome analysis to reveal salivary constituents. or sialome. We present the analysis of the sialome of cat flea Ctenocephaides felis.   Methodology and Critical Findings A salivary gland cDNA library from adult fleas was randomly sequenced. assembled. and annotated.

An. gambiae. In aid of future genomic sequencing of An. funestus. we explored the whole body transcriptome. derived from mixed stage progeny of wild-caught females from Mali. West Africa.  Principal Findings Here we report the functional annotation and comparative genomics of 2.005 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from An. funestus. which were assembled with a previous EST set from adult female salivary glands from the same mosquito. The assembled ESTs provided for a nonredundant catalog of 1.035 transcripts excluding mitochondrial sequences.  Conclusions/Significance Comparison of the An. funestus and An. gambiae transcriptomes using computational and macroarray approaches revealed a high degree of sequence identity despite an estimated 20–80 MY divergence time between lineages. A phylogenetically broader comparative genomic analysis indicated that the most rapidly evolving proteins– those involved in immunity. hematophagy. formation of extracellular structures. and hypothetical conserved proteins– are those that probably play important roles in how mosquitoes adapt to their nutritional and external environments. and therefore could be of greatest interest in disease control.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007976,6144126374691911981,/scholar?cites=6144126374691911981,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007976,0,0,0

In Brazil. two species of ticks in the genus Amblyomma. A. sculptum and A. aureolatum. are incriminated as vectors of this bacterium. Importantly. these two species present remarkable differences in susceptibility to R. rickettsii infection. where A. aureolatum is more susceptible than A. sculptum. In the current study. A. aureolatum and A. sculptum ticks were fed on suitable hosts previously inoculated with R. rickettsii. mimicking a natural infection. As control. ticks were fed on non-infected animals. Both midgut and salivary glands of all positively infected ticks were colonized by R. rickettsii. We did not observe ticks with infection restricted to midgut. suggesting that important factors for controlling rickettsial colonization were produced in this organ. In order to identify such factors. the total RNA extracted from the midgut was submitted to new generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The majority of the coding sequences (CDSs) of A. sculptum differentially expressed by infection were upregulated. whereas most of modulated CDSs of A. aureolatum were downregulated. The functional categories that comprise upregulated CDSs of A. sculptum. for instance. metabolism. signal transduction. protein modification. extracellular matrix. and immunity also include genes of A. aureolatum that were downregulated by infection.

An. gambiae SGH agglutinates red blood cells (RBC) from humans. horse. sheep. goat. pig. and cow; it is less active for rats RBC. and not detectable for guinea-pigs or chicken RBC.

Methodology/Principal Findings Herein. we prepared a mixture of ADO and AMP in equimolar amounts similar to those present in the salivary-gland extract (SGE) form one pair of salivary glands of P. papatasi and co-injected it with Leishmania amazonensis or L. major into mouse ears. ADO+AMP mimicked exacerbative effects of P. papatasi saliva in leishmaniasis. increasing parasite burden and cutaneous lesions. Enzymatic catabolism of salivary nucleosides reversed the SGE-induced immunosuppressive effect associated with IL-10 enhancement. Immunosuppressive factors COX2 and IL-10 were upregulated and failed to enhance ear lesion and parasite burden in IL 10-/- infected mice.

Nitrophorins. in addition to storing and transporting NO. have two other functions such as anti-histaminic and anti-clotting (displayed by nitrophorin 2 only). Additionally. nitrophorins display a thiol oxidase reaction. where cysteine is oxidized to cystine with the production of hydrogen peroxide. In this paper the heme-peroxidase reaction of nitrophorins is described. The heme moiety of nitrophorins is destroyed by addition of cysteine or hydrogen peroxide. No biliverdin is produced during this reaction.

Panstrongylus lignarius. also known as Panstrongylus herreri. is considered one of the most versatile triatomines because it can parasitize different hosts. it is found in different habitats and countries. it has sylvatic. peridomestic and domestic behavior and it is a very important vector of Chagas disease. especially in Peru. Molecules produced and secreted by salivary glands and fat body are considered of important adaptational value for triatomines because. among other functions. they subvert the host haemostatic. inflammatory and immune systems and detoxify or protect them against environmental aggressors. In this context. the elucidation of the molecules produced by these tissues is highly valuable to understanding the ability of this species to adapt and transmit pathogens.

These proteins are normally derived from small. secreted. structurally malleable protein families that can be modified to bind ligands that are important in hemostatic. inflammatory. and immune responses. Since blood feeding has evolved numerous times. different protein families are employed for this purpose. So far. these families have been found to include the lipocalins. odorant-binding proteins. antigen 5. and pathogenesis-related protein 1 (CAP) type proteins and the insect yellow proteins.

More than 75% of human genes have structural isoforms of transcripts. but to date few studies have been conducted to verify the alternative splicing systematically.  Methodology/Principal Findings The present study used expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and EST tagged SNP patterns to examine the transcript structure variations resulting from allelic gene structure variations in the major human malaria vector. Anopheles gambiae. About 80% of 236.004 available A. gambiae ESTs were successfully aligned to A. gambiae reference genomes. More than 2.340 transcript structure variation events were detected. Because the current A. gambiae annotation is incomplete. we re-annotated the A. gambiae genome with an A. gambiae-specific gene model so that the effect of variations on gene coding could be better evaluated. A total of 15.962 genes were predicted. Among them. 3.873 were novel genes and 12.089 were previously identified genes. The gene completion rate improved from 60% to 84%.

The population is modeled by a three-parameter equation describing host reproductive capacity. population size and the strength of the density dependence. while TE dynamics were modeled based also on three parameters. the maximum ability of the element to copy itself in the absence of regulation (T0). the regulatory effect of copy number decreasing transposition (C0.5). and the deleterious effect of each new transposition on host fitness (d).

Plasmodium vivax infections are rare in sub-Saharan Africa due to the absence of the Duffy blood group antigen (Duffy antigen). the only known erythrocyte receptor for the P. vivax merozoite invasion ligand. Duffy binding protein 1 (DBP1). However. P. vivax infections have been documented in Duffy-negative individuals throughout Africa. suggesting that P. vivax may use ligands other than DBP1 to invade Duffy-negative erythrocytes through other receptors. To identify potential P. vivax ligands. we compared parasite gene expression in Saimiri and Aotus monkey erythrocytes infected with P. vivax Salvador I (Sal I).

Here we report the first inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation derived from the salivary glands of a black fly (Simulium nigrimanum). named Simplagrin.  Methods and Findings Simplagrin was expressed in mammalian cells and purified by affinity-and size-exclusion chromatography. Light-scattering studies showed that Simplagrin has an elongated monomeric form with a hydrodynamic radius of 5.6 nm. Simplagrin binds to collagen (type I-VI) with high affinity (2–15 nM). and this interaction does not involve any significant conformational change as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Simplagrin-collagen interaction is both entropically and enthalpically driven with a large negative ΔG. indicating that this interaction is favorable and occurs spontaneously. Simplagrin specifically inhibits von Willebrand factor interaction with collagen type III and completely blocks platelet adhesion to collagen under flow conditions at high shear rates; however. Simplagrin failed to block glycoprotein VI and Iα2β1 interaction to collagen. Simplagrin binds to RGQOGVMGF peptide with an affinity (KD 11 nM) similar to that of Simplagrin for collagen. Furthermore. Simplagrin prevents laser-induced carotid thrombus formation in vivo without significant bleeding in mice and could be useful as an antithrombotic agent in thrombosis related disease.

Stomoxys calcitrans. is a major blood-feeding pest of livestock that has near worldwide distribution. causing an annual cost of over $2 billion for control and product loss in the United States alone. Control of these flies has been limited to increased sanitary management practices and insecticide application for suppressing larval stages. Few genetic and molecular resources are available to help in developing novel methods for controlling stable flies.This study examines stable fly biology by utilizing a combination of high-quality genome sequencing. microbiome analyses. and RNA-seq analyses targeting multiple developmental stages and tissues. In conjunction. manual curation of over 1600 genes was used to examine gene content related to stable fly reproduction. interactions with their host. host-microbe dynamics. and putative routes for control. Most notable was establishment of reproduction-associated genes and identification of expanded vision. chemosensation. immune repertoire. and metabolic detoxification pathway gene families.The combined sequencing. assembly. and curation of the male stable fly genome followed by RNA-seq and downstream analyses provide insights necessary to understand the biology of this important pest. These resources and knowledge will provide the groundwork for expanding the tools available to control stable fly infestations.

The cement is an adhesive substance that helps the attachment of the tick to the host skin. while the saliva contains a rich mixture of antihemostatic. anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory substances that allow ticks to properly acquire the blood meal. The tick saliva is also a vehicle used by several pathogens to be transmitted to the vertebrate host. including various bacterial species from the genus Rickettsia. Rickettsia rickettsii is a tick-borne obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the severe Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In Brazil. the dog yellow tick Amblyomma aureolatum is vector of R. rickettsii. In the current study. the effects of an experimental infection with R. rickettsii on the global gene expression profile of A. aureolatum SG was determined by next-generation RNA sequencing.

C5b and C9b on agarose-coated plates in a dose dependent manner. It also inhibited the activation of factor B in normal serum. but had no effect on the components of the membrane attack complex.

Clogmia lost maternal germ plasm. which contributes to embryo polarity in fruit flies (Drosophila). In culicine (Culex. Aedes) and anopheline mosquitoes (Anopheles). embryo polarity rests on a previously unnamed zinc finger gene (cucoid). or pangolin (dTcf). respectively. These genes also localize an alternative transcript isoform at the anterior egg pole. Basal-branching crane flies (Nephrotoma) also enrich maternal pangolin transcript at the anterior egg pole. suggesting that pangolin functioned as ancestral axis determinant in flies.

Here we provide direct experimental evidence showing that the juvenile hormone-binding protein (mJHBP) of Aedes aegypti is required for the regulation of innate immune responses and the development of mosquito blood cells (hemocytes). Using an mJHBP-deficient mosquito line generated by means of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology we uncovered a mutant phenotype characterized by immunosuppression at the humoral and cellular levels. which profoundly affected susceptibility to bacterial infection. Bacteria-challenged mosquitoes exhibited significantly higher levels of septicemia and mortality relative to the wild type (WT) strain. delayed expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). severe developmental dysregulation of embryonic and larval hemocytes (reduction in the total number of hemocytes) and increased differentiation of the granulocyte lineage. Interestingly. injection of recombinant wild type mJHBP protein into adult females three-days before infection was sufficient to restore normal immune function.

More importantly. the recovery of normal immuno-activation and hemocyte development requires the capability of mJHBP to bind JH III.

Haematobia irritans,2019,JM Ribeiro and Humberto Julio Debat and M Boiani and X Ures and S Rocha and M Breijo,20,BMC genomics,1,616,BioMed Central,The horn fly (Haematobia irritans) is an obligate blood feeder that causes considerable economic losses in livestock industries worldwide. The control of this cattle pest is mainly based on insecticides; unfortunately. in many regions. horn flies have developed resistance. Vaccines or biological control have been proposed as alternative control methods. but the available information about the biology or physiology of this parasite is rather scarce. We present a comprehensive description of the salivary and midgut transcriptomes of the horn fly (Haematobia irritans). using deep sequencing achieved by the Illumina protocol. as well as exploring the virome of this fly. Comparison of the two transcriptomes allow for identification of uniquely salivary or uniquely midgut transcripts. as identified by statistically differential transcript expression at a level of 16 x or more.

West Africa,2011,Nicholas C Manoukis and Ibrahima Baber and Moussa Diallo and Nafomon Sogoba and Jose MC Ribeiro,6,PloS one,11,e26910,Public Library of Science,The direction and magnitude of movement by the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae Giles has been of great interest to medical entomologists for over 70 years. This direction of movement is likely to be affected by many factors. from environmental conditions and stage of life history of the mosquito to the existence of attractants in the vicinity. We report here the direction of movement of newly emerged An. gambiae in nature. around the village of Donéguébougou. Mali. We assessed the direction of movement for individual mosquitoes by placing them in a novel enclosure with exit traps oriented in the direction of the cardinal and intermediate points of the compass. We consistently found predominantly Southward directions of movement during 2009 and 2010. with an additional Eastward component during the dry season and a Westward one during the wet season. Our data indicate that wind has an important effect on the direction of movement. but that this effect varied by season: Average directions of movement were downwind during the dry season and upwind during the wet season. A switch in anemotactic response suggests that the direction of movement of An. gambiae relative to the wind immediately after emergence under varying conditions of humidity should be further investigated under controlled conditions.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026910,8066146825436287779,/scholar?cites=8066146825436287779,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026910,0,0,0

Diaz and coworkers report that a possible etiological link exists between Fogo selvagem. an autoimmune disease. and previous exposure to the salivary antigens of blood-sucking insects. Although the audience of this Journal may be well acquainted with skin autoimmune diseases. the issue of insect saliva may recall only annoying allergic responses to unspecific antigens displayed by many patients. Why did evolution develop salivary molecules that displease us. substances that should be counterproductive to insect feeding. by eliciting the defense reactions of the insects prey? The interplay of hematophagous arthropod salivary molecules and their prey’s immune reaction is a problem that insects have dealt with for at least 300 million years. well before we mammals came to think we dominate the planet. Insects are an extremely successful branch of animals. able to exploit any kind of food source on land. including the blood of vertebrates. The number of blood-sucking insect species. well over 15.000. approaches the number of land vertebrates. The vast number of insect families and orders allowed hematophagy to evolve independently several times. even within a single insect order. such as the Diptera or the Hemiptera (Ribeiro. 1995). Ticks. which are spiders. not insects. have also skillfully exploited this food resource. What adaptations make a successful blood sucker?

We have evaluated protein-and DNA-based vaccines using a challenge model that more closely reproduces the pathology and immunity associated with sand fly transmitted infection. namely inoculation of a low number of Leishmania major metacyclic promastigotes into a dermal site. Adaptive immunity in this model revealed a requirement for CD8+ T lymphocytes. and the maintenance of memory effector T cells required long term antigen persistence. Using this natural challenge model. DNA vaccines were far more potent and durable in conferring protection than protein antigens plus interleukin-12 (IL-12). In the course of developing a reproducible sand fly challenge system to evaluate experimental vaccines. a novel approach to vaccination against cutaneous leishmaniasis was suggested. Prior exposure of mice to the bites of uninfected Phlebotomus papatasi sand flies conferred powerful protection against L. major that was associated with a strong delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. and especially interferon-g (IFN-g) production. at the site of parasite delivery. A DNA vaccine encoding a salivary protein from P. papatasi sensitised mice to produce a strong DTH response to sand fly bites and provided powerful protection in mice challenged with L. major parasites plus salivary gland homogenates.

Aedes albopictus. is a highly dangerous invasive vector of numerous medically important arboviruses including dengue. chikungunya and Zika. In four decades it has spread from tropical Southeast Asia to many parts of the world in both tropical and temperate climes. The rapid invasion process of this mosquito is supported by its high ecological and genetic plasticity across different life history traits. Our aim was to investigate whether wild populations. both native and adventive. also display transcriptional genetic variability for functions that may impact their biology. behaviour and ability to transmit arboviruses. such as sensory perception. Antennal transcriptome data were derived from mosquitoes from a native population from Ban Rai. Thailand and from three adventive Mediterranean populations: Athens. Greece and Arco and Trento from Italy. Clear inter-population differential transcriptional activity was observed in different gene categories related to sound perception. olfaction and viral infection. The greatest differences were detected between the native Thai and the Mediterranean populations. The two Italian populations were the most similar. Nearly one million quality filtered SNP loci were identified. The ability to express this great inter-population transcriptional variability highlights. at the functional level. the remarkable genetic flexibility of this mosquito species.

The female spermatheca is responsible for the maintenance. nourishment. and protection of the male sperm against damage during storage. Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arboviruses. including Yellow Fever. Dengue. Chikungunya. and Zika. Vector control is difficult due to this mosquito high reproductive capacity. Following comparative RNA-seq analyses of spermathecae obtained from virgin and inseminated females. eight transcripts were selected based on their putative roles in sperm maintenance and survival. including energy metabolism. chitin components. transcriptional regulation. hormonal signaling. enzymatic activity. antimicrobial activity. and ionic homeostasis. In situ RNA hybridization confirmed tissue-specific expression of the eight transcripts. Following RNA interference (RNAi). observed outcomes varied between targeted transcripts. affecting mosquito survival. egg morphology. fecundity. and sperm motility within the spermathecae. This study identified spermatheca-specific transcripts associated with sperm storage in Ae. aegypti. Using RNAi we characterized the role of eight spermathecal transcripts on various aspects of female fecundity and offspring survival. RNAi-induced knockdown of transcript AeSigP-66.427. coding for a Na+/Ca2+ protein exchanger. specifically interfered with egg production and reduced sperm motility.

Recent transcriptomic studies have revealed over one thousand different transcripts coding for secreted polypeptides in a single tick species. These gene products belong to many expanded families such as the lipocalins. metalloproteases. Antigen-5. cystatins. apyrases. as well as families that are found exclusively in ticks. such as the evasins. Isac. DAP36 and many others. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequences indicate that the salivary genes exhibit an increased rate of evolution due to a lower evolutionary constraint and/or positive selection. allowing for a large diversity of tick salivary proteins. Thus. for each new tick species that has its salivary transcriptome sequenced and assembled. a formidable task of annotation of these transcripts awaits. Currently. as of November 2019. there are over 287 thousand coding sequences deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) that are derived from tick salivary gland mRNA.

One of the major challenges in P. falciparum proteomics studies is identifying PfEMP1s at the protein level due to antigenic variation. To identify these PfEMP1s using shotgun proteomics. we developed a pipeline that searches high-resolution mass spectrometry spectra against a custom protein sequence database. A local alignment algorithm. LAX. was developed as a part of the pipeline that matches peptide sequences to the most similar PfEMP1 and calculates a weight value based on peptide’s uniqueness used for PfEMP1 protein inference.

Anopheles darlingi diverged from the African and Asian malaria vectors similar to 100 million years ago (mya) and successfully adapted to the New World environment. Here we present an annotated reference A. darlingi genome. sequenced from a wild population of males and females collected in the Brazilian Amazon. A total of 10 481 predicted protein-coding genes were annotated. 72% of which have their closest counterpart in Anopheles gambiae and 21% have highest similarity with other mosquito species. In spite of a long period of divergent evolution. conserved gene synteny was observed between A. darlingi and A. gambiae. More than 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and short indels with potential use as genetic markers were identified. Transposable elements correspond to 2.3% of the A. darlingi genome. Genes associated with hematophagy. immunity and insecticide resistance. directly involved in vector-human and vector-parasite interactions. were identified and discussed. This study represents the first effort to sequence the genome of a neotropical malaria vector. and opens a new window through which we can contemplate the evolutionary history of anopheline mosquitoes. It also provides valuable information that may lead to novel strategies to reduce malaria transmission on the South American continent.

While this phenomenon is best associated with mammals. it is observed in insects such as the viviparous cockroach. Diploptera punctata.

This insect is also one of the most important models in insect physiology. especially regarding the blood-feeding process. However. studies on R. prolixus genetics lagged behind and our understanding on the regulation of gene expression is incipient. Transcriptomes have the power to study the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment. A comprehensive R. prolixus transcriptome was performed in 2014. sequencing RNA from different tissues (anterior gut. midgut. posterior gut. rectum. ovaries. fat body. maphigian tubules and testes). However. on the occasion. only the gut transcriptome was deeply analysed. Here we evaluated the results of the testes transcriptome of R. prolixus with the objective to find and understand genes that could have an important role in male reproduction. We found that. from the 25.673 transcripts assembled in the whole transcriptome. 5.365 have a testis specific expression pattern. As expected. amongst the most abundant families of transcripts. are those related to spermatogenesis and male fertility. such as myosins. actins and dyneins. For our surprise. lipocalins. serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and lysozymes also were highly abundant in testes. The role of these classes of genes are well known in other tissues. such as salivary glands and gut. but very little is known on their role in testes (there are only a few hypothesis) and it would be interesting to further study the role of these genes on R. prolixus male fertility.

Bras. Parasitol. Vet,suplemento 1,135,,Tick infestations can be controlled by immunobiological strategies. however the complexity of the tick-host interface will require a multi-component. multi-effector anti-tick vaccine. High throughput genomic strategies for antigen discovery and the description of the immune correlates of effective anti-tick immune responses compose the dual strategy that we adopt in order to determine the specifications of an anti-tick vaccine. For identification of useful antigens. the transcriptomes of ovaries. hemocytes and salivary glands from rapidly ingurgitating females and of salivary glands from males of Boophilus microplus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus were PCR-amplified and the ESTs of random clones were mass sequenced. So far. more than 2 400 ESTs have been generated for these tissues. Bioinformatic treatment of the ESTs indicated approximately 30% of novelty. depending on the tissue studied. and identified clones with similarities to genes involved in defense. development. hematophagy and escape mechanisms. Many of these constitute candidate antigens. Regarding anti-tick immunity. we exploit the contrasting phenotypes of tick infestations in genetically resistant and susceptible breeds of cattle in order to obtain the correlates of the immune response that effectively interfere with the tick's blood meal.

Once ingested by a flea. Y. pestis establish a replicative niche in the gut and produce a biofilm that promotes foregut colonization and transmission. The rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis is an important vector to several zoonotic bacterial pathogens including Y. pestis. Some fleas naturally clear themselves of infection; however. the physiological and immunological mechanisms by which this occurs are largely uncharacterized. To address this. RNA was extracted. sequenced. and distinct transcript profiles were assembled de novo from X. cheopis digestive tracts isolated from fleas that were either: 1) not fed for 5 days; 2) fed sterile blood; or 3) fed blood containing ~5x108 CFU/ml Y. pestis KIM6+. Analysis and comparison of the transcript profiles resulted in identification of 23 annotated (and 11 unknown or uncharacterized) digestive tract transcripts that comprise the early transcriptional response of the rat flea gut to infection with Y. pestis. The data indicate that production of antimicrobial peptides regulated by the immune-deficiency pathway (IMD) is the primary flea immune response to infection with Y. pestis. The remaining infection-responsive transcripts. not obviously associated with the immune response. were involved in at least one of 3 physiological themes: 1) alterations to chemosensation and gut peristalsis; 2) modification of digestion and metabolism; and 3) production of chitin-binding proteins (peritrophins).

Here we show that patients suffering from severe malaria had increased amounts of circulating DNA and increased neutrophil elastase (NE) levels in plasma. We used cultured erythrocytes and isolated human neutrophils to show that Plasmodium-infected red blood cells release macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). which in turn caused NET formation by neutrophils in a mechanism dependent on the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). NET production was dependent on histone citrullination by peptidyl arginine deiminase-4 (PAD4) and independent of reactive oxygen species (ROS). myeloperoxidase (MPO) or NE. In vitro. NETs functioned to restrain parasite dissemination in a mechanism dependent on MPO and NE activities. Finally.

83847,Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus Infection Alters the Sialome of Ixodes ricinus Ticks During the Earliest Stages of Feeding,2020,Charles E Hart and Jose M Ribeiro and Maria Kazimirova and Saravanan Thangamani,10,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,,41,Frontiers,Ticks are hematophagous arthropods that transmit a number of pathogens while feeding. Among these is tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). a flavivirus transmitted by Ixodes ricinus ticks in the temperate zone of Europe. The infection results in febrile illness progressing to encephalitis and meningitis with a possibility of fatality or long-term neurological sequelae. The composition of tick saliva plays an essential role in the initial virus transmission during tick feeding. Ticks secrete a diverse range of salivary proteins to modulate the host response. such as lipocalins to control the itch and inflammatory response. and both proteases and protease inhibitors to prevent blood coagulation. Here. the effect of viral infection of adult females of I. ricinus was studied with the goal of determining how the virus alters the tick sialome to modulate host tissue response at the site of infection. Uninfected ticks or those infected with TBEV were fed on mice and removed and dissected one- and three-hours post-attachment. RNA from the salivary glands of these ticks. as well as from unfed ticks. was extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the expression of key secreted proteins at each timepoint. Genes showing statistically significant up- or down-regulation between infected and control ticks were selected and compared to published literature to ascertain their function. From this. the effect of tick viral infection on the modulation of the tick-host interface was determined. Infected ticks were found to differentially express a number of uncategorized genes. proteases.

Although most of the proteinaceous fraction of tick saliva is of little immunogenicity. repeated feeding of ticks on mammalian hosts may lead to impairment of tick feeding. preventing full engorgement. Here. we challenged rabbits with repeated feeding of both Ixodes ricinus nymphs and adults and observed the formation of specific antibodies against several tick salivary proteins. Repeated feeding of both I. ricinus stages led to a gradual decrease in engorged weights. To identify the salivary antigens. isolated immunoglobulins from repeatedly infested rabbits were utilised for a protein pull-down from the saliva of pilocarpine-treated ticks. Eluted antigens were first identified by peptide mass fingerprinting with the aid of available I. ricinus salivary gland transcriptomes originating from early phases of tick feeding. To increase the authenticity of immunogens identified. we also performed. for the first time. de novo assembly of the sialome from I. ricinus females fed for six days. a timepoint used for pilocarpine-salivation. The most dominant I. ricinus salivary immunogens identified in our study were zinc-dependent metalloproteases of three different families.

Here. we have identified Lufaxin. a protein component in saliva. as the inhibitor of the AP. Lufaxin inhibited the deposition of C3b. Bb. Properdin. C5b. and C9b on agarose-coated plates in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited the activation of factor B in normal serum. but had no effect on the components of the membrane attack complex. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated that Lufaxin stabilizes the C3b-B proconvertase complex when passed over a C3b surface in combination with factor B. Lufaxin was also shown to inhibit the activation of factor B by factor D in a reconstituted C3b-B. but did not inhibit the activation of C3 by reconstituted C3b-Bb. Proconvertase stabilization does not require the presence of divalent cations. but addition of Ni (2+) increases the stability of complexes formed on SPR surfaces. Stabilization of the C3b-B complex to prevent C3 convertase formation (C3b-Bb formation) is a novel mechanism that differs from previously described strategies used by other organisms to inhibit the AP of the host complement system.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC,0,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/23154,,,,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/bitstream/icict/23154/2/vladimir_vale_ertal_IOC_2017.pdf,0,0,0

Inhibitors of the complement system have been described in the saliva of hematophagous arthropods that are involved in the protection of digestive tissues against complement system-mediated damage. In this study. we describe albicin. a novel inhibitor of the alternative pathway of complement from the salivary glands of the malaria vector. Anopheles albimanus The inhibitor was purified from salivary gland homogenates by reverse-phase HPLC and identified by mass spectrometry as a small (13.4-kDa) protein related to the gSG7 protein of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi Recombinant albicin was produced in Escherichia coli and found to potently inhibit lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in assays of the alternative pathway while having no inhibitory effect on the classical or lectin pathways. Albicin also inhibited the deposition of complement components on agarose-coated plates. although it could not remove previously bound components. Antisera produced against recombinant albicin recognized both the native and recombinant inhibitors and also blocked their activities in in vitro assays. Using surface plasmon resonance and enzymatic assays. we found that albicin binds and stabilizes the C3-convertase complex (C3bBb) formed on a properdin surface and inhibits the convertase activity of a reconstituted C3bBb complex in solution. The data indicate that albicin specifically recognizes the activated form of the complex. allowing more efficient inhibition by …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC,0,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/23742,,,,,0,0,0
83864,Transposition burst of mariner-like elements in the sequenced genome of Rhodnius prolixus,2016,A Granzotto and JM Ribeiro and CMA Carareto,,Insect biochemistry and molecular biology,,,Elsevier Ltd,Transposable elements (TEs) are widespread in insect's genomes. However. there are wide differences in the proportion of the total DNA content occupied by these repetitive sequences in different species. We have analyzed the TEs present in R. prolixus (vector of the Chagas disease) and showed that 3.0% of this genome is occupied by Class II TEs. belonging mainly to the Tc1-mariner superfamily (1.65%) and MITEs (1.84%). Interestingly. most of this genomic content is due to the expansion of two subfamilies belonging to: irritans himar. a well characterized subfamily of mariners. and prolixus1. one of the two novel subfamilies here described. The high amount of sequences in these subfamilies suggests that bursts of transposition occurred during the life cycle of this family. In an attempt to characterize these elements. we performed an in silico analysis of the sequences corresponding to the DDD/E domain of the transposase gene. We performed an evolutionary analysis including network and Bayesian coalescent-based methods in order to infer the dynamics of the amplification. as well as to estimate the time of the bursts identified in these subfamilies. Given our data. we hypothesized that the TE expansions occurred around the time of speciation of R. Â prolixus around 1.4Â mya. This suggestion lays on the â Transposon Modelâ of TE evolution. in which the members of a TE population that are replicative active are present at multiple loci in the genome. but their replicative potential varies. and of the â Life Cycle Modelâ that states that when present-day TEs have been involved in amplification bursts. they share an ancestral copy that dates …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC,0,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201700022752,,,,,0,0,0

Angiogenesis and inflammation are key factors mediating the pathogenesis of AMD. Activation of tissue factor. a cell surface protein. can lead to angiogenic and inflammatory stimulation. Increased expression of tissue factor has been linked to AMD in mouse models and patients. This study aimed to evaluate if inhibition of tissue factor activity via a small protein. Ixolaris. could reduce the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory responses in human retinal pigmented epithelial (ARPE-19) cells and our Ccl2-/-/Cx3cr1-/-rd8 (DKO rd8) mouse model.Methods: A factor X cleavage assay was used to assess the inhibitory effects of Ixolaris on tissue factor in ARPE-19 cells. Cells were grown for 24 hours. washed. and incubated with 1 nM FVIIa and 100 nM FX with or without 10 nM Ixolaris for one hour. FX cleavage by tissue factor was measured using chromogenic substrate S2222. DKO rd8 mice were injected intravitreally with 1.5 μg of Ixolaris in one eye and PBS control in the other. Fundus images were recorded and graded monthly post-injection. Functional analysis was performed using electroretinography (ERG) recordings in dark and light-adapted conditions with UV and green light stimulation. Two months later. eyes were enucleated and processed for histology. electron microscopy. molecular analysis. and measurement of A2E. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.Results: Ixolaris was a potent inhibitor of tissue factor in ARPE-19 cells. as evidenced by the lack of FXa generation in Ixolaris-treated cells.

Here we have identified and characterized the main salivary anticoagulant (Cufaxapin) from Culex quinquesfaciatus. Cufaxapin. an atypical member of the serpin superfamily. is a tight. non‐covalent. competitive inhibitor of FXa with a calculated affinity (KD) of 56pM as determined by SPR analysis. Cufaxapin inhibits prothrombinase activity and significantly increases both PT and aPTT. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that Cufaxapin binds to FXa in a stoichiometric (1:1) way with a favorable ΔH of ‐34.12±0.26 kcal/mol. This interaction does not undergo detectable conformational change as determined by CD spectroscopy.

Lopap. a BBP-like protein from the venom of the toxic caterpillar Lonomia obliqua has been reported to act as a serine protease that activates the coagulation proenzyme prothrombin. Here we show that BBPLo. a variant of lopap from the same organism binds biliverdin IXγ. forming a complex that is spectrally identical with previously described BBP proteins. Although BBPLo is nearly identical in sequence to lopap. no prothrombinase activity was detected in our recombinant preparations using reconstituted systems containing coagulation factors Xa and Va. as well as anionic phospholipids. In addition to biliverdin. BBPLo was found to form a 1∶1 complex with heme prompting us to examine whether the unusual biliverdin IXγ ligand of BBPs forms as a result of oxidation of bound heme in situ rather than by a conventional heme oxygenase. Using ascorbate or a NADPH+-ferredoxin reductase-ferredoxin system as a source of reducing equivalents. spectral changes are seen that suggest an initial reduction of heme to the Fe(II) state and formation of an oxyferrous complex. The complex then disappears and a product identified as a 5-coordinate carbonyl complex of verdoheme. an intermediate in the biosynthesis of biliverdin. is formed. However. further reaction to form biliverdin was not observed. making it unlikely that biliverdin IXγ is formed by this pathway.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095424,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095424,0,0,0

As in all hematophagous arthropods. its saliva contains a complex cocktail that assists blood feeding by preventing platelet aggregation and blood  clotting and promoting vasodilation. These salivary components can be immunologically recognized by their vector's hosts and targeted with antibodies that might disrupt blood feeding. These antibodies can be used to detect vector exposure using immunoassays. Antibodies may also contribute to the fast evolution of the salivary cocktail. METHODOLOGY: Salivary gland cDNA libraries from nymphal and adult T. infestans of breeding colonies originating from different locations  (Argentina. Chile. Peru and Bolivia). and cDNA libraries originating from F1 populations of Bolivia. were sequenced using Illumina technology. Coding sequences (CDS) were extracted from the assembled reads. the numbers of reads mapped to these CDS. sequences were functionally annotated and polymorphisms determined. MAIN FINDINGS/SIGNIFICANCE: Over five thousand CDS. mostly full length or near full length. were publicly deposited on GenBank. Transcripts that  were over 10-fold overexpressed from different geographical regions. or from different developmental stages were identified. Polymorphisms were mapped to derived coding sequences. and found to vary between developmental instars and geographic origin of the biological material.

Tissue factor (TF). a primary initiator in the blood coagulation cascade. has been found to be upregulated in human AMD eyes. stressed ARPE-19 cells. and in Ccl1/Cx3cr1 double knockout mice on rd8 background (DKO). an AMD model. Ixolaris. a recombinant protein with sequence homology to TF Pathway inhibitor. has recently been shown to inhibit TF activity and regulate angiogenesis. We evaluated the effect of Ixolaris on TF expression in RPE cells and in DKO mice.Methods:: Varying concentrations of Ixolaris were added to ARPE-19 cells along with H2O2 and coagulation factors FVIIa and FX. the scaffolds for the Ixolaris/TF binding complex. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to analyze the relative expression levels of TF and Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In an in vivo study. Ixolaris (70 ug) was injected intravitreally into the right eyes of 17 DKO mice and the contralateral left eyes were used as controls and injected with PBS. After 1 month. fundus images were taken and the eyes of 4 mice were measured for TF and VEGF by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemsitry. The remaining 13 mice were injected with another round of Ixolaris and PBS. At the 2-month time point. fundus examinations were taken and scored. and the eyes were subsequently studied for histopathology. qRT-PCR. immunohistochemistry. and A2E levels by HPLC.Results:: In ARPE-19 cells stimulated with H2O2. the expression level of TF mRNA decreased in a …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC,0,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2359261,,,,https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2359261,0,0,0

Defibrotide (DF). a mixture of DNA aptamers. displays anticoagulant. anti-inflammatory. and endothelial cell (EC)-protective activities and has been successfully used to treat comatose children with veno-occlusive disease. DF was investigated here as a drug to treat cerebral malaria.Methods and Results—DF blocks tissue factor expression by ECs incubated with parasitized red blood cells and attenuates prothrombinase activity. platelet aggregation. and complement activation. In contrast. it does not affect nitric oxide bioavailability. We also demonstrated that Plasmodium falciparum glycosylphosphatidylinositol (Pf-GPI) induces tissue factor expression in ECs and cytokine production by dendritic cells. Notably. dendritic cells. known to modulate coagulation and inflammation systemically. were identified as a novel target for DF. Accordingly. DF inhibits Toll-like receptor ligand-dependent dendritic cells activation by a mechanism that is blocked by adenosine receptor antagonist (8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline) but not reproduced by synthetic poly-A.-C.-T. and-G. These results imply that aptameric sequences and adenosine receptor mediate dendritic cells responses to the drug. DF also prevents rosetting formation. red blood cells invasion by P. falciparum and abolishes oocysts development in Anopheles gambiae. In a murine model of cerebral malaria. DF affected parasitemia. decreased IFN-levels. and ameliorated clinical score (day 5) with a trend for increased survival.Conclusion—Therapeutic use of DF in malaria is proposed …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11189650711365541739&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) are a large family of heterogeneous proteins that have different functions and features; noteworthy are their adhesive and tensile characteristics. These properties may be essential for successful attachment of the metastriate ticks to the host and the prolonged feeding necessary for engorgement. In this work. we analyzed Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) similar to GRPs from cDNA libraries constructed from salivary glands of adult female ticks representing three hard. metastriate species in order to verify if their expression correlated with biological differences such as the numbers of hosts ticks feed on during their parasitic life cycle. whether one (monoxenous parasite) or two or more (heteroxenous parasite). and the anatomy of their mouthparts. whether short (Brevirostrata) or long (Longirostrata). These ticks were the monoxenous Brevirostrata tick. Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. a heteroxenous Brevirostrata tick. Rhipicephalus sanguineus. and a heteroxenous Longirostrata tick. Amblyomma cajennense. To further investigate this relationship. we conducted phylogenetic analyses using sequences of GRPs from these ticks as well as from other species of Brevirostrata and Longirostrata ticks.Results: cDNA libraries from salivary glands of the monoxenous tick.

Since the peritrophic matrix is a physical barrier that the parasite must cross to invade the mosquito. and the presence of allosamidin. a chitinase inhibitor. in a blood meal prevents the parasite from invading the midgut epithelium. chitinases (3.2.1.14) are potential targets of malaria parasite transmission-blocking interventions. We have purified a chitinase of the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum and cloned the gene. PgCHT1. encoding it.

83935,Immunization against a peptide vasodilator from sand fly saliva protects against Leishmania transmission in mice.,1996,CB Shoemaker and AA Siddiqui and PJ Skelly and GC Lanzaro and AH Santos and JM Ribeiro and RG Titus,3,Toxicon,34,302-303,,Sand fly saliva contains multiple factors with distinct pharmacological activities.  We have previously cloned and functionally expressed a cDNA that encodes one such factor. a highly potent peptide vasodilator called erythema-inducing factor (EIF). which creates the characteristic   red spot   at the site of a bite.  Characterization of EIF cDNAs from numerous different geographic isolates of sand fly indicate a high degree of polymorphism in the coding DNA with as much as 13 of 63 amino acid differences.  Yet the vasodilatory specific activity of the recombinant proteins shows no significant differences.  The sand fly also transmits human leishmaniasis which is caused by the protozoan parasite. Leishmania. and salivary factor(s) are known to exacerbate infectivity. often by 10-100-fold.  The parasites infect macrophages at the site of the fly bite. from which they replicate and spread.  The clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis range from self-healing cutaneous lesions to a potentially fatal visceral form depending upon the species of the parasite and the immunological response of the host.  Recently. we demonstrated that recombinant EIF. in addition to inducing erythema. can exacerbate experimental leishmaniasis.  We then tested whether protein or naked DNA vaccination against this peptide will neutralize the exacerbative effects of saliva.  Either immunization method induced both a humoral and cellular response to EIF.  Immunized animals were then challenged by foot pad infections of 10     5     Leishmania major parasites in the presence of sand fly saliva.  Two and four weeks post-infection. all vaccinated mice were found to have markedly …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC,0,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-b29d3565-7dd6-34a3-8c2f-9a5a923acd49,,,,,0,0,0

Standard cotton balls. impregnated with permethrin (7. 4% w/w). are dispensed from weatherresistant tubes placed at 10-meter intervals in suitable mouse habitats. Mice collect the cotton as they forage for fibrous material to build their nests. thus incorporating the acaricide into their burrows.This method. using such permethrin-treated cotton (PTC). was employed in a suburban community where ticks (1. dammini) are abundant and Lyme disease is endemic. in an attempt to reduce the risk of human exposure to LDS-infected ticks. The study area. located in Ipswich. Massachusetts. is bordered on its perimeter by salt marsh and is transected by a road. An 18-acre tract containing seven residences located on the south side of the road was selected for treatment with PTC.

Crane's Beach in Ipswich. NaushonIsland near Woods Hole. and Argilla Road in Ipswich. The first three sites have been studied intensively in relation to Lyme disease and are described elsewhere (11-13). The fourth site. Argilla Road. located near Crane's Beach. is a three-hectare tract in a wooded residential neighborhood located at the center of a focus of human Lyme disease cases (14); infected host-seeking nymphal/. dammini have been collected there since 1982 (TN Mather. unpublished data).,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC,0,http://www.ticktubes.com/downloads/ticktubes_comparing_rodents_study.pdf,,,,http://www.ticktubes.com/downloads/ticktubes_comparing_rodents_study.pdf,0,0,0

83955,ANTIHEMOSTATIC. ANTIINFLAMMATORY. AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE PROPERTIES OF THE SALIVA OF,,JMC RIBEIRO and GT MAKOUL and J LEVINE and DR ROBINSON,,,,,,Pilocarpine-induced saliva of the tick. Ixodes dammini. inhibited platelet aggregation triggered by ADP and collagen. as well as platelet-aggregation factor. In addition. we found apyrase activity (which degrades ATP and ADP to AMP and orthophosphate) and an anticoagulant. We showed the presence of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by bioassay and radioimmunoassay. This saliva inhibited interleukin 2 production by T cell hybridomas. an activity consistent with that of PGE2. A kininase was demonstrated. and this may counteract the algesia-and edema-promoting properties of PGE2. Together. these salivary components produce antihemostatic. antiinflammatory. and immunosuppressive effects that may facilitate feeding. as well as transmission of tick-borne pathogens.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC,0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2187567/,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2187567/pdf/je1612332.pdf,0,0,0

However. numerous differences are also observed; some of these must reflect the selection and subsequent adaptation associated with different ecologies and life strategies. Almost half of the genes in both genomes are interpreted as orthologs and show an average sequence identity of about 56%. which is slightly lower than that observed between the orthologs of the pufferfish and human (diverged about 450 million years ago). This indicates that these two insectsdivergedconsiderablyfasterthanvertebrates. Alignedsequencesrevealthat orthologous genes have retained only half of their intron/exon structure. indicating that intron gains or losses have occurred at a rate of about one per gene per 125 million years …,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2250172148539716250&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
83957,Reconstructing the flight kinematics of swarming and mating in wild mosquitoes: Supplementary Document,,Sachit Butail and Nicholas Manoukis and Moussa Diallo and José M Ribeiro and Tovi Lehmann and Derek A Paley,,,,,,Particle filtering is a sequential Monte Carlo method [3] that uses importance sampling to draw samples from probability distributions. In a particle filter the target state is represented by a point mass particle set that is propagated and updated using conditional probability representations of the motion model and measurement model. Methods that improve the sampling efficiency include [3] resampling. Rao-Blackwellization. and the unscented transformation. Table 1 describes the sampling importance resampling (SIR) particle filter algorithm that we implement as part of our tracking system. The target estimate at each step is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) of the particle set defined as the particle having the maximum weight.,True,ikZfnk0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=849731241708723749&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
