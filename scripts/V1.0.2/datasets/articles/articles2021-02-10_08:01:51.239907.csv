A few long ncRNAs that have been studied in any detail silence gene expression in processes such as X-inactivation and imprinting. We used a GENCODE annotation of the human genome to characterize over a thousand long ncRNAs that are expressed in multiple cell lines. Unexpectedly. we found an enhancer-like function for a set of these long ncRNAs in human cell lines. Depletion of a number of ncRNAs led to decreased expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes. including the master regulator of hematopoiesis. SCL (also called TAL1). Snai1 and Snai2.

The experiment had two major goals: the assessment of the accuracy of computational methods to predict protein coding genes; and the overall assessment of the completeness of the current human genome annotations as represented in the ENCODE regions. For the computational prediction assessment. eighteen groups contributed gene predictions. We evaluated these submissions against each other based on a 'reference set' of annotations generated as part of the GENCODE project. These annotations were not available to the prediction groups prior to the submission deadline. so that their predictions were blind and an external advisory committee could perform a fair assessment. The best methods had at least one gene transcript correctly predicted for close to 70% of the annotated genes. Nevertheless. the multiple transcript accuracy. taking into account alternative splicing. reached only approximately 40% to 50% accuracy. At the coding nucleotide level. the best programs reached an accuracy of 90% in both sensitivity and specificity. Programs relying on mRNA and protein sequences were the most accurate in reproducing the manually curated annotations. Experimental validation shows that only a very small percentage (3.2%) of the selected 221 computationally predicted exons outside of the existing annotation could be verified.

As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality (human. mouse. fly and worm). there is room for improvement of most genome assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome. published in 2006. was noted for its bimodal GC content distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set (OGSv1.0) compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect genomes. Here. we report an improved honey bee genome assembly (Amel_4.5) with a new gene annotation set (OGSv3.2). and show that the honey bee genome contains a number of genes similar to that of other insect genomes. contrary to what was suggested in OGSv1.0. The new genome assembly is more contiguous and complete and the new gene set includes ~5000 more protein-coding genes. 50% more than previously reported. About 1/6 of the additional genes were due to improvements to the assembly. and the remaining were inferred based on new RNAseq and protein data. Lessons learned from this genome upgrade have important implications for future genome sequencing projects.

In this regard. alternative splicing (AS) is a key phenomenon contributing to the production of different mature transcripts from the same primary RNA sequence. As a plethora of different transcript forms is available in databases. a first step to uncover the biology that drives AS is to identify the different types of reflected splicing variation. In this work. we present a general definition of the AS event along with a notation system that involves the relative positions of the splice sites. This nomenclature univocally and dynamically assigns a specific “AS code” to every possible pattern of splicing variation. On the basis of this definition and the corresponding codes. we have developed a computational tool (AStalavista) that automatically characterizes the complete landscape of AS events in a given transcript annotation of a genome. thus providing a platform to investigate the transcriptome diversity across genes. chromosomes. and species. Our analysis reveals that a substantial part—in human more than a quarter—of the observed splicing variations are ignored in common classification pipelines. We have used AStalavista to investigate and to compare the AS landscape of different reference annotation sets in human and in other metazoan species and found that proportions of AS events change substantially depending on the annotation protocol. species-specific attributes. and coding constraints acting on the transcripts.

The ENCODE project enables us to further explore this relationship using an unprecedented volume of data. Expression levels from more than 100.000 promoters were measured using a variety of high-throughput techniques applied to RNA extracted by different protocols from different cellular compartments of several human cell lines. ENCODE also generated the genome-wide mapping of eleven histone marks. one histone variant. and DNase I hypersensitivity sites in seven cell lines. We built a novel quantitative model to study the relationship between chromatin features and expression levels. Our study not only confirms that the general relationships found in previous studies hold across various cell lines. but also makes new suggestions about the relationship between chromatin features and gene expression levels. We found that expression status and expression levels can be predicted by different groups of chromatin features. both with high accuracy. We also found that expression levels measured by CAGE are better predicted than by RNA-PET or RNA-Seq. and different categories of chromatin features are the most predictive of expression for different RNA measurement methods. Additionally. PolyA+ RNA is overall more predictable than PolyA- RNA among different cell compartments. and PolyA+ cytosolic RNA measured with RNA-Seq is more predictable than PolyA+ nuclear RNA. while the opposite is true for PolyA- RNA.

Primitively eusocial bumblebees are uniquely placed to illuminate the evolution of highly eusocial insect societies. Bumblebees are also invaluable natural and agricultural pollinators. and there is widespread concern over recent population declines in some species. High-quality genomic data will inform key aspects of bumblebee biology. including susceptibility to implicated population viability threats. We report the high quality draft genome sequences of Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens. two ecologically dominant bumblebees and widely utilized study species. Comparing these new genomes to those of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera and other Hymenoptera. we identify deeply conserved similarities. as well as novelties key to the biology of these organisms. Some honeybee genome features thought to underpin advanced eusociality are also present in bumblebees. indicating an earlier evolution in the bee lineage. Xenobiotic detoxification and immune genes are similarly depauperate in bumblebees and honeybees. and multiple categories of genes linked to social organization. including development and behavior. show high conservation. Key differences identified include a bias in bumblebee chemoreception towards gustation from olfaction. and striking differences in microRNAs. potentially responsible for gene regulation underlying social and other traits. These two bumblebee genomes provide a foundation for post-genomic research on these key pollinators and insect societies.

All members of the class are terrestrial. but they attained terrestriality independently of insects. Myriapoda is the only arthropod class not represented by a sequenced genome. We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede Strigamia maritima. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods. and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts. and many small-scale examples of gene clustering. We describe several examples where S. maritima shows different solutions from insects to similar problems. The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from S. maritima. and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families. For some genes S. maritima has evolved paralogues to generate coding sequence diversity. where insects use alternate splicing. This is most striking for the Dscam gene. which in Drosophila generates more than 100.000 alternate splice forms. but in S. maritima is encoded by over 100 paralogues. We see an intriguing linkage between the absence of any known photosensory proteins in a blind organism and the additional absence of canonical circadian clock genes. The phylogenetic position of myriapods allows us to identify where in arthropod phylogeny several particular molecular mechanisms and traits emerged.

Human genome codes for 25 Sec-containing protein genes. and mouse and rat genomes for 24.   Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized the selenoproteomes of 44 sequenced vertebrates by applying gene prediction and phylogenetic reconstruction methods. supplemented with the analyses of gene structures. alternative splicing isoforms. untranslated regions. SECIS elements. and pseudogenes. In total. we detected 45 selenoprotein subfamilies. 28 of them were found in mammals. and 41 in bony fishes. We define the ancestral vertebrate (28 proteins) and mammalian (25 proteins) selenoproteomes. and describe how they evolved along lineages through gene duplication (20 events). gene loss (10 events) and replacement of Sec with cysteine (12 events). We show that an intronless selenophosphate synthetase 2 gene evolved in early mammals and replaced functionally the original multiexon gene in placental mammals. whereas both genes remain in marsupials. Mammalian thioredoxin reductase 1 and thioredoxin-glutathione reductase evolved from an ancestral glutaredoxin-domain containing enzyme. still present in fish. Selenoprotein V and GPx6 evolved specifically in placental mammals from duplications of SelW and GPx3. respectively. and GPx6 lost Sec several times independently. Bony fishes were characterized by duplications of several selenoprotein families (GPx1. GPx3. GPx4. Dio3. MsrB1. SelJ. SelO. SelT. SelU1. and SelW2).

To gain insight into the genome-wide evolution of these regions in mammals. we analyzed the repeat content in a large data set of rat–mouse–human orthologs.

Extensive work on honeybees and ants has revealed the molecular basis of derived queen and worker phenotypes in highly eusocial lineages. but we lack equivalent deep-level analyses of wasps and of primitively eusocial species. the latter of which can reveal how phenotypic decoupling first occurs in the early stages of eusocial evolution. We sequenced 20 Gbp of transcriptomes derived from brains of different behavioral castes of the primitively eusocial tropical paper wasp Polistes canadensis. Surprisingly. 75% of the 2.442 genes differentially expressed between phenotypes were novel. having no significant homology with described sequences. Moreover. 90% of these novel genes were significantly upregulated in workers relative to queens. Differential expression of novel genes in the early stages of sociality may be important in facilitating the evolution of worker behavioral complexity in eusocial evolution. We also found surprisingly low correlation in the identity and direction of expression of differentially expressed genes across similar phenotypes in different social lineages. supporting the idea that social evolution in different lineages requires substantial de novo rewiring of molecular pathways. These genomic resources for aculeate wasps and first transcriptome-wide insights into the origin of castes bring us closer to a more general understanding of eusocial …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C,146,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-2-r20,7866564287629236030,/scholar?cites=7866564287629236030,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-2-r20,0,0,0

We now show that Hnf1a deficiency in mice leads to highly tissue-specific changes in the expression of genes involved in key functions of both islets and liver. To gain insights into the mechanisms of tissue-specific Hnf1α regulation. we integrated expression studies of Hnf1a-deficient mice with identification of direct Hnf1α targets. We demonstrate that Hnf1α can bind in a tissue-selective manner to genes that are expressed only in liver or islets. We also show that Hnf1α is essential only for the transcription of a minor fraction of its direct-target genes. Even among genes that were expressed in both liver and islets. the subset of targets showing functional dependence on Hnf1α was highly tissue …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,110,https://mcb.asm.org/content/29/11/2945.short,8094719916661569522,/scholar?cites=8094719916661569522,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/29/11/2945.full.pdf,0,0,0

Genes are scored as a function of the scores of the assembled exons. and the highest scoring candidate gene is assumed to be the most likely gene encoded by the query DNA sequence. Considering additive gene scoring functions. currently available algorithms to determine such a highest scoring candidate gene run in time proportional to the square of the number of predicted exons.

A coding statistic can be defined as a function that computes given a DNA sequence a real number related to the likelihood that the sequence is coding for a protein. Model-dependent coding statistics are likely to capture more of the specific features of coding DNA since they are dependent on more parameters. It is suggested that model-dependent coding statistics may be more powerful in discriminating coding from noncoding DNA. A DNA sequence can be partitioned in a sequence of consecutive nonoverlapping codons in three different ways depending on the nucleotide in the sequence on which the grouping of nucleotides into codons starts. It is found that amino acid usage and codon preference carry a lot of information about coding function. and neither of these measures appears to …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,103,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121016258500050,12614204683731744190,/scholar?cites=12614204683731744190,,,0,0,0

Until very recently. all metazoan genomes investigated encoded selenoproteins. and these proteins had therefore been believed to be essential for animal life. Challenging this assumption. recent comparative analyses of insect genomes have revealed that some insect genomes appear to have lost selenoprotein genes.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we investigate in detail the fate of selenoproteins. and that of selenoprotein factors. in all available arthropod genomes. We use a variety of in silico comparative genomics approaches to look for known selenoprotein genes and factors involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis. We have found that five insect species have completely lost the ability to encode selenoproteins and that selenoprotein loss in these species. although so far confined to the Endopterygota infraclass. cannot be attributed to a single evolutionary event. but rather to multiple. independent events. Loss of selenoproteins and selenoprotein factors is usually coupled to the deletion of the entire no-longer functional genomic region. rather than to sequence degradation and consequent pseudogenisation. Such dynamics of gene extinction are consistent with the high rate of genome rearrangements observed in Drosophila. We have also found that. while many selenoprotein factors are concomitantly lost with the selenoproteins. others are present and conserved in all investigated genomes. irrespective of whether they code for selenoproteins or not. suggesting that they are involved in additional. non …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,72,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002968,11424326490059597494,/scholar?cites=11424326490059597494,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002968,0,0,0

10099162,Discovery of cancer driver long noncoding RNAs across 1112 tumour genomes: new candidates and distinguishing features,2017,Andrés Lanzós and Joana Carlevaro-Fita and Loris Mularoni and Ferran Reverter and Emilio Palumbo and Roderic Guigó and Rory Johnson,7,Scientific reports,1,1-16,Nature Publishing Group,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a vast unexplored genetic space that may hold missing drivers of tumourigenesis. but few such “driver lncRNAs” are known. Until now. they have been discovered through changes in expression. leading to problems in distinguishing between causative roles and passenger effects. We here present a different approach for driver lncRNA discovery using mutational patterns in tumour DNA. Our pipeline. ExInAtor. identifies genes with excess load of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across panels of tumour genomes. Heterogeneity in mutational signatures between cancer types and individuals is accounted for using a simple local trinucleotide background model. which yields high precision and low computational demands. We use ExInAtor to predict drivers from the GENCODE annotation across 1112 entire genomes from 23 cancer types.

Heidelberg,In this paper we address the problem of characterizing the RNA complement of a given cell type. that is. the set of RNA species and their relative copy number. from a large set of short sequence reads which have been randomly sampled from the cell’s RNA sequences through a sequencing experiment. We refer to this problem as the transcriptome reconstruction problem. and we specifically investigate. both theoretically and practically. the conditions under which the problem can be solved. We demonstrate that. even under the assumption of exact information. neither single read nor paired-end read sequences guarantee theoretically that the reconstruction problem has a unique solution. However. by investigating the behavior of the best annotated human gene set. we also show that. in practice. paired-end reads – but not single reads – may be sufficient to solve the vast majority of the transcript variants …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,66,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87361-7_5,1071350034333955902,/scholar?cites=1071350034333955902,,"ftp://nozdr.ru/biblio/kolxoz/Cs/CsLn/Algorithms%20in%20Bioinformatics,%208%20conf.,%20WABI%202008(LNCS5251,%20Springer,%202008)(ISBN%209783540873600)(406s).pdf#page=61",0,0,0

Novel technologies. such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). may help to uncover cryptic rearrangements in X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) patients. We have constructed an X-chromosome tiling path array using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and validated it using samples with cytogenetically defined copy number changes. We have studied 54 patients with idiopathic mental retardation and 20 controls subjects. Known genomic aberrations were reliably detected on the array and eight novel submicroscopic imbalances. likely causative for the mental retardation (MR) phenotype. were detected. Putatively pathogenic rearrangements included three deletions and five duplications (ranging between 82 kb to one Mb). all but two affecting genes previously known to be responsible for XLMR. Additionally. we describe different CNV regions with significant different frequencies in XLMR and control subjects (44% vs. 20%).

This identification is based on the statistical parameters estimated from a training set. Often. because of the huge number of parameters. it is difficult to obtain consistent estimators. To simplify the estimation problem. one imposes independent assumptions between the nucleotides along the site. However. this can potentially limit the minimum value of the estimation error.

Because RNA-seq is also becoming increasingly popular for transcriptome characterization. the possibility exists for further quantification of individual alternative transcript isoforms. and therefore for estimating the relative ratios of alternative splice forms within a given gene.

Here. we use 12 Drosophila genomes to study the power of comparative genomics metrics to distinguish between protein-coding and non-coding regions. First. we study the relative power of different comparative metrics and their relationship to single-species metrics. We find that even relatively simple multi-species metrics robustly outperform advanced single-species metrics. especially for shorter exons (≤240 nt). which are common in animal genomes. Moreover. the two capture largely independent features of protein-coding genes. with different sensitivity/specificity trade-offs. such that their combinations lead to even greater discriminatory power. In addition. we study how discovery power scales with the number and phylogenetic distance of the genomes compared. We find that species at a broad range of distances are comparably effective informants for pairwise comparative gene identification. but that these are surpassed by multi-species comparisons at similar evolutionary divergence. In particular. while pairwise discovery power plateaued at larger distances and never outperformed the most advanced single-species metrics. multi-species comparisons continued to benefit even from the most distant species with no apparent saturation.

In contrast to this generally accepted view. we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications. Conversely. strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability. an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA. whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development.

Random clone selection from the RACE mixture. however. is an ineffective sampling strategy if the dynamic range of transcript abundances is large. To improve sampling efficiency of human transcripts. we hybridized the products of the RACE reaction onto tiling arrays and used the detected exons to delineate a series of reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCRs. through which the original RACE transcript population was segregated into simpler transcript populations. We independently cloned the products and sequenced randomly selected clones. This approach.

More research is needed to identify effects of genetic variation on distant genes (trans-eQTLs) and understand their biological mechanisms. One common trans-eQTLs mechanism is “mediation” by a local (cis) transcript. Thus. mediation analysis can be applied to genome-wide SNP and expression data in order to identify transcripts that are “cis-mediators” of trans-eQTLs. including those “cis-hubs” involved in regulation of many trans-genes.

However. the significance of studies that assess binding without considering regulatory function is poorly understood.We compared previously reported mouse and human HNF-1α and HNF-4α binding studies with independent binding experiments.

10099204,Computational identification of the selenocysteine tRNA (tRNASec) in genomes,2017,Didac Santesmasses and Marco Mariotti and Roderic Guigó,13,PLoS computational biology,2,e1005383,Public Library of Science,Selenocysteine (Sec) is known as the 21st amino acid. a cysteine analogue with selenium replacing sulphur. Sec is inserted co-translationally in a small fraction of proteins called selenoproteins. In selenoprotein genes. the Sec specific tRNA (tRNASec) drives the recoding of highly specific UGA codons from stop signals to Sec. Although found in organisms from the three domains of life. Sec is not universal. Many species are completely devoid of selenoprotein genes and lack the ability to synthesize Sec. Since tRNASec is a key component in selenoprotein biosynthesis. its efficient identification in genomes is instrumental to characterize the utilization of Sec across lineages. Available tRNA prediction methods fail to accurately predict tRNASec. due to its unusual structural fold. Here. we present Secmarker. a method based on manually curated covariance models capturing the specific tRNASec structure in archaea. bacteria and eukaryotes. We exploited the non-universality of Sec to build a proper benchmark set for tRNASec predictions. which is not possible for the predictions of other tRNAs. We show that Secmarker greatly improves the accuracy of previously existing methods constituting a valuable tool to identify tRNASec genes. and to efficiently determine whether a genome contains selenoproteins. We used Secmarker to analyze a large set of fully sequenced genomes. and the results revealed new insights in the biology of tRNASec. led to the discovery of a novel bacterial selenoprotein family. and shed additional light on the phylogenetic distribution of selenoprotein containing genomes.

To define the molecular basis for the tissue-specific expression of CD6 we have identified the transcription factors that control the activity of the proximal regulatory region of the human CD6 gene. The TATA-less CD6 promoter contains multiple transcriptional start sites. and its preferential activity in human T lymphocytes is dependent on RUNX- and Ets-binding sites located within a highly conserved region. RUNX and Ets-1 factors transactivated the CD6 promoter through recognition of the −215 and −230 binding sites. respectively.

Moreover. the approach generalises to comparison of sequences from any two related           species. The underlying rationale (which is abundantly confirmed by observation) is that a           random mutation in a functional region is usually deleterious to the organism. and hence           unlikely to become fixed in the population. whereas mutations in a non-functional region           are free to accumulate over time.

By studying life‐history traits and transcriptomes of 14 Drosophila species differing more than sixfold in lifespan. we explored expression divergence and identified genes and processes that correlate with longevity. These longevity signatures suggested that longer‐lived flies upregulate fatty acid metabolism. downregulate neuronal system development and activin signaling. and alter dynamics of RNA splicing.

Many RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate their expression levels by a negative feedback loop. in which RBP binds its own pre-mRNA and causes alternative splicing to introduce a PTC.

10099222,Automatic evaluation of protein sequence functional patterns,1991,Roderic Guigo and Ann Johanson and Temple F Smith,7,Bioinformatics,3,309-315,Oxford University Press,A procedure that automatically provides an evaluation of the diagnostic ability of a protein sequence functional pattern is described. The procedure relies on the identification of the closest definable set in terms of a (protein sequence) database functional annotation to the set of database instances containing a given pattern. Assuming annotation correctness and completeness in the protein sequence database. the degree of statistical association between these sets provides an appropriate measure of the diagnostic ability of the pattern. An experimental implementation of the procedure. using the NBRF/PIR protein database. has been applied to a diverse collection of published sequence patterns.

To this end. we conducted a transcriptome-wide survey of tissue-specific gene expression and splicing events in the unprecedented collection of 8527 high-quality RNA-seq samples from the GTEx project. covering 36 human peripheral tissues and 13 brain subregions. We derived a weighted tissue-specificity scoring scheme accounting for the similarity of related tissues and inherent variability across individual samples. We showed that ~50.6% of all annotated human genes show tissue-specific expression. including many low abundance transcripts vastly underestimated by previous array-based expression atlases. As utilities for drug discovery. we demonstrated that tissue-specificity is a highly desirable attribute of validated drug targets and tissue-specificity can be used to prioritize disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using brain striatum-specific gene expression as an example. we provided a template to leverage tissue-specific gene expression to identify novel therapeutic targets.

We present a method to estimate the protein coding density in a corpus of DNA sequence data. in which a ‘coding statistic’ is calculated for a large number of windows of the sequence under study. and the distribution of the statistic is decomposed into two normal distributions. assumed to be the distributions of the coding statistic in the coding and noncoding …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,11,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/21/12/2837/1045692,771626632134576685,/scholar?cites=771626632134576685,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC309664/pdf/nar00061-0062.pdf,0,0,0

During B-cell differentiation. we found an increase in IR from the bone marrow precursors to cells residing in secondary lymphoid organs. B-cells that undergo affinity maturation to become antibody producing plasma cells steadily decrease retention.

This is a necessary step toward understanding better the functional content of the genome. The identification of genes is more difficult in eukaryotes than it is in prokaryotes. primarily because of the split nature of eukaryotic genes and because of the often large spacers found between adjacent genes. It is currently thought that less than 2% of vertebrate genomes code for proteins (Venter et al.. 2001; Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium. 2001). Apparently. the cellular machinery is able to recognize and process. with high precision. sequence signals within the primary DNA sequence or within the intermediate RNA molecules in the pathwayleading from DNA to protein (Figure 5.1).

In this work. we study how cis-regulatory variation modifies the penetrance of coding variants in their target gene. Using functional genomic and genetic data from GTEx. we observed that in the general population. purifying selection has depleted haplotype combinations that lead to higher penetrance of pathogenic coding variants. Conversely. in cancer and autism patients. we observed an enrichment of haplotype combinations that lead to higher penetrance of pathogenic coding variants in disease implicated genes. which provides direct evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of causal coding variants affects disease risk. Finally. we experimentally demonstrated that a regulatory variant can modify the penetrance of a coding variant by introducing a Mendelian SNP using CRISPR/Cas9 on distinct expression haplotypes and using the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout.

To facilitate further discovery. we have created the “Cancer LncRNA Census” (CLC). a manually-curated and strictly-defined compilation of lncRNAs with causative roles in cancer. CLC has two principle applications: first. as a resource for training and benchmarking de novo identification methods; and second. as a dataset for studying the fundamental properties of these genes.  CLC Version 1 comprises 122 lncRNAs implicated in 29 distinct cancers. LncRNAs are included based on functional or genetic evidence for causative roles in cancer progression.

Automated genome annotation is thus necessitated by this growth in genome projects; however. full-fledged annotation systems are usually home-grown and customized to a particular genome. There is thus a renewed need for accurate ab initio gene prediction methods. However. it is apparent that fully ab initio methods fall short of the required level of sensitivity and specificity for a quality annotation. Evidence in the form of expressed sequences gives the single biggest improvement in accuracy when used to inform gene predictions.

The two main components are ASPic. a program that derives highly accurate. albeit not necessarily complete. EST-based transcript annotations from EST alignments. and GeneID. a standard gene prediction program. which we have modified to take as evidence intron annotations. The introns output by ASPic CDS predictions is given to GeneID to constrain the exon-chaining process and produce predictions consistent with the underlying EST alignments. The pipeline was successfully tested on the entire C. elegans genome and the 44 ENCODE human pilot regions.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C,6,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/502827/abs/,15051425854525087893,/scholar?cites=15051425854525087893,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/502827/abs/,0,0,0

10099260,Bubbles: alternative splicing events of arbitrary dimension in splicing graphs,2008,Michael Sammeth and Gabriel Valiente and Roderic Guigó,,,,372-395,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Eukaryotic splicing structures are known to involve a high degree of alternative forms derived from a premature transcript by alternative splicing (AS). With the advent of new sequencing technologies. evidence for new splice forms becomes more and more easily available—bit by bit revealing that the true splicing diversity of “AS events” often comprises more than two alternatives and therefore cannot be sufficiently described by pairwise comparisons as conducted in analyzes hitherto. Further challenges emerge from the richness of data (millions of transcripts) and artifacts introduced during the technical process of obtaining transcript sequences (noise)—especially when dealing with single-read sequences known as expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We describe a novel method to efficiently predict AS events in different resolutions (i.e.. dimensions) from transcript annotations that allows for combination of …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,6,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78839-3_32,12970791412805475974,/scholar?cites=12970791412805475974,,,0,0,0

However. human selenoprotein P (SelenoP) has a redox-functioning selenocysteine in its N-terminal domain and nine selenium transporter-functioning selenocysteines in its C-terminal domain. Here we show that diverse SelenoP genes are present across metazoa with highly variable numbers of Sec-UGAs. ranging from a single UGA in certain insects. to 9 in common spider. and up to 132 in bivalve molluscs. SelenoP genes were shaped by a dynamic evolutionary process linked to selenium usage. Gene evolution featured modular expansions of an ancestral multi-Sec domain. which led to particularly Sec-rich SelenoP proteins in many aquatic organisms.

Ageing is the greatest risk factor for its development but mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP). apolipoprotein E (APOE). microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) among others. are also a major factor (Blasko et al.. 2004). The symptoms of AD result from neurofibrillary tangles that are composed of aggregates of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein and an increase in the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein in the brain that leads to deposits of senile plaques. As such. there is a worldwide effort to find an effective disease-modifying treatment that can reverse symptoms and/or delay onset of the disease. Transgenic mouse models exist that mimic a range of AD–related pathologies. although none of the models fully replicate all pathological features of the human disease (Birch et al.. 2014). Drugs developed using these mouse models have failed in phase III clinical trials (Mangialasche et al.. 2010; Braidy et al.. 2012; Saraceno et al.. 2013). These failures question not only our accurate understanding of the disease (Castellani and Perry. 2012) but also the validity of the animal models upon which the drug discovery efforts are rooted (Windisch. 2014; Nazem et al.. 2015).Animal models have contributed significantly to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of AD.

When the DNA strand of the hybrid is Py rich. the duplex is much more stable. rigid. and A-like than when the DNA strand is Pu rich. The origins of this dramatic asymmetry are double: first. the apparently innocuous substitution dT → rU produces a significant decrease in stacking. and second. backbone distortions are larger for DNA(Pu)·RNA(Py) hybrids than for the mirror RNA(Pu)·DNA(Py) ones. The functional impact of the structural and dynamic asymmetry in the biological activities of hybrids is dramatic and can be used to improve the efficiency of antisense-type strategies on the basis of the degradation of hybrids by RNase H or gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929419301603,8027242431548492387,/scholar?cites=8027242431548492387,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929419301603,0,0,0

While most studies to date have concentrated on their nuclear roles in transcriptional regulation. evidence is mounting that lncRNA also have cytoplasmic roles. Here we comprehensively map the cytoplasmic and ribosomal lncRNA population in a human cell. Three-quarters (74%) of lncRNAs are detected in the cytoplasm. the majority of which (62%) preferentially cofractionate with polyribosomes. Ribosomal lncRNA are highly expressed across tissues. under purifying evolutionary selection. and have cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios comparable to mRNAs and consistent across cell types. LncRNAs may be classified into three groups by their ribosomal interaction: non-ribosomal cytoplasmic lncRNAs. and those associated with either heavy or light polysomes. A number of mRNA-like features destin lncRNA for light polysomes. including capping and 5’UTR length. but not cryptic open reading frames or polyadenylation. Surprisingly. exonic retroviral sequences antagonise recruitment. In contrast. it appears that lncRNAs are recruited to heavy polysomes through basepairing to mRNAs. Finally. we show that the translation machinery actively degrades lncRNA. We propose that light polysomal lncRNAs are translationally engaged. while heavy polysomal lncRNAs are recruited indirectly. These findings point to extensive and reciprocal regulatory interactions between lncRNA and the translation machinery.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC,4,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/013508v1.abstract,3420312515801657379,/scholar?cites=3420312515801657379,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/01/06/013508.full.pdf,0,0,0

10099283,Enteric infection induces Lark-mediated intron retention at the 5'end of Drosophila genes,2020,Maroun Bou Sleiman and Michael Vincent Frochaux and Tommaso Andreani and Dani Osman and Roderic Guigo and Bart Deplancke,21,Genome Biology,ARTICLE,4,,Background RNA splicing is a key post-transcriptional mechanism that generates protein diversity and contributes to the fine-tuning of gene expression. which may facilitate adaptation to environmental challenges. Here. we employ a systems approach to study alternative splicing changes upon enteric infection in females from classical Drosophila melanogaster strains as well as 38 inbred lines. Results We find that infection leads to extensive differences in isoform ratios. which results in a more diverse transcriptome with longer 5'untranslated regions (5'UTRs). We establish a role for genetic variation in mediating inter-individual splicing differences. with local splicing quantitative trait loci (local-sQTLs) being preferentially located at the 5'end of transcripts and directly upstream of splice donor sites. Moreover. local-sQTLs are more numerous in the infected state. indicating that acute stress unmasks a substantial number of silent genetic variants. We observe a general increase in intron retention concentrated at the 5'end of transcripts across multiple strains. whose prevalence scales with the degree of pathogen virulence. The length. GC content. and RNA polymerase II occupancy of these introns with increased retention suggest that they have exon-like characteristics. We further uncover that retained intron sequences are enriched for the Lark/RBM4 RNA binding motif. Interestingly. we find that lark is induced by infection in wild-type flies. its overexpression and knockdown alter survival. and tissue-specific overexpression mimics infection-induced intron retention. Conclusion Our collective findings point to pervasive and consistent RNA splicing …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:hQUaER0FWQ4C,2,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/275803,3887115967409367055,/scholar?cites=3887115967409367055,,,0,0,0
10099284,Atlas of transcriptionally active transposable elements in human adult tissues,2019,Gireesh K Bogu and Ferran Reverter and Marc A Marti-Renom and Michael P Snyder and Roderic Guigó,,BioRxiv,,714212,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Approximately half of the human genome consists of mobile repetitive DNA sequences known as transposable elements (TEs). They are usually silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. but a few are known to escape silencing at embryonic stages. affecting early human development by regulating nearby protein-coding genes. To investigate transcriptional activity in human adult tissues we systematically investigate the expression landscape of about 4.2 million non-coding TEs in 8.051 RNA-Seq datasets from up to 49 adult tissues and 540 individuals. We show that approximately 79.558 individual TEs (2%). belonging to 856 subfamilies escape epigenetic silencing in adult tissues and become transcriptionally active. often in a very tissue-specific manner. Supporting a role for TEs in the regulation of expression of nearby genes. we found the expression of TEs often correlated with the expression of nearby genes. and significantly stronger when the TEs include eQTLs for the genes. We identified thousands of tissue-elevated. sex-associated TEs in the breast. ethnicity-associated in the skin and age-associated in the tibial artery. where we found a potential implication of two TE subfamilies in atherosclerosis. Our results suggest a functional role of TEs in the regulation of gene expression. support their implication in human phenotypes. and also serve as a comprehensive resource of transcriptionally active TEs in human adult tissues.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/714212v1.abstract,11196099638332846271,/scholar?cites=11196099638332846271,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/07/24/714212.full.pdf,0,0,0

10099286,Ten simple rules on how to organize a scientific retreat,2017,Julia Ponomarenko and Romina Garrido and Roderic Guigó,13,,2,e1005344,Public Library of Science,Scientific retreats are an intrinsic part of the life of many institutes. departments. and groups. They depart from traditional. virtual [1]. and unconventional conferences [2]. workshops [3]. and other types of scientific meetings [4] in that participants generally all know each other prior to the retreat. and. often. they have a good grasp of the scientific interests and accomplishments of each other; they may even be working closely together. Participants. thus. do not attend the retreat expecting to necessarily hear about breakthroughs in their fields of interests or to present their latest results to an expert audience but rather to have a deeper knowledge of the work of their closest colleagues. learn from developments in related areas. and explore potential collaborations.Since retreats usually take place away from the home institute and may expand over two or more days. they are expensive to organize—including significant institutional funds and employees’ working and personal time. They are disruptive of the daily scientific routine: experiments may need to be stopped or planned ahead. and regular activities such as seminars and group meetings need to be cancelled. Thus. to many. the benefits of moving a group of people who already share the same working space to a remote location over a period of two or more days are not obvious. After all. retreat participants already have the opportunity of meeting. almost on a daily basis. at the home institute. There is little empirical evidence that scientific retreats lead to better science (whatever this exactly means); we have been unable to find any work that would correlate frequency or length of scientific retreats …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC,2,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005344,8579027221600057088,/scholar?cites=8579027221600057088,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005344,0,0,0

Here we report the integrated analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes for circulating monocytes and neutrophils with the aim to enable downstream interpretation and functional validation of key regulatory elements in health and disease. We collected RNA-seq data. ChIP-seq of six histone modifications and of DNA methylation by bisulfite sequencing at base pair resolution from up to 6 individuals per cell type. Chromatin segmentation analyses suggested that monocytes have a higher number of cell-specific enhancer regions (4-fold) compared to neutrophils. This highly plastic epigenome is likely indicative of the greater differentiation potential of monocytes into macrophages. dendritic cells and osteoclasts. In contrast. most of the neutrophil-specific features tend to be characterized by repressed chromatin. reflective of their status as terminally differentiated cells. Enhancers were the regions where most of differences in DNA methylation between cells were observed. with monocyte-specific enhancers being generally hypomethylated. Monocytes show a substantially higher gene expression levels than neutrophils. in line with epigenomic analysis revealing that gene more active elements in monocytes. Our analyses suggest that the overexpression of c-Myc in monocytes and its binding to monocyte-specific enhancers could be an important contributor to these differences.

Herein. we investigated the significance of the lncRNA NEAT1 in CLL. We examined NEAT1 expression in 310 newly diagnosed Binet A patients. in normal CD19+ B-cells. and other types of B-cell malignancies. Although global NEAT1 expression level was not statistically different in CLL cells compared to normal B cells. the median ratio of NEAT1_2 long isoform and global NEAT1 expression in CLL samples was significantly higher than in other groups. NEAT1_2 was more expressed in patients carrying mutated IGHV genes. Concerning cytogenetic aberrations. NEAT1_2 expression in CLL with trisomy 12 was lower with respect to patients without alterations. Although global NEAT1 expression appeared not to be associated with clinical outcome. patients with the lowest NEAT1_2 expression displayed the shortest time to first treatment; however. a multivariate regression analysis showed that the NEAT1_2 risk model was not independent from other known prognostic factors. particularly the IGHV mutational status. Overall. our data prompt future studies to investigate whether the increased amount of the long NEAT1_2 isoform detected in CLL cells may have a specific role in the pathology of the disease.

While DNA employs it for genome replication. RNA molecules fold into complicated secondary and tertiary structures. Current knowledge on functional RNA structures in human protein-coding genes is focused on locally-occurring base pairs. However. chemical crosslinking and proximity ligation experiments have demonstrated that long-range RNA structures are highly abundant. Here. we present the most complete to-date catalog of conserved long-range RNA structures in the human transcriptome. which consists of 1.1 million pairs of conserved complementary regions (PCCRs). PCCRs tend to occur within introns proximally to splice sites. suppress intervening exons. circumscribe circular RNAs. and exert an obstructive effect on cryptic and inactive splice sites. The double-stranded structure of PCCRs is supported by a significant decrease of icSHAPE nucleotide accessibility. high abundance of A-to-I RNA editing sites. and frequent nearby occurrence of forked eCLIP peaks. Introns with PCCRs show a distinct splicing pattern in response to RNA Pol II slowdown suggesting that splicing is widely affected by co-transcriptional RNA folding. Additionally. transcript starts and ends are strongly enriched in regions between complementary parts of PCCRs. leading to an intriguing hypothesis that RNA folding coupled with splicing could mediate co-transcriptional suppression of premature cleavage and polyadenylation events.

Pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) are used to delete regulatory elements and small RNA genes. while longer RNAs can be silenced through promoter deletion. We here present CRISPETa. a bioinformatic pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model. Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target. Any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel. making CRISPETa equally appropriate for studies of individual elements. or complex library screens. Fast run-times are achieved using a precomputed off-target database. sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. We present a series of pre-designed. high-coverage library designs for entire classes of non-coding elements in human. mouse. zebrafish. Drosophila and C. elegans. Using an improved version of the DECKO deletion vector. together with a quantitative deletion assay. we test CRISPETa designs by deleting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the MALAT1 oncogene.

Comparison with transcriptome profiles obtained in human cell lines reveals substantial conservation of transcriptional programs. and uncovers a distinct class of genes with levels of expression across cell types and species. that have been constrained early in vertebrate evolution. This core set of genes capture a substantial and constant fraction of the transcriptional output of mammalian cells. and participates in basic functional and structural housekeeping processes common to all cell types. Perturbation of these constrained genes is associated with significant phenotypes including embryonic lethality and cancer.

In particular. they are interested in automatically obtaining the best description for the function of a given protein sequence pattern. It is assumed that such a description is the query on the functional annotation of a protein sequence database having the closest extension in the database to the extension of the pattern.

NATs roles have been related to gene regulation through different mechanisms. including post-transcriptional RNA processing. With the aim to identify NATs with potential regulatory function during fly development. we generated RNA-Seq data in Drosophila developing tissues and found bsAS. one of the most highly expressed lncRNAs in the fly wing. bsAS is antisense to bs/DSRF. a gene involved in wing development and neural processes. bsAS plays a crucial role in the tissue specific regulation of the expression of the bs/DSRF isoforms. This regulation is essential for the correct determination of cell fate during Drosophila development. as bsAS knockouts show highly aberrant phenotypes. Regulation of bs isoform usage by bsAS is mediated by specific physical interactions between the promoters of these two genes. which suggests a regulatory mechanism involving the collision of RNA polymerases transcribing in opposite directions. Evolutionary analysis suggests that bsAS NAT emerged simultaneously to the long-short isoform structure of bs. preceding the emergence of wings in insects.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:sfnaS5RM6jYC,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009245,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009245,0,0,0

10099322,Enteric infection induces Lark-mediated intron retention at the 5′ end of Drosophila genes,2020,Maroun Bou Sleiman and Michael Vincent Frochaux and Tommaso Andreani and Dani Osman and Roderic Guigo and Bart Deplancke,21,Genome biology,1,1-19,BioMed Central,RNA splicing is a key post-transcriptional mechanism that generates protein diversity and contributes to the fine-tuning of gene expression. which may facilitate adaptation to environmental challenges. Here. we employ a systems approach to study alternative splicing changes upon enteric infection in females from classical Drosophila melanogaster strains as well as 38 inbred lines. We find that infection leads to extensive differences in isoform ratios. which results in a more diverse transcriptome with longer 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTRs). We establish a role for genetic variation in mediating inter-individual splicing differences. with local splicing quantitative trait loci (local-sQTLs) being preferentially located at the 5′ end of transcripts and directly upstream of splice donor sites. Moreover. local-sQTLs are more numerous in the infected state. indicating that acute stress unmasks a substantial number of silent genetic variants. We observe a general increase in intron retention concentrated at the 5′ end of transcripts across multiple strains. whose prevalence scales with the degree of pathogen virulence. The length. GC content. and RNA polymerase II occupancy of these introns with increased retention suggest that they have exon-like characteristics. We further uncover that retained intron sequences are enriched for the Lark/RBM4 RNA binding motif. Interestingly. we find that lark is induced by infection in wild-type flies. its overexpression and knockdown alter survival. and tissue-specific overexpression mimics infection-induced intron retention.

Enhancers are central to control this tissue-specific gene expression pattern.

We found that enhancers showing tissue-specific activity are highly enriched in intronic regions and regulate the expression of genes involved in tissue-specific functions. while housekeeping genes are more often controlled by intergenic enhancers. Notably. an intergenic-to-intronic active enhancers continuum is observed in the transition from developmental to adult stages: the most differentiated tissues present higher rates of intronic enhancers. while the lowest rates are observed in embryonic stem cells.

OCA2 is caused by recessive mutations in the OCA2 gene with the most common mutation being a 2.7 kb deletion. Interestingly. 61% sub-Saharan African OCA2 patients develop dark patches known as ephelides in sun exposed skin. suggesting that these ephelides develop in response to UV exposure and appear to be inherited and protective against UV radiation damage.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC,0,https://gatesopenresearch.org/posters/3-1624,,,,https://gatesopenresearch.org/posters/3-1624,0,0,0

10099335,bsAS. an antisense long non-coding RNA. controls cell fate through regulation of blistered/DSRF isoform expression,2019,Sílvia Pérez-Lluch and Alessandra Breschi and Cecilia C Klein and Marina Ruiz-Romero and Amaya Abad and Emilio Palumbo and Lyazzat Bekish and Carme Arnan and Roderic Guigó,,bioRxiv,,846451,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that overlap coding genes in the opposite strand. NATs roles have been related to gene regulation through different mechanisms. including post-transcriptional RNA processing. With the aim to identify NATs with potential regulatory function during fly development. we generated RNA-Seq data in eye-antenna. leg. and wing at third instar larvae. Among the candidate NATs. we found bsAS. antisense to bs/DSRF. a gene involved in wing development and neural processes. Through the analysis of the RNA-Seq data. we found that these two different functions are carried out by the two different protein isoforms encoded in the bs gene. We also found that the usage of these isoforms is regulated by bsAS. This regulation is essential for the correct determination of cell fate during Drosophila development. as bsAS knockouts show highly aberrant phenotypes. bs regulation by bsAS is mediated by the specific physical interaction of the bsAS promoter with the promoters of bs. and it likely involves a mechanism. where expression of bsAS leads to the collision of RNA polymerases acting in opposite directions. preventing the elongation of the longer isoforms of bs. the ones carrying the neural related functions. Evolutionary analysis suggests that the bsAS NAT emerged simultaneously to the long-short isoform structure of bs. preceding the emergence of wings in insects. and maybe related to regulation of neural differentiation.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/846451v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/11/18/846451.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we explore the incompleteness of transcript models used for exome and genome analysis as one potential explanation for lack of current diagnoses. Therefore. we have updated the GENCODE gene annotation for 191 epilepsy-associated genes. using human brain-derived transcriptomic libraries and other data to build 3.550 novel putative transcript models. The extended transcriptional footprint of these genes allowed for 294 intronic or intergenic variants. found in human mutation databases. to be reclassified as exonic. while a further 70 intronic variants were reclassified as splice-site proximal. Using SCN1A as a case study due to its close phenotype/genotype correlation with Dravet syndrome. we screened 122 people with Dravet syndrome. or a similar phenotype. with a panel of novel exon sequences representing eight established genes and identified two de novo SCN1A variants that now. through improved gene annotation can be ascribed to residing among novel exons. These two (from 122 screened patients. 1.6%) new molecular diagnoses carry significant clinical implications. Furthermore. we identified a previously-classified SCN1A intronic Dravet-associated variant that now lies within a deeply conserved novel exon.

We found distinct tissue and developmental stage specific miRNA expression clusters. with an overall pattern of increasing tissue specific expression as development proceeds. Comparative analysis of conserved miRNAs in mouse and human revealed stronger clustering of expression patterns by tissue types rather than by species. An analysis of messenger RNA gene expression clusters compared with miRNA expression clusters identifies the potential role of specific miRNA expression clusters in suppressing the development of other tissues in their host tissue during embryonic development.

10099340,Novel autoregulatory cases of alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay,2018,Dmitri Pervouchine and Yaroslav Popov and Andy Berry and Beatrice Borsari and Adam Frankish and Roderic Guigó,,bioRxiv,,464404,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance system that selectively degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTC). Many RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate their expression levels by a negative feedback loop. in which RBP binds its own pre-mRNA and causes alternative splicing to introduce a PTC. We present a bioinformatic framework to identify novel such autoregulatory feedback loops by combining eCLIP assays for a large panel of RBPs with the data on shRNA inactivation of NMD pathway. and shRNA-depletion of RBPs followed by RNA-seq. We show that RBPs frequently bind their own pre-mRNAs and respond prominently to NMD pathway disruption. Poison and essential exons. i.e.. exons that trigger NMD when included in the mRNA or skipped. respectively. respond oppositely to the inactivation of NMD pathway and to the depletion of their host genes. which allows identification of novel autoregulatory mechanisms for a number of human RBPs. For example. SRSF7 binds its own pre-mRNA and facilitates the inclusion of two poison exons; SFPQ binding promotes switching to an alternative distal 3’-UTR that is targeted by NMD; RPS3 activates a poison 5’-splice site in its pre-mRNA that leads to a frame shift; U2AF1 binding activates one of its two mutually exclusive exons. leading to NMD; TBRG4 is regulated by cluster splicing of its two essential exons. Our results indicate that autoregulatory negative feedback loop of alternative splicing and NMD is a generic form of post-transcriptional control of gene expression.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/464404v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/11/24/464404.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here we have produced RNA sequencing data for a number of primary cells from multiple human body locations. The analysis of this data. together with additional epigenetic data also produced by the ENCODE project for a total of 146 primary cells. indicate that most cells in the human body belong to five major cell types: epithelial. endothelial. mesenchymal. neural and blood cells. These redefine. based on gene expression. the basic histological types in which tissues are usually classified. We identified genes specific to these cell types. including a core set of transcription factors (TFs).

We sequenced the genome of R. prolixus. generated assembled sequences covering 95% of the genome (similar to 702 Mb). including 15.456 putative protein-coding genes. and completed comprehensive genomic analyses of this obligate blood-feeding insect. Although immune-deficiency (IMD)-mediated immune responses were observed. R. prolixus putatively lacks key components of the IMD pathway. suggesting a reorganization of the canonical immune signaling network. Although both Toll and IMD effectors controlled intestinal microbiota. neither affected Trypanosoma cruzi. the causal agent of Chagas disease. implying the existence of evasion or tolerance mechanisms. R. prolixus has experienced an extensive loss of selenoprotein genes. with its repertoire reduced to only two proteins. one of which is a selenocysteine-based glutathione peroxidase. the first found in insects. The genome contained actively transcribed. horizontally transferred genes from Wolbachia sp.. which showed evidence of codon use evolution toward the insect use pattern. Comparative protein analyses revealed many lineage-specific expansions and putative gene absences in R. prolixus. including tandem expansions of genes related to chemoreception. feeding. and digestion that possibly contributed to the evolution of a blood-feeding lifestyle.

However. few studies have investigated primitively Eusocial insects which have caste determination later in development and show greater behaviour plasticity at adult stage. To understand the underlying epigenetic mechanisms we determined the adult brain methylome dynamics and associated transcriptomes of various individuals of two primitively social species: the paper wasp Polistes canadensis and the dinosaur ant Dinoponera quadriceps. DNA methylation in gene bodies. particularly at their 5'end. was positively associated with expression of housekeeping genes. a conserved feature in all insect species suggesting an ancestral role of methylation in constitutive gene expression. Notably. DNA methylation was not associated with caste specific gene expression. Key components of the methylation and demethylation machinery including a TET hydroxylase are conserved in primitively eusocial insects. but Polistes canadensis lacks DNMT3. which may account for its strikingly unpatterned methylome. Given the flexibility of adult Polistes to change caste. we manipulate the social structure of the nest to understand if unpatterned epigenomes reflect greater reprogramming potency.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC,0,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/10845/OR377.pdf?sequence=2,,,,,0,0,0

However. few variant transcripts have been characterized functionally. making it difficult to assess the contribution of AS to the generation of phenotypic complexity and to study the evolution of splicing patterns. We have compared the AS of 309 protein-coding genes in the human ENCODE pilot regions against their mouse orthologs in unprecedented detail. utilizing traditional transcriptomic and RNAseq data. The conservation status of every transcript has been investigated. and each functionally categorized as coding (separated into CDS or nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-linked) or non-coding. 36.7% of human and 19.3% of mouse coding transcripts are species specific. and we observe a 3.6 times excess of human NMD transcripts compared with mouse; in contrast to previous studies. the majority of species specific AS is unlinked to transposable elements. We observe one conserved CDS variant and one conserved NMD variant per 2.3 and 11.4 genes respectively. Subsequently. we identify and characterize equivalent AS patterns for 22.9% of these CDS or NMD-linked events in non-mammalian vertebrate genomes. and our data indicate that functional NMD-linked AS is more widespread and ancient than previously thought.

We identified previously unannotated and often tissue-or cell-line-specific transcribed fragments (RACEfrags). both 5 distal to the annotated 5 terminus and internal to the annotated gene bounds for the vast majority (81.5%) of the tested genes. Half of the distal RACEfrags span large segments of genomic sequences away from the main portion of the coding transcript and often overlap with the upstream-annotated gene (s). Notably. at least 20% of the resultant novel transcripts have changes in their open reading frames (ORFs). most of them fusing ORFs of adjacent transcripts. A significant fraction of distal RACEfrags show expression levels comparable to those of known exons of the same locus. suggesting that they are not part of very minority splice forms. These results have significant implications concerning (1) our current understanding of the architecture of protein-coding genes;(2) our views on locations of regulatory regions in the genome; and (3) the interpretation of sequence polymorphisms mapping to regions hitherto considered to be “noncoding.” ultimately relating to the identification of disease-related sequence alterations.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC,0,http://llama.mshri.on.ca/courses/Biophysics205/Papers/Denoeud_2007.pdf,,,,http://llama.mshri.on.ca/courses/Biophysics205/Papers/Denoeud_2007.pdf,0,0,0

Here we present a computational study to detect functional RNA structures within the ENCODE regions of the human genome. Since structural RNAs in general lack characteristic signals in primary sequence. comparative approaches evaluating evolutionary conservation of structures are most promising. We have used three recently introduced programs based on either phylogenetic–stochastic context-free grammar (EvoFold) or energy directed folding (RNAz and AlifoldZ). yielding several thousand candidate structures (corresponding to∼ 2.7% of the ENCODE regions). EvoFold has its highest sensitivity in highly conserved and relatively AU-rich regions. while RNAz favors slightly GC-rich regions. resulting in a relatively small overlap between methods. Comparison with the GENCODE annotation points to functional RNAs in all genomic contexts. with a slightly increased density in 3-UTRs. While we estimate a significant false discovery rate of∼ 50%–70% many of the predictions can be further substantiated by additional criteria: 248 loci are predicted by both RNAz and EvoFold. and an additional 239 RNAz or EvoFold predictions are supported by the (more stringent) AlifoldZ algorithm.

From the MR set we inferred PWMs for splice sites and start codons. and the Markov model of order 5 for coding regions. The MR set contains only single-gene sequences. To assess the accuracy of the predictions in a more realistic scenario. we have randomly embedded the sequences in the MR set in a background of artificial random intergenic DNA as described (R.

10099399,Assembling genes from predicted exons in linear time with dynamic programming,1998,Roderic Guigó Serra,,Journal of Computational Biology. 1998; 5 (4): 681-702,,,Mary Ann Liebert. Inc,In a number of programs for gene structure prediction in higher eukaryotic genomic sequences. exon prediction is decoupled from gene assembly: a large pool of candidate exons is predicted and scored from features located in the query DNA sequence. and candidate genes are assembled from such a pool as sequences of nonoverlapping frame-compatible exons. Genes are scored as a function of the scores of the assembled exons. and the highest scoring candidate gene is assumed to be the most likely gene encoded by the query DNA sequence. Considering additive gene scoring functions. currently available algorithms to determine such a highest scoring candidate gene run in time proportional to the square of the number of predicted exons. Here. we present an algorithm whose running time grows only linearly with the size of the set of predicted exons. Polynomial algorithms rely on the fact that. while scanning the set of predicted exons. the highest scoring gene ending in a given exon can be obtained by appending the exon to the highest scoring among the highest scoring genes ending at each compatible preceding exon. The algorithm here relies on the simple fact that such highest scoring gene can be stored and updated. This requires scanning the set of predicted exons simultaneously by increasing acceptor and donor position. On the other hand. the algorithm described here does not assume an underlying gene structure model. Indeed. the definition of valid gene structures is externally defined in the so-called Gene Model. The Gene Model specifies simply which gene features are allowed immediately upstream which other gene …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC,0,https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/16482,,,,https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/16482/guigo_assembling.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

NM (United States),We present a fast implementation of an algorithm to infer correlation between database queries. The implementation has been primarily designed to automatically obtain the best description for the function of a given protein sequence pattern. We assume that such a description is the query on the functional annotation of a protein sequence database having the closet extension in the database to the extension of the pattern. The functional annotation of a protein sequence database can be described as a set-valued attribute whose domain is a set of one-place predicates with biological meaning. The query language is then a first order language and the query space can be mapped into a set algebra in which a measure of set similarity is introduced. We have previously developed an algorithm to search such an algebra when negation is not considered. Here. we present an efficient implementation of such and algorithm and we develop a method to search exhaustively a protein sequence database for biologically relevant protein sequence patterns. incorporating such an implementation.

New York. NY,Metazoan genomes produce thousands of long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). of which just a small fraction have been well characterized. Understanding their biological functions requires accurate annotations. or maps of the precise location and structure of genes and transcripts in the genome. Current lncRNA annotations are limited by compromises between quality and size. with many gene models being fragmentary or uncatalogued. To overcome this. the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA capture long-read sequencing (CLS). an approach combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. CLS provides accurate annotations at high-throughput rates. It eliminates the need for noisy transcriptome assembly from short reads. and requires minimal manual curation.

While DNA employs it for genome replication. RNA molecules fold into complicated secondary and tertiary structures. Current knowledge on functional RNA structures in human protein-coding genes is focused on locally-occurring base pairs. However. chemical crosslinking and proximity ligation experiments have demonstrated that long-range RNA structures are highly abundant. Here. we present the most complete to-date catalog of conserved long-range RNA structures in the human transcriptome. which consists of 1.1 million pairs of conserved complementary regions (PCCRs). PCCRs tend to occur within introns proximally to splice sites. suppress intervening exons. circumscribe circular RNAs. and exert an obstructive effect on cryptic and inactive splice sites. The double-stranded structure of PCCRs is supported by a significant decrease of icSHAPE nucleotide accessibility. high abundance of A-to-I RNA editing sites. and frequent nearby occurrence of forked eCLIP peaks. Introns with PCCRs show a distinct splicing pattern in response to RNA Pol II slowdown suggesting that splicing is widely affected by co-transcriptional RNA folding. Additionally. transcript starts and ends are strongly enriched in regions between complementary parts of PCCRs. leading to an intriguing hypothesis that RNA folding coupled with splicing could mediate co-transcriptional suppression of premature cleavage and polyadenylation events.

10099407,Spatial and temporal transcriptional landscape during fly development,,Cecilia Coimbra Klein and Marina Ruiz-Romero and Silvia Perez-Lluch and Alessandra Breschi and Amaya Abad and Emilio Palumbo and Roderic Guigó,,,,,,During development most tissues undergo fast changes in order to develop into a functional organs. In this scenario regulation of gene expression turns to be essential to determine cell and tissue specificity. Although many studies aim to decipher tissue signature through the analysis of their transcriptome profiles most lack temporal information during tissue differentiation. In this study we track down the transcriptome of pre-determined cells throughout differentiation to identify the dynamic transcriptional profile from the antenna. eye. leg. genitalia and wing of Drosophila melanogaster development. We identified three main sets of genes: commonly expressed genes that change across time. tissue-specific genes and time-tissue specific genes. Our analyses suggest that although differences among tissues increase over time a conserved gene regulatory network is leading the differentiation process. At the early stages of differentiation. the genes contributing to tissue morphogenesis are related to cell cycle and proliferation while later to cuticle formation and neural development. A comparison of the splicing patterns shows that there are fewer differences in splicing when compared to gene expression. Nevertheless. the differences in isoform usage are mainly associated to genes known to play a role in neural fate and are found in late stage. suggesting that splicing may play a role during differentiation. Overall we observe that the transcriptome diverge as tissues become more specified. Finally to further characterize cell sub-populations in tissue development we analyzed the four compartments of wing primordia and identified genes that are …,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:mel-f30kHHgC,0,https://public-docs.crg.eu/rguigo/Data/cklein/CSHL.pdf,,,,https://public-docs.crg.eu/rguigo/Data/cklein/CSHL.pdf,0,0,0

10099409,Transcriptional landscape of the Drosophila wing,,Alessandra Breschi and Silvia Perez-Lluch and Emilio Palumbo and Amaya Abad and Roderic Guigó,1,cell,,0,,The fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster) is one of the most studied model organisms. however only few transcriptomics and epigenetics studies by next-generation sequencing technologies are available for specific tissues along different developmental stages. In the current study we aim to profile RNAseq from five different wing compartments in three developmental stages. namely third instar larva. white pupa and late pupa. Preliminary RNA-seq data are available for the five sub-compartments of the wing imaginal discs in the third instar larva. We identified sets of commonly expressed genes as well as compartment-specific genes. A comparison of the splicing patterns shows that differences in splicing are negligible when compared to differences in the gene expression. The strand-specificity of the RNA-seq protocol allowed us to identify about 40 sense-antisense gene pairs with a significant level of correlation of expression. GO analysis of the coding genes with overlapping antisense non-coding transcript reveals an enrichment for development-related terms and encourages a possible regulation for at least some of the antisense genes.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC,0,https://public-docs.crg.es/rguigo/Data/cklein/dmel/NGS14_ERC.poster.pdf,,,,https://public-docs.crg.es/rguigo/Data/cklein/dmel/NGS14_ERC.poster.pdf,0,0,0

10099414,Comparison of Alternative Splicing Structures in Eukaryotes,,Michael Sammeth and Sylvain Foissac and Roderic Guigó,,,,,,Numerous databases of alternative splice forms have been generated over the recent years. which–beside of using heterogenous input data–differ substantially in the definition and in the representation of patterns. Motivated by this. we have developed a novel relative position notation system to univocally describe alternative splicing (AS) events. and a parsing and visualization tool (AStaLaVista) that. based on this notation. is able to automatically characterize AS events from gene annotations. We have used this tool to compare AS in different annotations for the human genome (ie. GENCODE. REFSEQ and ENSEMBL) as well as across annotations for different eukaryotes. One outcome of our studies is that the impact of AS on the untranslated regions has probably been underestimated hitherto. We also show specific differences of the landscape of AS structures in UTR and in the CDS.

The percentage of proteins with at least one amino acid tandem repeat was remarkably high in all three mammalian species. and clearly larger in humans (17.6%) than in mice (14.9%) or rats (13.7%). The most prominent repeat types were E (glutamic acid). P (proline). A (alanine). L (leucine). S (serine). and G (glycine). followed by Q (glutamine) and K (lysine; Fig. 1). The frequency of different amino acid repeat types was similar to that found for human proteins by Karlin et al.(2002). The number of amino acid repeats in mouse proteins represented 80%(1482 vs. 1833) of the number found in human ones. and that of the rat 72%(1323 vs. 1833).

We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex. ethnicity. and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity. with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain. which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing. despite its stochasticity. may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes. Gene expression is the key determinant of cellular phenotype. and genome-wide expression analysis has been a mainstay of genomics and biomedical research. providing insights into the molecular events underlying human biology and disease. Whereas expression data sets from tissues/primary cells (1. 2) and individuals (3) have accumulated over recent years. only limited expression data sets have allowed analysis across tissues and individuals,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4775485146370494396&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) is developing such a resource (5. 6). collecting multiple “nondiseased” tissues sampled from recently deceased human donors. We analyzed the GTEx pilot data freeze (6). which comprised RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from 1641 samples from 175 individuals representing 43 sites: 29 solid organ tissues. 11 brain subregions. whole blood. and two cell lines: Epstein-Barr virus–transformed lymphocytes (LCL) and cultured fibroblasts from skin [table S1 and (7)].The identification and characterization of genetic variants that are associated with gene expression are extensively discussed in (6). Here we use the GTEx data to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues and how these patterns associate with human phenotypes. RNA-seq performed on the GTEx pilot samples produced an average of 80 million paired-end mapped reads per sample (fig. S1)(7. 8). We used the mapped reads to quantify gene expression using Gencode V12 annotation (9). which includes 20.110 protein-coding genes (PCGs) and 11.790 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).

In order to assess the perturbations of gene expression in trisomic cells. we studied the transcriptome of fibroblasts derived from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21. The use of these samples eliminates the genomic variability and identifies changes related to the T21 per se. Surprisingly. we found that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along the chromosomes. We identified 237 of those large regions that are either up-or downregulated in the trisomic twin. We found that those gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) can be partially defined by the expression level of their gene content.

10099425,Genomic analysis of ENCODE data: a weak but very widespread role of chromatin organization in alternative splicing.,,Roderic Guigó,,,,,,Whether an alternative exon is included or excluded in a mature RNA is considered a matter of combinatorial control. involving splice sites. additional binding sites and the factors that recognize them1. Recently evidence accumulated that this combinatorial control might actually involve more factors than previously anticipated. First. splicing can occur co-transcriptionally2. 3 and this mode of intron removal seems to be the most prominent one in yeast4. drosophila {CITE ROSBASH} and human {CITE US AND THE NSMB paper}. Second. some splicing factors are known to interact with modified histone tails5 and intragenic histone modifications have been shown experimentally to be involved in alternative splicing decisions on single genes6. 7. Third. a wave of publications in 2009 showed that chromatin structure related to exonintron structure8-13 genome wide. Finally lysine 36 trimethylation and lysine 4 methylation states have been linked to the control of alternative exons through the splicing factor PTB14. thereby offering a mechanistic explanation of how histone modification states can influence splicing outcome. Hence. interplay between chromatin and splicing can be considered accepted. It remains however unclear how important and widespread such interactions are. Here. analyzing data generated within the ENCODE project15. we explore how often cell-type specific splicing is paralleled by cell-type specific chromatin states and show that chromatin associated variables have weak but significant predictive capacity for exonic inclsuion levels.

For every such pair we calculated the percentage of overlap. expressed as the ratio of the intersection over the union of their corresponding lengths. We then analyzed the distribution of these overlaps (Supplementary Figure 1). We found that 31234 nucleosomes of the Lee et al.[1] dataset had at least 1 nucleotide overlap with the set of Shivaswamy et al [2]. Among these overlapping positions only 9.8% of the cases (3061 nucleosomes) had an overlap. which exceeded 0.95 while 17.8% of the cases (5560 nucleosomes) had an overlap greater than 0.90. To test the significance of these values we performed 1000 simulations of two random experiments which produced equal number of nucleosomal calls. The overlap values between two random experiments followed a Poisson distribution. which was significantly different from the observed one (p-value< 10-6 according to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). In fact. an overlap ratio of 0.95 was not encountered in any of the 1000 simulations. We thus opted for this rather strict threshold of 0.95 to define a subset of consistent nucleosome positions among the two datasets.,True,nUDzsZsAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miguel_Beato/publication/293882391_Additional_file_1/data/56e7e48408ae166360e4b9e9/1756-8935-3-20-S1.DOC,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miguel_Beato/publication/293882391_Additional_file_1/data/56e7e48408ae166360e4b9e9/1756-8935-3-20-S1.DOC,0,0,0

Large-scale experimental approaches [1. 2] have shed light to a number of interesting aspects of nucleosome positioning and of existing patterns related to its regulatory role. Computational approaches to predict nucleosome positioning [3. 4] have also led to similar conclusions. We have used a novel. computational method. called SymCurv. to define regions of nucleosome occupancy in genomic sequences ab initio [5]. Our approach is based on imposing symmetry constraints on the predicted curvature of a sequence. initially calculated using the roll. twist and tilt angles between trinucleotide steps.

The method is based on the theory of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are considered a supervised computer learning method because they exploit prior knowledge of gene function to identify unknown genes of similar function from expression data. SVMs avoid several problems associated with unsupervised clustering methods. such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps. SVMs have many mathematical features that make them attractive for gene expression analysis. including their flexibility in choosing a similarity function. sparseness of solution when dealing with large data sets. the ability to handle large feature spaces. and the ability to identify outliers.

To address the problem of analyzing such data. we describe a statistical method. which we have called 'gene shaving'. The method identifies subsets of genes with coherent expression patterns and large variation across conditions. Gene shaving differs from hierarchical clustering and other widely used methods for analyzing gene expression studies in that genes may belong to more than one cluster. and the clustering may be supervised by an outcome measure. The technique can be 'unsupervised'. that is. the genes and samples are treated as unlabeled. or partially or fully supervised by using known properties of the genes or samples to assist in finding meaningful groupings. We illustrate the use of the gene shaving method to analyze gene expression measurements made on samples from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

We find that these sequence-specific DNA binding proteins bind with quantitatively different specificities to highly overlapping sets of several thousand genomic regions in blastoderm embryos. Specific high- and moderate-affinity in vitro recognition sequences for each factor are enriched in bound regions.

However. protein production is also subject to stochastic fluctuations. or “noise.” Several recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli have investigated the relationship between transcription and translation rates and stochastic fluctuations in protein levels. or more generally. how such randomness is a function of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However. the fundamental question of whether stochasticity in protein expression is generally biologically relevant has not been addressed. and it remains unknown whether random noise in the protein production rate of most genes significantly affects the fitness of any organism. We propose that organisms should be particularly sensitive to variation in the protein levels of two classes of genes: genes whose deletion is lethal to the organism and genes that encode subunits of multiprotein complexes. Using an experimentally verified model of stochastic gene expression in S. cerevisiae. we estimate the noise in protein production for nearly every yeast gene. and confirm our prediction that the production of essential and complex-forming proteins involves lower levels of noise than does the production of most other genes. Our results support the hypothesis that noise in gene expression is a biologically important variable. is generally detrimental to organismal fitness. and is subject to natural selection.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,434,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020137,1826539140891547780,/scholar?cites=1826539140891547780,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020137,0,0,0

All three possible groupings of the species have been reported in the past. though recent multi-gene studies suggest that D. erecta and D. yakuba are sister species. Using the whole genomes of each of these species as well as the four other fully sequenced species in the subgenus Sophophora. we set out to investigate the placement of D. erecta and D. yakuba in the D. melanogaster species group and to understand the cause of the past incongruence. Though we find that the phylogeny grouping D. erecta and D. yakuba together is the best supported. we also find widespread incongruence in nucleotide and amino acid substitutions. insertions and deletions. and gene trees. The time inferred to span the two key speciation events is short enough that under the coalescent model. the incongruence could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting. Consistent with the lineage-sorting hypothesis. substitutions supporting the same tree were spatially clustered. Support for the different trees was found to be linked to recombination such that adjacent genes support the same tree most often in regions of low recombination and substitutions supporting the same tree are most enriched roughly on the same scale as linkage disequilibrium. also consistent with lineage sorting.

However. we demonstrate here that regulatory sequences whose binding sites have been almost completely rearranged can still produce identical outputs. We sequenced the even-skipped locus from six species of scavenger flies (Sepsidae) that are highly diverged from the model species Drosophila melanogaster. but share its basic patterns of developmental gene expression. Although there is little sequence similarity between the sepsid eve enhancers and their well-characterized D. melanogaster counterparts. the sepsid and Drosophila enhancers drive nearly identical expression patterns in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos. We conclude that the molecular machinery that connects regulatory sequences to the transcription apparatus is more flexible than previously appreciated. In exploring this diverse collection of sequences to identify the shared features that account for their similar functions. we found a small number of short (20–30 bp) sequences nearly perfectly conserved among the species. These highly conserved sequences are strongly enriched for pairs of overlapping or adjacent binding sites.

To better understand the mechanisms of ZLD activation and the range of its targets. we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before (mitotic cycle 8). during (mitotic cycle 13). and after (late mitotic cycle 14) the MZT. Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic cycle 10. we identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos. most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. As expected. early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However. we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT.

To investigate this. we systematically explored the conservation of regulatory networks in fungi by examining the cis-regulatory elements that govern the expression of coregulated genes. We first identified groups of coregulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes enriched for genes with known upstream or downstream cis-regulatory sequences. Reasoning that many of these gene groups are coregulated in related species as well. we performed similar analyses on orthologs of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes in 13 other ascomycete species. We find that many species-specific gene groups are enriched for the same flanking regulatory sequences as those found in the orthologous gene groups from S. cerevisiae. indicating that those regulatory systems have been conserved in multiple ascomycete species. In addition to these clear cases of regulatory conservation. we find examples of cis-element evolution that suggest multiple modes of regulatory diversification. including alterations in transcription factor-binding specificity. incorporation of new gene targets into an existing regulatory system. and cooption of regulatory systems to control a different set of genes. We investigated one example in greater detail by measuring the in vitro activity of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Rpn4p and its orthologs from Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa. Our results suggest that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins has coevolved with the sequences found upstream of the Rpn4p target genes and suggest that Rpn4p has a different function in N …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,259,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020398,4327969625013446547,/scholar?cites=4327969625013446547,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020398,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A program (HOOK) is described for generating potential ligands that satisfy the chemical and steric requirements of the binding region of a macromolecule. Functional group sites with defined positions and orientations are derived from known ligand structures or the multicopy simulation search (MCSS) method (Miranker. A.. Karplus. M. Proteins 11: 29–34. 1991). HOOK places molecular “skeletons” from a database into the protein binding region by making bonds between sites (“hooks”) on the skeleton and functional groups. The nonpolar interactions with the binding region of candidate molecules are assessed by use of a simplified van der Waals potential. The method is illustrated by constructing ligands for the sialic acid binding site of the hemagglutinin from the influenza A virus and the active site of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.

The similarly conserved Nipped-B protein is needed for cohesin to bind to chromosomes. In higher organisms. Nipped-B and cohesin regulate gene expression and development by unknown mechanisms. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation. we find that Nipped-B and cohesin bind to the same sites throughout the entire non-repetitive Drosophila genome. They preferentially bind transcribed regions and overlap with RNA polymerase II. This contrasts sharply with yeast. where cohesin binds almost exclusively between genes.

Identifying how many phenotypes are associated with differences in gene expression and how many gene-expression differences are associated with a phenotype is important to understanding the molecular basis and evolution of complex traits. We compared levels of gene expression among nine natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown either in the presence or absence of copper sulfate. Of the nine strains. two show a reduced growth rate and two others are rust colored in the presence of copper sulfate. We identified 633 genes that show significant differences in expression among strains. Of these genes. 20 were correlated with resistance to copper sulfate and 24 were correlated with rust coloration. The function of these genes in combination with their expression pattern suggests the presence of both correlative and causative expression differences. But the majority of differentially expressed genes were not correlated with either phenotype and showed the same expression pattern both in the presence and absence of copper sulfate. To determine whether these expression differences may contribute to phenotypic variation under other environmental conditions. we examined one phenotype. freeze tolerance. predicted by the differential expression of the aquaporin gene AQY2. We found freeze tolerance is associated with the expression of AQY2.

Here we use a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding to evaluate the contribution of different biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities alone achieve a correlation of ∼0.4 with experimental measurements of in vivo binding. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among the five factors. and accounting for spatial patterning by modeling binding in every nucleus independently. had little effect on prediction accuracy. A major source of error was the prediction of binding events that do not occur in vivo. which we hypothesized reflected reduced accessibility of chromatin. To test this. we incorporated experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into our model. effectively restricting predicted binding to regions of open chromatin.

Although a wide variety of experimental and computational methods have been developed to characterize transcription factor binding sites. they remain difficult to identify. Comparison of non-coding DNA from related species has shown considerable promise in identifying these functional non-coding sequences. even though relatively little is known about their evolution. Here we analyse the genome sequences of the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. bayanus. S. paradoxus and S. mikatae to study the evolution of transcription factor binding sites. As expected. we find that both experimentally characterized and computationally predicted binding sites evolve slower than surrounding sequence. consistent with the hypothesis that they are under purifying selection. We also observe position-specific variation in the rate of evolution within binding sites. We find that the position-specific rate of evolution is positively correlated with degeneracy among binding sites within S. cerevisiae. We test theoretical predictions for the rate of evolution at positions where the base frequencies deviate from background due to purifying selection and find reasonable agreement with the observed rates of evolution.

In humans. many more genes undergo consistent expression changes in the cortex than in the cerebellum; in chimpanzees. many genes change expression with age in cortex. but the pattern of changes in expression bears almost no resemblance to that of human cortex.

At mitotic cycle 8. when few zygotic genes are being transcribed. embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions. undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin. and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 12. but it is not until cycle 14 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown to be bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda. suggesting that Zelda triggers a cascade of events. including the accumulation of specific histone modifications. that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03737.001,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC,131,https://elifesciences.org/articles/03737,14962563731588654168,/scholar?cites=14962563731588654168,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/03737.pdf,0,0,0

However the generality of this response across T. gondii strains and the underlying mechanism for this pathogen-mediated behavioral change remain unknown. To begin exploring these questions. we evaluated the effects of infection with two previously uninvestigated isolates from the three major North American clonal lineages of T. gondii. Type III and an attenuated strain of Type I. Using an hour-long open field activity assay optimized for this purpose. we measured mouse aversion toward predator and non-predator urines. We show that loss of innate aversion of cat urine is a general trait caused by infection with any of the three major clonal lineages of parasite. Surprisingly. we found that infection with the attenuated Type I parasite results in sustained loss of aversion at times post infection when neither parasite nor ongoing brain inflammation were detectable.

Here we report that chromatin structure also affects laboratory DNA manipulation in ways that distort the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. We initially discovered this effect at the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMR locus. where we found that silenced chromatin was refractory to shearing. relative to euchromatin. Using input samples from ChIP-Seq studies. we detected a similar bias throughout the heterochromatic portions of the yeast genome. We also observed significant chromatin-related effects at telomeres. protein binding sites. and genes. reflected in the variation of input-Seq coverage. Experimental tests of candidate regions showed that chromatin influenced shearing at some loci. and that chromatin could also lead to enriched or depleted DNA levels in prepared samples. independently of shearing effects. Our results suggested that assays relying on immunoprecipitation of chromatin will be biased by intrinsic differences between regions packaged into different chromatin structures - biases which have been largely ignored to date.

Several highly virulent fungal pathogens have recently been discovered in natural populations. highlighting the need for a better understanding of fungal-vertebrate host-pathogen interactions. Because most fungal pathogens are not fatal in the absence of other predisposing conditions. host-pathogen dynamics for deadly fungal pathogens are of particular interest.

We have sequenced the genome allowing annotation of all key signaling pathways. transcription factors. and non-coding RNAs that will enhance ongoing functional studies. Parhyale is a member of the Malacostraca clade. which includes crustacean food crop species. We analysed the immunity related genes of Parhyale as an important comparative system for these species. where immunity related aquaculture problems have increased as farming has intensified. We also find that Parhyale and other species within Multicrustacea contain the enzyme sets necessary to perform lignocellulose digestion ('wood eating'). suggesting this ability may predate the diversification of this lineage. Our data provide an essential resource for further development of Parhyale as an experimental model. The first malacostracan genome will underpin ongoing comparative work in food crop species and research investigating lignocellulose as an energy source.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20062.001,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC,86,https://elifesciences.org/articles/20062,6704019409173921059,/scholar?cites=6704019409173921059,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/20062.pdf,0,0,0
10099523,Evolutionary mirages: selection on binding site composition creates the illusion of conserved grammars in Drosophila enhancers,2010,Richard W Lusk and Michael B Eisen,6,PLoS Genet,1,e1000829,Public Library of Science,The clustering of transcription factor binding sites in developmental enhancers and the apparent preferential conservation of clustered sites have been widely interpreted as proof that spatially constrained physical interactions between transcription factors are required for regulatory function. However. we show here that selection on the composition of enhancers alone. and not their internal structure. leads to the accumulation of clustered sites with evolutionary dynamics that suggest they are preferentially conserved. We simulated the evolution of idealized enhancers from Drosophila melanogaster constrained to contain only a minimum number of binding sites for one or more factors. Under this constraint. mutations that destroy an existing binding site are tolerated only if a compensating site has emerged elsewhere in the enhancer. Overlapping sites. such as those frequently observed for the activator Bicoid and repressor Krüppel. had significantly longer evolutionary half-lives than isolated sites for the same factors. This leads to a substantially higher density of overlapping sites than expected by chance and the appearance that such sites are preferentially conserved. Because D. melanogaster (like many other species) has a bias for deletions over insertions. sites tended to become closer together over time. leading to an overall clustering of sites in the absence of any selection for clustered sites. Since this effect is strongest for the oldest sites. clustered sites also incorrectly appear to be preferentially conserved. Following speciation. sites tend to be closer together in all descendent species than in their common ancestors. violating the common …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,80,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000829,17000730379295910949,/scholar?cites=17000730379295910949,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000829,0,0,0

Here we used lattice light-sheet microscopy to perform in vivo single-molecule imaging in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos of the transcription factor Bicoid that forms a gradient and initiates patterning along the anteroposterior axis. In contrast to canonical models. we observed that Bicoid binds to DNA with a rapid off rate throughout the embryo such that its average occupancy at target loci is on-rate-dependent. We further observed Bicoid forming transient “hubs” of locally high density that facilitate binding as factor levels drop. including in the posterior. where we observed Bicoid binding despite vanishingly low protein levels.

10099526,Drosophila embryogenesis scales uniformly across temperature in developmentally diverse species,2014,Steven G Kuntz and Michael B Eisen,10,PLoS Genet,4,e1004293,Public Library of Science,Temperature affects both the timing and outcome of animal development. but the detailed effects of temperature on the progress of early development have been poorly characterized. To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5°C and 32.5°C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes 33 hours at 17.5°C. and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5°C. above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably. while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold. the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis. we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species. like D. melanogaster. are of tropical origin. and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis. a sub-tropical fly. develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures. while D. virilis. a temperate fly. exhibits slower development at all temperatures.

10099529,GATA: a graphic alignment tool for comparative sequence analysis,2005,David A Nix and Michael B Eisen,6,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-8,BioMed Central,Several problems exist with current methods used to align DNA sequences for comparative sequence analysis. Most dynamic programming algorithms assume that conserved sequence elements are collinear. This assumption appears valid when comparing orthologous protein coding sequences. Functional constraints on proteins provide strong selective pressure against sequence inversions. and minimize sequence duplications and feature shuffling. For non-coding sequences this collinearity assumption is often invalid. For example. enhancers contain clusters of transcription factor binding sites that change in number. orientation. and spacing during evolution yet the enhancer retains its activity. Dot plot analysis is often used to estimate non-coding sequence relatedness. Yet dot plots do not actually align sequences and thus cannot account well for base insertions or deletions. Moreover. they lack an adequate statistical framework for comparing sequence relatedness and are limited to pairwise comparisons. Lastly. dot plots and dynamic programming text outputs fail to provide an intuitive means for visualizing DNA alignments. To address some of these issues. we created a stand alone. platform independent. graphic alignment tool for comparative sequence analysis (GATA                      http://gata.sourceforge.net/                                        ).

The determination of conserved sequences (often known as phylogenetic footprinting) has identified individual transcription factor binding sites. We extend this concept of functional conservation to higher-order features of transcription control regions. We used the genome sequences of four yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces to identify sequences potentially involved in multifactorial control of gene expression. We found 989 potential regulatory 'templates': pairs of hexameric sequences that are jointly conserved in transcription regulatory regions and also exhibit non-random relative spacing. Many of the individual sequences in these templates correspond to known transcription factor binding sites. and the sets of genes containing a particular template in their transcription control regions tend to be differentially expressed in conditions where the corresponding transcription factors are known to be active. The incorporation of word pairs to define sequence features yields more specific predictions of average expression profiles and more informative regression models for genome-wide expression data than considering sequence conservation alone. The incorporation of both joint conservation and spacing constraints of sequence pairs predicts groups of target genes that are specific for common patterns of gene expression.

Despite this progress. the precise physical nature of observed structures and the forces that govern their establishment remain poorly understood. Here we present high resolution Hi-C data from early Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that boundaries between topological domains of various sizes map to DNA elements that resemble classical insulator elements: short genomic regions sensitive to DNase digestion that are strongly bound by known insulator proteins and are frequently located between divergent promoters. Further. we show a striking correspondence between these elements and the locations of mapped polytene interband regions. We believe it is likely this relationship between insulators. topological boundaries. and polytene interbands extends across the genome. and we therefore propose a model in which decompaction of boundary-insulator-interband regions drives the organization of interphase chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC,59,https://elifesciences.org/articles/29550,10270868795532855139,/scholar?cites=10270868795532855139,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/29550.pdf,0,0,0

Its nuclei distribute in the embryo's interior during the first six divisions. dividing synchronously with a cycle time of less than ten minutes. After seven divisions (nuclear cycle 8). the syncytial blastoderm forms as the nuclei approach the embryo surface and slow their cycle time; subsequent divisions proceed in waves that initiate at the poles. Because genetic studies have not identified zygotic mutants that affect the early divisions and because transcription has not been detected before cycle 8. the early. pre-blastoderm embryo has been considered to rely entirely on maternal contributions and to be transcriptionally silent. Our studies identified several abnormal phenotypes in live engrailed (en) mutant embryos prior to cycle 8. as well as a small group of genes that are transcribed in embryos prior to cycle 7. Nuclei in en embryos divide asynchronously. an abnormality that was detected as early as nuclear cycle 2–3. Anti-En antibody detected nuclear En protein in embryos at cycle 2. and expression of an En:GFP fusion protein encoded in the paternal genome was also detected in cycle 2 nuclei. These findings demonstrate that the Drosophila embryo is functionally competent for gene expression prior to the onset of its rapid nuclear divisions and that the embryo requires functions that are expressed in the zygote in order to faithfully prosecute its early. pre-cellularization mitotic cycles.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,58,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003428,9794705500220759076,/scholar?cites=9794705500220759076,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003428,0,0,0

10099541,Sequencing mRNA from cryo-sliced Drosophila embryos to determine genome-wide spatial patterns of gene expression,2013,Peter A Combs and Michael B Eisen,8,PloS one,8,e71820,Public Library of Science,Complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression underlie embryo differentiation. yet methods do not yet exist for the efficient genome-wide determination of spatial expression patterns during development. In situ imaging of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard. but it is difficult and time consuming to apply to an entire genome. even when highly automated. Sequencing. in contrast. is fast and genome-wide. but is generally applied to homogenized tissues. thereby discarding spatial information. To take advantage of the efficiency and comprehensiveness of sequencing while retaining spatial information. we cryosectioned individual blastoderm stage Drosophila melanogaster embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and developed methods to reliably sequence the mRNA isolated from each 25 µm slice. The spatial patterns of gene expression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ hybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide timecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through gastrulation. We identified numerous genes with spatial patterns that have not yet been described in the several ongoing systematic in situ based projects.

This process is controlled by maternally deposited products. Initially. the zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent. and it is not until hours later that the zygotic genome takes control of development. The transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome is tightly coordinated with the degradation of the maternal products.

Understanding the origins of expression differences is complicated by the fact that organismal morphology and gene regulatory networks could potentially vary even between closely related species. To assess the scope of such changes. we used high-resolution imaging methods to measure mRNA expression in blastoderm embryos of Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila pseudoobscura and assembled these data into cellular resolution atlases. where expression levels for 13 genes in the segmentation network are averaged into species-specific. cellular resolution morphological frameworks. We demonstrate that the blastoderm embryos of these species differ in their morphology in terms of size. shape. and number of nuclei. We present an approach to compare cellular gene expression patterns between species. while accounting for varying embryo morphology. and apply it to our data and an equivalent dataset for Drosophila melanogaster. Our analysis reveals that all individual genes differ quantitatively in their spatio-temporal expression patterns between these species. primarily in terms of their relative position and dynamics. Despite many small quantitative differences. cellular gene expression profiles for the whole set of genes examined are largely similar. This suggests that cell types at this stage of development are conserved. though they can differ in their relative position by up to 3–4 cell widths and in their relative proportion between species by as much as 5-fold.

Comparative genomic methods that use patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify non-coding sequences with regulatory function have yielded many new vertebrate enhancers. However. these methods have not contributed significantly to the identification of regulatory sequences in sequenced invertebrate taxa. We demonstrate here that this differential success. which is often attributed to fundamental differences in the nature of vertebrate and invertebrate regulatory sequences. is instead primarily a product of the relatively small size of sequenced invertebrate genomes. We sequenced and compared loci involved in early embryonic patterning from four species of true fruit flies (family Tephritidae) that have genomes four to six times larger than those of Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike in Drosophila. where virtually all non-coding DNA is highly conserved. blocks of conserved non-coding sequence in tephritids are flanked by large stretches of poorly conserved sequence. similar to what is observed in vertebrate genomes. We tested the activities of nine conserved non-coding sequences flanking the even-skipped gene of the teprhitid Ceratis capitata in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos. six of which drove patterns that recapitulate those of known D. melanogaster enhancers. In contrast. none of the three non-conserved tephritid non-coding sequences that we tested drove expression in D. melanogaster embryos.

Here. we use lattice light-sheet microscopy to integrate single-molecule and high-speed 4D imaging in developing Drosophila embryos to study the nuclear organization and interactions of the key transcription factors Zelda and Bicoid. In contrast to previous studies suggesting stable. cooperative binding. we show that both factors interact with DNA with surprisingly high off-rates. We find that both factors form dynamic subnuclear hubs. and that Bicoid binding is enriched within Zelda hubs. Remarkably. these hubs are both short lived and interact only transiently with sites of active Bicoid-dependent transcription. Based on our observations. we hypothesize that. beyond simply forming bridges between DNA and the transcription machinery. transcription factors can organize other proteins into hubs that transiently drive multiple activities at their gene targets.Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

While these studies are potentially extremely powerful. a computationally intensive procedure. the de novo construction of a reference transcriptome must be completed as a prerequisite to further analyses. The accurate reference is critically important as all downstream steps. including estimating transcript abundance are critically dependent on the construction of an accurate reference. Though a substantial amount of research has been done on assembly. only recently have the pre-assembly procedures been studied in detail. Specifically. several stand-alone error correction modules have been reported on and. while they have shown to be effective in reducing errors at the level of sequencing reads. how error correction impacts assembly accuracy is largely unknown.

Here we report that TAF7L. a paralogue of TFIID subunit TAF7. is enriched in adipocytes and white fat tissue (WAT) in mouse. Depletion of TAF7L reduced adipocyte-specific gene expression. compromised adipocyte differentiation. and WAT development as well. Ectopic expression of TAF7L in myoblasts reprograms these muscle precursors into adipocytes upon induction. Genome-wide mRNA-seq expression profiling and ChIP-seq binding studies confirmed that TAF7L is required for activating adipocyte-specific genes via a dual mechanism wherein it interacts with PPARγ at enhancers and TBP/Pol II at core promoters. In vitro binding studies confirmed that TAF7L forms complexes with both TBP and PPARγ. These findings suggest that TAF7L plays an integral role in adipocyte gene expression by targeting enhancers as a cofactor for PPARγ and promoters as a component of the core transcriptional machinery.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00170.001,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C,41,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00170,15166492229278656496,/scholar?cites=15166492229278656496,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00170,0,0,0

We observed a surprising level of nucleotide divergence in transcriptionally silenced regions in inter-species comparisons of Saccharomyces yeasts. Likewise. intra-species analysis of polymorphisms also revealed increased SNP frequencies in both intergenic and synonymous coding positions of silenced DNA.

But even in relatively simple in vivo systems. the complexities of promoter organization and activity have made it difficult to predict how altering specific interactions between a transcription factor and DNA will affect promoter output. To better understand this. we measured the relative fitness of nearly all Escherichia coli   binding sites in different promoter and environmental contexts by competing four randomized  promoter libraries controlling the expression of the tetracycline resistance gene (tet) against each other in increasing concentrations of drug. We sequenced populations after competition to determine the relative enrichment of each −35 sequence. We observed a consistent relationship between the frequency of recovery of each −35 binding site and its predicted affinity for  that varied depending on the sequence context of the promoter and drug concentration. Overall the relative fitness of each promoter could be predicted by a simple thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation. in which the rate of transcriptional initiation (and hence fitness) is dependent upon the overall stability of the initiation complex. which in turn is dependent upon the energetic contributions of all sites within the complex. As implied by this model. a decrease in the free energy of association at one site could be compensated for by an increase in the binding energy at another to produce a similar output.

10099562,Identifying cis-regulatory sequences by word profile similarity,2009,Garmay Leung and Michael B Eisen,4,PloS one,9,e6901,Public Library of Science,Background Recognizing regulatory sequences in genomes is a continuing challenge. despite a wealth of available genomic data and a growing number of experimentally validated examples.  Methodology/Principal Findings We discuss here a simple approach to search for regulatory sequences based on the compositional similarity of genomic regions and known cis-regulatory sequences. This method. which is not limited to searching for predefined motifs. recovers sequences known to be under similar regulatory control. The words shared by the recovered sequences often correspond to known binding sites. Furthermore. we show that although local word profile clustering is predictive for the regulatory sequences involved in blastoderm segmentation. local dissimilarity is a more universal feature of known regulatory sequences in Drosophila.  Conclusions/Significance Our method leverages sequence motifs within a known regulatory sequence to identify co-regulated sequences without explicitly defining binding sites. We also show that regulatory sequences can be distinguished from surrounding sequences by local sequence dissimilarity. a novel feature in identifying regulatory sequences across a genome.

Recently. double-stranded protein-binding microarrays were developed as a potentially scalable approach to tackle transcription factor binding site identification. Here we present an algorithmic approach to experimental design of a microarray that allows for testing full specificity of a transcription factor binding to all possible DNA binding sites of a given length. with optimally efficient use of the array. This design is universal. works for any factor that binds a sequence motif and is not species-specific. Furthermore. simulation results show that data produced with the designed arrays is easier to analyze and would result in more precise identification of binding sites. In this study. we present a design of a double stranded DNA microarray for protein-DNA interaction studies and show that our algorithm allows optimally efficient use of the arrays for this purpose.

Morphological traits result from gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that form a web of transcription factors. which regulate multiple cis-regulatory element (CRE) sequences to control the coordinated expression of differentiation genes. The formation and modification of GRNs must ultimately be understood at the level of individual regulatory linkages (i.e.. transcription factor binding sites within CREs) that constitute the network. Here. we investigate how elements within a network originated and diversified to generate a broad range of abdominal pigmentation phenotypes among Sophophora fruit flies. Our data indicates that the coordinated expression of two melanin synthesis enzymes. Yellow and Tan. recently evolved through novel CRE activities that respond to the spatial patterning inputs of Hox proteins and the sex-specific input of Bric-à-brac transcription factors. Once established. it seems that these newly evolved activities were repeatedly modified by evolutionary changes in the network’s trans-regulators to generate large-scale changes in pigment pattern. By elucidating how yellow and tan are connected to the web of abdominal trans-regulators. we discovered that the yellow and tan abdominal CREs are composed of distinct regulatory inputs that exhibit contrasting responses to the same Hox proteins and Hox cofactors. These results provide an example in which CRE origination underlies a recently evolved novel trait. and highlights how coordinated expression patterns can evolve in parallel through …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005136,1648716529085708047,/scholar?cites=1648716529085708047,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005136,0,0,0

Given that osmoregulation can be challenging for these animals. with failure resulting in death. strong selection should be observed on genes related to the maintenance of water and solute balance. One such animal. Peromyscus eremicus. is native to the desert regions of the southwest United States and may live its entire life without oral fluid intake. As a first step toward understanding the genetics that underlie this phenotype. we present a characterization of the P. eremicus transcriptome. We assay four tissues (kidney. liver. brain. testes) from a single individual and supplement this with population level renal transcriptome sequencing from 15 additional animals. We identified a set of transcripts undergoing both purifying and balancing selection based on estimates of Tajima’s D.

We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infecting wild Drosophila. and established methods to infect D. melanogaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death. they climb upward. extend their proboscides. affixing in place. then raise their wings. clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the nervous system. suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes.

Since both are determined by the biophysical properties of the DNA–binding domain. selection on one will ultimately affect the other. We were interested in understanding how plastic the informational and regulatory properties of a transcription factor are and how transcription factors evolve to balance these constraints. To study this. we developed an in vivo selection system in Escherichia coli to identify variants of the helix-turn-helix transcription factor MarA that bind different sets of binding sites with varying degrees of degeneracy. Unlike previous in vitro methods used to identify novel DNA binders and to probe the plasticity of the binding domain. our selections were done within the context of the initiation complex. selecting for both specific binding within the genome and for a physiologically significant strength of interaction to maintain function of the factor. Using MITOMI. quantitative PCR. and a binding site fitness assay. we characterized the binding. function. and fitness of some of these variants.

This article presents new estimates of legitimate fertility rates in the different social classes. The denominators used for estimating the rates were derived from mid-year population estimates for married women. disaggregated by social class using information from the 1971 and 1981 Censuses. These population estimates are shown to be consistent with results from the General Household Survey. the Labour Force Survey and the OPCS one per cent Longitudinal Study. The article concentrates mainly on a discussion of trends over time in fertility rates in each social class according to mother's age and birth order. Further discussion deals with a comparison between the social classes of: median intervals between marriage and first birth; mean ages of all women giving birth and of women having first births; and the proportions of births to women which are conceived inside and outside marriage. the size and age structure of the population of women in each social class.

Yet the contribution of this transition to the evolution of gene expression is poorly understood. Here we study two aspects of gene expression specific to early embryogenesis in Drosophila: sex-biased gene expression prior to the onset of canonical X chromosomal dosage compensation. and the contribution of maternally supplied mRNAs. We sequenced mRNAs from individual unfertilized eggs and precisely staged and sexed blastoderm embryos. and compared levels between D. melanogaster. D. yakuba. D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. First. we find that mRNA content is highly conserved for a given stage and that studies relying on pooled embryos likely systematically overstate the degree of gene expression divergence. Unlike studies done on larvae and adults where most species show a larger proportion of genes with male-biased expression. we find that transcripts in Drosophila embryos are largely female-biased in all species. likely due to incomplete dosage compensation prior to the activation of the canonical dosage compensation mechanism. The divergence of sex-biased gene expression across species is observed to be often due to lineage-specific decrease of expression; the most drastic example of which is the overall reduction of male expression from the neo-X chromosome in D. pseudoobscura. leading to a pervasive female-bias on this chromosome. We see no evidence for a faster evolution of expression on the X chromosome in embryos (no “faster-X” effect). unlike in adults. and contrary to a …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC,21,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005592,5213701583943801646,/scholar?cites=5213701583943801646,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005592,0,0,0

We have developed a genetic approach to investigate how reporter gene transcription is affected by varying the spacing between transcription factor binding sites. We characterized the components of promoter architecture that govern the yeast transcription factors Cbf1 and Met31/32. which bind independently. but collaboratively recruit the coactivator Met4. A Cbf1 binding site was required upstream of a Met31/32 binding site for full reporter gene expression. Distance constraints on coactivator recruitment were more flexible than those for cooperatively binding transcription factors. Distances from 18 to 50 bp between binding sites support efficient recruitment of Met4. with only slight modulation by helical phasing. Intriguingly. we found that certain sequences located between the binding sites abolished gene expression. These results yield insight to the influence of both binding site architecture and local DNA flexibility on gene expression. and can be used to refine computational predictions of gene expression from promoter sequences.

Here. we evaluated how different microbial species commonly associated with laboratory-reared Drosophila melanogaster impact host biology at the level of gene expression in the dissected adult gut and in the entire adult organism. We observed that guts from animals associated from the embryonic stage with either zero. one or three bacterial species demonstrated indistinguishable transcriptional profiles. Additionally. we found that the gut transcriptional profiles of animals reared in the presence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone or in combination with bacteria could recapitulate those of conventionally-reared animals. In contrast. we found whole body transcriptional profiles of conventionally-reared animals were distinct from all of the treatments tested.

10099580,All motifs are NOT created equal: structural properties of transcription factor-DNA interactions and the inference of sequence specificity,2005,Michael B Eisen,6,Genome Biology,5,1-22,BioMed Central,The identification of transcription factor binding sites in genome sequences is an important problem in contemporary sequence analysis. and a plethora of approaches to the problem have been proposed. implemented and evaluated in recent years. Although the biological and statistical models. descriptions of binding sites and computational algorithms used vary considerably amongst these methods. most share a common assumption – that all motifs are equally likely to be transcription factor binding sites. Here we argue that this simplifying assumption is incorrect – that the specific nature of transcription factor-DNA interactions imposes constraints on the types of motifs that are likely to be transcription factor binding sites and on the relationships between motifs recognized by members of structurally similar transcription factors. We propose that our structural and biochemical understanding of the interactions …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,19,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-p7,2493650522926225177,/scholar?cites=2493650522926225177,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/gb-2005-6-5-p7.pdf,0,0,0
10099581,The ecology of the Drosophila-yeast mutualism in wineries,2018,Allison S Quan and Michael B Eisen,13,PloS one,5,e0196440,Public Library of Science,The fruit fly. Drosophila melanogaster. is preferentially found on fermenting fruits. The yeasts that dominate the microbial communities of these substrates are the primary food source for developing D. melanogaster larvae. and adult flies manifest a strong olfactory system-mediated attraction for the volatile compounds produced by these yeasts during fermentation. Although most work on this interaction has focused on the standard laboratory yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. a wide variety of other yeasts naturally ferment fallen fruit. Here we address the open question of whether D. melanogaster preferentially associates with distinct yeasts in different. closely-related environments. We characterized the spatial and temporal dynamics of Drosophila-associated fungi in Northern California wineries that use organic grapes and natural fermentation using high-throughput. short-amplicon sequencing. We found that there is nonrandom structure in the fungal communities that are vectored by flies both between and within vineyards. Within wineries. the fungal communities associated with flies in cellars. fermentation tanks. and pomace piles are distinguished by varying abundances of a small number of yeast species. To investigate the origins of this structure. we assayed Drosophila attraction to. oviposition on. larval development in. and longevity when consuming the yeasts that distinguish vineyard microhabitats from each other. We found that wild fly lines did not respond differentially to the yeast species that distinguish winery habitats in habitat specific manner.

We find that despite being created by the independent activity of five enhancers. even-skipped stripes are sculpted by the same kinetic phenomena: a coupled increase of burst frequency and amplitude. By tracking the position and activity of individual nuclei. we show that stripe movement is driven by the exchange of bursting nuclei from the posterior to anterior stripe flanks.

10099588,Patterns of chromatin accessibility along the anterior-posterior axis in the early Drosophila embryo,2018,Jenna E Haines and Michael B Eisen,14,PLoS genetics,5,e1007367,Public Library of Science,As the Drosophila embryo transitions from the use of maternal RNAs to zygotic transcription. domains of open chromatin. with relatively low nucleosome density and specific histone marks. are established at promoters and enhancers involved in patterned embryonic transcription. However it remains unclear how regions of activity are established during early embryogenesis. and if they are the product of spatially restricted or ubiquitous processes. To shed light on this question. we probed chromatin accessibility across the anterior-posterior axis (A-P) of early Drosophila melanogaster embryos by applying a transposon based assay for chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) to anterior and posterior halves of hand-dissected. cellular blastoderm embryos. We find that genome-wide chromatin accessibility is highly similar between the two halves. with regions that manifest significant accessibility in one half of the embryo almost always accessible in the other half. even for promoters that are active in exclusively one half of the embryo. These data support previous studies that show that chromatin accessibility is not a direct result of activity. and point to a role for ubiquitous factors or processes in establishing chromatin accessibility at promoters in the early embryo. However. in concordance with similar works. we find that at enhancers active exclusively in one half of the embryo. we observe a significant skew towards greater accessibility in the region of their activity. highlighting the role of patterning factors such as Bicoid in this process.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007367,4869404646713576254,/scholar?cites=4869404646713576254,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007367,0,0,0

Like many species with chromosomal sex determination. Drosophila females have two X chromosomes. while males have one X and one Y. Fusions of sex chromosomes with autosomes have occurred along the lineage leading to D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda. The resulting neo-sex chromosomes are gradually evolving the properties of sex chromosomes. and neo-X chromosomes are becoming targets for the molecular mechanisms that compensate for differences in X chromosome dose between sexes. We have previously shown that D. melanogaster possess at least two dosage compensation mechanisms: the well- characterized MSL-mediated dosage compensation active in most somatic tissues. and another system active during early embryogenesis prior to the onset of MSL-mediated dosage compensation. To better understand the developmental constraints on sex chromosome gene expression and evolution. we sequenced mRNA from individual male and female embryos of D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda. from ∼0.5 to 8 hours of development. Autosomal expression levels are highly conserved between these species. But. unlike D. melanogaster. we observe a general lack of dosage compensation in D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda prior to the onset of MSL-mediated dosage compensation. Thus. either there has been a lineage-specific gain or loss in early dosage compensation mechanism(s) or increasing X chromosome dose may strain dosage compensation systems and make them less …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004159,15908346028670502410,/scholar?cites=15908346028670502410,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004159,0,0,0

By determining these structural constraints. we can understand the “rules” that define functional cooperativity. Conversely. by understanding the rules of binding. we can infer structural characteristics. We have developed an information theory based method for approximating the physical limitations of cooperative interactions by comparing sequence analysis to microarray expression data. When applied to the coordinated binding of the sulfur amino acid regulatory protein Met4 by Cbf1 and Met31. we were able to create a combinatorial model that can correctly identify Met4 regulated genes.

These changes can be in cis regulatory elements that act in an allele-specific manner. or changes to the overall trans regulatory environment that interacts with cis regulatory sequences. Here we address several questions about the evolution of gene expression accompanying a convergently evolved constructive morphological trait. increases in tooth number in two independently derived freshwater populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Are convergently evolved cis and/or trans changes in gene expression associated with convergently evolved morphological evolution? Do cis or trans regulatory changes contribute more to gene expression changes accompanying an evolved morphological gain trait? Transcriptome data from dental tissue of ancestral low-toothed and two independently derived high-toothed stickleback populations revealed significantly shared gene expression changes that have convergently evolved in the two high-toothed populations. Comparing cis and trans regulatory changes using phased gene expression data from F1 hybrids. we found that trans regulatory changes were predominant and more likely to be shared among both high-toothed populations. In contrast. while cis regulatory changes have evolved in both high-toothed populations. overall these changes were distinct and not shared among high-toothed populations. Together these data suggest that a convergently evolved trait can occur through genetically distinct regulatory changes that converge on similar trans regulatory environments.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007443&rev=1,11708017196939486359,/scholar?cites=11708017196939486359,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007443&rev=1,0,0,0

The virus. which we name Entomophthovirus. is a capsid-forming. positive-strand RNA virus in the viral family iflaviridae. whose known members almost exclusively infect insects. We show that the virus RNA is expressed at high levels in fungal cells in vitro and during in vivo infections of Drosophila melanogaster. and that virus particles are present in E. muscae. Two close relatives of the virus had been previously described as insect viruses based on the presence of viral genomes in transcriptomes assembled from RNA extracted from wild dipterans. By analyzing sequencing data from these earlier reports. we show that both dipteran samples were co-infected with E. muscae. We also find the virus in RNA sequencing data from samples of two other species of dipterans. Musca domestica and Delia radicum. known to be infected with E. muscae. These data establish that Entomophthovirus is widely. and seemingly obligately. associated with E. muscae.

10099602,Use of an evolutionary model to provide evidence for a wide heterogeneity of required affinities between transcription factors and their binding sites in yeast,2008,Richard W Lusk and Michael B Eisen,,,,489-500,,The identification of transcription factor binding sites commonly relies on the interpretation of scores generated by a position weight matrix. These scores are presumed to reflect on the affinity of the transcription factor for the bound sequence. In almost all applications. a cutoff score is chosen to distinguish between functional and non-functional binding sites. This cutoff is generally based on statistical rather than biological criteria. Furthermore. given the variety of transcription factors. it is unlikely that the use of a common statistical threshold for all transcription factors is appropriate. In order to incorporate biological information into the choice of cutoff score. we developed a simple evolutionary model that assumes that transcription factor binding sites evolve to maintain an affinity greater than some factor-specific threshold. We then compared patterns of substitution in binding sites predicted by this model at different …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,7,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812776136_0047,9774035887860189582,/scholar?cites=9774035887860189582,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.143.4746&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

10099605,PointCloudExplore 2: Visual exploration of 3D gene expression,2008,Oliver Ruebel,,,,,,To better understand how developmental regulatory networks are defined in the genome sequence. the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project (BDNTP) has developed a suite of methods to describe 3D gene expression data. i.e.. the output of the network at cellular resolution for multiple time points. To allow researchers to explore these novel data sets we have developed PointCloudXplore (PCX). In PCX we have linked physical and information visualization views via the concept of brushing (cell selection). For each view dedicated operations for performing selection of cells are available. In PCX. all cell selections are stored in a central management system. Cells selected in one view can in this way be highlighted in any view allowing further cell subset properties to be determined. Complex cell queries can be defined by combining different cell selections using logical operations such as AND. OR. and NOT. Here we are going to provide an overview of PointCloudXplore 2 (PCX2). the latest publicly available version of PCX. PCX2 has shown to be an effective tool for visual exploration of 3D gene expression data. We discuss (i) all views available in PCX2. (ii) different strategies to perform cell selection.

The journal is published in partnership with the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). The importance of this partnership is described in the accompanying letter from Michael Gribskov. ISCB president.What motivates us to start a new journal at this time? Computation. driven in part by the influx of large amounts of data at all biological scales. has become a central feature of research and discovery in the life sciences. This work tends to be published either in methods journals that are not read by experimentalists or in one of the numerous journals reporting novel biology. each of which publishes only small amounts of computational research. Hence. the impact of this research is diluted. PLoS Computational Biology provides a home for important biological research driven by computation—a place where computational biologists can find the best work produced by their colleagues. and where the broader biological community can see the myriad ways computation is advancing our understanding of biological systems.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC,6,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010004,8314241856148370702,/scholar?cites=8314241856148370702,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010004,0,0,0

In this study. we investigated the temporal dynamics of Zelda binding along with the maternal patterning factors Dorsal and Caudal during early embryogenesis. We found in regions bound by Zelda and either Dorsal or Caudal. Zelda binding was detected. and reached maximum levels. earlier than Caudal and Dorsal. providing support of its role as a pioneer factor. We found that Dorsal and Caudal binding correlated strongly with Zelda binding at mitotic cycle 12. suggesting that Zelda is important for early binding by these factors and early onset of their target gene expression. At the same time. we show that among Dorsal target enhancers. the dorsal and ventral ectoderm enhancers are much more strongly associated with Zelda than mesoderm enhancers. revealing an additional function of Zelda in coordinating spatial activity of enhancers. We have also investigated the role of Zelda on chromatin structure. We found that in early embryos. before Dorsal and Caudal are bound at significant levels. Zelda binding is associated with histone acetylation and local histone depletion. These chromatin associated changes accompanied with increased local chromatin accessibility were also detected around Zelda peaks in coding sequences that do not appear to play a role in subsequent transcription factor binding. These findings suggest that Zelda binding itself can lead to chromatin structural changes. Finally. we found that Zelda motifs. both bound …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC,5,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/380857v1.abstract,16940708651982432908,/scholar?cites=16940708651982432908,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/07/30/380857.full.pdf,0,0,0

While traditional methods of mutagenesis and selection have been effective in improving production of compounds at a commercial scale. the genetic changes underpinning the altered phenotypes have remained largely unclear. We utilized high-throughput Illumina short read sequencing of a wild Penicillium chrysogenum strain in order to make whole genome comparisons to a sequenced improved strain (WIS 54–1255). We developed an assembly-free method of identifying chromosomal rearrangements and validated the in silico predictions with a PCR-based assay and Sanger sequencing. Despite many rounds of mutagen treatment and artificial selection. WIS 54–1255 differs from its wild progenitor at only one of the identified rearrangements. We suggest that natural variants predisposed for high penicillin production were instrumental in the success of WIS 54–1255 as an industrial strain. In addition to finding a previously published inversion in the penicillin biosynthesis cluster. we located several genes related to penicillin production associated with these rearrangements. By comparing the configuration of rearrangement events among several historically important strains known to be high penicillin producers to a collection of recently isolated wild strains. we suggest that wild strains with rearrangements similar to those in known high penicillin producers may be viable candidates for further improvement efforts.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096784,3405016201196298172,/scholar?cites=3405016201196298172,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096784,0,0,0

Among sequences recognized by a given DNA-binding protein. different positions exhibit varying degrees of conservation. The reason is that base pairs that are more extensively contacted by the protein tend to be more conserved. This observation can be used in the discovery of transcription factor binding sites. Here we present a rigorous means to accomplish this. In particular. we constrain the order of the information (entropy) in the columns of the position specific weight matrix (PWM) which characterizes the motif being sought. We then show how to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of a PWM under such order restrictions. This computation is easily integrated with the EM algorithm or the Gibbs sampler to enhance performance in the search for motifs in unaligned sequences.

10099623,Or22 allelic variation alone does not explain differences in discrimination of yeast-produced volatiles by D. melanogaster,2017,Carolyn Elya and Allison S Quan and Kelly M Schiabor and Michael B Eisen,,BioRxiv,,186064,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Different lines of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster show variation in the ability to discriminate between volatiles produced by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under natural (nitrogen-limiting. YVN) or laboratory (sugar-limiting. YVL) conditions. Previous work in our laboratory uncovered a strong correlation between heightened sensitivity to YVN wild D. melanogaster lines that harbored a chimeric variant of the highly variable odorant receptor 22 (Or22) locus of D. melanogaster. We sought to determine if this trend held for an extended set of D. melanogaster lines. if observed variation within chimeric and non-chimeric lines could be explained by nucleotide polymorphisms and if replacing Or22 with a chimeric allele in a non-chimeric background could confer the enhanced ability to detect YVN. In parallel. we performed crosses of chimeric and non-chimeric fly lines and assayed the behavior of their progeny for enhanced sensitivity to YVN to assess the heritability of the Or22 locus. Ultimately. we found that. while the overall trend of increased sensitivity to YVN in chimeric lines persists. there are exceptions and variation that cannot be explained by sequence variation at the Or22 locus. In addition. we did not observe increased sensitivity for YVN upon replacing the Or22 allele in a non-chimeric line (OreR) with that from our most YVN-sensitive. chimeric line (ME).

10099625,Non-respiratory functions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria are required for optimal attractiveness to Drosophila melanogaster,2014,Kelly M Schiabor and Allison S Quan and Michael B Eisen,,BioRxiv,,007336,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,While screening a large collection of wild and laboratory yeast isolates for their ability to attract Drosophila melanogaster adults. we noticed a large difference in fly preference for two nearly isogenic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. BY4741 and BY4742. Using standard genetic analyses. we tracked the preference difference to the lack of functional mitochondria the stock of BY4742 used in the initial experiment. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy to examine the volatile compounds produced by BY4741 and the mitochondria-deficient BY4742. and found they differed significantly. We found that several ethyl esters are present at much higher levels in strains with functional mitochondria. even in fermentative conditions. We confirmed the role of these ethyl esters in attraction by examining an EEB1Δ strain which reduces ethyl ester production. We found that nitrogen levels in the substrate affect the production of these compounds. and that they are produced at high levels by strains with functional mitochondria in the fermentation of natural substrates. Collectively these observations demonstrate the effect core metabolic processes have in mediating the interaction between yeasts and insect vectors. and highlight the importance of non-respirative mitochondrial functions in yeast ecology.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/007336v1.abstract,9747800730041818089,/scholar?cites=9747800730041818089,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2014/07/20/007336.full.pdf,0,0,0

The silencers are regulatory sites flanking both loci and consisting of binding sites for the Rap1. Abf1. and ORC proteins. each of which also functions at hundreds of sites throughout the genome in processes unrelated to silencing. Interestingly. the sequence of the binding site for Rap1 at the silencers is distinct from the genome-wide binding profile of Rap1. being a weaker match to the consensus. and indeed is bound with low affinity relative to the consensus sequence. Remarkably. this low-affinity Rap1 binding site variant was conserved among silencers of the sensu stricto Saccharomyces species. maintained as a poor match to the Rap1 genome-wide consensus sequence in all of them. We tested multiple predictions about the possible role of this binding-site variant in …,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,3,https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/2/12/1555/6028544,11168585112396909889,/scholar?cites=11168585112396909889,,https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/2/12/1555/6028544,0,0,0

As avid readers and writers of science at the online international undergraduate The Journal of Young Investigators (JYI)(1). we believe that informal education through Internet-based media promotes active and critical scientific thought.

We present a unified probabilistic framework for motif discovery that incorporates evolutionary information. We treat aligned DNA sequence as a mixture of evolutionary models. for motif and background. and. following the example of the MEME program. provide an algorithm to estimate the parameters by Expectation-Maximization. We examine a variety of evolutionary models and show that our approach can take advantage of phylogenic information to avoid false positives and discover motifs upstream of groups of characterized target genes.

Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is often multifactorial. involving multiple transcription factors binding to the same transcription control region (eg. upstream activating sequences and enhancers). and to understand the regulatory content of eukaryotic genomes it is necessary to consider the cooccurrence and spatial relationships of individual binding sites. The identification of sequences conserved among related species (often known as phylogenetic footprinting) has been successfully used to identify individual transcription factor binding sites. Here. we extend this concept of functional conservation to higher-order features of transcription control regions involved in the multifactorial control of gene expression.Results. We used the genome sequences of four yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces to identify sequences potentially involved in multifactorial control of gene expression. We found1.117 potential regulatory"" templates"": pairs of hexameric sequences that are jointly conserved in transcription regulatory regions and also exhibit non-random relative spacing. Many of the individual sequences in these templates correspond to known transcription factor binding sites. and the sets of genes containing a particular template in their transcription control regions tend to be differentially expressed in conditions where the corresponding transcription factors are known to be active.Conclusions. The incorporation of both joint conservation and spacing constraints of sequence pairs predicts groups of target genes that were specific for common patterns of gene expression.

Here we focus on a single experimental condition. and utilize gene expression data to identify sequence motifs associated with genes that are activated under this experimental condition. We use a linear model with two way interactions to model gene expression as a function of sequence features (words) present in presumptive transcription control regions. The most relevant features are selected by a feature selection method called stepwise selection with monte carlo cross validation. We apply this method to a publicly available dataset of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. focussing on the 800 basepairs immediately upstream of each gene's translation start site (the upstream control region (UCR)).

When overexpressed in epithelial cells. ILK inhibits E-cadherin expression. causing an epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. I demonstrate that ILK represses E-cadherin expression by stimulating the expression of Snail. a transcription factor that binds and represses the E-cadherin promoter. Inhibition of ILK in colon cancer cells with a highly selective ILK inhibitor. or dominant-negative ILK. resulted in the inhibition of Snail expression and a concomitant stimulation of expression of E-cadherin.

In this study. we leveraged extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of human-fish conserved and ultraconserved1 noncoding elements in the human genome. We tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay and observed that 45% functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. While directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo. the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. We identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression and used these features to rank all~ 3.100 human-fugu conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. The testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a three-fold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. These data dramatically expand the catalogue of in vivo-characterized human gene enhancers and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2mn1v97k/qt2mn1v97k_noSplash_1ecc279c86b7b56f0478f849d4d63de5.pdf,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2mn1v97k/qt2mn1v97k_noSplash_1ecc279c86b7b56f0478f849d4d63de5.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. genome-wide location analysis (chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray chip [ChIP-chip] analysis) revealed that NELF is concentrated at the 5 ends of 2.111 genes in Drosophila cells. Permanganate genomic footprinting was used to determine if paused Pol II colocalized with NELF. Forty-six of 56 genes with NELF were found to have paused Pol II. Pol II pauses 30 to 50 nucleotides downstream from transcription start sites. Analysis of DNA sequences in the vicinity of paused Pol II identified a conserved DNA sequence that probably associates with TFIID but detected no evidence of RNA secondary structures or other conserved sequences that might directly control elongation. ChIP-chip experiments indicate that GAGA factor associates with 39% of the genes that have NELF. Surprisingly. NELF associates with almost one-half of the most highly expressed genes. indicating that NELF is not necessarily a repressor of gene expression. NELF-associated pausing of Pol II might be an obligatory but sometimes transient checkpoint during the transcription cycle.Based on studies of the transcription inhibitor 5. 6-dichloro-1--D-ribobenzimidazole (DRB). it was proposed that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in animal cells is controlled a short distance downstream from the transcription start site by the opposing actions of positive and negative elongation factors. dubbed P-TEF and N-TEF. respectively (36). Biochemical analyses resulted in a model for regulation of transcription elongation in the promoter-proximal region (42).

10099721,Zelda (the coolest transcription factor ever) is a master regulator of embryonic adolescence,,Michael Eisen,,,,,,PLoS Genetics just published a paper from my lab describing our analysis of the binding and activity of a remarkable protein. known as Zelda. that appears to be a master regulator of genome activation in the earliest stages of Drosophila development. and thereby plays a major role in shaping the form and function of the mature animal.Virtually all animals begin life as a fertilized egg with a single copy of its diploid genome. In the earliest stages of development. the zygotic genome is generally inactive. with the embryo’s molecular processes being driven by proteins. RNAs and other substances packed into the egg by the mother. But at point ranging from a few hours to a few days after fertilization (depending on the species). the zygotic genome is activated. maternal proteins and RNAs are degraded. and the embryo takes control of its own fate (Tadros and Lipshitz. 2009 is an excellent review on the topic). It’s the functional equivalent of embryonic adolescence–at first the mother is in control of everything. the embryo makes some early. halting steps towards independence. and then. as a teenager. it breaks free completely.,True,z2foFg4AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,0,http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=617,,,,http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=617,0,0,0

While the modENCODE Project is pursuing that goal primarily by systematic. largescale experimental analyses. those experiments are already being guided and enhanced by available comparative genomics data. It is our thesis that additional sequencing will greatly improve our ability to identify functional elements in the D. melanogaster and C. elegans genomes especially in conjunction with experimental data being generated by modENCODE. These species were chosen to fill “phylogenetic discovery gaps”–the absence of sequence data at critical evolutionary distances identified by recent theoretical and empirical studies-as ideal for functional annotation.

A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks. the properties of reconstructed decay vertices. and the presence or absence of a lepton. or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at root s = 7TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb(-1). The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events. For analyses requiring higher purity. a misidentification probability of only 1.5% has been achieved. for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency.,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:u_MDJdmB8EcC,237,http://vinar.vin.bg.ac.rs/handle/123456789/5413,15839217231938391833,/scholar?cites=15839217231938391833,,https://vinar.vin.bg.ac.rs/bitstream/handle/123456789/5413/pdf.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Our aim is to quantify this measure of similarity to improve peptide:MHC binding prediction methods. This should help compensate for holes and bias in the sequence space coverage of existing peptide binding datasets. Here. a novel amino acid similarity matrix (PMBEC) is directly derived from the binding affinity data of combinatorial peptide mixtures. Like BLOSUM62. this matrix captures well-known physicochemical properties of amino acid residues. However. PMBEC differs markedly from existing matrices in cases where residue substitution involves a reversal of electrostatic charge. To demonstrate its usefulness. we have developed a new peptide:MHC class I binding prediction method. using the matrix as a …,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,149,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2105-10-394,17841439477155090332,/scholar?cites=17841439477155090332,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2105-10-394,0,0,0

The measurement of the Higgs boson lifetime is derived from its flight distance in the CMS detector with an upper bound of τ H< 1.9× 10− 13 s at the 95% confidence level (CL). corresponding to a lower bound on the width of Γ H> 3.5× 10− 9 MeV.

D-particles, fields, gravitation, and cosmology",11,112011,American Physical Society,A search has been performed for pair production of heavy vector-like down-type (B ) quarks. The analysis explores the lepton-plus-jets final state. characterized by events with one isolated charged lepton (electron or muon). significant missing transverse momentum and multiple jets. One or more jets are required to be tagged as arising from b -quarks. and at least one pair of jets must be tagged as arising from the hadronic decay of an electroweak boson. The analysis uses the full data sample of pp  collisions recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. operating at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb −1  . No significant excess of events is observed above the expected background. Limits are set on vector-like B  production. as a function of the B  branching ratios. assuming the allowable decay modes are B→Wt/Zb/Hb . In the chiral limit with a branching ratio of 100% for the decay B→Wt . the observed (expected) 95% CL lower limit on the vector-like B  mass is 810 GeV (760 GeV). In the case where the vector-like B  quark has branching ratio values corresponding to those of an SU(2)  singlet state. the observed (expected) 95% CL lower limit on the vector-like B  mass is 640 GeV (505 GeV). The same analysis. when used to investigate pair production of a colored. charge 5/3 exotic fermion T 5/3  . with subsequent decay T 5/3 →Wt . sets an observed (expected) 95% CL lower limit on the T 5/3   mass of 840 GeV (780 GeV).,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:gAJFiZdMcUIC,145,https://boris.unibe.ch/id/eprint/87643,15322916220422628680,/scholar?cites=15322916220422628680,,https://boris.unibe.ch/87643/8/PhysRevD.91.pdf,0,0,0

10099910,Search for additional neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in the  final state in proton-proton collisions at  13 TeV,2018,CMS collaboration,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.06553,,,,A search is presented for additional neutral Higgs bosons in the  final state in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM). using the data collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb . To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons. the search includes production of the Higgs boson in association with b quarks. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are set on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into  leptons and the cross section for the production via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks. These limits range from 18 pb at 90 GeV to 3.5 fb at 3.2 TeV for gluon fusion and from 15 pb (at 90 GeV) to 2.5 fb (at 3.2 TeV) for production in association with b quarks. assuming a narrow width resonance. In the m  scenario these limits translate into a 95% CL exclusion of 6 for neutral Higgs boson masses below 250 GeV. where  is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets.

This distribution can be used for a precise determination of the top-quark mass since gluon radiation depends on the mass of the quarks. The experimental analysis is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb−1. The selected events were identified using the lepton+jets top-quark-pair decay channel. where lepton refers to either an electron or a muon.

The morphological observation with electron microscopes revealed that nano-sized ZnO particles were embedded homogeneously in the inner part of PMMA microspheres. Moreover. their spherical shape could be maintained to a large amount of ZnO in the PMMA phase. From this study. it was found that one of key requirements in the synthesis of inorganic/polymer composite microspheres was the enhanced interfacial compatibility between inorganic and polymer. which was achieved by treating the surface of inorganics hydrophobically and imparting conformational anchorage factor at inorganic interfaces.,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:tfFR5hCbSrAC,115,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927775702000444,7829111658732224391,/scholar?cites=7829111658732224391,,,0,0,0

The twisted supersymmetric index at genus g and the correlation functions of half-BPS loop operators on S 1 can be computed exactly by supersymmetric localization. For g= 1. this gives a simple UV computation of the 3d Witten index. Twisted indices provide us with a clean derivation of the quantum algebra of supersymmetric Wilson loops. for any Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons-matter theory. in terms of the associated Bethe equations for the theory on. This also provides a powerful and simple tool to study 3d= 2 Seiberg dualities. Finally. we study A-and B-twisted indices for= 4 supersymmetric gauge theories. which turns out to be very useful for quantitative studies of three-dimensional mirror symmetry. We also briefly comment on a relation between the S 2× S 1 twisted …,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:bODvOFH0kxoC,106,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP08(2016)059,3496644086923291659,/scholar?cites=3496644086923291659,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP08(2016)059.pdf,0,0,0

The friction coefficient of fullerene nano-oil at the lower normal loads (<∼1200 N) under the fixed orbiting speed (∼1800 rpm) was ∼0.02. while that of pure oil was ∼0.03. indicating that the fullerene nanoparticles dispersed in the base refrigerant oil improved the lubrication property by coating the friction surfaces.

In electron microscopy observation. it was found that TiO2 nanoparticles were embedded homogeneously in the PMMA phase. This study elucidates that the interfacial compatibility between TiO2 and PMMA played a decisive role in producing the composite microspheres structured with inner TiO2 and continuous PMMA. which was achieved by treating the surface of the TiO2 particles hydrophobically. The TiO2/PMMA composite microspheres produced showed good ability to protect against UV rays and are therefore of great usefulness in cosmetic formulations.,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:s3QjdzrrZf4C,90,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00396-002-0655-6,7572848311321942635,/scholar?cites=7572848311321942635,,,0,0,0

The measurement uses 90 pb− 1 of data from p p collisions at s= 1.8 TeV collected with the CDF detector. An inclusive lepton trigger is used to collect a large sample of B hadron semileptonic decays. The mass difference Δ m d is determined from the proper time dependence of the fraction of B hadrons that undergo flavor oscillations. The flavor at decay is inferred from the charge of the lepton from semileptonic B decay. The initial flavor is inferred by determining the flavor of the other B hadron produced in the collision. either from its semileptonic decay (soft-lepton tag) or from its jet charge.

MFC technology has been found in a wide range of applications. including biosensors.[2. 3] small power generation systems. such as sediment batteries.[4. 5] and wastewater treatment systems.[6. 7] However. most have only been implemented on lab-scale. The scalability of MFCs is crucial for real applications. not only in terms of increased capacity of fuel utilization. but also to increase the power production. Therefore. this concept has recently become a critical issue pertaining to their feasibility; a number of researchers have focused on various MFC configurations. electrode/separator materials. catalysis. etc.[8] To fulfill these needs. MFC stacks have been investigated. and two approaches have been attempted so far: 1) Serial stacking individual MFCs.[9–14] and 2) installing multiple anodes in a single compartment.[15–19] In terms of ease-of-construction. the second approach ensures simpler fabrication than the first. which requires a delicate design for the feed and discharge. that is. the second approach has advantages in terms of construction and maintenance (viability requirements). In addition. the installation of multiple anodes in a reactor can increase the ratio of electrode area per volume of anode compartment. and it was previously verified that a high ratio leads to a high power density.[16],True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:Iq19BMNozs4C,80,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daehee_Kim7/publication/224926162_Scaling-Up_Microbial_Fuel_Cells_Configuration_and_Potential_Drop_Phenomenon_at_Series_Connection_of_Unit_Cells_in_Shared_Anolyte/links/5a84fcbf0f7e9b2c3f502d1d/Scaling-Up-Microbial-Fuel-Cells-Configuration-and-Potential-Drop-Phenomenon-at-Series-Connection-of-Unit-Cells-in-Shared-Anolyte.pdf,5524282154001637359,/scholar?cites=5524282154001637359,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daehee_Kim7/publication/224926162_Scaling-Up_Microbial_Fuel_Cells_Configuration_and_Potential_Drop_Phenomenon_at_Series_Connection_of_Unit_Cells_in_Shared_Anolyte/links/5a84fcbf0f7e9b2c3f502d1d/Scaling-Up-Microbial-Fuel-Cells-Configuration-and-Potential-Drop-Phenomenon-at-Series-Connection-of-Unit-Cells-in-Shared-Anolyte.pdf,0,0,0

In addition. the anode open circuit potentials (OCPs) of the sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) became more negative with sediment depth.

The shape from the result of the parameter optimization is determined as a final model with some modifications.

A study was therefore conducted to determine whether OA and UA could stimulate the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes through peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor (PPAR)‐α activation. This work was then extended to investigate the rate of formation of cornified envelope as a marker in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes and the amount of transglutaminase in human keratinocytes treated with OA and UA. It was shown that OA induced the differentiation of …,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:Lbh3VFZM3akC,72,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0906-6705.2005.00386.x,6624696111802408397,/scholar?cites=6624696111802408397,,,0,0,0

Despite that the mutation of p20 caused the highest susceptibility toward organic hydroperoxide and heat stress. the cellular level of p20 did not respond to the exposure of oxidative stress. Expression level of p20 during anaerobic growth was sustained at the ∼50% level compared with that of the aerobic growth. Viability of aerobic p20Δ without glucose was reduced to the ∼65% level of isogenic strains. whereas viability of aerobic p20Δ with 0.5% glucose supplement was sustained. The deletion of p20 resulted in a gradual loss of the cell viability during anaerobic …,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:08ThfGyFJksC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817477775,1471719079478369666,/scholar?cites=1471719079478369666,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817477775,0,0,0

Two common approaches to determine prediction performance are cross-validation. in which all available data are iteratively split into training and testing data. and the use of blind sets generated separately from the data used to construct the predictive method. In the present study. we have compared cross-validated prediction performances generated on our last benchmark dataset from 2009 with prediction performances generated on data subsequently added to the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) which served as a blind set. We found that cross-validated performances systematically overestimated performance on the blind set.

Imaging analysis shows a deviation from a Gaussian tail at r≳ 10 fm. although the bulk emission at lower radius is well described by a Gaussian.

We measure this polarization from the invariant mass of the b quark from t→ W b and the lepton from W→ l ν whose momenta measure the W decay angle and direction of motion. respectively. In this paper we present a measurement of the decay rate (f V+ A) of the W produced from the decay of the top quark in the hypothesis of V+ A structure of the t W b vertex.

Four volunteers (27%) demonstrated sterile immunity to controlled human malaria infection and. overall. protection was statistically significantly associated with ELISpot and CD8+ T cell IFN-γ activities to AMA1 but not CSP. DNA priming was required for protection. as 18 additional subjects immunized with Ad alone (AdCA) did not develop sterile protection.  Methodology/Principal Findings We sought to identify correlates of protection. recognizing that DNA-priming may induce different responses than AdCA alone. Among protected volunteers. two and three had higher ELISpot and CD8+ T cell IFN-γ responses to CSP and AMA1. respectively. than non-protected volunteers. Unexpectedly. non-protected volunteers in the AdCA trial showed ELISpot and CD8+ T cell IFN-γ responses to AMA1 equal to or higher than the protected volunteers. T cell functionality assessed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ. TNF-α and IL-2 likewise did not distinguish protected from non-protected volunteers across both trials. However. three of the four protected volunteers showed higher effector to central memory CD8+ T cell ratios to AMA1. and one of these to CSP. than non-protected volunteers for both antigens.

Excited leptons (lstar) are assumed to be produced via contact interactions in conjunction with a standard model lepton and to decay via lstar to l gamma. yielding a final state with two energetic leptons and a photon. The number of events observed in data is consistent with that expected from the standard model. The 95% confidence upper limits for the cross section for the production and decay of excited electrons (muons). with masses ranging from 0.6 to 2 TeV. are 1.48 to 1.24 fb (1.31 to 1.11 fb).

A-enriched sample of events with a single lepton (electron or muon). missing transverse momentum and at least four high transverse momentum jets. of which at least one is tagged as coming from a b-quark. is selected. A likelihood fit is used to reconstruct the event kinematics. A Bayesian unfolding procedure is employed to estimate A C at the parton-level.

This measurement covers a wide transverse momentum range. from 52 to 300 GeV/c. Samples of heavy-flavor enhanced jets together with inclusive jets are used to extract the average shapes of b-jets. The b-jets are expected to be broader than inclusive jets. Moreover. b-jets containing a single b-quark are expected to be narrower than those containing a b b pair from gluon splitting. The measured b-jet shapes are found to be significantly broader than expected from the pythia and herwig Monte Carlo simulations. This effect may arise from an underestimation of the fraction of b-jets originating from gluon splitting in these simulations.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Phylogenetic profiles encode patterns of presence or absence of genes across genomes. and these profiles can be used to assign functional relationships to nonhomologous pairs of proteins (Pellegrini et al.. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1999; 96: 4284–4288). Although it is well known that many proteins were created from combinations of domains. most of the existing implementations of phylogenetic profiles do not consider this fact. Here. we introduce an extension that considers the multidomain nature of proteins and test the method against the known interaction data sets. Whereas earlier implementations associated one entire sequence with one protein phylogenetic profile (Single-Profile). our method instead breaks the sequence into a set of segments of predetermined size and constructs a separate profile for each segment (Multiple-Profile).

Catholyte aeration to a unit MFC against passive air diffusion to the cathode in the other unit MFC shifted voltage reversal between the two units. due to improved mass transport and O2 concentration effects in the aerated MFC. The shifted voltage reversal returned to an original status when catholyte aeration was stopped. A Pt-coated cathode increased the rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by a factor of ∼20. as compared to the non-Pt cathode. As a result. the anodic reaction rate that became slower than the rate on the Pt-cathode limited current density to overpotential in the stacked MFC equipped with the Pt-cathode.

Specifically. the function of HLA class II is to ensure that a sufficient sample of peptides derived from foreign molecules is presented to T cells. This leads to an important concern in human drug development as the possible immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals. especially those intended for chronic administration. can lead to reduced efficacy and an undesired safety profile for biological therapeutics. As part of this review. we will highlight the molecular basis of antigen presentation as a key step in the induction of T cell responses. emphasizing the events associated with peptide binding to polymorphic and polygenic HLA class II molecules. We will further review methodologies that predict HLA class II binding peptides and candidate epitopes. We will focus on tools provided by the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. discussing the basic features of different prediction methods. the objective evaluation of prediction quality. and general guidelines for practical use of these tools. Finally the use. advantages. and limitations of the methodology will be demonstrated in a review of two previous studies investigating the immunogenicity of erythropoietin and timothy grass pollen.,True,QzfSIEUAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,45,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2013/467852/abs/,14679427932777418867,/scholar?cites=14679427932777418867,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2013/467852/abs/,0,0,0

It is therefore of interest to study the effect of the shape of metal nanoparticles on their catalytic activity in various organic and inorganic reactions. Truncated triangular silver nanoplates with well‐defined planes were synthesized by a simple solvothermal approach. The activity of these truncated triangular silver nanoparticles was compared with that of cubic and near‐spherical silver nanoparticles in the oxidation of styrene in colloidal solution. It was found that the crystal faces of silver nanoparticles play an essential role in determining the catalytic oxidation properties. The silver nanocubes had the {100} crystal faces as the basal plane. whereas truncated triangular nanoplates and near‐spherical nanoparticles predominantly exposed the most‐stable {111} crystal faces.

Significantly. this new material possesses the advantages of both hemin and graphene and exhibits three interesting properties. First. H-GNs have intrinsic peroxidase-like activity. which can catalyze the reaction of peroxidase substrate. due to the existence of hemin on the graphene surface. Second. their dispersion follow the 2D Schulze−Hardy rule. that is to say. the coagulation of H-GNs in electrolyte solution results from the interplay between van der Waals attraction and electric double-layer repulsion. Third. H-GNs exhibit the ability to differentiate ss- and ds-DNA in optimum electrolyte concentration. owing to the different affinities of ss- and ds-DNA to the H-GNs.

The short length of the miRNA sequences and relatively low conservation of pre-miRNA sequences restrict the conventional sequence-alignment-based methods to finding only relatively close homologs. On the other hand. it has been reported that miRNA genes are more conserved in the secondary structure rather than in primary sequences. Therefore. secondary structural features should be more fully exploited in the homologue search for new miRNA genes.

The power of this DNA device originates from the excellent efficiency of Pb2+ for stabilizing G-quadruplexes. which makes the DNA duplex unwind thereby driving the device. This device can be reset to the original state by addition of a strong Pb2+ chelator DOTA. endowing the device with good reusability. In the whole process. the signal readout is modulated via a fluorescent probe binding to and being released from the G-quadruplex. Such a DNA device can serve as a novel turn-on fluorescent sensor for Pb2+ detection with high selectivity and sensitivity.,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,319,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja105849m,14117427290467066541,/scholar?cites=14117427290467066541,,,0,0,0

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types.

We applied the idea to a biochemical oscillation network and found that the underlying potential landscape for the oscillation limit cycle has a distinct closed ring valley (Mexican hat-like) shape when the fluctuations are small. This global landscape structure leads to attractions of the system to the ring valley. On the ring. we found that the nonequilibrium flux is the driving force for oscillations. Therefore. both structured landscape and flux are needed to guarantee a robust oscillating network. The barrier height separating the oscillation ring and other areas derived from the landscape topography is shown to be correlated with the escaping time from the limit cycle attractor and provides a …,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,303,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/34/12271.short,3537866354148105400,/scholar?cites=3537866354148105400,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/34/12271.full.pdf,0,0,0

Fluorescence of QDs could be quenched greatly by Hg(II). In the presence of biothiols. such as glutathione (GSH). homocysteine (Hcy). and cysteine (Cys). however.

We show here that cortactin can promote sedimentation of F-actin at centrifugation forces under which F-actin is otherwise not able to be precipitated. Electron microscopic analysis after negative staining further revealed that actin filaments in the presence of cortactin are cross-linked into bundles of various degrees of thickness. Hence. cortactin is also an F-actin cross-linking protein. We also demonstrate that the optimal F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin requires a physiological pH in a range of 7.3–7.5. Furthermore. pp60c-src phosphorylates cortactin in vitro. resulting in a dramatic reduction of its F-actin cross-linking activity in a manner depending on levels of tyrosine phosphorylation.

In the last seven years. Ru(bpy)32+ ECL has attracted much interest from analysts and been successfully exploited as a detector of flow injection analysis (FIA). high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). capillary electrophoresis (CE). and micro total analysis systems (μTAS). Immobilization of Ru(bpy)32+ on a solid surface provides several advantages over the solution-phase ECL procedure. such as the simplicity of experimental design and cost-effectiveness. After a brief discussion of the mechanism of Ru(bpy)32+ ECL. we discuss its applications in FIA. HPLC. CE and μTAS and give special attention to the design of Ru(bpy)32+ ECL cells and some immobilization techniques of Ru(bpy)32+; we focus on papers published after 1997.,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,256,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016599360400603X,6859874951613626812,/scholar?cites=6859874951613626812,,,0,0,0

Using glutathione as a model ligand. the smallest cluster. Cu2. is selectively synthesized to form a nearly monodisperse product. eliminating the need for tedious size fractionation. Evolution of photoluminescence and absorption spectra reveal that the formation of stable cluster species occurs through surface etching. Intriguingly. the as‐prepared CuNCs exhibit an aggregation‐induced emission enhancement effect. The CuNCs emit a faint light when dispersed in aqueous solution. but generate a striking fluorescence intensity enhancement upon aggregation.

Particularly. newly emerging Cu nanoclusters offer excellent potential as functional biological probes. In this work. we for the first time report that the fluorescence of DNA-hosted Cu nanoclusters is very sensitive to base type located in the major groove. This intriguing finding provides a sensitive fluorimetric diagnostic of the mismatch type in a specific DNA sequence. which is difficult to achieve by traditional methods. Furthermore. the research results have shed some light on the luminescent mechanism of Cu nanoclusters. Owing to its high specificity and easy operation without rigorously controlled temperature and arduous probe DNA design. it is expected that the proposed procedure can provide a tool for early diagnosis and risk assessment of malignancy.,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC,218,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn3002455,3751186369147176449,/scholar?cites=3751186369147176449,,,0,0,0

Taking advantage of the high specificity of 17E DNAzyme for Pb 2+. highly sensitive and selective fluorescent. electrochemical and colorimetric sensors have been developed for Pb 2+. In this work. we report a simple. sensitive and label-free 17E DNAzyme-based sensor for Pb 2+ detection using unmodified gold nanoparticles (GNPs) based on the fact that unfolded single-stranded DNA could be adsorbed on the citrate protected GNPs while double-stranded DNA could not. By our method the substrate cleavage by the 17E DNAzyme in the presence of Pb 2+ could be monitored by color change of GNPs. thereby Pb 2+ detection was realized. The detection of Pb 2+ could be realized within 20 min. with a detection limit of 500 nM.

By optimizing the experimental conditions. we obtained the detection limit of our sensing platform based on bare graphene oxide to be 1.9 μM with a linear detection range from 2 μM to 35 μM. Selectivity of this sensing platform has been carefully investigated; the results showed that this sensor specifically responded to ochratoxin A without interference from other structure analogues (N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine and warfarin) and with only limited interference from ochratoxin B.

In this PET process. a parallel G-quadruplex and the sensing sequences are blocked by a duplex. The specific combination of targets with the sensing sequence triggers the release of the G-quadruplex and allows it to fold properly and bind hemin to form a stable G-quadruplex/hemin complex. The complex proves favorable for PET because it makes the G-quadruplex bind hemin tightly. which promotes the electron transfer from the DNA/Ag NCs to the hemin FeIII center. thus resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the DNA/Ag NCs.

The associated changes in gene expression patterns exhibit time-directionality. This “arrow of time” in the collective change of gene expression across multiple stable gene expression patterns (attractors) is not explained by the regulated activation. the suppression of individual genes which are bidirectional molecular processes. or by the standard dynamical models of the underlying gene circuit which only account for local stability of attractors. To capture the global dynamics of this nonequilibrium system and gain insight in the time-asymmetry of state transitions. we computed the quasipotential landscape of the stochastic dynamics of a canonical gene circuit that governs branching cell fate commitment.

The effect of the charge of the end group on the electrochemical response of Fe(CN)63– at the SAM modified electrode was studied by using cyclic voltammetry. At high pH. when the –COOH groups are dissociated. Fe(CN)63– current is suppressed; as the solution pH is lowered. Fe(CN)63– current increases. The electrochemical titration curve was obtained by correlating the currents to the different electrolyte pH values. from which the surface pKa was obtained to be 5.2±0.1. Furthermore. a calculation equation was presented to simulate the electrochemical titration. As comparison. the surface pKa was also measured by contact angle titration as 5.6±0.1.

Assuming a standard axial-vector spin-dependent WIMP interaction with Xe 129 and Xe 131 nuclei. the most stringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron cross sections for WIMPs with masses above 10 GeV/c 2 are set in all dark matter direct detection experiments. The minimum upper limit of 4.1× 10− 41 cm 2 at 90% confidence level is obtained for a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c 2.

The microchip CE-ECL system described in this article consists of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer containing separation and injection channels and an electrode plate with an ITO electrode fabricated by a photolithographic method. The PDMS layer was reversibly bound to the ITO electrode plate. which greatly simplified the alignment of the separation channel with the working electrode and enhanced the photon-capturing efficiency. In our study. the high separation electric field had no significant influence on the ECL detector. and decouplers for isolating the separation electric field were not needed in the microchip CE-ECL system.

In this work. we first constructed a label-free electrochemical aptasensor introducing a probe immobilization technique by the use of a layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembled multilayer with ferrocene−appended poly(ethyleneimine) (Fc−PEI) on an indium tin oxide (ITO) array electrode for detection of cocaine. The Fc−PEI and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were LBL assembled on the electrode surface via electrostatic interaction. Then. cocaine aptamer fragments. SH-C2. were covalently labeled onto the outermost AuNP layer. When the target cocaine and cocaine aptamer C1 were present simultaneously. the SH-C2 layer hybridized partly with C1 to bind the cocaine. which led to a decreased differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal of Fc−PEI.

Unsafe lane change maneuvers are key factor for traffic accidents and traffic congestion. For drivers’ safety. comfort and convenience. advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are presented. The main problem discussed in this paper is the development of an autonomous lane change system. The system can be extended applied in intelligent vehicles in future. It solves two crucial issues – trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Polynomial method was adopted for describing the trajectory planning issue. Movement of a host vehicle was abstracted into time functions. Moreover. collision detection was mapped into a parameter space by adopting infinite dynamic circles. The second issue was described by backstepping principle.

Toward unlocking the energy capabilities of Li‐O2 batteries. it is crucial to have a fundamental understanding of the origin of sudden death in terms of reactive sites and transport limitations. Herein. a mechanistic study is presented on a model system of Au|Li2O2|Li+ electrolyte. in which the Au electrode was passivated with a thin Li2O2 film by discharging to the state of sudden death. Direct conductivity measurement of the Li2O2 film and in situ spectroscopic study of ORR using 18O2 for passivation and 16O2 for further discharging provide compelling evidence that ORR (and O2 evolution reaction as well) occurs at the buried interface …,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:RJujIP1NYNUC,105,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201600793,11825962826827097498,/scholar?cites=11825962826827097498,,,0,0,0

So far. among the various detection methods. the strategies based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are quite attractive because of the high sensitivity. and especially as it is reported that Hg2+ can be directly detected by SERS without tagging. However. the procedure for the direct SERS detection of mercury is still unclear with little experimental evidence. limiting further development of Hg2+ detection by SERS. Herein. we performed a simple method based on SERS for the detection of mercury ions in water without tagging. It is established that in only 2 min. low concentration of Hg2+ can be recognized based on the decrease of SERS intensity.

The pattern of the microelectrode was directly made on the surface of a microscope slide through an electroless deposition procedure. The surface of the slide was first selectively coated with a thin layer of sodium silicate through a micromolding in capillary technique provided by a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannel; this left a rough patterned area for the anchoring of catalytic particles. A metal layer was deposited on the pattern guided by these catalytic particles and was used as the working electrode. Factors influencing the fabrication procedure were discussed. The whole chip was built by reversibly sealing the slide to another PDMS layer with electrophoresis microchannels at room temperature.

The surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) measurements indicate that the density of surface states on TiO2 is likely dependent upon the details of prepared methods. TiO2 particles prepared from basic sol have more surface states than that prepared from acidic sol. When the TiO2 thin films prepared using the TiO2 sols were sensitized by CdS particles. the SPS responses relative to the surface states on TiO2 from 350 to 800 nm were decreased. The photoelectrochemical properties of nanostructured TiO2 electrodes suggest that the fewer the surface states and the smaller the particle sizes of TiO2. the larger the photocurrent response.

The two loops of this molecular beacon consist of thrombin aptamer sequence and the complementary sequence of target DNA. which are utilized to sense single-stranded DNA and thrombin. The G-quadruplex DNAzyme can effectively catalyze the H2O2-mediated oxidation of 3.3′.5.5′-tetramethylbenzidine sulfate to generate colorimetric signal. Upon addition of the target. the DNA or protein combines with one loop of the hairpin structures. and meanwhile drives the middle G-quadruplex DNAzyme to dissociate.

We uncovered some key factors in determining the global robustness and function of the budding yeast cell cycle by exploring the underlying landscape and flux of this nonequilibrium network. The dynamics of the system is determined by both the landscape which attracts the system down to the oscillation orbit and the curl flux which drives the periodic motion on the ring. This global structure of landscape is crucial for the coherent cell cycle dynamics and function. The topography of the underlying landscape. specifically the barrier height separating basins of attractions. characterizes the capability of changing from one part of the system to another. This quantifies the stability and robustness of the system.

This method has some clear advantages including simplicity. quickness. high quality. good reproducibility. and no need of a complex post-treatment process (removing templating). Furthermore. the present method could be extended to other metal-based NP assembling hollow spheres.

An effective electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor based on PSP with carbon nanotube (CNTs) composite film was developed. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy were applied to characterize this composite film. The PSP was used as an immobilization matrix to entrap the ECL reagent Ru(bpy)32+ due to the electrostatic interactions between sulfonic acid groups and Ru(bpy)32+ cations. The introduction of CNTs into PSP acted not only as a conducting pathway to accelerate the electron transfer but also as a proper matrix to immobilize Ru(bpy)32+ on the electrode by hydrophobic interaction. Furthermore. the results indicated the ECL intensity produced at this composite film was over 3-fold compared with that of the pure PSP film due to the electrocatalytic activity of the CNTs.

The smallness of neutrino masses and the large lepton flavor violation associated with neutrino mixing are both fundamental properties that give insights into modifications of current theories. Other possibilities that may reveal themselves in the neutrino sector include extra"" sterile"" neutrinos. CP violation in the neutrino mixing matrix. and CPT violation associated with the neutrino mass hierarchy. Since neutrino oscillations have now been established. the next step is to map out the parameters associated with neutrino masses and mixings. The experimental program to accomplish this goal will require a wide range of experiments using neutrinos from solar. atmospheric. reactor. and accelerator sources. Due to the relations between these various measurements. it will be important for the world-wide community to set up a structured program to work through the experimental measurements in a coherent and logical manner. The existing experimental results fit rather nicely into a picture with three massive neutrinos. which corresponds to the simplest scenario for three generations (for recent global analyses see. eg.

The electrocatalytic and plasmonic properties of the Au nanoparticle/CoTMPyP self-assembled nanostructured materials (abbreviated as Au/CoTMPyP SANMs) are tunable by controlled self-assembly of the Au nanoparticles and CoTMPyP on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The electrocatalytic activity of the Au/CoTMPyP SANMs can be tuned in two ways. One way is that citrate-stabilized Au nanoparticles are positioned first on ITO surface with tunable number density. and then positively charged CoTMPyP ions are planted selectively on these gold sites. The other way is that Au nanoparticles and CoTMPyP are deposited by virtue of layer-by-layer assembly. which can also tune the amount of the as-deposited electrocatalysts.

The NAANPs are obtained by functionalizing the gold nanoparticles with AS1411 aptamer and then bound with one porphyrin derivative N-methylmesoporphyrin IX (NMM). Using HeLa cells over expressing nucleolin as representative cancer cells. the formed NAANPs can target to the cell surface via the specific AS1411-nucleolin interaction. which can discriminate the cancer cells from normal ones (e.g. HEK293) unambiguously.

10100559,Multi-scaled explorations of binding-induced folding of intrinsically disordered protein inhibitor IA3 to its target enzyme,2011,Jin Wang and Yong Wang and Xiakun Chu and Stephen J Hagen and Wei Han and Erkang Wang,7,PLoS Comput Biol,4,e1001118,Public Library of Science,Biomolecular function is realized by recognition. and increasing evidence shows that recognition is determined not only by structure but also by flexibility and dynamics. We explored a biomolecular recognition process that involves a major conformational change – protein folding. In particular. we explore the binding-induced folding of IA3. an intrinsically disordered protein that blocks the active site cleft of the yeast aspartic proteinase saccharopepsin (YPrA) by folding its own N-terminal residues into an amphipathic alpha helix. We developed a multi-scaled approach that explores the underlying mechanism by combining structure-based molecular dynamics simulations at the residue level with a stochastic path method at the atomic level. Both the free energy profile and the associated kinetic paths reveal a common scheme whereby IA3 binds to its target enzyme prior to folding itself into a helix. This theoretical result is consistent with recent time-resolved experiments. Furthermore. exploration of the detailed trajectories reveals the important roles of non-native interactions in the initial binding that occurs prior to IA3 folding. In contrast to the common view that non-native interactions contribute only to the roughness of landscapes and impede binding. the non-native interactions here facilitate binding by reducing significantly the entropic search space in the landscape. The information gained from multi-scaled simulations of the folding of this intrinsically disordered protein in the presence of its binding target may prove useful in the design of novel inhibitors of aspartic proteinases.,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC,74,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001118,18048944746296761580,/scholar?cites=18048944746296761580,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001118,0,0,0

Because of the adding of histidine or cysteine. the formation of G-quadruplex-Cu(II) metalloenzyme will be disturbed. thus the catalytic activity to TMB-H2O2 reaction is inversely proportional to the concentration of histidine or cysteine. With this strategy. the limit of detection in experimental measurement for histidine and cysteine is 10 nM and 5 nM. respectively. which are both lower than previous colorimetric arrays.

Inspired from the silver effect on the enhanced fluorescence intensity of Au NCs. a series of bovine serum albumin-protected Au–Ag bimetallic NCs were prepared by regulating the molar ratios of HAuCl4/AgNO3 and their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) property was investigated using triethylamine as co-reactant. Notably. multifold higher efficiency was achieved with Au–Ag bimetallic NCs in reference to the monometallic nanoclusters. Moreover. the doping of Ag atoms not only made the ECL emission of the Au NCs blue shift but also decreased the peak potential and onset potential. which provided an efficient and facile way to improve the ECL behavior.

We show the intrinsic potential as being Lyapunov function(monotonically decreasing in time) does exist and can define the adaptive landscape for general evolution dynamics for studying global stability. The driving force determining the dynamics can be decomposed into gradient of potential landscape and curl probability flux. Non-zero flux causes detailed balance breaking and measures how far the evolution from equilibrium state. The gradient of intrinsic potential and curl flux are perpendicular to each other in zero fluctuation limit resembling electric and magnetic forces on electrons.

Understanding the process of how histone chaperones associate and dissociate from the histones can help clarify their roles in chromosome metabolism. Some histone chaperones are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Recent studies of IDPs revealed that the recognition of the biomolecules is realized by the flexibility and dynamics. challenging the century-old structure-function paradigm. Here we investigate the binding between intrinsically disordered chaperone Chz1 and histone variant H2A.Z-H2B by developing a structure-based coarse-grained model. in which Debye-Hückel model is implemented for describing electrostatic interactions due to highly charged characteristic of Chz1 and H2A.Z-H2B. We find that major structural changes of Chz1 only occur after the rate-limiting electrostatic dominant transition state and Chz1 undergoes folding coupled binding through two parallel pathways. Interestingly. although the electrostatic interactions stabilize bound complex and facilitate the recognition at first stage. the rate for formation of the complex is not always accelerated due to slow escape of conformations with non-native electrostatic interactions at low salt concentrations. Our studies provide an ionic-strength-controlled binding/folding mechanism. leading to a cooperative mechanism of “local collapse or trapping” and “fly-casting” together and a new understanding of the roles of electrostatic interactions in IDPs' binding.,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC,64,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002608,523544640023058955,/scholar?cites=523544640023058955,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002608,0,0,0

Cyclic potential scanning in acetone solution led to a stable CPMVA film formed on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. scanning tunneling microscopy. and cyclic voltammetry were used for characterizing the structure and properties of the CPMVA film. These studies indicated that self-aggregated clusters were formed on a freshly cleaved HOPG surface. while a self-organized monolayer was formed on the precathodized HOPG electrode. The CPMVA film exhibited reversible redox kinetics both in acidic aqueous and in acetone solution. which showed that it could be used as a catalyst even in organic phase.

It was found that large area of aggregated AuNRs film could be formed at the interface of toluene and water due to the interfacial tension between the two phases. The obtained large area of aggregated AuNRs film exhibits strong surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity with 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) and 2-aminothiophenol (2-ATP) as the probe molecules based on the strong electromagnetic coupling effect between the very adjacent AuNRs. Enhancement factors (EF) were used to estimate the SERS activity of the aggregated AuNRs film. which is obtained to be 1.7× 10 5 for 7a vibration of 4-ATP.

Because the porous capillary wall allowed the CE current to pass through and there was no electric field gradient beyond that section. the influence of CE high-voltage field on the ECL procedure was eliminated. The porous section formed by etching the capillary with hydrofluoric acid after only one side of the circumference of 2−3 mm of polyimide coating of the capillary was removed. while keeping the polyimide coating on the other part to protect the capillary from HF etching makes the capillary joint much more robust since only a part of the circumference of it is etched.

10100639,Influence of surface energy on the non-linear pull-in instability of nano-switches,2014,KF Wang and Baolin L Wang,59,International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics,,69-75,Pergamon,This paper investigates the pull-in instability of a nano-switch under electrostatic and intermolecular Casimir forces. The analysis is based on the geometrically non-linear Euler–Bernoulli beam theory with consideration of the surface energy. Through differential quadrature method (DQM). the pull-in voltages of the nano-switch are obtained. Results show that the effect of surface energy and geometrically non-linear deformation on the pull-in voltage depends on the length. height and initial gap of the nano-switch. In addition. the effect of intermolecular Casimir force on the pull-in voltage weakens as the initial gap increases.,True,Q5bM7ScAAAAJ:k0eMxzHTHKYC,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020746213002096,10141239642892291375,/scholar?cites=10141239642892291375,,,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,The process of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (rhBMP‐2)‐induced endochondral ossification involves (1) the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondroblasts and osteoblasts; (2) the production and maturation of cartilage and bone matrix; and (3) the differentiation of circulating osteoclast precursor cells into osteoclasts. Currently the molecular mechanisms of these complex sequential events are unknown. It seemed reasonable to us to assume that communication between cells through soluble mediators during bone induction by rhBMP‐2 may play an important role in the sequential differentiation of chondroblasts. osteoblasts. and osteoclasts.

Typical oxidative wear was identified by X-ray diffraction patterns with predominant tribo-oxides of Fe3O4 and Fe2O3.

We studied the wear characteristics of AZ91D alloy as a function of the normal load and the ambient temperature. The mild-to-severe wear transition occurred with increasing the load and the critical load reduced with the ambient temperature rising. However. no matter how high the ambient temperature was in the range of 25–200 °C. the mild wear prevailed under the lower loads. Especially. the AZ91D alloy presented a lower wear rate at 200 °C than at 25 and 100 °C under the low loads of 12.5–25 N. but vice versa under the loads of more than 25 N. These phenomena seem to be contradictory to the popular view that the mild-to-severe wear transition is controlled by the critical surface temperature.

DNA presents great advantages in the fabrication of molecular devices and higher-order logic circuits. Herein. by making use of the hybridization and displacement of DNA strands. as well as the formation and dissociation of a G-quadruplex. a simple and universal DNA-based platform is developed to implement half-adder and half-subtractor arithmetic processes. The novel feature of the designed system is that the two required logic gates for the half adder (an AND and an XOR logic gate integrated in parallel) or the half subtractor (an XOR and an INHIBIT logic gate integrated in parallel) are achieved simultaneously with the same platform and are triggered by the same set of inputs. Another novel feature is that the developed half adder and half subtractor are operated by the same DNA platform in an enzyme-free system and share a constant threshold setpoint.

Biomolecular recognition is often flexible and associated with large conformational changes involving both binding and folding. However. the global and physical understanding for the process is still challenging. Here. we quantified the intrinsic energy landscapes of flexible biomolecular recognition in terms of binding–folding dynamics for 15 homodimers by exploring the underlying density of states. using a structure-based model both with and without considering energetic roughness. By quantifying three individual effective intrinsic energy landscapes (one for interfacial binding. two for monomeric folding). the association mechanisms for flexible recognition of 15 homodimers can be classified into two-state cooperative “coupled binding–folding” and three-state noncooperative “folding prior to binding” scenarios.

The morphology of Ag dendrites was tunable by changing the concentration of capping reagent PVP. It was demonstrated that for higher concentrations of PVP. smaller Ag dendrites with shorter and smoother branches were obtained. while the ratio of the length of the branches to the body diameter of the Ag dendrites (L/D) became lower. It was also shown that the concentration of added AgNO3 was very important for the formation of Ag dendrites. The presented method is amenable for extension to large-scale synthesis of Ag dendrites.

10100734,The extended phenotype,1982,Richard Dawkins,8,,,,Oxford University Press,The first chapter does some of the work of a Preface. in explaining what the book does and does not set out to accomplish. so I can be brief here. It is not a textbook. nor an introduction to an established field. It is a personal look at the evolution of life. and in particular at the logic of natural selection and the level in the hierarchy of life at which natural selection can be said to act. I happen to be an ethologist. but I hope preoccupations with animal behaviour will not be too noticeable. The intended scope of the book is wider.The readers for whom I am mainly writing are my professional colleagues. evolutionary biologists. ethologists and sociobiologists. ecologists. and philosophers and humanists interested in evolutionary science. including. of course. graduate and undergraduate students in all these disciplines. Therefore. although this book is in some ways the sequel to my previous book. The Selfish Gene. it assumes that the reader has professional knowledge of evolutionary biology and its technical terms. On the other hand it is possible to enjoy a professional book as a spectator. even if not a participant in the profession. Some laypeople who read this book in draft have been kind enough. or polite enough. to claim to have liked it. It would give me great satisfaction to believe them. and I have added a glossary of technical terms which I hope may help. I have also tried to make the book as near as possible to being enjoyable to read. The resulting tone may possibly irritate some serious professionals.

10100737,The meme machine,2000,Susan Blackmore and Susan J Blackmore,25,,,,Oxford Paperbacks,"What is a meme? First coined by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene. a meme is any idea. behavior. or skill that can be transferred from one person to another by imitation: stories. fashions. inventions. recipes. songs. ways of plowing a field or throwing a baseball or making a sculpture. The meme is also one of the most important--and controversial--concepts to emerge since The Origin of the Species appeared nearly 150 years ago. In The Meme Machine Susan Blackmore boldly asserts:"" Just as the design of our bodies can be understood only in terms of natural selection. so the design of our minds can be understood only in terms of memetic selection."" Indeed. Blackmore shows that once our distant ancestors acquired the crucial ability to imitate. a second kind of natural selection began. a survival of the fittest amongst competing ideas and behaviors. Ideas and behaviors that proved most adaptive--making tools. for example. or using language--survived and flourished. replicating themselves in as many minds as possible. These memes then passed themselves on from generation to generation by helping to ensure that the genes of those who acquired them also survived and reproduced. Applying this theory to many aspects of human life. Blackmore offers brilliant explanations for why we live in cities. why we talk so much. why we can't stop thinking. why we behave altruistically. how we choose our mates. and much more. With controversial implications for our religious beliefs. our free will. our very sense of"" self.""

Biological Sciences,1161,489-511,The Royal Society,An adaptation in one lineage (e. g. predators) may change the selection pressure on another lineage (e. g. prey). giving rise to a counter-adaptation. If this occurs reciprocally. an unstable runaway escalation or ‘arms race’ may result. We discuss various factors which might give one side an advantage in an arms race. For example. a lineage under strong selection may out-evolve a weakly selected one (‘the life-dinner principle’). We then classify arms races in two independent ways. They may be symmetric or asymmetric. and they may be interspecific or intraspecific. Our example of an asymmetric interspecific arms race is that between brood parasites and their hosts. The arms race concept may help to reduce the mystery of why cuckoo hosts are so good at detecting cuckoo eggs. but so bad at detecting cuckoo nestlings.

10100742,Animal signals: information or manipulation,1978,Richard Dawkins and John R Krebs,2,Behavioural ecology: An evolutionary approach,,282-309,,"Because of the way natural selection works. it is reasonable for us to picture an animal as a machine designed to preserve and propagate the genes that ride inside it (Dawkins 1976). As a means to this end it will often manipulate objects in its world. pushing them around to its own advantage. Some of these objects will themselves be living creatures-mates. parents. prey. rivals-each one a machine designed to propagate its own genes in similar ways. When an animal seeks to manipulate an inanimate object. it has only one recourse-physical power. A dung beetle can move a ball of dung only by forcibly pushing it. But when the object it seeks to manipulate is itself another live animal there is an alternative way. It can exploit the senses and muscles of the animal it is trying to control. sense organs and behaviour machinery which are themselves designed to preserve the genes of that other animal. A male-t cricket does not physically roll a female along the ground and into his burrow. He sits and sings. and the female comes to him under her own power. From his point of view this communication is energetically more efficient than trying to take her by force. Cullen (1972) uses a human analogy to illustrate the distinction between force and communication.'... to a man the command"" Go jump in the lake"" is a signal. the push which precipitates him is not'. Making a similar point Wilson (1975) cites JBS Haldane's remark that'a general property of communication is the pronounced energetic efficiency of signalling: a small effort put into the signal typically elicits an energetically greater response'.

10100749,The extended phenotype: The long reach of the gene,2016,Richard Dawkins,,,,,Oxford University Press,In The Selfish Gene. Richard Dawkins crystallized the gene's eye view of evolution developed by WD Hamilton and others. The book provoked widespread and heated debate. Written in part as a response. The Extended Phenotype gave a deeper clarification of the central concept of the gene as the unit of selection; but it did much more besides. In it. Dawkins extended the gene's eye view to argue that the genes that sit within an organism have an influence that reaches out beyond the visible traits in that body-the phenotype-to the wider environment. which can include other individuals. So. for instance. the genes of the beaver drive it to gather twigs to produce the substantial physical structure of a dam; and the genes of the cuckoo chick produce effects that manipulate the behaviour of the host bird. making it nurture the intruder as one of its own. This notion of the extended phenotype has proved to be highly influential in the way we understand evolution and the natural world.

10100758,Hierarchical organisation: a candidate principle for ethology.,1976,Richard Dawkins,,,,,Cambridge U Press,If we look far into the future of our science. what will it mean to say we ‘understand the mechanism of behaviour? The obvious answer is what may be called the neurophysiologist's nirvana: the complete wiring diagram of the nervous system of a species. every synapse labelled as excitatory or inhibitory; presumably also a graph. for each axon. of nerve impulses as a function of time during the course of each behaviour pattern. This ideal is the logical end point of much contemporary neuroanatomical and neurophysiological endeavour. and because we are still in the early stages. the ultimate conclusion does not worry us. But it would not constitute understanding of how behaviour works in any real sense at all. No man could hold such a mass of detail in his head. Real understanding will only come from distillation of general principles at a higher level. to parallel for example the great principles of genetics-particulate inheritance. continuity of germ-line and non-inheritance of acquired characteristics. dominance. linkage. mutation. and so on. Of course neurophysiology has been discovering principles for a long time. the all-or-none nerve impulse. temporal and spatial summation and other synaptic properties. y-efferent servo-control and so on. But it seems possible that at higher levels some important principles may be anticipated from behavioural evidence alone.

10100760,The evolution of evolvability,2003,Richard Dawkins,,"On growth, form and computers",,239-255,Elsevier Academic Press,A title like The Evolution of Evolvability ought to be anathema to a dyed-in-the-wool. radical neo-Darwinian like me. Part of the reason it is not is that I really have been led to think differently as a result of creating. and using. computer models of artificial life which. on the face of it. owe more to the imagination than to real biology. The use of artificial life. not as a formal model of real life but as a generator of insight in our understanding of real life. is one that I want to illustrate in this chapter. With a program called Blind Watchmaker. I created a world of two-dimensional artificial organisms on the computer screen (Dawkins. 1986). Borrowing the word used by Desmond Morris for the animal-like shapes in his surrealistic paintings (Morris. 1987). I called them biomorphs. My main objective in designing Blind Watchmaker was to reduce to the barest minimum the extent to which I designed biomorphs. I wanted as much as possible of the biology of biomorphs to emerge. All that I would design was the conditions–ideally very simple conditions–under which they might emerge. The process of emergence was to be evolution by the Darwinian process of random mutation followed by nonrandom survival. Once a Darwinian process gets going in a world. it has an open-ended power to generate surprising consequences: us. for example. But. before any Darwinian process can get going. there has to be a bare minimum of conditions set up. These were the conditions that I had to engineer in my computer world.The first condition. one that I have emphasized sufficiently before (Dawkins. 1976. 1982). is that there must be replicators–entities capable. like DNA …,True,0smOZFIAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC,458,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lgMZgLiDIN4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA239&dq=info:6JMe0qlJ7qgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=NxejJLSb78&sig=CI_dtKV8lllupi9Aq5955uUkVFg,12172747836552549352,/scholar?cites=12172747836552549352,,,0,0,0

Groups and species are now rightly unfashionable. so what are we left with? The prevailing answer is Darwin's: ‘the individual’. Individuals clearly do not maximise their own survival so the concept of fitness had to be invented. If fitness is correctly defined in Hamilton's way as ‘inclusive fitness’ it ceases to matter whether we speak of individuals maximising their inclusive fitness or of genes maximising their survival. The two formulations are mutually inter‐translatable. Yet some serious mistranslations are quoted from the literature. which have led their authors into actual biological error.

With the exception of Pontic the dialects of Asia Minor have been almost entirely passed over: in spite of the pleas of Hatzidákis and Thumb1 that this investigation is one of the most pressing needs of modern Greek studies. hardly anything is yet available but the tantalising scraps con-tained in the few books written by native scholars. No one who has benefited by the mass of material furnished by their collections. and at the same time knows the difficulties under which these books are produced—the lack of libraries. the depressing effects of poverty and isolation. the vexations of theTurkish censorship. which has sometimes to be evaded by the use of false imprints and pseudonyms—will be grudging in his expressions of obligation to their labours. But it must nevertheless be recognised that no zeal or enthusiasm on their part can make up for the inevitable absence of philological training. It is in these circumstances that my interest in modern Greek gradually became centred on the dialects of Asia Minor. whose precarious condition. threatened as they are not only by the advance of Turkish and by the danger of absorption into the common Greek. but also by the great increase of emigration which has been one of the most striking results of the constitutional régime of New Turkey. was a reminder that no time was to be lost.

Their essays raise so many interesting points. it would take another book to reply to them properly. Instead. on the basis that it is better to say a few things thoroughly than lots sketchily. I shall concentrate on what I take to be each author’s central argument.J. Scott Turner and Kevin Laland both. in their different ways. want to go further than me in extending the phenotype. Or so they see it. I am not so sure that further is the right word. Progress implies movement in a useful direction. whereas their extensions–of the organism. and into niche creation–occasionally reminded me of Stephen Leacock’s knight who jumped on his horse and galloped off in all directions.

Along the way Ruse considers two great popularizers of evolution. Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. as well as two leaders in the field of evolutionary studies. Richard Lewontin and Edward O.

The most likely way for such an equilibrium to be maintained is through something equivalent to frequency-dependent selection. Females of the digger wasp Sphex ichneumoneus (Sphecidae) nest in underground burrows. They usually dig and provision these by themselves but occasionally a nest is jointly occupied. The two wasps fight whenever they meet and in the end only one of the two females lays an egg in the shared nest. Two models based on the theory of mixed evolutionarily stable strategies were developed and tested on comprehensive field data from two North American populations of these wasps. The first model proposes two strategies called founding and joining. Founders start burrows alone. but they are more successful when they are joined by a joiner.

These writings have been based on the study of the objects themselves in the Museums of Athens and Sparta. and on the not meagre but still preliminary reports which appeared. year by year as the work proceeded. in the Annual of the School. The aim of the present book is to give the full results of the excavation. with as many illustrations and as much information on the dates of the various objects as is possible. The material is extremely copious. and it has not been regarded as any part of the contributors' task either to attempt the impossible and to forestall everything that could possibly be said on the general relations of these objects. or even to make all the archaeological comparisons that could be made; still less to write dissertations on Spartan art in its relations to the archaic art of Greece as a whole. Nothing further has been attempted than what was necessary to cast as much light as possible upon the various classes of objects. and to show their relations one to the other. and thus to make the nature and import of our material as clear as possible to our readers.

Long before selection favoured joint nesting itself. it might have favoured some other incidental preadaptation such as the habit of 'entering' abandoned burrows. found in the usually solitary wasp Splaex ichneumoneus.

Wasps often abandon the nests they have dug. and other individuals adopt or 'enter' these empty burrows.

10100792,Do digger wasps commit the Concorde fallacy?,1980,Richard Dawkins and H Jane Brockmann,28,Animal Behaviour,3,892-896,Academic Press,The Concorde fallacy is a notorious theoretical error which tempts economists and evolutionists alike. It amounts to investing further in a project simply because one has invested in it heavily in the past. rather than because of potential future return on investment. Digger waps. Sphex ichneumoneus. disconcertingly appear to behave as if following the Concorde fallacy. Pairs of females fight over jointly occupied nests. provisioned with paralysed katydids. The prior investment by each wasp in the nest is measured as the number of katydids that she has put into it. The true value of the nest is approximated by the total number of katydids there. The evidence suggests that the wasp with the least prior investment is the one most likely to surrender. In a post-hoc attempt at rationalizing this Concordian result. we uncover some of the pitfalls of naive optimality speculations. and recommend analysis in terms of evolutionarily …,True,0smOZFIAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC,122,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347280801497,11677567598713073585,/scholar?cites=11677567598713073585,,https://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1980-dawkins.pdf,0,0,0
10100793,Parasites. desiderata lists and the paradox of the organism,1990,Richard Dawkins,100,Parasitology,S1,S63-S73,Cambridge University Press,Eavesdrop morning coffee at any major centre of evolutionary theory today. and you will find'parasite'to be one of the commonest words in the language. Parasites are touted as prime movers in the evolution of sex. promising the final solution to that problem of problems. the puzzle that led GC Williams to proclaim in 1975'a kind of crisis' at hand in evolutionary biology (Hamilton. 1980; Tooby. 1982; Seger & Hamilton. 1988). Parasites seem to offer a plausible justification for the otherwise futile effort females put into choosing among posturing males (Hamilton & Zuk. 1982; but see Read. 1990). Frequency-dependent selection exerted by parasites is. according to one admittedly minority view. largely responsible for the high levels of diversity found in gene pools (Clarke. 1979). One might even extrapolate to a time when the entire metazoan body could come to be seen as a gigantic adaptation against microscopic pathogens.I want to use parasites in an entirely different kind of evolutionary argument. almost a philosophical argument. Parasites have a role in clarifying the very meaning of that most basic unit in the hierarchy of life. the organism itself (Dawkins. 1982. 1989). Parasites help us to think straight about the problem that I shall call the'Paradox of the Organism'.

Richard Dawkins powerfully captured a newly emerging way of understanding evolution--a gene's eye view. Dawkins went on to publish five more bestselling books. including The Blind Watchmaker and Unweaving the Rainbow. He is one of the most high profile public intellectuals today and any attempt to understand the scientific view of the world must grapple with his ideas. Now. in this exciting collection of original essays. some of the world's leading thinkers offer their take on how Dawkins has changed the way we think. Readers will find stimulating pieces by Daniel Dennett. the renowned philosopher of mind and author of Darwin's Dangerous Idea; Steven Pinker. the brilliant Harvard linguist who wrote The Language Instinct and The Blank Slate; Matt Ridley. author of the bestselling Genome; and James Watson. who with Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA. arguably the greatest scientific discovery of the last century. Dawkins' widely admired literary style forms the subject of several pieces. including one from novelist Philip Pullman (author of the bestselling His Dark Materials trilogy). As one of the world's best known rationalists. Dawkins' stance on religion is another theme in this collection. explored by Simon Blackburn. Michael Ruse. Michael Shermer. and the Bishop of Oxford.

While there are many superficial similarities between biological and cultural evolution. attempts to pin down such analogies have not been wholly successful. One limiting factor may be a lack of empirical evidence that the basic assumptions of the evolutionary model are met within a cultural system. We argue that a focus on the detection and description of the units of selection is an essential first step in constructing any evolutionary model. In this paper we outline the necessary connection between units of selection and evolution. describe the properties of a unit of selection. and introduce an empirical method for the detection of putative units of selection in a model cultural system: discourse within NetNews. a discussion system on the Internet.,True,0smOZFIAAAAJ:HqhvjgTjE9cC,81,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519397904604,16361749771440319861,/scholar?cites=16361749771440319861,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.69.2239&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The user presses keys on a keyboard to denote behavioural events. The number of separate events which can be distinguished depends on the quality of equipment used. and can be over 60. The main disadvantage of the system is that no two events can be recorded simultaneously. The information is coded on magnetic tape. using an unmodified single channel domestic tape recorder. The encoding unit is light and battery driven. and together with the tape recorder can easily be taken into the field. The tapes are later played back through a simple interface to a small computer. The computer decodes them. and punches out a permanent paper tape record of which behaviours occurred. and when. to the nearest tenth of a second.

10100848,What’s wrong with cloning?,2014,Richard Dawkins,,Science and the World: Philosophical Approaches,,441,Broadview Press,Richard Dawkins (born 1941) is perhaps the best-known public personality of all of the contributors to this text. having. among other notable achievements. published many hugely successful books. including the The God Delusion (Bantam Books. 2006). which sold nearly 2 million copies and has been translated into at least 30 languages. Trained as a scientist (he received his D. Phil in ethology. the study of animal psychology. from Oxford in 1966). he has made exemplary contributions to the science of animal behaviour and to evolutionary theory. having introduced the renowned concepts of the selfish gene and the meme to contemporary science. and has become one of the most successful popular science writers of his generation. However. Dawkins’s main fame is as a warrior in the century-plus war (if I may so dub it) between religion and evolutionary biology. In many ways. he might be seen as a modern day Thomas H. Huxley (1825-95). a famous public intellectual of the 19th century who defended the meek Darwin so well against the assaults of organized religion that he earned the nickname “Darwin’s Bulldog.” In the 20th century Dawkins has taken up this battle with religion. and put it on the defensive with a series of lectures. films. television specials. countless interviews. and best-selling books. This essay is but one installment in this long series. Of course. Dawkins has also become the focus of strong emotions. having earned the nickname “Darwin’s Pitbull.” which is voiced with affection among his admirers but with resentment among his detractors.

10100853,Science in the soul: selected writings of a passionate rationalist,2017,Richard Dawkins,,,,,Random House,NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER• The legendary biologist and bestselling author mounts a timely and passionate defense of science and clear thinking with this career-spanning collection of essays. including twenty pieces published in the United States for the first time. For decades. Richard Dawkins has been a brilliant scientific communicator. consistently illuminating the wonders of nature and attacking faulty logic. Science in the Soul brings together forty-two essays. polemics. and paeans—all written with Dawkins’s characteristic erudition. remorseless wit. and unjaded awe of the natural world. Though it spans three decades. this book couldn’t be more timely or more urgent. Elected officials have opened the floodgates to prejudices that have for half a century been unacceptable or at least undercover. In a passionate introduction. Dawkins calls on us to insist that reason take center stage and that gut feelings. even when they don’t represent the stirred dark waters of xenophobia. misogyny. or other blind prejudice. should stay out of the voting booth. And in the essays themselves. newly annotated by the author. he investigates a number of issues. including the importance of empirical evidence. and decries bad science. religion in the schools. and climate-change deniers. Dawkins has equal ardor for “the sacred truth of nature” and renders here with typical virtuosity the glories and complexities of the natural world. Woven into an exploration of the vastness of geological time. for instance. is the peculiar history of the giant tortoises and the sea turtles—whose journeys between water and land tell us a deeper story about evolution.

In Brief Candle in the Dark he continues his autobiography. following the threads that have run through the second half of his life so far and homing in on the key individuals. institutions and ideas that inspired and motivated him. He paints a vivid picture. coloured with wit. anecdote and digression. of the twenty-five postgraduate years he spent teaching at Oxford. He pays affectionate tribute to past colleagues and students. recalling with characteristic wry humour the idiosyncrasies of an establishment steeped in ancient tradition and arcane ritual while also recording his respect for the profound commitment to learning and discovery that lies at its core. He invites us to share the life of a travelling scientist. from fieldwork on the Panama Canal to conferences of stratospheric eminence in exotic locations in the company of some of the most prominent-and some of the most eccentric-of the world's scientific luminaries. And he describes his experiences with his many publishers. television producers. interviewers and partners in debate. not least in the heady period when. after publication of The God Delusion in 2006. he is dubbed the world's most outspoken and controversial atheist.

10100874,The tyranny of the discontinuous mind,2011,Richard Dawkins,19,New Statesman,,54-57,,What percentage of the British population lives below the poverty line? When I call that a silly question. a question that doesn’t deserve an answer. I’m not being callous or unfeeling about poverty. I care very much if children starve or pensioners shiver with cold. My objection–and this is just one of many examples–is to the very idea of a line: a gratuitously manufactured discontinuity in a continuous reality. Who decides how poor is poor enough to qualify as below the ‘poverty line’? What is to stop us moving the line and thereby changing the score? Poverty/wealth is a continuously distributed quantity. which might be measured as. say. income per week. Why throw away most of the information by splitting a continuous variable into two discontinuous categories: above and below the ‘line’? How many of us lie below the stupidity line? How many runners exceed the fast line? How many Oxford undergraduates lie above the first class line?Yes. we in universities do it too. Examination performance. like most measures of human ability or achievement. is a continuous variable. whose frequency distribution is bell-shaped. Yet British universities insist on publishing a class list. in which a minority of students receive first class degrees. rather a lot obtain seconds (sometimes subdivided into upper and lower seconds). and a few get thirds. That might make sense if the distribution had three or four peaks with deep valleys in between. but it doesn’t. Anybody who has ever marked an exam knows that the bottom of one class is separated from the top of the class below by a small fraction of the distance that separates it from the top of its own class.

But getting to the bottom of the problem can sometimes be more of a challenge than getting things back on track. Start by asking yourself if you were clear enough with your brief. Did you set out a well defined description of the task. along with your expectations of what success would look like? Did you lay out a clear chain of accountability with established authority lines and escalation guidelines? Most importantly did you check commitment to the deliverable and the deadline? If you want your team to demonstrate accountability then you need to make sure everyone is clear about what’s expected and where responsibilities lie.So results aren’t what you expected and you need to work out why. One of the most uncomfortable conversations for any manager is unpicking the reasons for failure with a team member. Encouraging them to make a clear-eyed appraisal of the facts and accept some uncomfortable truths about their performance is not a task for the faint-hearted. Take the responsibility to build psychological safety into the conversation and allow a positive and meaningful exchange. Avoid blaming and shaming as well as giving your team member excuses or a free pass. Together. explore the potential impact of the failure but ensure that the groundwork for future positives is laid down too: this difficult conversation can become an example of your commitment to continuous improvement.

10100896,The selfish genius: how Richard Dawkins rewrote Darwin's legacy,2009,Fern Elsdon-Baker,,,,,Totem Books,Richard Dawkins is one of the world's most recognisable living scientists. In the public perception of evolutionary theory. it often seems as if Dawkins has become more associated with Darwinism than Charles Darwin himself. However. in recent years he has been left behind by changes in the way science thinks about evolutionary processes. Dawkins was not actually a professor of biology but a professor for the public understanding of science. The very first line of The Extended Phenotype reads.'this is a work of unabashed advocacy'. Dawkins himself acknowledges that this would not be accepted in a scientific journal. So why is it for a popular science book? He has used his position to publicly attack'unreason'in the form of organised religion. pseudo-science. or new age folly. This polarised representation of science is potentially fuelling the feud between Darwinism and Creationism. Fern Elsdon-Baker. a rational pro-science atheist and specialist in the history and communication of evolutionary theory. finds Dawkins influence distinctly worrying. She argues that Dawkins is publicly misrepresenting science as a whole and asks whether Dawkins is really acting to popularise science or to popularise Richard Dawkins?,True,0smOZFIAAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC,30,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3073669020541529445&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3073669020541529445,/scholar?cites=3073669020541529445,,,0,0,0

10100899,The dialects of Modern Greek,1940,Richard M Dawkins,39,Transactions of the Philological Society,1,1-38,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,LANGUAGES whose speakers have not been subjected to the influence of literary education must always. I suppose. consist of a multiplicity of dialects. of which the extreme examples may perhaps be hardly intelligible to members of distant groups. Any wide spread of the arts of writing and reading will check the growth of dialect. because by its prestige the written form of the language will have a controlling and centralizing effect. Convenience too will demand some common means of intercourse. a lingua franca or form of the language purged of the most locally restricted features. although the effect of this will be slight when compared to that of a standard written style. Now until say a hundred and twenty years ago rustic Greece was very much in the condition of a quite unlettered people. The peasants spoke a number of locaI dialects; by the side of these there existed as a means of literary expression and for the …,True,0smOZFIAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC,30,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-968X.1940.tb01219.x,15542400520538025049,/scholar?cites=15542400520538025049,,,0,0,0

In a moment I’ll look at what the Pope actually says about evolution. and then at other claims of his church. to see if they really are so neatly distinct from the domain of science. First though. a brief aside on the claim that religion has some special expertise to offer us on moral ques-tions. This is often blithely accepted even by the nonreligious. presumably in the course of a civilized “bending over back-wards” to concede the best point your opponent has to offer-however weak that best point may be. The question.“What is right and what is wrong?” is a genuinely difficult question which science certainly cannot answer. Given a moral premise or a priori moral belief. the important and rigorous discipline of secular moral philosophy can pursue scientific or logical modes of reasoning to point up hidden implications of such beliefs. and hidden inconsistencies between them.

When the empire broke up. they fell. sometimes after an interval of Latin domination. under the power of the Turks. This contact between two widely opposed cultures produced everywhere a long struggle. which has ended in recent years with the final triumph of one or the other party. Never has any real union resulted. The two sides. it is true. have often come together very closely in the externals of culture. yet in everything touching the essentials of life and thought they remained poles apart. and whenever roused to full consciousness. actively hostile. The initial difference between the Greek and the Turk. accentuated still further by the influences of Christianity and Islam. were too great. and the parties were too unequally yoked for their contact. however long and intimate. to be …,True,0smOZFIAAAAJ:I858iXPj1OkC,29,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44167986,16474515377474204850,/scholar?cites=16474515377474204850,,,0,0,0
