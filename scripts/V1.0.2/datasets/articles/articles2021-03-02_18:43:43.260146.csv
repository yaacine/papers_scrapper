1105959,Walking technicolor signatures at hadron colliders,1991,Kenneth Lane and MV Ramana,44,Physical Review D,9,2678,American Physical Society,Aspects of the dynamics of walking technicolor models are expected to have important consequences for technihadron production at hadron colliders. Hard-mass enhancements characteristic of walking technicolor raise technipion (π T) masses relative to technirho (ρ T) masses so that the decays ρ T→ π T π T are either suppressed or forbidden altogether. Thus. ρ T can be unusually narrow with unconventional decay modes. Large weak isospin breaking in U-and D-technifermion masses (required for t− b splitting) leads to neutral ρ T and π T that are ideally mixed. Finally. multiscale models of walking technicolor in which the light-scale technifermions carry ordinary SU (3) color can have color-octet ρ T's which are produced strongly in parton-parton collisions and are within reach of the Fermilab Tevatron. These would appear as narrow. well-separated ρ DD and ρ UU resonances in dijet production or in π T π T …,True,EjgoXp0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,351,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.44.2678,713671807956631892,/scholar?cites=713671807956631892,,,0,0,0

One major constraint is the economics of nuclear power. driven by both the high capital costs and financial uncertainties. The second is concern about catastrophic accidents; despite the development of newer reactor designs. the possibility of such an accident has not been completely eliminated.

People oppose nuclear power for a variety of reasons. but the predominant concern is the perception that it is a risky technology. Some communities that are closely associated with it even suffer from stigmatization. The nuclear industry has tried a variety of strategies to break down public resistance to nuclear power—including information campaigns. risk comparisons. and efforts to promote nuclear power as a solution to climate change. None of these strategies has worked well. mostly because the public lacks trust in the nuclear industry. Public resistance to nuclear power is likely to continue. making it difficult to site and build new reactors.

There is concern that the March 2006 separation plan proposed by India for demarcating its military and civilian nuclear facilities may allow a potentially rapid expansion of its capacity for fissile material production for weapons. In this analysis. we have assessed fissile material production capabilities in India and how they might change as a result of the U.S.–India deal. We look at current stockpiles of fissile materials in India and Pakistan and estimate the changing capacity for future fissile material production as India progressively places some of its heavy water reactors under safeguards.

1105967,The Power of Promise: Examining Nuclear Energy in India,2012,MV Ramana,,,,,Penguin,Nuclear power has been held out as possibly the most important source of energy for India. And the dream of a nuclear-powered India has been supported by huge financial budgets and high-level political commitment for over six decades. Nuclear power has also been presented as safe. environmentally benign and cheap. Physicist and writer MV Ramana offers a detailed narrative of the evolution of India’s nuclear energy programme. examining different aspects of it and the claims of success made on its behalf. In The Power of Promise he makes a historically nuanced and compelling argument as to why the nuclear energy programme has failed in the past and why its future is dubious. Ramana shows that nuclear power has been more expensive than conventional forms of electricity generation. that the ever-present risk of catastrophic accidents is heightened by observed organizational inadequacies at nuclear facilities. and that existing nuclear fuel cycle facilities have been correlated with impacts on public health and the environment. He offers detailed information and analysis that should serve to deepen the debate on whether India should indeed embark on a massive nuclear programme.,True,EjgoXp0AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,81,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5m8Atq0ncrwC&oi=fnd&pg=PT8&dq=info:Y1Y_yLOXUeoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=b5TRqGErP6&sig=e6LYWpVNpaY1EF1yUI06t53n65M,16884443276403234403,/scholar?cites=16884443276403234403,,,0,0,0

The five visions are as follows: a vision of risk-free energy would eliminate catastrophic accidents and meltdowns. A vision of indigenous self-energization would see SMRs empowering remote communities and developing economies. A vision of water security would see SMR-powered desalination plants satisfying the world’s water needs. A vision of environmental nirvana would see SMRs providing waste-free and carbon-free electricity to preserve the earth’s biosphere.

While there are several potential advantages with these reactors. they are also confronted with multiple challenges. Important among these challenges is to have these new reactor designs licensed by national regulatory bodies. Because of the many novel features incorporated in different SMR (small modular reactor) designs. careful and thorough licensing procedures are critical to maintaining safety of the nuclear fleet. This paper examines how different countries have engaged in the process of licensing new reactor designs. and demonstrates both similarities and differences between countries. In many cases. designers have emphasized the safer design and deployment features of SMRs and attempted to use those features as reasons to get existing licensing requirements diluted.

A sensitivity analysis is included to account for variations in important parameters within the comparative cost analysis. Our results suggest that for a large range of parameters. the economics of nuclear power are not favorable in comparison with natural gas. even if the currently low domestic natural gas prices in Saudi Arabia were to rise substantially.

India has refused to accept international safeguards on this facility. raising concerns that the plutonium produced in its uranium blankets might be used to make nuclear weapons. Based on neutronics calculations for a detailed three-dimensional model of the reactor. we estimate that up to 140 kg of weapon-grade plutonium could be produced with this facility each year. This article shows how India's large stockpile of separated reactor-grade plutonium from its unsafeguarded spent heavy-water reactor fuel could serve as makeup fuel to allow such diversion of the weapon-grade plutonium from the blankets of the fast breeder reactor.

The Yalesandra plant is one among more than 20 such Megawatt size solar power plants in India during the past few years. The performance of this plant during its first year of operation has been discussed. The total electrical energy generated by the Yelasandra plant during 2010 was 3.34 million kWh. Although the performance of photovoltaic modules was good. there were problems associated with the inverters which led to reduction in energy generation. The impact of temperature variation of modules on their performance has been highlighted.Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) has established the first largescale grid-connected solar power plant using photovoltaic panels near Yalesandra village. Kolar District. The plant was commissioned on 27 December 2009 with an installed capacity of 3 MWpeak (MWP). Two other plants with same capacity were constructed later in Belgaum and Raichur.

Among other options. carbon capture and storage (CCS) is being considered as a potential technology for decarbonising the power sector. Consequently. it is important to quantify the relative benefits and trade-offs of coal-CCS in comparison to its competing renewable power sources from multiple sustainability perspectives. In this paper. we assess coal-CCS pathways in India up to 2050 and compare coal-CCS with conventional coal. solar PV and wind power sources through an integrated assessment approach coupled with a nexus perspective (energy-cost-climate-water nexus). Our levelized costs assessment reveals that coal-CCS is expensive and significant cost reductions would be needed for CCS to compete in the Indian power market. In addition. although carbon pricing could make coal-CCS competitive in relation to conventional coal power plants. it cannot influence the lack of competitiveness of coal-CCS with respect to renewables. From a climate perspective. CCS can significantly reduce the life cycle GHG emissions of conventional coal power plants. but renewables are better positioned than coal-CCS if the goal is ambitious climate change mitigation. Our water footprint assessment reveals that coal-CCS consumes an enormous volume of water resources in comparison to conventional coal and. in particular. to renewables. To conclude. our findings highlight that coal-CCS not only suffers from typical new technology development related challenges—such as a lack of technical potential …,True,sA9EU2wAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/2/262,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/2/262/pdf,0,0,0

Four basic themes. repetition. commitment. assortation. and parochialism. appear repeatedly throughout the literature. Repetition can give rise to the evolution of behavior that exhibits reciprocity-like features but a vast array of other behaviors are also stable.

It is shown that the fundamental reason for deforestation is the prevailing system of property rights. which denies the local people certainty about future benefits from forests. This has destroyed the incentive to use forests sustainably. It is therefore suggested that the present structure of rights of use and control over forest lands be changed.

There has been a marked increase in national policies and legislation on climate change since the AR4 with a diversity of approaches and a multiplicity of objectives (see Section 15.2). However. Figure 1.9 of Chapter 1 suggests that these policies. taken together. have not yet achieved a substantial deviation in emissions from the past trend. Limiting concentrations to levels that would be consistent with a likely probability of maintaining temperature increases below 2 degrees C this century (scenarios generally in the range of 430-480 ppmv CO2eq) would require that emissions break from these trends and be decreased substantially. In contrast. concentrations exceed 1000 ppmv CO2eq by 2100 in many baseline scenarios (that is. scenarios without additional efforts to reduce emissions).   The literature on mitigation scenarios provides a wide range of CO2 shadow price levels consistent with these goals. with estimates of less than US$50/tCO2 in 2020 in many studies and exceeding US$100/tCO2 in others. assuming a globally-efficient and immediate effort to reduce emissions. These shadow prices exhibit a strongly increasing trend thereafter. Policies and instruments are assessed in this light.   Section 15.2 assesses the role of institutions and governance. Section 15.3 lays out the classification of policy instruments and packages. while 15.4 discusses the methodologies used to evaluate policies and institutions.

Less attention has been paid to the possibility that lack of awareness about adverse health effects of environmental pollution could also keep the demand low. We use a household survey from urban India to estimate the effects of schooling. exposure to mass media. and other measures of awareness on home water purification.

1106011,Collective action for forest conservation: Does heterogeneity matter,2007,Eswaran Somanathan and Rajagopal Prabhakar and Bhupendra Singh Mehta,,"Inequality, Cooperation and Environmental Sustainability",,234-245,Princeton University Press,It is of interest to examine the role of heterogeneity in asset ownership and ethnicity in the success of community management of forests for at least two reasons. First. we would like to know under what conditions community management of forests (as compared to state management. for example). is likely to be successful in order to make policy appropriately. Second. this setting is interesting for examining some hypotheses about the role that heterogeneity plays in collective action in general. There are at least three different arguments that can be advanced for why heterogeneity may be inimical to the success of collective action. One. proposed by Alesina. Baqir. and Easterly (1999). suggests that tastes for public goods may differ across groups. and this can reduce the willingness to pay for public goods which may not be the kind that one's own group wants. This argument does not really apply in the case of the Himalayan forests examined in this chapter. where the benefit from collective action is forest preservation and its associated benefits so that there is really not much choice as to the type of public good to be financed. A second argument. often made by political scientists. is that social divisions may favor politicians who seek to provide private benefits to particular groups rather than providing public goods. Again. in the setting of small village forests. this argument does not apply.This chapter is part of a larger research project for which financial support from the National Science Foundation (USA) under grants SBR-9711286 and SES-9996602 is gratefully acknowledged. as is field support from the UP Academy of Administration. and the UP …,True,drfV8loAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,61,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=w4t1agamc1QC&oi=fnd&pg=PA234&dq=info:ILC7i-YfylkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3LgAtGP2eq&sig=Ca5COqUn3zWoRqY5qvaOfrKWYkc,6470018889718411296,/scholar?cites=6470018889718411296,,http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/files/gems/sustainability/sustain09.pdf,0,0,0

A simple model of collective action is presented in which such punishment opportunities are available. and some individuals have a taste for exercising them. The model suggests that many of the correlates of successful collective action in the commons management literature are endogenous. and it clarifies the channels through which others operate. It points to the importance of communication costs and asymmetries in power rather than wealth in explaining when collective action fails.

1106017,8 Norm Compliance and Strong Reciprocity,2005,Rajiv Sethi and E Somanathan,,Moral Sentiments and Material Interests,,229,,A central feature of strong reciprocity is the propensity to punish others for opportunistic actions and to reward them for acts of uncommon generosity. where such rewards and punishments are not motivated by the prospect of future gain. The social norms that serve as the benchmark for evaluating behavior may vary from one culture to another. but given some such set of broadly shared norms. strong reciprocity provides a decentralized mechanism for their enforcement. The extent and persistence of strong reciprocity poses something of a theoretical puzzle because monitoring and sanctioning activities. while potentially beneficial to the group. place a net material burden on the reciprocator. Since opportunistic individuals choose to comply with or violate norms based on the likelihood and severity of sanctioning they anticipate. such individuals will always outperform reciprocators within any group. Even under complete compliance. reciprocators incur costs that opportunists are able to avoid. One would expect this payoff differential to exert evolutionary pressure on the population composition until reciprocators are entirely displaced from the group. This suggests that any population composed of immutable groups with no intergroup mobility will not sustain strong reciprocity in the long run.The situation can be quite different if groups can dissolve and new groups are formed periodically. Strong reciprocity differs from pure altruism in one important respect: The presence of reciprocators in a group can. under very general conditions. alter the behavior of opportunists in such a manner as to benefit all members of the group (including reciprocators). 1 …,True,drfV8loAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,38,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jsVpDIIGzQoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA229&dq=info:_Jr6pk1p79kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=4DmVQi4dMN&sig=LhBh2wSh84Kve1Lw0Anoa7uq26c,15703886207899048700,/scholar?cites=15703886207899048700,,http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/5708/norm%20compliance.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Second. there would have been selection pressure between groups. as through warfare and other forms of group competition. This second type of pressure would have provided evolutionary incentives for individuals to be able to cooperate in groups with others. which in turn depends on the ability to avoid cheating. or defection in a prisoner's dilemma setting.

Such accidents could potentially breach the reactor containment and disperse radioactivity to the environment. The potential for such accidents results from the reactor core not being in its most reactive configuration; further. when there is a loss of the coolant. the reactivity increases rather then decreasing as in the case of water-cooled reactors.

In circular plates. the standing waves of two such degenerate bending modes can be superposed with a 1/4 period separation in time to yield a traveling wave response. This is the principle of a traveling wave ultrasonic motor (TWUM). in which a traveling bending wave in a stator drives the rotor through a friction contact. The stator contains teeth to increase the speed at the contact region. and these affect the rotational symmetry of the plate.

1106044,Economics of carbon-dioxide abatement under an exogenous constraint on cumulative emissions,2018,Ashwin K Seshadri,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.08717,,,,The fossil-fuel induced contribution to further warming over the 21st century will be determined largely by integrated CO2 emissions over time rather than the precise timing of the emissions. with a relation of near-proportionality between global warming and cumulative CO2 emissions. This paper examines optimal abatement pathways under an exogenous constraint on cumulative emissions. Least cost abatement pathways have carbon tax rising at the risk-free interest rate. but if endogenous learning or climate damage costs are included in the analysis. the carbon tax grows more slowly. The inclusion of damage costs in the optimization leads to a higher initial carbon tax. whereas the effect of learning depends on whether it appears as an additive or multiplicative contribution to the marginal cost curve. Multiplicative models are common in the literature and lead to delayed abatement and a smaller initial tax. The required initial carbon tax increases with the cumulative abatement goal and is higher for lower interest rates. Delaying the start of abatement is costly owing to the increasing marginal abatement cost. Lower interest rates lead to higher relative costs of delaying abatement because these induce higher abatement rates early on. The fraction of business-as-usual emissions (BAU) avoided in optimal pathways increases for low interest rates and rapid growth of the abatement cost curve. which allows a lower threshold global warming goal to become attainable without overshoot in temperature. Each year of delay in starting abatement raises this threshold by an increasing amount. because the abatement rate increases exponentially with time.,True,NJpOqqQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08717,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08717,0,0,0

1106046,Economics of limiting cumulative CO2 emissions,2017,Ashwin K Seshadri,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.03502,,,,"Global warming from carbon dioxide (CO2) is known to depend on cumulative CO2 emissions. We introduce a model of global expenditures on limiting cumulative CO2 emissions. taking into account effects of decarbonization and rising global income and making an approximation to the marginal abatement costs (MAC) of CO2. Discounted mitigation expenditures are shown to be a convex function of cumulative CO2 emissions. We also consider minimum-expenditure solutions for meeting cumulative emissions goals. using a regularized variational method yielding an initial value problem in the integrated decarbonization rate. A quasi-stationary solution to this problem can be obtained for a special case. yielding decarbonization rate that is proportional to annual CO2 emissions. Minimum-expenditure trajectories in scenarios where CO2 emissions decrease must begin with rapid decarbonization at rate decreasing with time. Due to the shape of global MAC the fraction of global income spent on CO2 mitigation ("" burden"") generally increases with time. as cheaper avenues for mitigation are exhausted. Therefore failure to rapidly decarbonize early on reduces expenditures by a small fraction (on the order of 0.01%) of income in the present. but leads to much higher burden to future generations (on the order of 1% of income).",True,NJpOqqQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03502,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03502,0,0,0

Other forcers such as aerosols and non-CO2 greenhouse gases may also influence the timing of maximum radiative forcing. This paper approximates solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four time-constants to identify factors governing the timing of its concentration peak. The most important emissions-related factor is the ratio between average rates at which emissions increase and decrease. which in turn is related to the rate at which the emissions intensity of CO2 is reduced. Rapid decarbonization of CO2 can not only limit global warming but also achieve an early CO2 concentration peak.

But there is spatial coherence and heterogeneity that is relevant to forecasting. This paper considers year-to-year rainfall change and annual extremes at sub-national scales. We use Data Mining techniques to gridded rain-gauge data for 1901-2011 to characterize coherence and heterogeneity and identify spatially homogeneous clusters. We study the direction of change in rainfall between years (Phase). and extreme annual rainfall at both grid level and national level. Grid-level Phase is found to be spatially coherent. and significantly correlated with all-India mean rainfall (AIMR) phase. Grid-level extreme-rainfall years are not strongly associated with corresponding extremes in AIMR. although in extreme AIMR years local extremes of the same type occur with higher spatial coherence. Years of extremes in AIMR entail widespread phase of the corresponding sign. Furthermore. local extremes and phase are found to frequently co-occur in spatially contiguous clusters.,True,NJpOqqQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08246,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08246,0,0,0
1106050,Factors controlling the time-delay between peak CO2 emissions and concentrations,2015,Ashwin K Seshadri,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.00805,,,,Carbon-dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor to anthropogenic global warming. and the timing of its peak concentration in the atmosphere is likely to govern the timing of maximum radiative forcing. It is well-known that dynamics of atmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants. and here we approximate the solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four time-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in CO2 emissions and concentrations. and therefore the timing of the concentration peak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of change of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio is large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and concentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of this ratio through mitigation. in order to achieve an early peak in CO2 concentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak. combined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity. because the delay between peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with which decarbonization occurs. Of course. for limiting the magnitude of peak concentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions throughout its trajectory. but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is not examined here. The carbon cycle parameters affecting the timing of the concentration peak are primarily the long multi-century time-constant of atmospheric CO2. and the ratio of contributions to the impulse response function of atmospheric CO2 from the infinite time-constant and the long time-constant …,True,NJpOqqQAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00805,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00805,0,0,0

The recovery of this energy would enable a substantial reduction in fuel consumption. One solution is to integrate a heat recovery system based on a steam Rankine cycle. The key component in such a system is the expander. which has a strong impact on the system’s performance. A survey of different expander technologies leads us to select the reciprocating expander as the most promising one for an automotive application. This paper therefore proposes a steady-state semi-empirical model of the expander device developed under the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) environment. The ambient and mechanical losses as well as internal leakage were taken into account by the model. By exploiting the expander manufacturer’s data. all the parameters of the expander model were identified. The model computes the mass flow rate. the power output delivered and the exhaust enthalpy of the steam. The maximum deviation between predictions and measurement data is 4.7%. A performance study of the expander is carried out and shows that the isentropic efficiency is quite high and increases with the expander rotary speed. The mechanical efficiency depends on mechanical losses which are quite high. approximately 90%. The volumetric efficiency was also evaluated.

A complete literature review is done and results in two comparative graphs. In the second part. simulation models are built and calibrated in order to assess the fuel consumption reduction that can be achieved on a real driving cycle. The strength of this article is that the models are calibrated using actual data. Finally. those simulations results are analyzed and the Rankine cycle and turbocompound are the two most profitable solutions. However the simulations of the turbocompound shows its limitations because the impact on the exhaust pressure drop is not taken into account in the assessment of the car fuel consumption. Fuel reduction of up to 6% could be achieved. depending on the driving cycle and the waste heat recovery technology.

This system is designed to test only the performance of the expander. It is made up mainly of a scroll compressor. a scroll expander. a heat exchanger. and a by-pass valve. The latter is used to adjust the pressure ratio imposed to the expander. The expander was originally a compressor designed for heat pump applications and is characterized by a nominal power input of 2.5 kWe. Performance of the expander is evaluated in terms of isentropic effectiveness and filling factor as functions of the main operating conditions. The study also investigates the impact of oil mass fraction on the expander performance.

Many observers have predicted an uptake of combined PV/battery units which could ultimately disconnect from the grid and lead to autonomous homes or micro-grids. However. most of the comments in social media. blogs or press articles lack proper cost evaluation and realistic simulations. We aim to bridge this gap by simulating self-consumption in various EU countries. for various household profiles. with or without battery. Results indicate that (1) self-consumption is a non-linear. almost asymptotic function of PV and battery sizes. Achieving 100% self-consumption (i.e. allowing for full off-grid operation) is not realistic for the studied countries without excessively oversizing the PV system and/or the battery; (2) although falling fast …,True,WVDLdN4AAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,151,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916311643,5191895607624108763,/scholar?cites=5191895607624108763,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916311643,0,0,0

As a consequence. the accuracy and simulation speed of the higher level system model mainly depend on the heat exchanger model formulation. In particular. the modeling of thermo-flow systems characterized by evaporation or condensation requires heat exchanger models capable of handling phase transitions. To this aim. the finite volume (FV) and the moving boundary (MB) approaches are the most widely used. The two models are developed and included in the open-source ThermoCycle Modelica library. In this contribution. a comparison between the two approaches is presented. An integrity and accuracy test is designed to evaluate the performance of the FV and MB models during transient conditions. In order to analyze how the two modeling approaches perform when integrated at a system level. two organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system models are built using the FV and the MB evaporator model. and their responses are compared against experimental data collected on an 11 kW el ORC power unit. Additionally. the effect of the void fraction value in the MB evaporator model and of the number of control volumes (CVs) in the FV one is investigated.

The ORC (organic Rankine cycle) is a relatively simple but efficient process that can be used for this purpose by converting low and medium temperature waste heat to power. In this study we propose four linear regression models to predict the maximum obtainable thermal efficiency for simple and recuperated ORCs. A previously derived methodology is able to determine the maximum thermal efficiency among many combinations of fluids and processes. given the boundary conditions of the process.

This paper describes an alternative cycle design that offers potential advantages in terms of heat source exploitation. A concept for a reciprocating expander is presented that performs both. work extraction and heat addition. Heated by thermal oil. evaporation takes place in two expansion chambers with a transfer of the working fluid at an intermediate pressure level. Using saturated liquid as feed leads to an expansion in the two-phase domain. A dynamic model of this expander is used to determine the state of the working fluid during the process. Based on this model. a first optimisation by means of changed valve timing is conducted and the results of this scenario are shown in this paper. The heat transfer during expansion is investigated and used to establish a representation of the dynamic calculation results for use with a steady state cycle evaluation. An organic Rankine cycle model is developed and used for a comparison. The performance of the expander itself and the different requirements regarding heat source and temperature levels are studied.,True,7Y9zV8oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,8,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13796681.pdf,18036012612245350479,/scholar?cites=18036012612245350479,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13796681.pdf,0,0,0

Special attention has been paid to robustness and to simulation speed. Dynamic simulations are indeed often limited by numerical constraints and failures. either during initialization or during integration. Furthermore. the use of complex equations of state (EOS) to compute thermodynamic properties dramatically decreases the simulation speed.

1106114,Modelling of a small scale reciprocating ORC expander for cogeneration applications,2013,Jorrit Wronski and Jean-Francois Oudkerk and Fredrik Haglind,,Proceedings of the ASME ORC 2nd international seminar on ORC power systems,,,,Various expansion machines are used in mini and small-scale organic Rankine cycle (ORC) installations. Among these. volumetric machines dominate with published work on. for example. vane-type (Mohd et al.. 2010). reciprocating (Glavatskaya et al.. 2012; Wronski et al.. 2012) and scroll expanders (Lemort et al.. 2011; Li et al.. 2011; Wang et al.. 2011) with the latter being the most commonly used device type. Most expanders run with fixed admission and exhaust timing causing over-and underexpansion. which leads to significant losses in off-design operation (Lemort and Quoilin. 2009).This work presents dynamic models covering the operation of a reciprocating expander for a medium temperature heat source. Assuming a cogeneration scenario. condenser pressure of a power cycle changes with heat load. Here. the required temperature is varied from 25◦ C to 75◦ C representing the two cases of no heat demand and domestic hot water generation. respectively. To satisfy thermal demand at higher temperatures. the saturation pressure in the condenser has to rise since most heat is released during the phase change. This study considers the effect of elevated back-pressure on the closing of the admission valve concluding with an estimation for achievable power output under ideal operating conditions. As a result. a basic control scheme with variable valve timing based on condenser temperature only is sketched. Implementing the cutoff angle and condenser temperature relation in an algorithm helps to maintain a high isentropic efficiency η over a wide range of operating conditions.,True,7Y9zV8oAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,6,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18494201.pdf,13761209281043685236,/scholar?cites=13761209281043685236,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18494201.pdf,0,0,0

Scientific work focusing on the heat transfer in PHEs has been carried out since the late 19th century. More recent publications have been focusing on vaporization and condensation of refrigerants at heat-pump like operation. Despite PHEs are largely used for small to medium organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems (5-250 kWel). literature covering the heat exchanger performance at temperatures and pressures suitable for ORCs is scarce. In order to fill the lack of experimental data for heat transfer in ORC-like operation. a dedicated heat transfer test installation has been designed and built at the Technical University of Denmark. The rig features six small brazed PHEs installed in series which allow simulating various heat transfer conditions. The first measured experimental results are presented. The tests includeÂ vaporization runs carried out at three different saturation temperatures (70. 80. and 90 ÂC) and different evaporator outlet conditions (outlet vapor quality around 0.4 and 1.00) and Â various inlet sub-cooling around 5 and 10 ÂC for HFC-134a.

Micro ORC systems are normally equippedwith brazed plate heat exchangers which allows for efficient heat transfer with a compact design.

The current literature is lacking experimental data and validated correlations for vaporization of organic fluids at typical working conditions of ORC systems for low temperature waste heat recovery (WHR) applications.

1106123,Experimental and numerical analysis of brazed plate heat exchangers for organic fluids,2013,Lars Bennov and Jorrit Wronski and Wiebke Brix Markussen and Fredrik Haglind,,,,,,n-Pentane is a suitable working fluid for ORC applications exploiting temperatures around 180◦ C. This work investigates the heat transfer process in brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHE) for n-Pentane. It provides more accurate information regarding the boiling process. which is not much discussed in literature. yet. According to Roser et al.[4]. two-phase heat transfer is significantly influenced by mass velocity and is therefore dominated by convective boiling. Whereas Dário et al.[1] conclude that nucleate boiling dominates due to a strong heat flux dependency.We present a preliminary experimental analysis carried out with a test rig consisting of a platetype preheater and evaporator as well as an expansion valve. a condenser and a pump. First tests were made with a maximum temperature and pressure of 145◦ C and 5 bar. respectively. with a mass flow of approximately 0.05 kg s− 1. A numerical model is developed to compare experimental results with established heat transfer and pressure drop correlations from literature. Based on experimental and modelling results. the influence of nucleate and convective boiling is identified alongside other important parameters. Correlation from Focke et al.[2] correlates the experimental single-phase heat transfer coefficient. whereas correlation from Khan et al.[3] correlates the two-phase data. New correlations for single-and two-phase heat transfer of n-Pentane in BPHE. suitable for small-scale ORC. are developed from existing correlations.

The functional fluid used is a surfactant stabilised paraffin-in-water dispersion containing different amounts of phase change material. Density. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometric properties and ultrasonic velocity are measured and evaluated. Results from heating the dispersion at a constant gradient of 0.25 Kmin-1 from 5 C to 35 C corresponds to the peak melting rate identified by differential scanning calorimetry. The employed sensors are part of a test rig made from standard components and data is acquired from three experimental runs. Thermal expansion of the paraffin is derived from measured data and is linked to its state of aggregation. The T2 NMR relaxation spectrum of protons within the fluid is used to estimate the amount of solid-. melting-and liquid material inside the wax droplets.

Furthermore. ORCs are designed for unmanned operation with little maintenance. Because of these excellent characteristics. several ORC waste heat recovery plants are already in operation. Although the basic ORC is gradually adopted into industry. the need of increased cost-effectiveness persists. Therefore. a next logical step is the development of new ORC architectures.

ORCs typically work in changing operating conditions. Examples are solar. waste heat. and combined heat and power applications (CHP). The proposed design methodology consists of four steps. First an ORC is sized for fixed operating conditions. With this sizing the part load regime is modeled. The part load model is then used in a 1-year simulation to assess the actual power output.

Although many energy intensive industries could benefit significantly from the integration of ORC technology. its current adoption rate is limited. One important reason for this arises from the difficulty of prospective investors and end-users to recognize and. ultimately. realise the potential energy savings from such deployment. In recent years. electric arc furnaces (EAF) have been identified as particularly interesting candidates for the implementation of waste heat recovery projects. Therefore. in this work. the integration of an ORC system into a 100 MWe EAF is investigated. The effect of evaluations based on averaged heat profiles. a steam buffer and optimized ORC architectures is investigated. The results show that it is crucial to take into account the heat profile variations for the typical batch process of an EAF. An optimized subcritical ORC system is found capable of generating a net electrical output of 752 kWe with a steam buffer working at 25 bar. If combined heating is considered. the ORC system can be optimized to generate 521 kWe of electricity. while also delivering 4.52 MW of heat. Finally. an increased power output (by 26% with combined heating. and by 39% without combined heating) can be achieved by using high temperature thermal oil for buffering instead of a steam loop; however. the use of thermal oil in these applications has been until now typically discouraged due to flammability concerns.

As a consequence. the accuracy and simulation speed of the higher level system model mainly depend on the heat exchanger model formulation. In particular. the modeling of thermo-flow systems characterized by evaporation or condensation requires heat exchanger models capable of handling phase transitions. To this aim. the finite volume (FV) and the moving boundary (MB) approaches are the most widely used. The two models are developed and included in the open-source ThermoCycle Modelica library. In this contribution. a comparison between the two approaches is presented. An integrity and accuracy test is designed to evaluate the performance of the FV and MB models during transient conditions. In order to analyze how the two modeling approaches perform when integrated at a system level. two organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system models are built using the FV and the MB evaporator model. and their responses are compared against experimental data collected on an 11 kW el ORC power unit. Additionally. the effect of the void fraction value in the MB evaporator model and of the number of control volumes (CVs) in the FV one is investigated. The results allow drawing general guidelines for the development of heat exchanger dynamic models involving two-phase flows.

Several studies have underlined the potential of small-capacity Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plants for Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) applications. For such systems. accurate models based on actual experimental data represent an important tool. in particular when control issues are considered. This paper presents an experimental campaign on a 10-kWe WHR ORC unit carried out both in steady-state and in transient conditions. The unit presents a regenerative architecture. uses Solkatherm (SES36) as working fluid and a single screw expander as expansion machine. The dynamic response of the unit is analyzed by applying a step function to the pump rotational speed while keeping the expander rotational speed constant. During the experiments. the control of the external heating circuit ensures a steady heat source temperature at the inlet of the evaporator. It has been ensured that the power plant was operating in steady-state condition before any change is imposed to the system. The test rig exhibits a good first law efficiency (about 11% efficiency for a heat source of 125* C) and allows measuring a wide range of operating conditions. Maximum isentropic efficiency of the screw expander is about 60%. Following the experimental campaign. steady state performance curves of the screw expander are developed and calibrated with the experimental data.

In this paper. a detailed overall ORC simulation model is presented based on two solution strategies: condenser subcooling and total working fluid charge of the system. The latter allows the subcooling level to be predicted rather than specified as an input. The overall cycle model is composed of independent models for pump. expander. line sets. liquid receiver and heat exchangers. Empirical and semi-empirical models are adopted for the pump and expander. respectively. A generalized steady-state moving boundary method is used to model the heat exchangers. The line sets and liquid receiver are used to better estimate the total charge of the system and pressure drops. Finally. the individual components are connected to form a cycle model in an object-oriented fashion. The solution algorithm includes a preconditioner to guess reasonable values for the evaporating and condensing temperatures and a main cycle solver loop which drives to zero a set of residuals to ensure the convergence of the solution. The model has been developed in the Python programming language.

However. model development is often time consuming and the scientific community lacks of open-access tools to study ORC systems.

For a suitable choice of working fluid. the setting of its evaporation pressure is crucial for the performance of an ORC installation. The higher the evaporation pressure. the higher the cycle efficiency on the one hand. but the lower the energy recovered from the heat source due to a higher outlet temperature on the other hand. An optimum has to be found to achieve maximum net power production. Heat source temperature profiles typical for geothermal and solar applications are simulated with an electric thermal oil boiler. An optimal control strategy. based on the installation empirical model is developed and verified on an 11 kWe ORC test rig.

Simulation results of a validated dynamic model of the ORC power unit are used to derive a correlation for the evaporating temperature. which maximizes the power generation for a range of operating conditions. This idea is further extended using a perturbation-based extremum seeking (ES) algorithm to identify online the optimal evaporating temperature. Regarding safety conditions. we propose the use of the extended prediction self-adaptive control (EPSAC) approach to constrained model predictive control (MPC). Since it uses input/output models for prediction. it avoids the need for state estimators. making it a suitable tool for industrial applications. The performance of the proposed control strategy is compared to PID-like schemes. Results show that EPSAC-MPC is a more effective control strategy. as it allows a safer and more efficient operation of the ORC unit. as it can handle constraints in a natural way. operating close to the boundary conditions where power generation is maximized.

The performance of the autotuned PID is compared to that of a PID controller which is designed using a computer-assisted design tool assuming the availability of a full process model. An illustrative example in simulation of a high-order system. for which a simple PID controller may not be an optimal choice. proves that the proposed algorithm works well.

Simulations on a validated dynamic model of a real regenerative ORC unit. are used to illustrate the existence of an optimal evaporating temperature which maximizes energy production for some given heat source conditions. This idea is further extended using a perturbation based Extremum Seeking (ES) algorithm to find online the optimal evaporating temperature. Regarding safety conditions we propose the use of the Extended Prediction Self-Adaptive Control (EPSAC) approach to constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC). Since it uses input/output models for prediction. it avoids the need of state estimators. making of it a suitable tool for industrial applications. The performance of the proposed control strategy is compared to PID-like schemes.

Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) appears as a solution due to its capability to find optimal control actions for the case of nonlinear processes with constraints. In this contribution. the control problem is solved using the Nonlinear Extended Prediction Self-Adaptive Control (NEPSAC) approach to model predictive control (MPC). which besides of being a fast algorithm also avoids explicit local linearization by directly using the nonlinear model for prediction.

When liquid flooding and regeneration is applied to refrigeration and heat pump systems. simple cycle modeling predicts that for systems that operate at very large temperature lifts. the increase in system coefficient of performance can be greater than 50%. In order to better understand the liquid-flooded working process. a detailed scroll compressor model has been developed which comprises a geometric model and an overall compressor model. The geometric model includes numerically validated analytic solutions for all geometric parameters. including force terms. for constant wall thickness scroll wraps that can have multiple pairs of compression chambers.

Hybrid heat exchangers are heat exchangers that are typically run in dry mode to reject heat. When the ambient conditions require more heat rejection than can be provided by sensible heat transfer. a water pump is turned on and water flows over the fins. and the evaporation of water provides a further cooling effect. Fouling in dry-mode operation is physically similar to that of air-cooled heat exchangers. but in evaporative mode the flow of the water over the coil eliminates the impact of fouling.

This kind of model is particularly useful when modeling 1D heat exchangers or piping. eg. in thermodynamic cycles involving a phase change. Issues. such as chattering or stiff systems. can lead to low simulation speed. instabilities and simulation failures. In the particular case of two-phase flow models. they are usually linked to a discontinuity in the density derivative between the liquid and two-phase zones. In this work. several methods to tackle numerical problems are developed. described. implemented and compared. In addition. methods available in the literature are also implemented and compared to the proposed approaches. Results suggest that the robustness of the models can be significantly increased with these different methods. at the price of a small increase of the error in the mass and energy balances.

We carried out an extensive screening of the binary. ternary. and four-component blends possible among a list of 13 pure refrigerants comprising four hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). eight hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). and carbon dioxide. The screening was based on a simplified cycle model. but with the inclusion of pressure drops in the evaporator and condenser. The metrics for the evaluation were nonflammability. low GWP. high COP (coefficient of performance). and a volumetric capacity similar to the R-134a baseline system.

1106194,Experimental investigation of an ORC system for a micro-solar power plant,2014,Rémi Dickes and Olivier Dumont and Sébastien Declaye and Sylvain Quoilin and Ian Bell and Vincent Lemort,,,,,,Because of the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming issues. the world energy sector is undergoing various changes toward increased sustainability. Among the different technologies being developed. solar energy. and more specifically CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) systems are expected to play a key role to supply centralized loads and off-grid areas in the medium-term. Major performance improvements can be achieved by implementing advanced control strategies accounting for the transient and random nature of the solar heat source. In this context. a lab-scale solar power plant has been designed and is under construction for experimental purposes and dynamic analyzes. The test rig includes an ORC unit. a field of parabolic trough collectors and a thermal energy storage. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign conducted on the ORC module alone. This power unit. designed for a 2.8 kW net electrical output. consists of two scroll expanders in series. an air-cooled condenser. a recuperator. a volumetric pump and an oil-heated evaporator. The ORC engine is constructed using standard mass manufactured components from the HVAC industry. this practice reducing considerably the system cost.

This approach. with a very simple functional form. allows for the reproduction of the most accurate simulation data to within nearly their statistical uncertainty.

Six heat pump systems were considered. corresponding to an upper limit of the sink temperature of 120 °C. For each set of heat sink and source temperatures the best available technology was determined. The results showed that four different heat pump systems propose the best available technology at different parts of the complete domain.

This is due to the reduced vapour pressure and the non-isothermal phase change of the zeotropic mixture. ammonia-water. To evaluate to which extent these advantages can be translated into feasible heat pump solutions. the working domain of the HACHP is investigated based on technical and economic constraints. The HACHP working domain is compared to that of the best available vapour compression heat pump with natural working fluids.

The main barrier for IHP integration is the operating cost and thereby the COP. COP is highly dependent on the temperature difference between the source and sink. Today estimation of expected COP is often done by IHP suppliers and involves choices such as working fluid and compressor technology. By extending the method (of part 1) to include a generic and generalized estimation of COP. the feasibility of integration is elaborated to include real process parameters such as working fluid. compressor and heat exchanger characteristics. The method allows analysis of the credibility of assumptions for heat pump performance and estimated COP improvement from changes of the individual characteristics.

Considering only direct heat exchange. the minimum forward temperature level is determined by the demand side. as energy services are required at a certain temperature. As domestic hot water is required at a temperature range where legionella is no longer a threat. forward temperatures in a traditional low temperature district heating network cannot be lowered beyond approximately 55 oC. One solution is to boost the temperature of the forward tap water stream with a heat pump. as the remaining heat demands are often not required at temperature levels as high as the tap water. The scope of this work is to evaluate the power consumption and second law efficiency of booster heat pumps for tap water production in a low temperature district heating network. The heat pump and storage arrangement is evaluated based on a tapping sequence from the Danish standards (DS439). Based an initial investigation of possible designs. three configurations have been chosen for the evaluation. Of the three heat pumps. two are implemented on the primary side to boost the network stream. and one is intended to increase the temperature of the tap water directly. Results show that one of the three configurations are superior to the two remaining. when considering temperature levels of forward stream between 35 oC and 47 oC.

A study of the refrigerant distribution is carried out for two channels in parallel and for two different cases. In the first case maldistribution of the inlet quality into the channels is considered. and in the second case a non-uniform airflow on the secondary side is considered. In both cases the total mixed superheat out of the evaporator is kept constant. It is shown that the cooling capacity of the evaporator is reduced significantly. both in the case of unevenly distributed inlet quality and for the case of non-uniform airflow on the outside of the channels.,True,hTNjmT8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,56,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140700709001029,13227242295019160162,/scholar?cites=13227242295019160162,,,0,0,0

This paper evaluates the use of a high temperature Kalina cycle for a central receiver concentrating solar power plant with direct vapour generation and without storage. The use of the ammonia-water mixture as the power cycle working fluid with non-isothermal evaporation and condensation presents the potential to improve the overall performance of the plant. This however comes at a price of requiring larger heat exchangers because of lower thermal pinch and heat transfer degradation for mixtures as compared with using a pure fluid in a conventional steam Rankine cycle. and the necessity to use a complex cycle arrangement.

The use of such mixtures as working fluids in organic Rankine cycle power plants enables a minimization of the mean temperature difference of the heat exchangers. which is beneficial for cycle performance. On the other hand. larger heat transfer surface areas are typically required for evaporation and condensation when zeotropic mixtures are used as working fluids. In order to assess the feasibility of using zeotropic mixtures. it is. therefore. important to consider the additional costs of the heat exchangers. In this study. we aim at evaluating the economic feasibility of zeotropic mixtures compared to pure fluids.

In the design and modelling of such heat exchangers the flow and liquid/vapour distribution is often assumed to be ideal. However. maldistribution may occur and will cause each channel to behave differently due to the variation of the mass flux and vapour quality. To evaluate the effect of maldistribution on the performance of plate heat exchangers. a numerical model is developed in which the mass. momentum and energy balances are applied individually to each channel. including suitable correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop. The flow distribution on both the refrigerant and secondary side is determined based on equal pressure drop while the liquid/vapour distribution is imposed to the model.

In this context. the header and coil design is a promising configuration to minimize the stresses.This paper presents a method to design the header and coil heat exchangers of the steam generator. taking into account low-cycle fatigue requirements. by defining minimum allowable heating rates for the evaporator and superheater.

Navigating in the Arctic offers opportunities and challenges for waste heat recovery systems (WHRS). Lower temperatures require larger heating power on board. hence a larger demand for waste heat usage. to cover services and maintaining on board spaces temperatures. However. a lower heat rejection temperature increases the WHRS thermal efficiency. The air temperature for the Arctic route selected is colder than that of the seawater. opening the opportunity of having air as coolant.

The analysis focused on how the estimated net power outputs of zeotropic mixtures compared to pure fluids are affected by the method used for specifying the performance of the heat exchangers. Four different methods were included in the assessment. which assumed that the organic Rankine cycle systems were characterized by the same values of:(1) the minimum pinch point temperature difference of the heat exchangers;(2) the mean temperature difference of the heat exchangers;(3) the heat exchanger thermal capacity (UA); or (4) the heat exchanger surface area for all the considered working fluids. The second and third methods took into account the temperature difference throughout the heat transfer process. and provided the insight that the advantages of mixtures are more pronounced when large heat exchangers are economically feasible to use. The first method was incapable of this. and deemed to result in optimistic estimations of the benefits of using zeotropic mixtures. while the second and third method were deemed to result in conservative estimations. The fourth method provided the additional benefit of accounting for the degradation of heat transfer performance of zeotropic mixtures. In a net power output based performance ranking of 30 working fluids. the first method estimates that the increase in the net power output of zeotropic mixtures compared to their best pure fluid components is up to 13.6%.

Pumped thermal energy storage (PTES or Carnot battery) converts electric energy to thermal energy with a heat pump (or another heating system) when electricity production is greater than demand; when electricity demand outstrips production the PTES generates power from two thermal storage reservoirs (possibly a Rankine cycle mode). Classical PTES architectures do not achieve more than 60% roundtrip electric efficiency.

1106278,Charge-sensitive methods for the off-design performance characterization of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems,2019,Rémi Dickes,,,,,,[en] The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is among the most suited technologies to convert low-grade and low-capacity heat sources into useful work. For many reasons-including predictive control. optimal sizing or performance forecast-a proper understanding and characterization of the ORC behaviour under off-design conditions is of significant interest. In order to avoid any intrinsic state assumption. predictive models must account for both fundamental conversation laws of hermodynamics. namely the conservation of energy and the conservation of mass. Besides of modelling the energy transfers. a true off-design model must account for the constant amount of working fluid in the system and simulate its distribution among the different components. Although well-known for HVAC systems. such charge-sensitive considerations are quasi absent for the ORC technology and existing models have never been completely validated. The goal intended by this PhD thesis is to fill this gap. To begin this work. experiments are conducted to assess the fluid distribution and the impact of the charge on a real system operation. To this end. a 2 kWe ORC test rig is constructed and tested over wide range of conditions. Besides of standard thermohydraulic sensors. the fluid charge distribution is measured on-line by bending load cells and infrared imaging techniques.

Nonetheless. the adoption of this technology in the automotive domain requires specific R&D activities going from the system definition to the on-board integration. This study focuses on the preliminary design phase of ORC systems recovering the heat wasted from two of the sources available on a HDT: the exhaust and recirculated gases. From these heat sources and their combinations. 6 possible architectures are identified. On the other hand. 4 volumetric expansion machine technologies are considered (scroll. screw. piston and vane Expanders). At the end. 24 topologies are therefore modelled considering the main components (Pump. Heat exchangers. Expansion machines). A three-step optimization method is proposed to identify the most promising system. First. the most suitable conditions are identified for the design of the ORC systems using a simple model of volumetric expansion machine. In a second step. the design phase. using more detailed models for the expansion machines. a thermos-economic optimization is performed.

To avoid imposing the condenser subcooling (or any other equivalent state variable). the ORC model should account for the mass repartition of working fluid through the unit in function of the operating conditions. Among the various components constituting ORC power systems. the proper modelling of the mass of working fluid enclosed in the heat exchangers is of primary importance. The goal of this work is to develop such a reliable charge-sensitive ORC model. To this end. a 2kWe recuperative ORC system is used as case study and experimental measurements are used as reference dataset. The ORC system features two brazed plate heat exchangers and one fin coil condenser. For these three heat exchangers. a large set of empirical correlations is investigated in order to evaluate both the fluids void fractions and their convective heat transfer coefficients. By comparing the models predictions with the experimental data. the study highlights the limitations of existing correlations and investigates three different correction methods to improve them. Ultimately. the analysis compares nine models of brazed plate heat exchangers. two models of condenser. three correction methods for improving the heat transfer correlations and four void fraction methods. Accounting for every combination possible. 288 different models of the ORC are compared for predicting both the heat exchangers thermal performance and the total mass enclosed in the ORC unit.

1106283,Experimental Validation of Heat Transport Modelling in Large Solar Thermal Plants,2020,Kevin Sartor and Rémi Dickes,13,Energies,9,2343,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Solar thermal plants are often considered as a convenient and environmentally friendly way to supply heat to buildings or low temperature industrial processes. Some modelling techniques are required to assess the dynamic behaviour of solar thermal plants in order to control them correctly. This aspect is reinforced while large plants are considered. Indeed. some atmospheric conditions. such as local clouds. could have significant influence on the outlet temperature of the solar field. A common modelling approach to assess the heat transport in pipes is the one-dimensional finite volume method. However. previous work shows limitations in the assessment of the temperatures and in the computational time required for simulating large pipe networks. In this contribution. a previous alternative method developed and validated in a district heating network is used and extended to a solar thermal plant considering the thermal solar gain and the inertia of the pipes.

This model is used to better estimate the various sources of losses during the solar energy conversion and to investigate potential means of performance improvements.

The present study investigates a unique type of Kalina process called the Split-cycle. applied to the exhaust heat recovery from large marine engines. In the Split-cycle. the working fluid concentration can be changed during the evaporation process in order to improve the match between the heat source and working fluid temperatures. We present a system analysis to identify the governing mechanisms of the process. including a comparison of the efficiency of the Split-cycle and a conventional Kalina cycle and an investigation of the effects of using reheat in both …,True,PWc_LW8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,72,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544213009213,3764913868771342231,/scholar?cites=3764913868771342231,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.869.3530&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Finally. those simulations results are analyzed and the Rankine cycle and turbocompound are the two most profitable solutions. However the simulations of the turbocompound shows its limitations because the impact on the exhaust pressure drop is not taken into account in the assessment of the car fuel consumption.

Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) brings a possibility to produce electrical energy from heat. originally intended to be released to the surroundings. For ORC systems with power output up to 10 kW. small-scale turbines are still expensive to manufacture and their use can be problematic in terms of high shaft speed or quality of inlet vapor. It is therefore preferable to use positive displacement expanders. The first part of this paper presents and analyses the measurements conducted on a prototype of vane expander. This vane expander characterized by a 1 kW power output operates in an ORC heat engine that uses hexamethyldisiloxane as a working fluid. The expander inlet temperature varies approximately from 135 C to 150 C. inlet pressure varies approximately from 200 to 300 kPa abs. isentropic efficiency from 0.4 to 0.58. The second part of the paper proposes a grey-box model. which is calibrated on the base of the measured data. This lumped-parameter model takes into consideration major losses of the expander: supply and discharge pressure losses. under and over-expansion. internal leakages and mechanical losses.

1106321,On the design of waste heat recovery organic Rankine cycle systems for engines of long-haul trucks,2017,Ludovic Guillaume,,,,,,[en] The reduction of CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activities is a strategic goal of the EU in which heavy duty vehicles can contribute in a relevant way. A promising solution is the recovery of the thermal energy initially wasted by the engine. which represents around 60% of the combustion energy. Transforming this heat into mechanical or electrical energy will thus increase the engine thermal efficiency. The conversion can be performed by means of a thermodynamic cycle (eg organic or non-organic Rankine cycles) using the waste heat as energy source. as it has already been developed in large stationary applications. Depending on the operating conditions. fuel consumption. and hence CO2 emissions. can theoretically be reduced by 10% to 15%.Nonetheless. the adoption of such technology in the automotive domain requires specific R&D activities to select the working fluid. the components and the most appropriate system architecture in order to achieve sustainable costs and the required level of reliability. while the transient nature of the heat sources available on the truck must be taken into account to evaluate the resulting fuel economy.

The increase in oil prices compels manufacturers to focus on new solutions to improve fuel efficiency of truck powertrain such as Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS). Over last few years a lot of studies have proven that there are a lot of hurdles (cooling margin. expansion machines.…) for a perfect match of such a system on a vehicle. The objective of this study is to define an optimal WHRS for a heavy duty vehicle.The results presented hereafter are obtained thanks to steady state modeling. Two kinds of simulations will be used for this study. Simple thermodynamic simulations for the comparison of several fluids then a more complex model will be presented in the second part. This part will be more focused on the expansion machine and Rankine cycle arrangement choice thanks to the evaluation of fuel economy for each concept. The fuel savings will be determined by reducing real driving cycle to a relevant number of steady state operating points weighting by their fraction of operating type over the cycle. In the first part a comparison of the net output power (Shaft Power minus Pump consumption) and the cycle efficiency is done for several fluids in order to choose the best one from a performance and environmental point of view.

This paper focuses on an expander of a truck-embedded ORC system. The considered expander is a roots machine. The roots machine is a volumetric machine characterized by a theoretical internal volume ratio of 1. It is typically used as compressor under low pressure ratios (for instance. engine supercharging or air “blowers”). First. a test rig has been built to perform several tests on the volumetric machine. It is an ORC power system with a typical architecture using R245fa as working fluid (and 5% in mass oil fraction). heated oil as heat source and tap water as heat sink. Maps presenting produced powers. filling factors and isentropic efficiencies versus on one side the pressure ratio (from 1.2 to 4.5) and on the other side the shaft rotational speed (from 1000 to 11000 RPM) are investigated. The maximal delivered power is slightly above 3 kW. Concerning the filling factor the range is between 0.85 and 2.75 and the isentropic efficiency reaches a maximum about 50%. Wet expansions are envisaged leading to a deterioration of the performance. From the experimental data. a semi-empirical model is calibrated. This model is able to extrapolate the performance outside the experimental operating conditions and identify the different loss sources. Moreover. effects of overheat level and lubricating oil are also envisaged. The actual tested machine does not have an internal volumetric ratio strictly equal to 1 but is slightly larger.

To avoid imposing the condenser subcooling (or any other equivalent state variable). the ORC model should account for the mass repartition of working fluid through the unit in function of the operating conditions. Among the various components constituting ORC power systems. the proper modelling of the mass of working fluid enclosed in the heat exchangers is of primary importance. The goal of this work is to develop such a reliable charge-sensitive ORC model. To this end. a 2kWe recuperative ORC system is used as case study and experimental measurements are used as reference dataset. The ORC system features two brazed plate heat exchangers and one fin coil condenser. For these three heat exchangers. a large set of empirical correlations is investigated in order to evaluate both the fluids void fractions and their convective heat transfer coefficients. By comparing the models predictions with the experimental data. the study highlights the limitations of existing correlations and investigates three different correction methods to improve them. Ultimately. the analysis compares nine models of brazed plate heat exchangers. two models of condenser. three correction methods for improving the heat transfer correlations and four void fraction methods.

Despite these rather good efficiencies in comparison with smaller ICEs. a large amount of heat is wasted to the ambient in the engine coolant circuit. in the exhaust gas and in the exhaust gas recirculation cooler. These different heat sources differ by their capacities and levels of temperatures. In order to meet the upcoming international CO2 regulations and in order to increase the competitiveness of transportation by trucks. truck industry is currently investigating the technical and economical feasibility of waste heat recovery by means of Organic Rankine Cycle heat engines.

In the recent years. carbon dioxide has increased its market share in the field of commercial refrigeration and has proven to be a viable solution for the replacement of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) systems. This success is mainly due to the ongoing technological evolution of carbon dioxide refrigeration systems. In the present paper. a CO2 commercial refrigeration unit serving a supermarket located in Northern Italy is presented. The unit consists of a booster compressor rack with parallel compression. with ten compressors arranged to provide around 20 kW cooling capacity at low temperature and 90 kW cooling capacity at medium temperature. Four out of ten compressors. provided by Frascold®. are arranged in parallel. The installation. in addition to the cooling load. provides all the thermal functions in one unit: it integrates a heat exchanger for the air conditioning and the possibility of two stage heat recovery. for sanitary hot water production and for space heating. The refrigeration unit is equipped with pressure and temperature sensors. power consumption and load analysers for the compressors. A computer model has been developed to evaluate the acquired data of the system and to analyse the key parameters. The preliminary results from the monitoring of this unit are presented in this paper and used to calibrate the model of the system.

In these cases. secondary pollutant emissions control measures are most of the time not economically viable and primary emissions control must be used alone to avoid the formation of undesired compounds such as NOx and SOx. Primary control measures require the careful optimization of fuel quality and combustion process.

This kind of model is particularly useful when modeling 1D heat exchangers or piping. eg. in thermodynamic cycles involving a phase change. Issues. such as chattering or stiff systems. can lead to low simulation speed. instabilities and simulation failures. In the particular case of two-phase flow models. they are usually linked to a discontinuity in the density derivative between the liquid and two-phase zones. In this work. several methods to tackle numerical problems are developed. described. implemented and compared. In addition. methods available in the literature are also implemented and compared to the proposed approaches. Results suggest that the robustness of the models can be significantly increased with these different methods. at the price of a small increase of the error in the mass and energy balances.

Some modelling methods are required to consider the dynamic behaviour of district heating networks to design them correctly. spare the investment costs and limit the heat losses related to the use of a too high operating temperatures. For the same reasons. the DHN control or retrofit of installations also requires the assessment of the DHN dynamic behaviour. To achieve this. the heat transport in DHN. which is one of the key issues in the behaviour of a whole centralized heating system. has to be correctly modelled.

This health parameter estimation makes use of the analytical redundancy of an engine model and therefore implies the knowledge of the engine state. As the latter is a priori not known the second task is therefore an engine state variable estimation. State variables here designate working conditions such as inlet temperature. pressure. Mach number. rotational speeds. … Estimation of the state variables constitutes a general application of the Extended Kalman Filter theory. while the health parameter estimation is a classical recurrent regression problem.

1106348,A comparative study for simulating heat transport in large district heating network,2015,Kevin Sartor and David Thomas and Pierre Dewallef,,Proceedings of ECOS 2015,,,,Nowadays. district heating networks (DHN) are a convenient. economic and environmental-friendly way to supply heat to a large amount of buildings connected to a central heating plant. However. the control of such a system becomes challenging if the total length of the network reaches several kilometres. Indeed. in this case. the travel time of the information into the system is close to several hours. One solution consists in instrumenting all the parts of the network and performing a closed loop control to optimize the temperature and the mass flow rate supplied to every single consumption point. However this solution is generally expensive and difficult to implement in existing networks. What is proposed in this paper is to dynamically model the heat waves in the network to determine the temperatures and mass flow rates at some key locations. Coupled to predictive models of the thermal demand of the buildings connected to the network. it will be possible to determine when and how the heating plant must inject power to satisfy or anticipate heat demand of the district heating and to perform energy savings. For example. if too important amount of energy is supplied to the network. a higher pipe temperature is achieved in the network which leads to more important heat losses. To overcome this. the model has to consider the ambient losses and the thermal inertia of the pipe. Indeed. this last effect is often neglected even if it induces some delays in the heat transport.In this contribution. a preliminary study is performed to check the possibility to use the onedimensional finite volume method implemented in the Modelica platform to simulate heat waves …,True,qkoHWN4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,24,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/183406/1/ECOS%2052429%20-%20Sartor%20Kevin%20-%20reviewed%20article.pdf,12102484085054534755,/scholar?cites=12102484085054534755,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/183406/1/ECOS%2052429%20-%20Sartor%20Kevin%20-%20reviewed%20article.pdf,0,0,0

In this context. many research efforts are intended to dynamically adapt the maintenance planning based on the actual engine health condition. rather than using a fixed schedule based on the number of running hours. Monitoring the engine health condition can be carried out by observing the drifts from some reference values of a set of measurements performed onboard.

In this paper. a detailed overall ORC simulation model is presented based on two solution strategies: condenser subcooling and total working fluid charge of the system. The latter allows the subcooling level to be predicted rather than specified as an input. The overall cycle model is composed of independent models for pump. expander. line sets. liquid receiver and heat exchangers. Empirical and semi-empirical models are adopted for the pump and expander. respectively. A generalized steady-state moving boundary method is used to model the heat exchangers. The line sets and liquid receiver are used to better estimate the total charge of the system and pressure drops. Finally. the individual components are connected to form a cycle model in an object-oriented fashion. The solution algorithm includes a preconditioner to guess reasonable values for the evaporating and condensing temperatures and a main cycle solver loop which drives to zero a set of residuals to ensure the convergence of the solution.

For a suitable choice of working fluid. the setting of its evaporation pressure is crucial for the performance of an ORC installation. The higher the evaporation pressure. the higher the cycle efficiency on the one hand. but the lower the energy recovered from the heat source due to a higher outlet temperature on the other hand.

1106380,Comprehensive Model of a Single-screw Expander for ORC-Systems,2014,Davide Ziviani and Ian Bell and Martijn van den Broek and Michel De Paepe,,,,,,The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system is considered one of the leading technologies for waste heat recovery applications. In order to increase the overall efficiency. design improvements and optimization analyses are necessary. The expander is the key component to convert the thermal energy in useful work. Several volumetric and turbine expanders have been investigated. Among volumetric machines. scroll. twin-screw and vane-type expanders are the main technologies. Recently. a number of experimental studies on single-screw expanders (SSE) have been carried out. demonstrating the feasibility of employing such machine as an ORC expander. The single screw configuration presents a number of advantages over twin screw including balanced loading of the main screw. long working life. high volumetric efficiency. In this paper. a detailed geometry-based multi-chamber model of a single-screw expander is presented. The model is based on a rotation-dependent function that entirely describes the geometry of the engaging surface between the screw rotor and the star wheels. The computation of the swept volume at each angular step and the inlet conditions. enables the solution of the system of differential equations governing the thermodynamic problem. The level of details of the model. which includes heat transfer losses. oil-flooded mixing and leakage paths calculation. allows the investigation of the impact of design changes to the expander machine performance. The validation of the proposed model is realized with experimental data obtained from an ORC set up which employs a SSE and Solkatherm as working fluid.,True,gPdAtg0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,11,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/icec/2357/,9957961512220903733,/scholar?cites=9957961512220903733,,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3356&context=icec,0,0,0

In particular. single-screw expanders have shown some potential due to their symmetric and balanced configuration that decreases the loads on the bearings. A comprehensive characterization of this type of machine with two working fluids. i.e.. SES36 and R245fa. has been carried out in a previous work [1].

The combination of CFD and the material model makes it possible to assess the risk of moisture related damage in valuable objects for cases with large temperature or humidity gradients in the air. To couple both models the choice was made to integrate the porous material model into the CFD package. This requires the heat and moisture transport equations in the air and the porous material to be written down in function of the same transported variables. Validation with benchmark experiments proved the good functionality of the coupled model.

In this study the effect of punching delta winglet vortex generators into the louvered fin surface in the near wake region of each tube was numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The delta winglets serve to reduce the size of the tube wakes. They cause three important mechanisms of heat transfer enhancement. First. due to the swirling motion of the generated vortices. hot air is removed from the tube wake to the mainstream regions and vice versa. Second. the induced wall-normal flow locally thins the boundary layer. which also enhances the heat transfer. Third. the size of the wake zones is reduced because the flow separation from the tube surface is delayed. This also results in a reduced form drag of the tube surface.

In these gas turbines the heat of the exhaust gases is used to produce steam. This steam is injected in the combustion chamber. resulting in a high specific power and a high thermal efficiency. A major disadvantage of steam injected gas turbines is the large water consumption. Placing a condenser in the cycle makes it possible to recover all the injected steam.

The heat transfer during hydrogen and methane combustion is compared examining the effects of the compression ratio. ignition timing and mixture richness. Less cyclic and spatial variation in the heat flux traces are observed when burning hydrogen. which can be correlated to the faster burn rate. The peak heat flux increases with the compression ratio. but the total cycle heat loss can decrease due to less heat transfer at the end of the expansion stroke.

The 2D flow field of a standard transonic turbine stator is simulated using the state-of-the-art inviscid ZFLOW computational fluid-dynamic solver coupled with a fluid property library containing the thermodynamic models. The considered thermodynamic models are. in order of increasing complexity. the polytropic ideal-gas (PIG) law. the Peng–Robinson–Stryjek–Vera (PRSV) cubic equation of state. and the highly accurate multiparameter equations of state (MPEoSs). which are adopted as benchmark reference.

The combination of a very complex fuel-processing plant and a combined cycle power station leads to challenging problems as far as dynamic operation is concerned. Dynamic performance is extremely relevant because recent developments in the electricity market push toward an ever more flexible and varying operation of power plants. A dynamic model of the entire system and models of its sub-systems are indispensable tools in order to perform computer simulations aimed at process and control design.

This can lead to inaccurate predictions for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) turbines. which operate partly in the nonideal thermodynamic region. The objective of this work is to evaluate the influence of different equations of state (EoS) on the computed aerodynamic performance and the test case is a 2D nozzle blade of an existing ORC turbine operated with the siloxane MDM as working fluid. Three different fluid models are considered. the simple polytropic ideal gas law. the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera cubic EoS and the state-of-the-art Span-Wagner EoS. A comparison of the computed Mach number and pressure coefficient distribution along the blade as well as the outlet flow angles. mass flows and loss estimations for both design and off-design operating conditions is presented. The fluid dynamic results are very similar for the computations employing the Span-Wagner and Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera EoS.

Ideal-gas and dense-gas expansions are analyzed. using the polytropic ideal gas and Van der Waals thermodynamic models to compute the properties of the fluid. In these equations. the number of active degrees of freedom of the molecule is made explicit and it is taken as a measure of molecular complexity. The obtained results are subsequently verified using highly accurate multiparameter equations of state. For isentropic expansions. the Mach number does not depend on the molecular weight of the fluid but only on its molecular complexity and pressure ratio.

A predictive thermodynamic model is used to compute the relevant mixture properties. including its critical point coordinates and the local value of the fundamental derivative of gasdynamics Γ. The considered model is the improved Peng-Robinson Stryjek-Vera cubic equation of state. complemented by the Wong-Sandler mixing rules. A finite thermodynamic region is found where the non-linearity parameter Γ is negative and therefore nonclassical gasdynamics phenomena are admissible. A non monotone dependence of Γ on the mixture composition is observed in the case of binary mixtures of siloxane and perfluorocarbon fluids. with the minimum value of Γ in the mixture being always larger than that of its more complex component. The observed dependence indicates that non-ideal mixing has a strong influence on the gasdynamics behaviour—either classical or nonclassical—of the mixture.

1106480,Supercritical ORC turbogenerators coupled with linear solar collectors,2011,Emiliano Casati and Piero Colonna and Nawin R Nannan,5,Proceedings of the ISES solar world congress,,4056-4068,,The modern development of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants worldwide started with the first oil crisis in the early 70’s. and peaked with the nine commercial SEGS plants built in the Mojave Desert in California. with an average yearly direct normal insolation (DNI) up to 2727 kWh/m2 year. between 1984 and 1990 (Fernández-García et al.. 2010). It is mainly because of these installations that plants based on parabolic trough collectors (PTC) are the most mature and cost-effective CSP technology (Price et al.. 2002). Several other solar power plants of this kind are currently being built. Another option for line-focus concentrators to which consistent R&D efforts are being devoted involves linear Fresnel collectors. This technology has the potential of significantly reducing the cost of the solar field. which constitutes the largest share of the total initial investment and the cost with the highest margin for reduction (Pitz-Paal et al. 2007). Linear Fresnel collectors are now in the pre-commercial stage (Mills. 2004).In conventional solar thermal power plants a heat transfer fluid (HTF. typically synthetic oil) is used in a closed loop to carry the thermal energy over to the working fluid of the steam Rankine cycle power system.

This type of flow can occur in expanders of organic Rankine cycle power plants. In order to study NICFD. a Ludwieg tube-type facility has been designed and constructed at Delft University of Technology. A large variety of fluids can be employed in the facility. but for this study D6 siloxane is chosen as working fluid due to its high thermal stability and the possibility of encountering non-classical gasdynamic phenomena. This compound belongs to the siloxane class. which are also used as working fluids in ORC power systems.

The potential for the conversion into electricity of the thermal power coming from liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs. waste heat from primary engines or industrial processes. biomass combustion. and concentrated solar radiation is arguably enormous. ORC technology is possibly the most flexible in terms of capacity and temperature level. and is currently often the only applicable technology for the conversion of external thermal energy sources. In addition. ORC power systems are suitable for the cogeneration of heating and/or cooling. another advantage in the framework of distributed power generation. Related research and development is therefore very lively.

Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems stand out in terms of reliability and cost-effectiveness. and have demonstrated their advantages compared to steam power plants [1. 2]. Since the first examples of implementations. ORC power plants proved suitable for the conversion of thermal energy into electricity even for very low power capacity. down to few kWe [3. 1. 2. 4]. These small systems are often referred to as mini-ORC (mORC) power plants. However. the most successful commercial applications have been deployed in a much larger power size. ranging from hundreds of kWe up to approximately 5 MWe. and these systems represent now the state of the art of this technology. Nonetheless. many researchers in the ORC field are still investigating the development of mORC modules for a variety of applications: the interested reader is referred to Ref. [5] for a thorough review. The expanding device constitutes the critical component of any small power system and. in the case of those working according to the Rankine cycle. this constitutes one of the motivations driving the interest towards the ORC concept. The adoption of molecularly complex and heavy working fluids. instead of steam. primarily allows fundamental simplifications of the turboexpander design [1. 2]. In case of mORC systems with power output lower than (say) 10 kWe. it is disputable which. among turbomachinery and volumetric machines. offers the best …,True,SXsfhf4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/781329,,,,,0,0,0

Limited success has been achieved due to difficulty in obtaining suboptimal targets to which the antibody has enough affinity to bind while at the same time having lower levels of affinity in comparison to the target to facilitate displacement. Aptamers are synthetic oligonucleotides specifically selected to bind a certain target. Thanks to their high affinity and sensitivity. aptamers appear as alternative candidates to antibodies for analytical devices and several enzyme-linked aptamer assays and aptasensors have been reported.

Cholesterol is generally important as a component in the membranes of liposome drug delivery systems due to its stabilizing effects in vivo.

The zinc ionophore activity was demonstrated as the capacity of polyphenols to transport zinc cations across the liposome membrane and increase the zinc-specific fluorescence of the encapsulated fluorophore FluoZin-3. In addition. the zinc chelation strength of the polyphenols was also tested in a competition assay based on the fluorescence quenching of zinc-dependent fluorescence emitted by zinc–FluoZin-3 complex.

Venomous animals produce an enormous variety of peptide toxins with high affinity for specific ion channels and receptors. The mammalian prototoxin lynx1 shares with α-bungarotoxin the ability to bind and modulate nicotinic receptors (nAChRs); however. lynx1 is tethered to the membrane via a GPI anchor. We show here that several classes of neurotoxins. including bungarotoxins and cobratoxins. retain their selective antagonistic properties when tethered to the membrane.

1106636,Biomedical applications of peptide nanostructures,2016,Melis Şardan Ekiz,,,,,,Nature as an important inspirational source for scientists presents complex and elegant examples for adaptive and intelligent systems created by self-assembly. There has been a great endeavour for understanding these sophisticated systems and self assembly gives us an opportunity to emulate these systems by customized molecular designs. In this thesis. next-generation biomaterials were developed by integrating peptide amphiphile molecules into sugar. lipid or inorganic based materials through covalent or noncovalent interactions and their biomedical applications were investigated. Peptide amphiphiles can form morphologically different supramolecular nanostructures based on the amino acid sequence they bear. Also. a bioactive amino acid sequence can be inserted into the peptide backbone not only to enhance the biocompatibility of the material but also to direct cellular responses. On the other hand. amphiphilic character of peptide amphiphiles enables to interact with other amphiphilic molecules or hydrophobic surfaces via hydrophobic interactions. In the scope of the present thesis. peptide based systems were utilized in three different biomedical applications: drug delivery. bioimaging and regenerative medicine. In the first chapter. the self-assembly as one of the iv bottom-up approaches. peptide self-assembly. the forces and factors triggering the peptide assembly. the importance of peptide amphiphile design in the resulting nanostructure and the biomedical applications of peptide amphiphiles are shortly introduced.

In order to remove or reduce the harmful effects of carbon black used as a filler material. the effects of polymers obtained by using some biological wastes such as shelf-life passed milk instead of carbon black on the physical and mechanical properties of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber have been investigated. Moving Die Rheometer and Soxhlet extraction tests were applied to the obtained compound and the results were evaluated. MDR test results showed that the scorch time of the samples increased by 10% SP filler. and Soxhlet test results were in line with MDR test. Mechanical analysis showed that the addition of casein polymer improved the elongation at break values of the samples. The tests were concluded that the best resulting sample is 10% SP. FTIR result shows that the casein polymer is chemically bonded to the EPDM rubber. The results showed that the prepared bio-based filler could be used as an alternative and non-hazardous filler.,True,mmooJzAAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/iarej/issue/38845/399235,,,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/522667,0,0,0

Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) culture have improved the ability of in vitro culture to replicate in vivo conditions. Although 3D cultures still cannot achieve the complexity of the in vivo environment. they can still better replicate the cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions of solid tumors. Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are three-dimensional (3D) clusters of cells with tumor-like features such as oxygen gradients and drug resistance. and represent an important translational tool for cancer research. Accordingly. natural and synthetic polymers. including collagen. hyaluronic acid. Matrigel®. polyethylene glycol (PEG). alginate and chitosan. have been used to form and study MCTS for improved clinical translatability. This review evaluates the current state of biomaterial-based MCTS formation. including advantages and disadvantages of the different biomaterials and their recent applications to the field of cancer research. with a focus on the past five years.

1106734,Activating the Intrinsic Pathway of Apoptosis Using BIM BH3 Peptides Delivered by Peptide Amphiphiles with Endosomal Release,2019,Mathew R Schnorenberg and Joseph A Bellairs and Ravand Samaeekia and Handan Acar and Matthew V Tirrell and James L LaBelle,12,Materials,16,2567,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Therapeutic manipulation of the BCL-2 family using BH3 mimetics is an emerging paradigm in cancer treatment and immune modulation. For example. peptides mimicking the BIM BH3 helix can directly target the full complement of anti-and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins to trigger apoptosis. This study has incorporated the potent BH3 α-helical death domain of BIM into peptide amphiphile (PA) nanostructures designed to facilitate cellular uptake and induce cell death. This study shows that these PA nanostructures are quickly incorporated into cells. are able to specifically bind BCL-2 proteins. are stable at physiologic temperatures and pH. and induce dose-dependent apoptosis in cells. The incorporation of a cathepsin B cleavable linker between the BIM BH3 peptide and the hydrophobic tail resulted in increased intracellular accumulation and mitochondrial co-localization of the BIM BH3 peptide while also improving BCL-2 family member binding and apoptotic reactivation. This PA platform represents a promising new strategy for intracellular therapeutic peptide delivery for the disruption of intracellular protein: protein interactions.

Here. we report that oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 4 (ORP4) is a potential druggable precision target in ovarian cancer cells. ORP4 has limited expression in normal tissues and was recently recognized to be a cancer-specific driver of cellular proliferation. including in patient-isolated leukemias. We demonstrate that ORP4 is strongly expressed in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative natural product compound OSW-1 targets ORP4 and OSBP. Our results demonstrate that the OSW-1 compound has high antiproliferative potency in both monolayer and three-dimensional ovarian cancer spheroid models. especially compared to the standard …,True,NsmKgScAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C,0,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00207,,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00207,0,0,0

For instance. metal ions function as cofactors of enzymes and apatite mineralization in bone is driven by collagen nanofibers serve as both physical and chemical templates. These unique interactions in natural systems are examples for development of synthetic materials for many applications such as catalysts. artificial enzymes or materials for regenerative medicine etc. Manufacturing a catalyst at the nanoscale is important due to increased specific surface area and reduced diffusion path length. In this thesis. we demonstrated peptide based bioinspired nanomaterials. The self-assembled peptide nanofibers were utilized as templates for palladium nanoparticle formation. Functionalization of insoluble electrospun nanofibers with a heavy metal binding peptide sequence was utilized to remove toxic metal ions from water.

These peptides were utilized in fabrication of nanostructured materials. ALPs with amino (Ac-KFFAAK-Am) and carboxylate (Ac-EFFAAE-Am) functional groups were used in growth of titanium dioxide (titania) in solution. On the other hand. PA with amino group (lauryl-VVAGK-Am) was used in growth of titania by atomic layer deposition method. Obtained nanostructured titania in each case was used in construction of dye-sensitized solar cells. Peptide amphiphile with phytochelatin mimetic sequence and adamantyl functionality (ADAc-6-Ahx-GECECECG-Am) was used in noncovalent functionalization of electrospun hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) mesh; HPβCD mesh functionalized with peptide was further used in metal ion scavenging. PA with sequence lauryl-VVAGH-Am was used in noncovalent encapsulation of zinc phthalocyanine derivative. New photophysical properties of encapsulated chromophore were studied and ultrafast energy transfer was observed. L and D peptide amphiphiles (L/D-pyrenebutyryl-6-Ahx-VVAGH-Am and L/D-lauryl-VVAGH-Am) were used to induce chiral organization of achiral chromophore (pyrene) in self-assembled nanofibers of PAs.

The voltammetric response of immobilized Cyt c−A is quasi-reversible and very stable with time. Addition of competitive guests. such as 1-adamantamol. results in the disappearance of the signal. In the presence of 4.4‘-bipyridine. the quasi-reversible redox response changed to give the characteristic signal of a surface confined redox couple. Experiments in the presence of electroactive probes such as Ru(NH3)63+ and 1.2-naphthoquinone resulted in a decrease of the signal intensity of the probe and shifted the half-wave potential to more positive values.

The CNO-modified surfaces were characterized by ESEM and AFM microscopy as well as by electrochemical techniques.

In this study. we tried to develop PEG (polyethylene glycol)/cholesterol-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver the Astragaloside VII (AST-VII) and potentiate adjuvant properties of AST-VII for the influenza vaccine. In the formation of PEG/cholesterol/AST-VII-based LNPs (PEG300: Chol-AST-VII LNPs). 3 different primary solvents (acetone. ethanol. and chloroform) were evaluated. employing their effects on hydrodynamic particle size. distribution. surface chemistry. and colloidal stability. Prepared nanoparticles were simply admixtured with inactivated influenza antigen (H3N2) and applied to PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-ionomycin treated human whole blood to evaluate their cytokine release profile.

The main goals of this thesis are synthesis of immunologically active analogs of AST VII and identifying immunomodulatory mechanism of actions of AST VII. The impact of AST VII and its synthesized analogs (dicarboxylic AST VII: DC-AST VII and dodecylamine conjugated AST VII: DAC-AST VII) on the cytokine release profile of human whole blood cells (hWB). dendritic cell maturation and subsequently T cell activation were analyzed by using flow cytometry and ELISA. IL-1 and IL-17A cytokines were substantially induced on hWB following treatments of the compounds. The most potent compounds were: DAC-AST VII (3.32 fold) for production of IL-1. AST VII (5.05 fold) for production of IL-17A. AST VII was more effective than DAC-AST VII (7.52 fold versus 1.34) in IL-1 production in BMDCs (bone marrow derived dendritic cells). The co-stimulation with AST VII and LPS enhanced dendritic cell maturation and activation by upregulating MHC II. CD86 and CD80. as well as IL-12 induction. All compounds were able to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells via increasing CD44 expression. Inflammasome activation may have a role in AST VII induced IL-1 secretion. dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation.

Results  Addition of 0.8% and 1.6% AgNPs in microwave-polymerized resin significantly decreased the transverse strength and elastic modulus. In terms of impact strength. the addition of AgNPs has no effect on both resin groups. Glass transition temperature (Tg) was decreased with the addition of AgNPs for both denture base resins.  Conclusions  The incorporation of AgNPs. generally used for antimicrobial efficiency. affected the transverse strength of the denture base acrylic resins depending on the concentration of nanoparticles.

Ingestion of heavy metal contaminated vegetables is one of the primary ways in which these elements get access to human body. Thus. it is a necessity to analyse heavy metal levels in crops and agricultural soils. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of heavy metals in vegetables and agricultural soil samples and to calculate bioconcentration factors of samples from the abandoned mining district.

The most common vegetables used in the local human diet were collected from Gemikonagi (n= 7) and Dipkarpaz (n= 7) with 7 agricultural topsoil samples from each region and they were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. According to the results obtained. it was seen that malva samples had the highest mean concentration of heavy metals in both Gemikonagi and Dipkarpaz (718.53 mg/kg and 240.47 mg/kg. respectively). In both regions. the highest mean heavy metal concentration in soil was Fe (Gemikonagi; 25073.74 mg/kg and Dipkarpaz; 15061.58 mg/kg). In accordance with the obtained data. it was found that Cr accumulation in lettuce grown in Dipkarpaz is the only Bioconcentration Factor value that is above the limit.

Each retailer faces external dynamic demand and is controlled by a deterministic order-up-to level policy requiring that the supplier raise the retailer's inventory level to a predetermined maximum in each replenishment. The problem is deciding on when and in what sequence to visit the retailers such that systemwide inventory holding and routing costs are minimized.

1106950,Efficient formulations and a branch-and-cut algorithm for a production-routing problem,2010,Mirko Ruokokoski and OGUZ Solyali and Jean-François Cordeau and Raf Jans and Haldun Süral,,,,,GERAD,The production-routing problem can be seen as a combination of two well known combinatorial optimization problems: the lotsizing and the vehicle routing problems. The variant considered in this paper consists in designing a production schedule for an uncapacitated plant. replenishment schedules for multiple customers. and a set of routes for a single uncapacitated vehicle starting and ending at the plant. The aim of the problem is to fulfill the demand of the customers over a finite horizon such that the total cost of distribution. setups. and inventories is minimized. This paper introduces a basic mixed integer linear programming formulation and several strong reformulations of the problem. Two families of valid inequalities. 2-matching and generalized comb inequalities. are introduced to strengthen these formulations. and they are used within a branch-and-cut algorithm. Computational results on a large set of randomly generated instances are presented. Instances with up to 40 customers and 15 time periods or with 80 customers and 8 periods have been solved to optimality within a two-hour limit. The tests clearly indicate the effectiveness of the new formulations and of the valid inequalities. In addition. an uncoordinated approach is considered to demonstrate the benefits of the simultaneous optimization of production and distribution planning. The total cost increases on average by 47% when employing such an uncoordinated approach. Finally. a heuristic algorithm. based on defining an a priori tour for the vehicle routing part. is investigated. The heuristic algorithm shows an excellent performance.

1106961,Multidimensional assortment problem with an application,1999,Ashish Tripathy and Haldun Süral and Yigal Gerchak,33,Networks: An International Journal,3,239-245,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,This paper addresses the discrete multidimensional assortment problem. Assortment issues arise frequently in practice as an important design and inventory problem which simultaneously seeks the answers to two related questions: (a) Which items (or sizes of a product) to stock? (b) How much of each to stock? Its discrete multidimensional version concerns itself with choosing sizes from among a discrete set of possible ones with each size being characterized by more than one dimension. Our research is motivated by an application of the problem in the distribution center of a global manufacturer of telecommunications equipment where the goal was to standardize the sizes of three‐dimensional crates used to package finished items by selecting a few from among all crate sizes. The main contributions of this research are (1) modeling the assortment problem as a facility location problem.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW). capacitated vehicles must be routed to satisfy a set of transportation requests between given origins and destinations. In addition to capacity and time window constraints. vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries. This paper introduces two new formulations for the PDPTW and the closely related dial‐a‐ride problem (DARP) in which a limit is imposed on the elapsed time between the pickup and the delivery of a request. Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch‐and‐cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the PDPTW and the DARP. Instances with up to eight vehicles and 96 requests (194 nodes) have been solved to optimality. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals. Inc. NETWORKS.

While some side constraints such as maximum flight time and maintenance requirements involve only crews or aircraft. linking constraints impose minimum connection times for crews that depend on aircraft connections. To handle these linking constraints. a solution approach based on Benders decomposition is proposed. The solution process iterates between a master problem that solves the aircraft routing problem. and a subproblem that solves the crew pairing problem. Because of their particular structure. both of these problems are solved by column generation.

1106990,An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for two-echelon vehicle routing problems arising in city logistics,2012,Vera C Hemmelmayr and Jean-François Cordeau and Teodor Gabriel Crainic,,Computers & Operations Research,,,Pergamon,In this paper. we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the Two-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-VRP) and the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The 2E-VRP arises in two-level transportation systems such as those encountered in the context of city logistics. In such systems. freight arrives at a major terminal and is shipped through intermediate satellite facilities to the final customers. The LRP can be seen as a special case of the 2E-VRP in which vehicle routing is performed only at the second level. We have developed new neighborhood search operators by exploiting the structure of the two problem classes considered and have also adapted existing operators from the literature. The operators are used in a hierarchical scheme reflecting the multi-level nature of the problem.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The quay crane scheduling problem consists of determining a sequence of unloading and loading movements for cranes assigned to a vessel in order to minimize the vessel completion time as well as the crane idle times. Idle times originate from interferences between cranes since these roll on the same rails and a minimum safety distance must be maintained between them. The productivity of container terminals is often measured in terms of the time necessary to load and unload vessels by quay cranes. which are the most important and expensive equipment used in ports.

A variation of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). the VRP with Cross-Docking (VRPCD) arises in a number of logistics planning contexts. This paper addresses the VRPCD. where a set of homogeneous vehicles are used to transport orders from the suppliers to the corresponding customers via a cross-dock. The orders can be consolidated at the cross-dock but cannot be stored for very long because the cross-dock does not have long-term inventory-holding capabilities. The objective of the VRPCD is to minimize the total travel time while respecting time window constraints at the nodes and a time horizon for the whole transportation operation.

The parallel machine lot-sizing problem consists of finding the optimal timing and level of production and the best allocation of products to machines. In this paper. we look at how to incorporate parallel machines in a mixed-integer programming model when using commercial optimization software. More specifically. we look at the issue of symmetry.

The variant considered in this paper consists in designing a production schedule for an uncapacitated plant. replenishment schedules for multiple customers. and a set of routes for a single uncapacitated vehicle starting and ending at the plant. The aim of the problem is to fulfill the demand of the customers over a finite horizon such that the total cost of distribution. setups. and inventories is minimized. This paper introduces a basic mixed integer linear programming formulation and several strong reformulations of the problem. Two families of valid inequalities. 2-matching and generalized comb inequalities. are introduced to strengthen these formulations. and they are used within a branch-and-cut algorithm. Computational results on a large set of randomly generated instances are presented. Instances with up to 40 customers and 15 time periods or with 80 customers and 8 periods have been solved to optimality within a two-hour limit. The tests clearly indicate the effectiveness of the new formulations and of the valid inequalities. In addition. an uncoordinated approach is considered to demonstrate the benefits of the simultaneous optimization of production and distribution planning. The total cost increases on average by 47% when employing such an uncoordinated approach. Finally. a heuristic algorithm. based on defining an a priori tour for the vehicle routing part. is investigated. The heuristic algorithm shows an excellent performance.

In a planning horizon which consists of multiple periods. the inventory provides a link between the periods. This integration across time periods constitutes the first type of integration. The proposed model also considers the production of different types of items at three different levels: objects are fabricated or purchased and next cut into pieces which are then assembled into final products. The integration between these three production levels constitutes the second type of integration.

1107056,A hybrid approach for the capacitated lot sizing problem with setup carryover,2012,Hacer Guner Goren and Semra Tunali and Raf Jans,50,International Journal of Production Research,6,1582-1597,Taylor & Francis Group,The capacitated lot sizing problem with setup carryover deals with the issue of planning multiple products on a single machine. A setup can be carried over from one period to the next by incorporating the partial sequencing of the first and last product. This study proposes a novel hybrid approach by combining Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and a Fix-and-Optimise heuristic to solve the capacitated lot sizing problem with setup carryover. Besides this. a new initialisation scheme is suggested to reduce the solution space and to ensure a feasible solution. A comparative experimental study is carried out using some benchmark problem instances. The results indicate that the performance of the pure GAs improves when hybridised with the Fix-and-Optimise heuristic. Moreover. in terms of solution quality. promising results are obtained when compared with the recent results in the literature.,True,alFWqPoAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,36,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207543.2011.559486,4163688650151069760,/scholar?cites=4163688650151069760,,,0,0,0

This paper aims to fill the gap by introducing a general model for the assembly routing problem (ARP). which consists of simultaneously planning the assembly of a finished product at a plant and the routing of vehicles collecting materials from suppliers to meet the inventory requirements imposed by the production.

We specifically focus on modeling the binary conditions in the convexification approach to the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. For a general Binary Mixed Integer Programming problem. an extreme point of the overall problem does not necessarily correspond to an extreme point of the subproblem. Therefore. the binary conditions cannot in general be imposed on the new master problem variables but must be imposed on the original binary variables. In some cases. however. it is possible to impose the binary restrictions directly on the new master problem variables.

We examine the Lagrangean relaxation (LR) of demand constraints in a strong reformulation of the problem. We then design a primal heuristic to generate upper bounds and combine it with the LR problem within a subgradient optimization procedure.

For this reason. certain proposals for incorporating means for reducing setup costs into classical production-inventory models have been offered in recent years.

We address the potential endogeneity problem in the relationship and identify the possible causes of this endogeneity as:(i) firm level heterogeneity in financial returns.(ii) the relationship between firm’s productivity level and the marginal cost of sustainability initiatives. and (iii) measurement error. We implement Instrumental Variable (IV) technique to overcome these biases. Our results present empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that corporate sustainability is positively related (possibly causally) with corporate financial performance. We further find that sustainability initiatives are more costly for more productive companies; thus. they have less incentive to invest.

We formulate the problem as a multiperiod Markov decision process (MDP) and present a linear programming (LP) approximation that provides an upper bound on the optimal objective function value of the MDP model. We then present two solution approaches to the MDP using the LP solution: a static approach that uses the LP solution directly and a dynamic approach that adopts a revenue management perspective and employs bid‐price controls technique where the LP is resolved after each demand arrival.

A Wiley Company,In this article we present a novel technique for deriving the convex envelope of certain nonconvex fixed‐charge functions of the type that arise in several related applications that have been considered in the literature. One common attribute of these problems is that they involve choosing levels for the undertaking of several activities. Two or more activities share a common resource. and a fixed charge is incurred when any of these activities is undertaken at a positive level. We consider nonconvex programming formulations for these problems in which the fixed charges are expressed in the form of concave functions. With the use of the developed convex envelope results. we show that the convex envelope relaxations of the nonconvex formulations lead to the linear programming relaxations of the strong IP/MIP formulations of these problems.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,We consider a two‐level system in which a warehouse manages the inventories of multiple retailers. Each retailer employs an order‐up‐to level inventory policy over T periods and faces an external demand which is dynamic and known. A retailer's inventory should be raised to its maximum limit when replenished. The problem is to jointly decide on replenishment times and quantities of warehouse and retailers so as to minimize the total costs in the system. Unlike the case in the single level lot‐sizing problem. we cannot assume that the initial inventory will be zero without loss of generality. We propose a strong mixed integer program formulation for the problem with zero and nonzero initial inventories at the warehouse.

While previous research suggests that quality grading adds value. there are also concerns raised regarding how reliably the grades can be identified. We argue that uncertainty is inherent to the grading process and investigate the value of grading by taking into account the underlying uncertainty.

In this study. characteristics of a flash flood occurred in Morphou region in North Cyprus on 18th of January. 2010 are studied and some remedial measures are proposed. Hydrologic and hydraulic modeling of this flood event has been developed for decision-making concerning type and degree of implementation of these measures. Since there is no any stream flow gauging station along the creeks in the study area. the synthetic unit hydrograph is developed by using the US Soil Conversation Service method to obtain design flood hydrographs. Two remedial alternatives are eventually tested. Based on cost analyses. the one that is to build a detention basin for storing water and a lateral channel for diverting extra flow from Bostancı Creek to Fabrika Creek. is found to be feasible.

North Cyprus,2016,H Zaifoğlu and B Akıntuğ,,12th International Water Advances in Civil Engineering Conference,,21-23,,Floods are one of the most important natural disasters in recent years due to unplanned growing urbanization and the climate change which leads to increase in frequency of extreme rainfall events. In this study. the flood problem in industrial area of Nicosia (Lefkoşa) is examined with executing hydrological and hydraulic analysis. The study area which is approximately 4 km2 is divided into two major parts: The upper basin. mostly consist of rural areas with three sub-basins. and the lower basin which involves the main industrial area. First. historical storm events are investigated and the design-storm hyetograph is developed. Since. there are no runoff records for the basin. the US Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Method is employed in the estimation of synthetic unit hydrographs and design hydrographs are obtained.As a solution. the upper and the lower basins are disengaged by constructing detention basin together with diversion channel. By holding the surface runoff. detention basin protects the industrial area to be flooded. The diversion channel ensures that the flood wave do not pass over the crest of the detention basin and evacuates the excess water from the reservoir to the creek which is located at the east part of detention basin. The Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) is employed in order to simulate rainfall-runoff process and perform the hydraulic design for the urbanized lower basin. In the final solution. it is proposed that the stormwater runoff. collected over the industrial area should be discharged using a 3 m by 2 m box culvert to a nearby creek.,True,vOeJa7QAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hasan_Zaifoglu2/publication/314003289_Remedial_Measures_for_Flood_Problems_of_Nicosia_Industrial_Area_North_Cyprus/links/58b153d5a6fdcc6f03f67496/Remedial-Measures-for-Flood-Problems-of-Nicosia-Industrial-Area-North-Cyprus.pdf,13857779805600596569,/scholar?cites=13857779805600596569,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hasan_Zaifoglu2/publication/314003289_Remedial_Measures_for_Flood_Problems_of_Nicosia_Industrial_Area_North_Cyprus/links/58b153d5a6fdcc6f03f67496/Remedial-Measures-for-Flood-Problems-of-Nicosia-Industrial-Area-North-Cyprus.pdf,0,0,0

The assessment under different scenarios is carried out using Aqueduct Global Flood Analyzer in which all the analyses are based on the gross domestic product (GDP). population. and the present and future (2030) urban damage. In this study. to effectively estimate future changes. three scenarios were employed. namely. IPCC Scenario A2. the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenario which represents climate change. and the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenario which represents socio-economic change. All these scenarios were employed from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report. To determine current mean monthly precipitation. 1981–2010 data were used and Meteonorm V7 software was employed for the generation of the mean monthly precipitation from 2011 to 2100. The level of flood protection employed is a 10-year one which is used to identify the population at risk. the effects of this event on the GDP and to determine the rate at which urban damage is happening. Utilizing Meteonorm V7 software. average monthly precipitation is predicted. This study determined that. in any year. the majority of Zimbabwe has a low to medium (2–3% probability) flood occurrence in which a 10-year flood has a 10% occurrence probability in any given year.

In the stochastic approach. synthetic flow scenarios are generated and used for the analysis of complex events such as multi-year droughts. Conclusions drawn from such analyses are only plausible to the extent that the underlying time series model realistically represents the natural variability of flows.

In this research project. a class of model called Markov-Switching (MS) model (also referred to as a Hidden Markov model) is presented as an alternative to conventional ARMA models.

Markov Switching (MS) models have been suggested as a possible alternative to traditional time series models. MS models employ a Markov chain to simulate a state variable representing the climate regime. Within each climate regime. the hydrologic variable is described by a probability density function whose parameters depend on the state. To simulate realistic multi-year flow regimes. the MS model must be applied to annual data. However. in typical water resource studies. synthetic streamflow data are needed at sub-annual time steps. for example monthly.

Moreover. the heat capacity of the adsorbent bed and its shell should be low for the simple and heat recovery cycles and the adsorbent bed should be cooled down to the condensation temperature for all cases to achieve the highest possible COP.

A normalized model is presented and used to process the seasonal TRNSYS results to investigate the coincidence between the solar-supplied cooling power and cooling load as the relative sizes of the cooling system and storage are varied. The normalized model yields a seasonal solar fraction and seasonal loss fraction (the excess solar-supplied cooling lost to the environment due to insufficient storage).

Basic trends in performance were investigated as the following parameters were varied: system type (with or without heat recovery); incident radiation; maximum and minimum bed temperatures; condensation temperature; difference between condensation and minimum bed temperatures (bed excess temperature); bed’s dead mass; collector type (flat plate vs. evacuated tube); cooling tower type (wet vs. dry); cooling system size; and. storage size. Results for the conditions explored include the following. Steady-periodic simulations show that the system’s COP decreases with decreases in radiation and increases with minimum bed and condensation temperatures.

Practically. however. its process suffers from low yields. and the mechanism behind this failure is rather poorly understood. Here. we investigate a failure mechanism of polymer melt infiltration of vertical aligned (VA-) CNTs. In penetrating the VA-CNT interstices. polymer melts exert a capillarity-induced attractive force laterally on CNTs at the moving meniscus. leading to locally agglomerated macroscale bunches. Such a large configurational change can deform and distort individual CNTs so much as to cause buckling or breakdown of the alignment. In view of membrane manufacturing. this irreversible distortion of nanotubes is detrimental. as it could block the transport path of the membranes.

Pristine graphene in single-and polycrystallinity poses a unique diffusion barrier property for most of chemical species at broad ambient conditions.

For subcontinuum pores. both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments predict potential salt rejection to envisage a seawater desalination application.

1107177,Scaling the Mass Transport Enhancement through Carbon Nanotube Membranes,2018,Seul Youn and Jakob Buchheim and Mahesh Lokesh and Hyung Park,,,,,,Measuring and controlling enhanced mass transport in carbon nanotube (CNT) and membranes thereof have been of great interest and importance in fundamental studies of nanofluidics as well as practical applications including desalination and gas separation. Experiments and simulations have claimed nearly frictionless transport and attributed it to tight graphitic confinement. Nevertheless. rare and scattered experimental data are obscuring the transport efficiency limit and the mechanistic understanding of fluid transport through CNTs. Here we present a new fabrication process for a manifold membrane of reinforced CNTs. a method applicable to any type of CNT including single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) and extendable to various end-use-oriented matrix materials. Reaffirming the remarkable water and gas flow enhancement. we observe their strong correlation with the aspect ratio and the qualityof SWCNTs. leading to a new scaling for proper assessment of the enhanced mass transport through CNT membranes. As the result. we recognize the conceptual equivalence between the nearly frictionless CNT channel and the channel of infinitesimal length. an orifice. It is hoped that our work could correct the misleading message about the theoretical limit of flow enhancement to the readership. hence providing a valuable source of reference on designing and analyzing high-performance CNT membranes.,True,ScqdJJIAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01890716/,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01890716/document,0,0,0

Its outstanding electrical. thermal and mechanical properties enable new advances in science and engineering. Among other fields. membrane technology could greatly benefit from such an ultrathin material. Graphene displays extraordinary mechanical strength and molecular tightness in its pristine state. which render the material a perfect choice as a basis for subsequent pore formation. Due to the atomic thickness such membranes out of porous graphene are expected to impose minimal flow resistance. A successful transformation of graphene into a membrane. therefore. would be a change of paradigm in membrane science. since it would define the ultimate permeation limit.Here. the laboratory scale synthesis and first macroscopic mass transport characterization of such porous graphene membranes are described.

Two monolayers of graphene are transferred onto a porous support subsequently. which isolates the leak tight. freestanding graphene double layer.

To replace the far field detector traditionally used to detect surface plasmons we integrate a near field detector below a functionalized gold film.

Experimental results also indicated that the FEB etch process is governed by the electron-stimulated desorption of oxygen from the SiO2 matrix. and subsequently rate limited by XeF2 availability. Based on experimental evidence and existing literature. a simple. two-step model was introduced to qualitatively describe the etch mechanism. The model involves a cyclical process. which is initiated by the reduction of a surface layer of SiO2 to elemental silicon.

The resultant length scale was correlated to the transport and instability growths that occur during the liquid lifetime of the melted copper rings. For 13-nm-thick rings. a change in the nanoparticle spacing with the ring width is attributed to a transition from a Raleigh−Plateau instability to a thin film instability because of competition between the cumulative transport and instability timescales. To explore the competition between instability mechanisms further. we carried out experiments with 7-nm-thick rings.

Carrier type control in multilayer WSe2 FET devices with Cr/Au contacts is initially demonstrated by modulating the WSe2 thickness. The carrier type evolves with increasing WSe2 channel thickness. being p-type. ambipolar. and n-type at thicknesses <3. ∼4. and >5 nm. respectively.

Antioxidant activity was evaluated by the DPPH (2.2-diphenyl-1-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical-scavenging method. while a bioassay method was carried out to study acute toxicity in Artemia salina L. Physical-chemical and functional characteristics of GAP support its potential role in the food and pharmaceutical industries. GAP was photostable under UV irradiation. In vitro GAP antioxidant evaluation showed that it bears free radical-scavenging activity for DPPH radicals. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of GAP was 239.4 mg∙mL−1. indicating that this biopolymer is nontoxic. Such results indicate that this biopolymer presents characteristics of neutrality. photostability. and nontoxicity that are commercially attractive.,True,dpI-O-YAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C,5,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijps/2018/1385830/abs/,7511887027559386412,/scholar?cites=7511887027559386412,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijps/2018/1385830/abs/,0,0,0

We show that the most influential component of device design is the ratio between the area of the gate electrode and the active channel. while the spacing between these components and their individual shapes has a negligible contribution. These findings provide much needed guidance in device design intended for ionotronic gating with ionic liquids.,True,CyzPiiUAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC,9,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4974485,1472837953318713702,/scholar?cites=1472837953318713702,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4974485,0,0,0

A strong photocurrent resonance peak is observed at 1060 nm (1.17 eV). likely attributed to indirect optical transitions in few-layer PdSe2. More interestingly. when the thickness of PdSe2 flakes increases. more and more photocurrent resonance peaks appear in the near-infrared region. suggesting strong interlayer interactions in few-layer PdSe2 help open up more optical transitions between the conduction and valence bands of PdSe2. Moreover. gate-dependent measurements indicate that remarkable photocurrent responses at the junctions between PdSe2 and metal electrodes primarily result from the photovoltaic effect when a PdSe2 phototransistor is in the off-state and are partially attributed to the photothermoelectric effect when the …,True,CyzPiiUAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,7,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/nr/c9nr03505b,18108053521441861801,/scholar?cites=18108053521441861801,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/getauthorversionpdf/c9nr03505b,0,0,0

Depending on the choice of catalytic metals (Au. Ni. Cu. Co) and germane (GeH4) concentration during CVD. either Ge NWs or NTs can be synthesized at low growth temperatures (310−370 °C). Furthermore. Ge NWs and NTs with two or more branches can be grown from the same stem while using AAO with branched channels as templates. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that NWs are single crystalline and that branches grow epitaxially from the stem of NWs with a crystalline direction independent of diameter.

Purification proceeds from the top down and is likely catalytically facilitated via the evolving platinum layer. Thermal simulations suggest a temperature threshold of ∼485 K. and the purification rate is a function of the PtC5 thickness (80–360 nm) and laser pulse width (1–100 μs) in the ranges studied. The thickness dependence is attributed to the ∼235 nm penetration depth of the PtC5 composite at the laser wavelength. and the pulse-width dependence is attributed to the increased temperatures achieved at longer pulse widths.

The controller gives an appropriate signal to the control valve depending upon the difference between the measured flow rate and the set flow rate. Conventional flowmeters produce a differential pressure in the flow. which is measured and suitably scaled to get the flow rate. Incidentally. a control valve uses the principle of restricting the area for flow which in turn produces a differential pressure. From the above. it is seen that if a relationship is developed between the differential pressure produced by the control valve and the flow through it. the valve itself could function as a flowmeter also. apart from acting as a control valve.

Arm field gas absorption column titration techniques were used for the analysis. The total concentration of carbonate and hence the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed was determined using gravimetric methods. The comparison between the obtained experimental and simulated results shows that the formulated model is a good representation of the system. A program was written in Q-Basic for simulation of any gas absorption packed column. the model and computer program could therefore be used to determining the condition in a counter-current continuous column at any given time. for any chemically reacting absorption system.,True,i7b7Z4EAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,13,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.563.3812&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5250468611119641501,/scholar?cites=5250468611119641501,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.563.3812&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Effect of the process parameters studied on pulps composition and digestibility were found to be complex. The results revealed that digestibility could not be predicted merely according to composition. Severity factor was correlated with compositional changes and digestibility with good R-squared values at varied liquid–solid ratios (8–16 v/w). but not with overall glucose yield. HCW pretreatment significantly improved the overall glucose yield up to 83.72% with severity of 3.31 and liquid–solid ratio of 8.0 compared to untreated raw OPF which only recorded an overall glucose yield of 30.97%.

There is also an increased awareness of the importance that the production of biomass feedstock and biofuels be sustainable. In order to ensure that bioenergy is developed in an environmentally. economically and socially sustainable way. a range of policy instruments can be used to require or promote good practices throughout the supply chain.Establishing certification schemes is one of the strategies to ensure that bioenergy is produced in a sustainable manner and is often thought to be the most suitable instrument for the development of sustainable bioenergy systems (Ladanai S.. Vinterbäck J.. 2010). At present. numerous sustainability certification systems have been developed. on national and international level. These certification systems differ in many ways: not only are they developed by different organisations. they have also developed to serve many different feedstocks (eg forests. agricultural crops). bioenergy products (eg relatively unprocessed forest residues. ethanol. biodiesel. electricity). and to apply to whole or segments of the supply chain (eg production system. chain of custody from growers to energy consumers).,True,ZejcBy4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,15,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/314858/iea_sust_cert_task_1_final2013.pdf?sequence=1,18290030548383471632,/scholar?cites=18290030548383471632,,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/314858/iea_sust_cert_task_1_final2013.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The palladium nanoparticle modified electrode displays a sensitivity and limit of detection of 60 mA mol−1 L and 2.6 µM respectively while the array has a sensitivity of 8 mA mol−1 L with a detection limit of 1.8 µM. The beneficial cost implications of using palladium nano- or micro-particles in sensors compared to a palladium macroelectrode are evident. Interestingly the array of the nanoparticles shows similar sensitivity and limit of detection to the microelectrode array which probably indicates that the random distribution of the former leads to ‘clumps’ of nanoparticles that effectively act as microelectrodes.,True,nMFKg0EAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,238,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/articlehtml/2006/an/b513751a,3232598852334526637,/scholar?cites=3232598852334526637,,,0,0,0

However. the approach can occasionally be restricted by limitations of selectivity; various species present in the target medium may oxidise or reduce at similar potentials. We show that the use of conducting porous layers on the surface of electrodes can be used to modify the mass transport regime from linear (planar) diffusion to one of approximately ‘thin layer’ character and that this alteration can in favourable circumstances facilitate the amperometric discrimination between species which oxidise or reduce at similar potentials under planar diffusion conditions.The method is illustrated with respect to the detection of dopamine at naked glassy carbon electrodes and at such electrodes modified with a …,True,nMFKg0EAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,225,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092540050900999X,10182999664553430916,/scholar?cites=10182999664553430916,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51048010/j.snb.2009.12.04620161225-24631-9vbt4l.pdf,0,0,0

Towards understanding the dissolution and toxicity of silver nanoparticles,2014,Christopher Batchelor-McAuley and Kristina Tschulik and Christopher CM Neumann and Eduardo Laborda and Richard G Compton,9,International Journal of Electrochemical Science,3,,,The mass-transport to a spherical particle in solution is considered in the context of the mechanism of oxygen reduction on silver nanoparticles. For small particles (≤1 μm) the reduction follows a two-proton. two-electron pathway due to the rapid diffusion of the intermediate hydrogen peroxide away from the interface. Above this size threshold the hydrogen peroxide is further reduced to water. This switch of mechanism is of importance when interpreting the dissolution of silver nanoparticles in aqueous media and their inherent toxicity. The release of H2O2 from nanoparticles but not bulk silver may explain why silver nanoparticles are thought more toxic than their macroscopic counterparts. © 2014 by ESG.,True,nMFKg0EAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,79,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:3ee0c9fc-b5b1-4af8-8456-86e82e3bc1dd,17104086879946032842,/scholar?cites=17104086879946032842,,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:3ee0c9fc-b5b1-4af8-8456-86e82e3bc1dd/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=90301132.pdf&type_of_work=Journal+article,0,0,0

This is generally performed using a micro-disc working electrode; however. for the first time we report the use of cylindrical micro-wire electrodes for nanoparticle impact experiments. These electrodes provide much enhanced detection limits; specifically decreasing the concentration of nanoparticles measurable by over two orders of magnitude. In addition. the use of micro-wire electrodes reduces the shielding effect due to absorption of particles to the insulating sheath that surrounds a micro-disc electrode. Micro-wire electrodes are fabricated and their electrochemical response analysed via cyclic voltammetry experiments using molecular species.

Thus. chloride ion quantification in sweat is important towards the screening of cystic fibrosis. Electrochemical methods. being cost effective and convenient. can be exploited for this. The electrochemical oxidation of silver nanoparticles in the absence of chloride ions gives one voltammetric signal related to the oxidation of silver to silver ions. The presence of chloride ions in the solution causes the appearance of an additional signal at a lower potential which is related to the oxidation of silver to silver chloride. This signal has a peak height which correlates linearly with the concentration of chloride ions from 2 mM to 40 mM when the electrochemical experiments are performed on silver nanoparticle modified screen printed electrodes.

The occupant has influence due to his presence and activities in the building and due to his control actions that aim to improve indoor environmental conditions (thermal. air quality. light. noise). Due to the demand for sustainable buildings more passive buildings will be built. Consequently the weight of the user behavior on the energy balance of a building increases. In the design phase. e.g.. via building performance simulation. this effect has only recently been recognized.

Hensen,,,,,,Net-zero energy buildings have usually very low energy demand. and consequently heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are designed and controlled to meet this low energy demand. However. a number of uncertainties in the building use. operation and external conditions such as climate change and occupant behaviour can influence the energy demand. Considering these variations. the currently designed net zero energy buildings will not always be able to provide the required indoor environmental quality. A proper balance between energy demand.

Not considering the potential influence of uncertainties on building performance could mislead the decision-making process during the design phase. Hence. it is crucial to include the modeling of uncertainties within building performance simulation (BPS) models. As for uncertainties due to OB. there are a number of ways to model them in BPS tools. characterized by different levels of complexity.

These uncertainties cause performance variations resulting in deviations between actual operation compared to the predicted performance in the design phase. Therefore. performance robustness assessment of these buildings should consider uncertainties and should be included in the design phase to ensure the intended performance in the future. The probability of occurrences of these uncertainties are usually unknown and hence. scenarios are essential to assess the performance robustness of buildings.

However. none of the permanent thermal mass concepts are optimal in all operational conditions. We propose a concept that combines the benefits of buildings with low and high thermal mass by applying hybrid adaptable thermal storage (HATS) systems and materials to a lightweight building. The HATS concept increases building performance and the robustness to changing user behavior. seasonal variations and future climate changes. In this paper the potential of the novel HATS concept is investigated by determining the sensitivity of the optimal thermal mass of a building to the change of seasons and to changing occupancy patterns. The optimal thermal mass is defined as the quantity of the thermal mass that provides the best building performance (based on a trade-off between the building performance indicators). Building performance simulation and multi-objective optimization techniques are used to define the optimal thermal mass of a case study in the Netherlands. Simulation results show that the optimal quantity of the thermal mass is sensitive to the change of seasons and occupancy patterns. This implies that the building performance will benefit from implementing HATS. Furthermore. the results show that using HATS reduces the heating energy demand of the case study with 26% and reduces weighted over- and underheating hours with 85%.,True,G4QvDMUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,8,https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/handle/1969.1/94125,8877831884265808890,/scholar?cites=8877831884265808890,,https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/94125/ESL-IC-10-10-75.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1107811,Stochastic modeling of overtime occupancy and its application in building energy simulation and calibration,2014,Kaiyu Sun and Da Yan and Tianzhen Hong and Siyue Guo,79,Building and Environment,,1-12,Pergamon,Overtime is a common phenomenon around the world. Overtime drives both internal heat gains from occupants. lighting and plug-loads. and HVAC operation during overtime periods. Overtime leads to longer occupancy hours and extended operation of building services systems beyond normal working hours. thus overtime impacts total building energy use. Current literature lacks methods to model overtime occupancy because overtime is stochastic in nature and varies by individual occupants and by time. To address this gap in the literature. this study aims to develop a new stochastic model based on the statistical analysis of measured overtime occupancy data from an office building. A binomial distribution is used to represent the total number of occupants working overtime. while an exponential distribution is used to represent the duration of overtime periods.

Field experience shows that energy savings of 5–30% are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task. not only because the task itself is difficult. but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly. creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming.

1107855,Comparisons of Inverse Modeling Approaches for Predicting Building Energy Performance,2015,Godfried Augenbroe Yuna Zhang and Zheng O’Neill and Bing Dong,,Building and Environment,,,,In building retrofit projects. retrofit savings can be estimated by comparing building energy use before and after installing Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). A complicating factor is that there is no direct measurement of the reduced energy use that is solely attributable to the retrofit. Indeed. simple comparisons by subtracting the post-retrofit energy use from the pre-retrofit would ignore the impact of other factors. such as weather and occupancy with constantly changing patterns. on the total building energy use. Data-driven models (i.e.. derived by inverse modeling approaches) that are trained with monitored pre-retrofit building data can be used as the baseline models in a retrofit project. However. to be effective. the baseline energy models must be capable of singling out the impact of ECMs and ignoring the influence of other factors.

1107870,Integrated building heating. cooling and ventilation control,2010,Bing Dong,,,,,,Current research studies show that building heating. cooling and ventilation energy consumption account for nearly 40% of the total building energy use in the US The potential for saving energy through building control systems varies from 5% to 20% based on recent market surveys. In addition. building control affects environmental performances such as thermal. visual. air quality. etc.. and occupancy such as working productivity and comfort. Building control has been proven to be important both in design and operation stages.Building control design and operation need consistent and reliable static and dynamic information from multiple resources. Static information includes building geometry. construction and HVAC equipment. Dynamic information includes zone environmental performance. occupancy and outside weather information during operation.. At the same time. model-based predicted control can help to optimize energy use while maintaining indoor set-point temperature when occupied. Unfortunately. several issues in the current approach of building control design and operation impede achieving this goal. These issues include: a) dynamic information data such as real-time on-site weather (eg. temperature. wind speed and solar radiation) and occupancy (number of occupants and occupancy duration in the space) are not readily available; b) a comprehensive building energy model is not fully integrated into advanced control for accuracy and robustness; c) real-time implementation of indoor air temperature control are rare.

It is therefore necessary to capture the factors influencing these energy intensive occupant behaviors and to incorporate them in building design. This review-based article puts forward a framework to represent occupant behavior in buildings by arguing: occupants are not illogical and irrational but rather that they attempt to restore their comfort in the easiest way possible. but are influenced by many contextual factors. This framework synthesizes statistical and anecdotal findings of the occupant behavior literature.

The algorithm learns occupants' illuminance preferences from their light switch-on and blinds closing behaviours. and employs this information to determine the photosensor setpoints to switch off lighting and to open blinds. The algorithm was implemented inside controllers serving five private offices and a controls laboratory – a shared office space with a standalone controls network.

1107891,Review of current methods. opportunities. and challenges for in-situ monitoring to support occupant modelling in office spaces,2017,Sara Gilani and William O’Brien,10,,5-6,444-470,Taylor & Francis,Modelling occupant behaviours presents an opportunity to better predict building energy performance and comfort in real situations to support building design and operation. The implementation of such representative occupant models is achievable with the development of occupant models derived from the empirical data. which are collected in existing buildings. Collecting data of occupants' presence and behaviours can be. however. a challenging effort that requires prior knowledge. skills. and a significant investment. This paper critically reviews past. current. and potential future techniques for monitoring occupant behaviours in the context of existing buildings. The lessons learned and recommendations for future research in the field are drawn from previous experience in the literature and anecdotal evidence.,True,xG1lbcsAAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC,48,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19401493.2016.1255258,9839121373943677560,/scholar?cites=9839121373943677560,,,0,0,0
1107892,Oh behave! Survey stories and lessons learned from building occupants in high-performance buildings,2017,Julia K Day and William O'Brien,31,Energy research & social science,,11-20,Elsevier,High-performance buildings are designed to decrease building energy use and provide the benefits of greater comfort. health. and usability to occupants. In these buildings. control technologies have advanced over the past decades. and there has been a tendency for building designers to increase automation to mitigate energy inefficient occupant behaviors. Yet. a growing body of literature has revealed that overly-automated buildings come at a great risk: occupant tolerance for discomfort is significantly reduced as control is withdrawn. Oftentimes researchers ask “what.” “how many.” and “how often?”—but we often neglect to ask the “why” questions in energy-related research. In this paper. “survey stories” from seven occupant behavior/energy studies (which were originally conducted by the authors) are presented to offer lessons learned for future research and design efforts.

The total energy consumption and energy end-use breakdown are presented and several findings from the energy analysis are discussed such as the importance of occupant behavior. occupant comfort and the improvements that could lead to achieving full net-zero energy performance. It was demonstrated that large reductions in energy consumption can be achieved with little effect on comfort. Occupants affect the loads significantly and need to be educated and given specific feedback about their energy use patterns in order to help them adjust their behavior for energy efficiency. Although already far below the typical home in energy consumption (about 90%). this paper shows how ÉcoTerra could consume even less energy and how similar houses could be designed or upgraded to achieve net zero energy.,True,xG1lbcsAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC,47,https://www.task40.iea-shc.org/data/sites/1/publications/DB-TP7-Obrien-2011-06.pdf,10782403487193769779,/scholar?cites=10782403487193769779,,https://www.task40.iea-shc.org/data/sites/1/publications/DB-TP7-Obrien-2011-06.pdf,0,0,0
1107894,A critical review of field implementations of occupant-centric building controls,2019,June Young Park and Mohamed M Ouf and Burak Gunay and Yuzhen Peng and William O'Brien and Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard and Zoltan Nagy,165,,,106351,Pergamon,Recent developments in information and communication technology have sparked the notion of smart buildings; an example of which is occupant-centric control (OCC). In this approach. a control system acquires various data from occupants. the indoor environment. and outdoor climate. and learns or derives useful information for building control. e.g.. room occupancy patterns and adaptive set-points. Ultimately. these adaptive control parameters are used to improve both occupant comfort and energy efficiency. Typical OCC approaches have been put forward in concept papers. small-scale experiments. as well as simulations. However. there are relatively few studies in which OCC is implemented in real buildings. In this article. we review OCC research. focusing on field-implementation case studies in actual buildings under realistic use conditions.

1107895,Simulating occupants' impact on building energy performance at different spatial scales,2018,Sara Gilani and William O'Brien and H Burak Gunay,132,Building and Environment,,327-337,Pergamon,It is not evident that modeling the stochastic nature of occupants' presence and behavior at the building level is as important as at the room level. Given this line of inquiry. the question is: how should occupants be modeled at different spatial resolutions? How much difference does it make to annual building energy use predictions if: (1) industry assumptions or dynamic models are used. and (2) probabilistic or deterministic models are used? This paper explores the reliability of predicting lighting energy use and the ability to quantify uncertainty at different scales. To this end. the impacts of occupancy and lighting and window shade use behaviors on lighting use predictions at various scales are studied. For occupant modeling. stochastic and rule-based models and custom and standard schedules are used. The simulation results indicated that the whole-building lighting energy use predictions with the stochastic …,True,xG1lbcsAAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318300581,8530535997534916819,/scholar?cites=8530535997534916819,,,0,0,0
1107896,Development of an occupancy learning algorithm for terminal heating and cooling units,2015,H Burak Gunay and William O'Brien and Ian Beausoleil-Morrison,93,Building and Environment,,71-85,Pergamon,A significant portion of the North American workforce reports having the ability to alter their daily arrival and departure times for work. As a result. personal preferences translate into individual occupancy profiles. To accommodate these diverse personal schedules. building operators tend to use conservatively short temperature setback periods. In this paper. a year's worth of data gathered by motion sensors placed in private offices in an academic building were analyzed. The predictability of the recurring occupancy patterns was assessed. Drawing upon this. an adaptive occupancy-learning control algorithm which learns the arrival and departure times recursively and adapts the temperature setback schedules accordingly. was developed. Later. the algorithm was implemented in the Energy Management System (EMS) application of the building performance simulation (BPS) tool EnergyPlus.

For each of them. a (still growing) number of indices and metrics have been proposed in the literature and standards. In the present work. they are described. categorized according to common features. and finally discussed. As in the case of long-term thermal comfort indices. such visual comfort indices and their summation over a specified calculation period might be used for driving optimization processes to support a more conscious integrated design of buildings.

1107900,A review of indices for the long-term evaluation of the general thermal comfort conditions in buildings,2012,Salvatore Carlucci and Lorenzo Pagliano,53,,,194-205,Elsevier,A number of metrics for assessing human thermal response to climatic conditions have been proposed in literature over the last decades. They aim at describing human thermal perception of the thermal environment to which an individual or a group of people is exposed. More recently. a new type of “discomfort index” has been proposed in scientific literature. in standards and in guidelines for describing. in a synthetic way. the long-term thermal comfort conditions in buildings and for predicting uncomfortable phenomena. Most of these new indices synthesize the thermal performance of a building in a single value.We present in this paper a systematic review of 15 indices for the long-term evaluation of thermal comfort conditions in a building.
