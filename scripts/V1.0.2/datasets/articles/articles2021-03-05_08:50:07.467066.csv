This controller does not need the knowledge of modal variables and spacecraft angular velocity. The absence of measurements of these variables is compensated by appropriate dynamics of the controller. which supplies their estimates. The Lyapunov technique is applied in the design of this dynamic controller. Possible source of instability of the controlled system in real cases are the influence of the flexibility on the rigid motion. the presence of disturbances acting on the structure. and parameter variations.

Long-term EEG recordings of an epileptic patient contain a huge amount of EEG data. The detection of epileptic activity is. therefore. a very demanding process that requires a detailed analysis of the entire length of the EEG data. usually performed by an expert. This paper describes an automated classification of EEG signals for the detection of epileptic seizures using wavelet transform and statistical pattern recognition. The decision making process is comprised of three main stages: (a) feature extraction based on wavelet transform. (b) feature space dimension reduction using scatter matrices and (c) classification by quadratic classifiers. The proposed methodology was applied on EEG data sets that belong to three subject groups: (a) healthy subjects.

First. a controller is designed using a high order sliding mode twisting algorithm. to track a desired rotor velocity signal and an optimal rotor flux modulus. minimizing the power loss in copper and core. Then. a super-twisting (ST) sliding mode observer for stator current is designed and the rotor flux is calculated. by means of the equivalent control method. Two methods for the rotor velocity estimation are then proposed. The first consists of a further super-twisting sliding mode observer for rotor fluxes. with the purpose of retrieving the back-electromotive force components by means of the equivalent control method.

After preprocessing of EEG signals we extract representative features in time. frequency and time-frequency domain as well as using nonlinear analysis. The features are extracted in a few frequency sub-bands of clinical interest since these sub-bands showed much better discriminatory characteristics compared with the whole frequency band. Then we optimally reduce the dimension of feature space to two using scatter matrices. A decision about the presence of epileptiform activity in EEG signals is made by quadratic classifiers designed in the reduced two-dimensional feature space. The accuracy of the technique was tested on three sets of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded at the University Hospital Bonn: surface EEG signals from healthy volunteers. intracranial EEG signals from the epilepsy patients during the seizure free interval from within the seizure focus and intracranial EEG signals of epileptic seizures also from within the seizure focus.

1139463,Evolution of Active Filter Circuits Design Using Genetic Programming,2017,Ogri J Ushie and Maysam F Abbod and Evans C Ashigwuike,9,Electroscope Journal,9,19-28,,This research seeks to introduce genetic folding (GF). modified symbolic circuit analysis in Matlab (MSCAM). and automatically simulated Netlist into existing genetic programming (GP) which is a new contribution of this paper. It enhances the development of independent Matlab toolbox for the evolution of active filter circuits. The active filter circuit evolution. especially when operational amplifiers are involved as components. is of the first kind in circuit evolution. The research uses only one software package instead of combining PSpice and Matlab in electronic circuit simulation as in existing GP. This saves the elapsed time for moving the simulation between the two platforms and reduces the cost of subscription. The evolving circuit from GP/F using Matlab simulation is automatically transformed into a symbolic Netlist. The Netlist is fed into MSCAM; where MSCAM uses it to generate matrices for the simulation. The matrices enhance frequency response analysis of four different active filter circuits (low-pass. high-pass. band-pass. band-stop of active filter circuits). Results presented proved the algorithm’s efficiency regarding design wise. The research also provided an alternative method of using GP/F for the evolution of active filter circuit. especially when operational amplifier is involved as a component.,True,6biGsEIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://electroscopejournal.org.ng/index.php/electros/article/view/116,,,,https://electroscopejournal.org.ng/index.php/electros/article/download/116/108,0,0,0

Any of these variables employed must ensure that the antennae at both sides of the link can see each other. This is because the radio horizon extends beyond the optical horizon. Inspite of this porch. telecommunications’ long distance signal suffer degradation. The ratio of the transmitted power to the receiver power is empirically deteriorated. The level of the received signal fluctuation is usually a function of the configured characteristics between the TX-antenna and the RX-antenna. In view of this. operating considerations are usually focused on LOS. NLOS and the FZ of the area. among other environmental issues. The study. therefore. focuses on issues associated with Radio waves propagation under Fresnel zone peak levels of 0.6. 1.0 and 2.0. Five locations were considered along a major economic route (Eket-Mobil Oil giant and Uyo capital city). Signal strength pattern along the route was evaluated using a wireless radio link established in all the surveyed interceptions. This aided to determine any impeding structure tending to obstruct signal propagation; and measurements were taken at five respective nodes along the route. Results indicated the best line-of-sight (LOS) at Etinan (-81dB signal strength). AfahaNsit. recorded the second best on the table (-82dB). On the other hand. locations like Eket and Nsit-Ubium established very poor line-of-sight (signal strength of-84dB and-83dB respectively). The study further noted that obstruction like trees along the route to Eket contributed greatly to the poor results obtained at the terminal point of the signal; except for the meticulous …,True,x1doDH4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,8,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57cc/a470b0bc99bd4fc0ed4d671b6035a6e22904.pdf,294654718520537500,/scholar?cites=294654718520537500,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57cc/a470b0bc99bd4fc0ed4d671b6035a6e22904.pdf,0,0,0

In practice. this radiated energy varies and diminishes in strength as it propagates from the point-source to the receiver. The level of attenuation of this radio wave can be determined by many factors. Researchers on urban wireless microcells networks. had very often. focused on measurements and modeling of reflected and diffracted rays from corners of structures and their exterior walls. In some cases the structures in questions were treated as opaque to signal propagating under terrestrial mobile frequency range. The attenuation capacity of these structures forms the basis of this study. Quasi-two-dimensional ray-based model was employed during the study. The transmitting and receiving antennae heights were erected at elevation levels not above the top of an average roof. while the base station antenna was assumed to be at the same height as the mobile station to enable the transmitted rays to propagate in a horizontal plane. This was anchored on the theory that transmitted em waves have uniform distribution as it propagated through different layers of the building. The attenuation coefficients of other obstructions in the periphery of the environment were not considered. Furthermore. only the exterior building coordinates were assumed to be known.

This study. therefore views teletraffic data as complete random and in-deterministic variables. and examines its continuous dependence on configuration of fixed engineering values by equipment innovators/operators. The study was carried out by examining if core equipment techniques for processing traffic data on real-time basis vary in accordance with the bandwidth required to deliver the service (voice. data and video). Four Line Trunk Groups (LTG01. LTG02. LTG03 and LTG04) and 16 Digital Line Units (DLUs) were used for the study. Close examination of the activated DLUs configured to carry voice bandwidth generated daily traffic values of 0.1 Erlang to 0.2 Erlang. while others generated traffic rates of 0.01 Erlang to 0.05 Erlang per line; during the non-busy-hour period.

Although a network can be through a wireless device most local connections are done using cables. There are three main computer-networking cables namely coaxial cable. unshielded twisted pair cable and the optic fibre cable. In this research work the cables that most effectively transmit data given some distance in a computer network. were determined. To achieve this. a signal strength meter Multiple Dwelling Unit (MDU) from Applied Instruments Inc is used to measure the signal strength at particular distances in the network. Results show that coaxial cable has a correlation coefficient of-0.66857 to t he distance. unshielded twisted pair cable has-0.47362 while optic fibre cable has–-0.91674. From the analyses it was discovered that the signal strength is partially inversely related to the distance for coaxial cables and about half inversely related to the distance in unshielded twisted pair cables. While in optic fibre cables the signal strength is almost perfectly inversely related to the distance. Similarly the use of these cables was considered in download time. Download time for both plain text and graphics were recorded and from this it was discovered that the mean difference is significant at 0.05 level which shows that the unshielded twisted pair cable is better for plain text download while the optic fibre cable is better for graphic download,True,x1doDH4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/gjpas/article/view/16833,17334549354123470345,/scholar?cites=17334549354123470345,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/gjpas/article/download/16833/31715,0,0,0

The idea is spreading very wide not only within households but industries because of its numerous benefits such as its ecofriendly nature. cost effectiveness. and accessibility. This paper focuses on reviewing the hybridization of wind and solar energy sources in Nigeria. Wind speeds are considerably low during dry season in Nigeria when the intensity of the sun is very high and shines for a long period of time. The wind is stronger during the rainy season when less sunlight is available. Since the maximum operating time for solar and wind systems occur at different times of the day and year. power generation using wind solar hybrid system is likely to be readily available when needed. Wind and solar hybrid system conversion could be large scale connected to the national grid or small scale for stand-alone systems. Different work carried out by researchers’ shows that if Nigeria can properly harness 40 percent of her renewable energy resources such as wind and solar. the problem of power failure will be a thing of the past in both remote locations and urban areas of Nigeria. It is recommended that government should as a matter of urgency prioritize the generation of electricity through the integration of the various renewable energy resources.,True,x1doDH4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,http://gjeta.com/content/review-hybridization-renewable-energy-resources-nigeria,,,,http://gjeta.com/sites/default/files/GJETA-2020-0028.pdf,0,0,0

Inyiama,2,"UNILAG Journal of Medicine, Science & Technology (UJMST)",1&2,1-10,Unilag,This paper presents an electronic Expert system platform to detect and diagnose existing and new cases of contagious diseases as they occur with minimal contact with the index patient(s) and healthcare personnel with a confidence level that can be used to initiate or suggest appropriate follow-up action(s). The aim is to use ICT tools for patient-diagnosis. raise a red flag in real-time and thus contain contagious cases which may degenerate into an epidemic by providing a way to analyze vague and ambiguous input data from visible and reported symptoms in patients. A re-useable Expert system which makes use of fuzzy reasoning techniques and design methodology was used in this work. The Expert system is premised on rule-based fuzzy logic which captures the ambiguity. imprecision and nuances involved in disease reporting and detection using the Mamdani model. The software developed for the Fuzzy Expert system. called SOSIC. presents its diagnosis with fuzzy values between 0 to 1 corresponding to its level of confidence for the fuzzy inputs. The current approach to e-diagnosis and detection of contagious diseases using the SOSIC software is not completely contactless. thus ongoing investigations are geared towards improving SOSIC to be contactless. The developed system which runs on a computer system provides a safe procedure with minimum contact between patients and healthcare personnel to address early detection and diagnosis issues that may help forestall chain-infection and epidemics. The fuzzy based Expert system can be further extended to accommodate the detection of a wider array of symptoms as new cases …,True,vOukh_4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://ir.unilag.edu.ng/handle/123456789/3884,2002916035871175775,/scholar?cites=2002916035871175775,,https://ir.unilag.edu.ng/bitstream/handle/123456789/3884/A%20LINGUISTIC%20FUZZY%20EXPERT%20SYSTEM%20FOR%20CONTAGIOUS%20DISEASES%20DETECTION%20%26%20ISOLATION.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Nwankwo,6,Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences,6,282 - 289,,The importance of authenticating intellectual property identification numbers (IPINs) cannot be overemphasized. especially in the sciences and academia. This study focuses on the textual intellectual properties such as the text books. Every text book is protected by a copyright. and is uniquely identified by a reference number known as the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). This unique identity is generated in line with an International Standard Organization (ISO) certified algorithm. Thus. it should be possible to detect cases of errors or fraud when such an identification number is presented. Frontal authentication refers to a first level computer-based investigative check to confirm that a particular intellectual property identity is valid. A timely confirmation using requisite computational tools is necessary. and should be achieved in an offline mode. A second level authentication goes beyond the frontal check by attempting to validate the actual ownership of the intellectual property. The experimental dataset used in this research is made up of text book data collected from the bookshelves of an academic library. The computational algorithm is based on the application of error coding techniques and number theoretical algorithms. An important research gap is that many of the existing online searchengine based implementations provide authentication on a single intellectual property basis. thus necessitating the proposed designed system to fill this gap by accommodating mass inquiries.

It causes some drivers' disability of seeing and obeying traffic signs. This makes drivers violate traffic rules. In this paper. an attempt to use hybrid lighting technology to mitigate this problem was developed. Incandescent lightings with deployed halogen bulbs provided an instantaneous source of highly efficacious illumination which is brighter than the drivers' ambient lights (both daylight. electrical lights and their reflections). which can help drivers get access to enough warning and help them initiate traffic safety warning as necessary. The halogen lightings also offered the required high current draw needed in electrical circuitry to help brighten the LED displays.

The new technique converges very quickly. and is ideal for cases where the system of equations can be easily differentiated. It is motivated by the multivariable Newton–Raphson (mNR) method and is approximately of second-order convergence. Furthermore. we introduce the “zeros Jacobian” for the Jacobian evaluated at some arbitrary zeros of the vector function components. This is utilized in computing a feasible starting point for SNEs.

Four significant manufacturing uncertainties that include downtimes due preventive maintenance. workers’ shifts and off duties. machine fault and power failure were used as input variables. The effects of these four essential factors on the productivity of a typical manufacturing company is investigated. Daily data of these four downtimes together with the daily cost of production and revenue for three consecutive years were sourced from a reputable production company in Nigeria. The daily productivity index of that system is evaluated using the acquired data from the purchases and sales day book. The efficacy of the model is tested through the mean square error (MSE).

Inc.,Gender Recognition (GR) is the process of identifying gender difference by extracting and evaluating features from data existing as images. video. audio. text. and other signals. The task of GR has been achieved using face. keystroke. gait. and speech features. “Laughter” with its intrinsic usefulness for this task is yet to be explored. Laughter is an important paralinguistic feature in human communication. It can change the meaning of speech when triggered by some form of arousal or amusement. Although. laughter can be “acted.” but the human natural laughter is a spontaneous reflex response. which reasonably embeds some characteristic peculiarities of the individuals. The human brain has capacity to make this distinction. In this study. spontaneous laughter bouts of 123 volunteers (41 females and 82 males) were recorded.

It is pervasive world-wide yet tenuous and costly to manage. Diabetes Mellitus is also difficult to model because it is nonlinear. dynamic and laden with mostly patient specific uncertainties. A neuro-fuzzy model for the prediction of blood glucose level in Type 1 diabetic patients using coupled insulin and meal effects is developed. This study establishes that the necessary and sufficient conditions to predict blood glucose level in a Type 1 diabetes mellitus patient are: knowledge of the patient’s insulin effects and meal effects under diverse metabolic scenarios and the transparent coupling of the insulin and meal effects. The neuro-fuzzy models were trained with data collected from a single Type 1 diabetic patient covering a period of two months. Clarke’s Error Grid Analysis (CEGA) of the model shows that 87.5% of the predictions fall into region A. while the remaining 12.5% of the predictions fall into region B within a four (4) hour prediction window. The model reveals significant variation in insulin and glucose responses as the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient changes.,True,lO1Wb_oAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/ast/4/1/article-p1.xml,,,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/ast/4/1/article-p1.xml,0,0,0

The emphasis on the global outlook and worldwide rating or ranking of researchers. their researches and their institutions partly prompted this research work. The perspectives of researchers from developing countries were sought through the administration of online survey and data obtained and were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The survey results indicate that majority of African academics are concerned about the issue and desire a paradigm shift to be supported by institutional administrators and policy makers. The phenomenon of Globafricalisation which includes the pressure to fit into the Western-imposed model despite the deficit of research support infrastructures may in part be fueling the push for global institutional and research rating by various institutions in Africa. No doubt. all institutions want a high ranking on a global scale but the apparent questions are: what parameters are ranked. and how acceptable. reputable and transparently flawless are the processes involved?

Ag diffusion is responsible for lower sheet resistance values in shorter resistors only in the case of ruthenate conductive grains while the reverse is observed in RuO2-based layers.

The cermets are cylindrical rods of constant 3.0 mm diameter and varying lengths ranging between 5.0 mm and 25 mm. The cermets were fabricated by employing a compaction method that uses a mould at a constant pressure of 6.9× 10 8 N/m2 on various Cu-Clay compositions ranging between 70 and 95 vol.% Cu. The cermets were subjected to varying peak annealing temperatures ranging between 100 and 1000 0C and for annealing time tf ranging from 30 minutes to 180 minutes before being furnace-cooled to room temperature. Results showed that the annealing schedule greatly affects the resistivity. size-effect and Temperature coefficient of Resistance (TCR). The electrical properties showed that sintering is complete irrespective of the annealing temperature between 300 and 1000 oC when the annealing time tf exceeds 120 minutes.[Journal of American Science 2010; 6 (6): 210-216].(ISSN: 1545-1003).,True,CgXph-0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olayinka_Babalola/publication/228895606_Effect_of_Annealing_on_DC_Charge_transport_in_Copper-Clay_Cermets/links/02e7e52f875444d970000000.pdf,15515427122707235029,/scholar?cites=15515427122707235029,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olayinka_Babalola/publication/228895606_Effect_of_Annealing_on_DC_Charge_transport_in_Copper-Clay_Cermets/links/02e7e52f875444d970000000.pdf,0,0,0

Two very well-resolved and reproducible signals/oxidation peaks with a voltammetric separation of 0.35 V were obtained in Britton–Robinson (BR) buffer (pH 9). The MgO NPLs are found to exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity and improved voltammetric response compared to unmodified (bare) SPEs. Under optimum pH conditions (pH 9). the DPV curves exhibit linear responses to nifedipine and atenolol over the concentration ranges of 0.2–104.41 μM and 6.66–909.09 μM with detection limits of 0.032 μM and 1.76 μM. respectively.

Solid electrodes play a crucial role in the voltammetric determination of pharmaceuticals. The potential of solid electrodes has emerged in recent years thanks to their non–toxicity. broad spectrum of analytes. extremely broad concentration range and broad potential window in both anodic and cathodic directions. This review summarizes the application of solid electrodes (either bare or modified electrodes) in pharmaceutical analysis using different electroanalytical techniques. namely. cyclic. linear sweep. differential pulse. square wave and stripping voltammetric techniques. Only four types of solid electrodes will be taken into account. a regular home made solid electrode; carbon paste electrode (CPE) and a three new alternative electrodes; screen printed electrodes (SPE). boron–doped diamond electrode (BDDE) and pencil graphite electrode (PGE).,True,c1zFvU0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Awad_Alrashdi/publication/331564038_Voltammetric_Determination_of_Pharmaceutical_Compounds_at_Bare_and_Modified_Solid_Electrodes_A_Review/links/5c80e41592851c69505c975a/Voltammetric-Determination-of-Pharmaceutical-Compounds-at-Bare-and-Modified-Solid-Electrodes-A-Review.pdf,3905569850669155092,/scholar?cites=3905569850669155092,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Awad_Alrashdi/publication/331564038_Voltammetric_Determination_of_Pharmaceutical_Compounds_at_Bare_and_Modified_Solid_Electrodes_A_Review/links/5c80e41592851c69505c975a/Voltammetric-Determination-of-Pharmaceutical-Compounds-at-Bare-and-Modified-Solid-Electrodes-A-Review.pdf,0,0,0

It has been found that exposure to natural and synthetic estrogenic chemicals may adversely affect wildlife and human health (Colborn et al. 1993). In vitro exposures (Soto et al. 1992; Soto et al. 1994; Toomey et al. 1999) have confirmed the effects of EDCs on tissue structure and cellular processes. Nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) are EDCs which are used globally in the production of plastics. pesticides. and cleaning products and are present in sewage effluents around the world (Talmage. 1994). It has been reported that NP is the most important degradation product of NPEs because of its enhanced resistance towards biodegradation. toxicity. ability to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. and estrogenicity (Ahel et al. 1994). NP is found in surface waters. aquatic sediments. and ground water (Bennie. 1999; Talmage. 1994) and it is estrogenic in various aquatic animals (Nimrod and Benson. 1996; Talmage. 1994; Servos. 1999).The application of environmental toxicological studies on non-mammalian vertebrates is rapidly expanding; and for aquatic system. fish have become valuable indicator for the evaluation of the effects of noxious compounds (Khidr and Mekkawy. 2008).
