Aspects of the methodology to establish bioavailability and ileal digestibility values also are discussed. and recommendations about the use of these values are provided. Two main factors can contribute to differences between bioavailability and ileal digestibility of AA. First. some AA. such as Lys. may be absorbed in chemical complexes that preclude their use for metabolism. Second. fermentation in the upper gut may result in a net loss or gain of AA to the animal. In addition. dietary effects on the efficiency of using bioavailable AA intake for tissue growth or milk production should be considered and may be attributed to endogenous AA losses in the hindgut and the metabolic costs associated with endogenous gut protein synthesis and losses.

A better understanding of the mechanisms whereby antibiotics influence animal physiology. as well as appropriate use of disease models and in vitro techniques. will lead to the development of alternatives to in-feed antibiotic.

Estimates of ENL are important for determining true ileal N and amino acid digestibilities and for identifying means to improve the efficiency of N and energy utilization in growing pigs. Endogenous secretions originate from various sources including saliva. pancreatic secretions. bile. sloughed off epithelial cells. serum albumin and mucin. It has been estimated that 70 to 80% of endogenous N secretions are digested and re-absorbed. Therefore. ENL represents only a fraction of total endogenous N secreted into the gut. Increased ENL are likely associated with elevated rates of gut protein synthesis. This is bound to increase maintenance energy and amino acid requirements of pigs. Traditionally.

Nutrient intake levels are directly related to voluntary feed intake. Voluntary feed intake in pigs is influenced by several factors including environmental conditions (e.g. thermal and social conditions). animal status (e.g.. age and physiological status). and feed and feeding conditions (e.g. bulkiness of the feed and feed form). Although the individual effects of many of these factors on voluntary feed intake have been investigated and quantified. little has been done to characterize their interactive effects.

During recent years. the design of residential air conditioners has employed smaller diameter tube 6.35¬±9.53 mm) in order to improve the airside performance and to reduce the refrigerant charge into the system and more recently the air-conditioning manufacturers are implementing the related application by use of 4¬±5 mm diameter tubes. Knowledge of the two-phase frictional characteristics is essential since it would certainly improve the accuracy of the design of a thermal system. Unfortunately. most of the predictive correlations of pressure drop are based on the experimental data with tube diameter greater than 10 mm. Extrapolations of these correlations to applications utilizing the small diameter tubes are uncertain. It seems despite the important application of twophase flow in small diameter tubes. the adequate frictional two-phase pressure drop correlations and the published experimental data for small tubes are very rare.

The chemical reduction method is. however. used only for nanofluid containing Cu nanoparticle in water. The thermal conductivities of the nanofluids are measured by a modified transient hot wire method. Experimental results show that nanofluids with low concentration of Cu.

Second. it permits reduction in concentrations faster than the natural carbon cycle: the effects of irreversibility are thus partly alleviated. Third. because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure. air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies.We assess the ultimate physical limits on the amount of energy and land required for air capture and describe two systems that might achieve air capture at prices under 200 and 500 $/tC using current technology.Like geoengineering. air capture ‚Ä¶,True,PfciJkgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,473,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-005-9026-x,5318072251993807984,/scholar?cites=5318072251993807984,,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/file/Keithetal-AirCapture.pdf,0,0,0

1233778,A case for climate engineering,2013,David Keith,,,,,MIT Press,A leading scientist argues that we must consider deploying climate engineering technology to slow the pace of global warming. Climate engineering‚Äîwhich could slow the pace of global warming by injecting reflective particles into the upper atmosphere‚Äîhas emerged in recent years as an extremely controversial technology. And for good reason: it carries unknown risks and it may undermine commitments to conserving energy. Some critics also view it as an immoral human breach of the natural world. The latter objection. David Keith argues in A Scientist's Case for Climate Engineering. is groundless; we have been using technology to alter our environment for years. But he agrees that there are large issues at stake. A leading scientist long concerned about climate change. Keith offers no na√Øve proposal for an easy fix to what is perhaps the most challenging question of our time; climate engineering is no silver bullet. But he argues that after decades during which very little progress has been made in reducing carbon emissions we must put this technology on the table and consider it responsibly. That doesn't mean we will deploy it. and it doesn't mean that we can abandon efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But we must understand fully what research needs to be done and how the technology might be designed and used.

Understanding the factors that drive convection in aquifers is important for assessing geological CO2 storage sites. A hydrodynamic stability analysis is performed for non-linear. transient concentration fields in a saturated. homogenous. porous medium under various boundary conditions. The onset of convection is predicted using linear stability analysis based on the amplification of the initial perturbations. The difficulty with such stability analysis is the choice of the initial conditions used to define the imposed perturbations. We use different noises to find the fastest growing noise as initial conditions for the stability analysis. The stability equations are solved using a Galerkin technique.

The first is the reproduction of network structure as a general social resource for network members. The second is the alteration of network structure by entrepreneurs for their own benefit. The idea of reproduction is a conventional one in organizational sociology but has taken on increased importance due to the work of Bourdieu and Coleman. In contrast. Burt stresses the entrepreneurship of individual agents in exploiting structural holes that lie between constrained positions. Though complementary. the theories of social capital and structural holes have fundamentally different implications for network formation.This paper investigates these theories by examining empirically the formation of the interorganizational network among biotechnology firms.

German corporate ownership patterns and restructuring events in the 1990's are examined here in this light. The results show that ownership links among German firms constitute a ""small world"" that has consequences for understanding mergers and acquisitions. Ownership links form closely-knit clusters of firms that are nonetheless highly connected across the network as a whole. Restructuring events fall squarely in the center of this structure. Despite increasing global competition. the German small world tends to replicate itself. To illustrate this robustness. potential disruptions to the observed German network are simulated.

1233820,The make-or-cooperate decision in the context of an industry network,1992,Bruce Kogut and Weijan Shan and Gordon Walker,,Networks and organizations,,348-65,,"One of the most important decisions facing an organization is which activities should be carried out internally and which should be purchased. This question is frequently characterized as"" make or buy."" and the an-swers to it determine the boundaries of the firm. A fruitful line of research on this question is transaction cost economics (Williamson 1985). which has sought to determine organizational boundaries by comparing the costs of internal production to the costs of relying on the market for production. These costs are related partly to the size of the firm and to its internal capabilities. as well as to the hazards of relying on the outside market."" The problem of what determines a firm's boundaries has frequently been extended to include cooperative modes of interfirm relationship that are intermediate between market and organization. Such modes include joint ventures. licensing. and other long-term cooperative agreements.‚ÄúMake or buy"" thus becomes ‚Äúmake or cooperate."" It is the latter problem that we investigate here.In the research program to which this chapter belongs. we analyze the decision to make or cooperate as influenced by the structure of relationships in a network of firms. As a way to fix ideas. it is useful to emphasize that in transaction cost studies. the influence of the external network is reduced to a summary variable measuring the degree of supplier market competition in a market; the fewer the suppliers. the greater the risk that prices may be renegotiated. especially if the buyer cannot switch easily to other sources.",True,BMrPd3wAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C,292,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13364986135649739351&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13364986135649739351,/scholar?cites=13364986135649739351,,,,0,0,0
1233821,Geographies of Environmental Justice.,2006,Gordon P Walker and Harriet Bulkeley,37,Geoforum,5,655-659,,The concept of environmental justice. from its earliest emergence in the civil rights politics of the United States. has always been intensely geographical. The legal and political contestation of proposals to site polluting and toxic facilities in predominantly poor and black communities. which formed the central political mobilisation of the US environmental justice movement. focused on questions of distribution. inequality and injustice which resonate with long standing traditions of geographical enquiry and analysis. The body of US based literature on environmental justice contains substantial contributions by geographers. including multiple empirical studies of patterns of location of industrial and waste sites. historical research on processes of co-evolution of urban and industrial development. and analysis of environmental justice activism in general and in particular settings. Not surprisingly much of this work has been framed by the particularities of environmental justice in the US. Whilst there are significant exceptions. attention has predominantly been given to the socio-spatial distribution of pollution and ‚Äòtoxicity‚Äôwithin US national borders. to the politics of race and civil rights. and to policy responses to accusations of environmental racism in facility siting.However. the terminology of environmental justice has now travelled beyond the US and the sites of grassroots activism within which it originated.

This situation is encountered in applications such as synthetic aperture radar imaging or propagation of polynomial phase signals through channels affected by multipath and is thus worthy of a careful analysis. A new approach is proposed based on a transformation called product high-order ambiguity function (PHAF).

The common theme of most research in this area is to optimize physical layer performance measures without considering in much detail how cooperation interacts with higher layers and improves network performance measures. Because these issues are important for enabling cooperative communications to practice in real-world networks. especially for the increasingly important class of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). the goals of this article are to survey basic cooperative communications and outline two potential architectures for cooperative MANETs. The first architecture relies on an existing clustered infrastructure: cooperative relays are centrally controlled by cluster heads. In another architecture without explicit clustering. cooperative links are formed by request of a source node in an ad hoc. decentralized fashion. In either case. cooperative communication considerably improves the network connectivity. Although far from a complete study. these architectures provide modified wireless link abstractions and suggest tradeoffs in complexity at the physical and higher layers.

Interestingly. synchrony has often been observed in networks of biological agents (e.g.. synchronously flashing fireflies. or spiking of neurons). In this paper. we propose a bio-inspired network synchronization protocol for large scale sensor networks that emulates the simple strategies adopted by the biological agents. The strategy synchronizes pulsing devices that are led to emit their pulses periodically and simultaneously. The convergence to synchrony of our strategy follows from the theory of Mirollo and Strogatz. 1990. while the scalability is evident from the many examples existing in the natural world.

Relying on block precoding. this paper develops generalized space-time coded multicarrier transceivers appropriate for wireless propagation over frequency-selective multipath channels.

The approach is based on the generalized Wigner-Hough transform as an effective way to estimate the instantaneous frequency of parametric signals embedded in noise.

Due to the limited energy supplies of a sensor node. energy efficiency has become a crucial issue in the design of broadcasting protocols. In this paper. we analyze the energy savings provided by a cooperative form of broadcast. called the opportunistic large arrays (OLA). and compare it to the performance of conventional multi-hop networks where no cooperation is utilized for transmission. The cooperation in OLA allows the receivers to utilize for detection the accumulation of signal energy provided by the transmitters that are relaying the same symbol.

The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2and CO and decreased the activation energy for the production of the synthesis gas. The hydrogen-exchange reaction between CH4and CD4proceeded remarkably faster than the oxidation of methane with CeO2regardless of the presence or absence of Pt. Thus. It was suggested that the cleavage of the C‚ÄìH bond of methane could not be the rate-determining step.

A distinctive feature of these applications is that they have significant parallelism. including thread- . data-. and instruction-level parallelism. that is potentially well-aligned with the increasing parallelism supported by emerging multi-core architectures. Designing systems to meet the demands of these applications therefore requires a benchmark suite comprising these complex applications and that exposes the parallelism present in them.

Software-level symptoms have previously been used to detect permanent hardware faults. However. they can not detect a small fraction of faults. which may lead to silent data corruptions(SDCs). In this paper. we present a system that uses invariants to improve the coverage and latency of existing detection techniques for permanent faults. The basic idea is to use training inputs to create likely invariants based on value ranges of selected program variables and then use them to identify faults at runtime. Likely invariants. however. can have false positives which makes them challenging to use for permanent faults. We use our on-line diagnosis framework for detecting false positives at runtime and limit the number of false positives to keep the associated overhead minimal.

Depending on these parameters we observed a voltage decay of 5‚Äì15% within 48 h after charging. These observations hardly affect dynamic operations for supercapacitors. but have major implications for all static setups. A complex electrical model has been established to account for the redistribution effects of ions occurring in supercapacitors. Intense experimental studies suggest that these redistribution effects are in part responsible for the measured potential decays. Extended charging allows the ions to allocate themselves more homogeneously throughout the pores and therefore the voltage decay during the rest period following the charging is greatly reduced.

This is the main reason that Ferromagnetic Materials was initially chosen as title for the Handbook series. although the latter aimed at giving a more complete cross-section of magnetism than Bozorth's book.

We have investigated the effect of the maximal entropy change derived from magnetization measurements performed in different measurement processes.

Based on the previously established method. we developed a better and stable animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus by high-fat diet combined with multiple low-dose STZ injections. Meanwhile. this new model was used to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of berberine.  Method. Wistar male rats fed with regular chow for 4 weeks received vehicle (control groups). rats fed with high-fat diet for 4 weeks received different amounts of STZ once or twice by intraperitoneal injection (diabetic model groups). and diabetic rats were treated with berberine (100‚Äâmg/kg. berberine treatment group). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were carried out.

Series A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences,1922,573-581,The Royal Society,We have measured the kinematic viscosity of glycerol-water mixtures. for glycerol mass fractions ranging from 0 to 1. in the temperature range 10-50 ¬∞C. The measurements were made by using a series of Ubbelohde viscometers. Apart from comprehensiveness and comparative accuracy the present measurements expose serious errors in the limited data that were earlier available on such mixtures.

In the experiments. fluorescein dye solution is pumped through the fibrous hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL) and imaged with fluorescence microscopy. Transient image intensity data is correlated to the liquid surface height and is analyzed and presented in the form of three-dimensional reconstructions of the time-evolving gas/liquid interface inside the fibrous structure. The high spatial resolution of the visualization can resolve the dynamic transport of liquid water through distinct pathways. which helps to refine understanding regarding liquid water transport mechanism within these porous layers.

Fluorescence microscopy is used to provide ex situ visualization of liquid water transport through the GDL placed beneath an optically transparent clamping plate. Transient image data obtained with a CCD camera indicates that areas of compression in the GDL coincide with preferential pathways for water transport and break-through. Preferential flow of water through the smaller pores resulting from GDL compression is contrary to the expected behaviour in a hydrophobic medium. and this suggests a loss of hydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to investigate the effect of compression on the morphology of the GDL.

It is also large-scale. in stark contrast to microchannels. Microfluidic energy technologies must offer either massive scalability or direct relevance to energy processes already operating at scale. We have to pick our fights. Highlighted here are the exceptional opportunities I see. including some recent successes and areas where much more attention is needed. The most promising directions are those that leverage high surface-to-volume ratios. rapid diffusive transport. capacity for high temperature and high pressure experiments. and length scales characteristic of microbes and fluids (hydrocarbons.

Commonly employed as mechanical pencil refills. graphite rods are inexpensive and serve effectively as both electrode and current collector for combined all-vanadium fuel/oxidant systems. In contrast to film-deposited electrodes. the geometry and mechanical properties of graphite rods enable unique three-dimensional microfluidic fuel cell architectures. Planar microfluidic fuel cells employing graphite rod electrodes are presented here first. The planar geometry is typical of microfluidic fuel cells presented to date. and permits fuel cell performance comparisons and the evaluation of graphite rods as electrodes.

Inc.,Two methods for mitigating unacceptably high HCCI heat-release rates are investigated and compared in this combined experimental/CFD work. Retarding the combustion phasing by decreasing the intake temperature is found to have good potential for smoothing heat-release rates and reducing engine knock. There are at least three reasons for this: 1) lower combustion temperatures. 2) less pressure rise when the combustion is occurring during the expansion stroke. and 3) the natural thermal stratification increases around TDC. However. overly retarded combustion leads to unstable operation with partial-bum cycles resulting in high IMEPg variations and increased emissions. Enhanced natural thermal stratification by increased heat-transfer rates was explored by lowering the coolant temperature from 100 to 50¬∞C.

Highly-dynamic emissions instrumentation is implemented to provide real-time measurement of NOx and particulate. Engine subsystems are analyzed to understand their role in emissions formation. As the rate of pedal position change increases. the emissions of NOx and particulates are affected dramatically. An instantaneous load increase was found to produce peak NOx values 1.8 times higher and peak particulate concentrations an order of magnitude above levels corresponding to a five-second ramp-up.

1234211,Deploying power grid-integrated electric vehicles as a multi-agent system,2011,Sachin Kamboj and Willett Kempton and Keith S Decker,,,,13-20,,Grid-Integrated Vehicles (GIVs) are plug-in Electric Drive Vehicles (EDVs) with power-management and other controls that allow them to respond to external commands sent by power-grid operators. or their affiliates. when parked and plugged-in to the grid. At a bare minimum. such GIVs should respond to demand-management commands or pricing signals to delay. reduce or switch-off the rate of charging when the demand for electricity is high. In more advanced cases. these GIVs might sell both power and storage capacity back to the grid in any of the several electric power markets‚Äîa concept known as Vehicle-to-Grid power or V2G power. Although individual EDVs control too little power to sell in the market at an individual level. a large group of EDVs may form an aggregate or coalition that controls enough power to meaningfully sell. at a profit. in these markets. The profits made by such a coalition can then be used by the coalition members to offset the costs of the electric vehicles and batteries themselves. In this paper we describe an implemented and deployed multi-agent system that is used to integrate EDVs into the electricity grid managed by PJM. the largest transmission service operator in the world.

The design. based on a lumped element delay line. has a number of advantages. The rf field uniformity is significantly better than that of a saddle coil or slotted tube resonator. The improved Br homogeneity is needed to generate accurate multiecho pulse sequences. Using this coil. we obtain. as expected. the nearly linear increase in signal-to-noise as a function of frequency or static magnetic field I30 (I). The coil‚Äôs cylindrical symmetry allows quadrature drive and reception which decreases rf power requirements by a factor of two and increases signal-tonoise by a factor of fi (2). Our head-size coil and body-size coil operate at 64 MHz. Designs for operation at lower frequencies or somewhat higher frequencies are possible. Small scale versions of this coil design should be applicable to conventional NMR spectroscopy.The use of a superconducting solenoidal magnet for whole-body MR imaging requires a transverse rf field within a cylindrical volume. A perfectly homogeneous transverse magnetic field in an infinitely long cylinder can be produced by a surface current which runs along the length of the cylinder and is proportional to sin 8. where 0 is the cylindrical coordinate azimuthal angle. The conventional saddle coil (3) actually approximates the ideal sinusoidal current distribution for six equally spaced values of 0 (0= 0. 60. 120. 180. 240. 300‚Äù).

We have developed a highly effective decoupling scheme which allows us to use small surface coils in arbitrary orientations with respect to larger excitation coils and which eliminates interactions between the two. When a single surface coil is used as both transmitter and receiver. the radiofrequency excitation field is nonuniform. This nonuniform excitation makes it impossible to produce accurate flip angles over the sensitive region of the sample. This problem can be overcome if a larger coil. such as a large area surface coil or whole-body imaging coil is used for the excitation.

These reactions. often referred to as second O2 addition. or O2 + QOOH reactions. are believed to be responsible for low-temperature chain branching in hydrocarbon oxidation. The O2 + propyl system was chosen as a model system.

Variable reaction coordinate transition-state theory is used to characterize the barrierless transition states for the O2 + QOOH addition reactions as well as subsequent C3H6O3 dissociation reactions.

Because of the subsurface temperature profile of terrestrial storage sites. CO2 stored in these reservoirs is buoyant. As a result. a portion of the injected CO2 can escape if the reservoir is not appropriately sealed. We show that injecting CO2 into deep-sea sediments <3.000-m water depth and a few hundred meters of sediment provides permanent geologic storage even with large geomechanical perturbations. At the high pressures and low temperatures common in deep-sea sediments.

Here we present a method of CO2 disposal that is based on combining CO2 chemically with abundant raw materials to form stable carbonate minerals. A major advantage of this method is that the resulting waste product is thermodynamically stable and environmentally neutral. It is therefore possible to store large quantities permanently with minimal environmental impact and without the danger of an accidental release of CO2 which has proven fatal in quantities far smaller than contemplated here.

NM (US),Controlling the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere without limiting access to fossil energy resources is only possible if carbon dioxide is collected and disposed of away from the atmosphere. While it may be cost-advantageous to collect the carbon dioxide at concentrated sources without ever letting it enter the atmosphere. this approach is not available for the many diffuse sources of carbon dioxide. Similarly. for many older plants a retrofit to collect the carbon dioxide is either impossible or prohibitively expensive. For these cases we investigate the possibility of collecting the carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. We conclude that there are no fundamental obstacles to this approach and that it deserves further investigation.

1234347,Diesel engine transient operation: principles of operation and simulation analysis,2009,Constantine D Rakopoulos and Evangelos G Giakoumis,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Traditionally. the study of internal combustion engines operation has focused on the steady-state performance. However. the daily driving schedule of automotive and truck engines is inherently related to unsteady conditions. In fact. only a very small portion of a vehicle‚Äôs operating pattern is true steady-state. eg. when cruising on a motorway. Moreover. the most critical conditions encountered by industrial or marine engines are met during transients too. Unfortunately. the transient operation of turbocharged diesel engines has been associated with slow acceleration rate. hence poor driveability. and overshoot in particulate. gaseous and noise emissions. Despite the relatively large number of published papers. this very important subject has been treated in the past scarcely and only segmentally as regards reference books. Merely two chapters. one in the book Turbocharging the Internal Combustion Engine by N. Watson and MS Janota (McMillan Press. 1982) and another one written by DE Winterbone in the book The Thermodynamics and Gas Dynamics of Internal Combustion Engines. Vol. II edited by JH Horlock and DE Winterbone (Clarendon Press. 1986) are dedicated to transient operation. Both books. now out of print. were published a long time ago. Then. it seems reasonable to try to expand on these pioneering works. taking into account the recent technological advances and particularly the global concern about environmental pollution. which has intensified the research on transient (diesel) engine operation. typically through the Transient Cycles certification of new vehicles.,True,1-NXGy4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,425,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FSiOQxzs81UC&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=info:UlJDlznWufcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=rYsLTMmW-D&sig=f6r-lh1ihnocxJs8sF0_cr-b4Zs,17850534140898923090,/scholar?cites=17850534140898923090,,,,0,0,0

Density functional theory calculations using the generalized gradient approximation with the linearized augmented plane wave method were used to interpret the band gap narrowing.

Laser ablation. a technique widely used to deposit a variety of inorganic materials. can also be used as a simple and highly versatile method for forming thin polymer films. The data presented show that PTFE films can be produced on various supports by the evaporation of a solid PTFE target with a pulsed ultraviolet laser. The composition of the ablation plume suggests that PTFE ablation and subsequent film formation occur by way of a laser-induced pyrolitic decomposition with subsequent repolymerization. The polymer films produced by this method are composed of amorphous and highly crystalline regions. the latter being predominantly in a chain-folded configuration with the molecular axis aligned parallel to the substrate surface.,True,EOB-NScAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,199,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/262/5134/719.abstract,8944515772040849338,/scholar?cites=8944515772040849338,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48706992/science.262.5134.71920160909-18640-17sc2rp.pdf,0,0,0

People are concerned about the dangers of carcinogens in air. water. and food. and they expect their representatives in government to protect them from such hazards. On the other hand. the economic costs of eliminating every suspected carcinogen from the environment would cause tremendous economic hardship. How should policymakers use science to help strike a balance between the benefits of lowering the risk of cancer and the economic costs of regulation? In this important book the authors squarely address the complex interaction of science and regulatory policy. They begin by clarifying the scientific issues that are central to regulatory decisions. then explain how and why scientists can honestly disagree about these issues. They demonstrate with two cogent case studies: the heated debates about formaldehyde and benzene. both useful but potentially toxic chemicals. By examining how scientists evaluated the risks from these chemicals. and what kinds of legislative. administrative. and judicial decisions emerged from the evaluations. the authors furnish insight into the checks and balances of health-risk regulation. They point out that overselling science in this context is harmful to both science and democracy. Their final chapter proposes creative methods for constructing a bridge between the scientist and the regulator that will be invaluable to anyone concerned about health risks.,True,XmWXjosAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,159,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=P7VYT2YyE0kC&oi=fnd&pg=PP9&dq=info:JJ1QPOERr2oJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qfA7MdWuZw&sig=MRUr29W2ffDTw1RaH8s25WiGQ2Q,7687382748021955876,/scholar?cites=7687382748021955876,,,,0,0,0
