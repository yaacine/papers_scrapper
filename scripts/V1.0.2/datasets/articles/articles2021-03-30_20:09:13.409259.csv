Thus. they are used in many formulations in the chemical and textile industries and also as inhibitors of corrosion. Generally. sulfonamide derivatives are prepared using sulfonyl chlorides as the raw material. The methods often described in the literature involve the use of ammonia gas and pressure. A simple and direct method to prepare pure alkanesulfonamide derivatives possessing good surface properties is presented in this work. Thus. n‐dodecanesulfonyl chlorides obtained by photochemical sulfochlorination of n‐dodecane under visible light using sulfuryl chloride were separated from the reaction mixture. These sulfonyl chlorides. a mixture of primary and secondary isomers. were transformed in one step into N‐ethyldodecanesulfonamides.

Formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers BV,Dodecanesulfonates (isomer mixtures) have been synthesized by the process developed in our laboratory.    First. pseudoternary phase diagrams of water or (brine) decane/dodecanesulfonates-butan-1-ol systems were drawn and compared  with those of a commercial sample (Hostapur 60). In the presence of NaCl. a three-phase region (Winsor III) appears for the  two systems. and is larger with the home-made surfactants. This region is interesting in enhanced oil recovery because it  leads to very low interfacial tensions.        Then. the behavior of the Winsor III region was investigated as a function of the alcohol/surfactant mass ratio (C/T). At  a constant salinity (2.5 mass% NaCl) a value of 2 for C/T gives the best compromise for a larger WIII region with both systems.  For this ratio. optimal salinity values of 1.55 and 1.65 mass% for our sample and Hostapur 60. were found. respectively.  ,True,EtALEIoAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,7,https://akjournals.com/view/journals/10973/92/3/article-p759.xml,12323811350777788107,/scholar?cites=12323811350777788107,,https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/3077/1/azira_3077.pdf,0,0,0

The coal was added as a solid pore-forming agent. Pores sizes as large as a few micron were generated when the Yalloun coal was incorporated at a relatively high proportion. These pores were formed due to the burning out of the added coal during the thermal treatment conducted at 700°C. Results of phosphorus removal experiments showed that the increase of the amount of phosphorus removed could be positively correlated with the increase of the total pore volume and the mean pore size. Decreases in pore sizes and total pore volume were pronounced in sorbents used to remove phosphorus due to the formation of a Ca-phosphate mineral on their surfaces.

It was found that the crude CJ had a flocculating activity (FA) of 89±2.2% which is significantly higher than that of a powdery sample derived from a 60 C oven-dried CJ sample and which was about 37.8±2.5%. Interestingly. both crude and dried samples showed the ability to flocculate kaolin suspensions within a wide pH range from 3 to 11. The flocculating activity was found to increase with the presence of divalent and trivalent cations. The enhancement is more significant in the case of the 60 C oven-dried sample. Crude bioflocculant showed to be thermally stable.

1215857,What are the Health Risks of Occupational Exposure to Adhesive in the Shoe Industry?,2016,Imed Gargouri and Moncef Khadhraoui and Boubaker Elleuch,,,,,IntechOpen,The term “shoe” covers a wide range of products made from various materials. Organic solvents (OS) are components of various products such as the adhesives which are used in many industries. The shoe industry consumes large amounts of adhesives. This chemical risk assessment (CRA) is to validate the hypothesis of decreasing gradient of RA craft enterprises to industrial enterprises through the semi-industrial. The simplified methodology CRA of INRS was applied. For each chemical. a hazard class is assigned based on the sign. and then the potential exposure class is determined according to parameters “quantity and frequency of use”. Our RA process is complete with ambient measurements for solvents to which employees are most frequently exposed. Adhesives being constituted as solvent mixture. we have conventionally used an exposure index which is compared with the limit values. The simplified method CRA of INRS was chosen because it is one of the reference methods in RA established from the Kinney model. If these atmospheric samples and toxicology tests were made for the first time in the shoe industry in Sfax. they concerned a sample of companies of the three shoe manufacturing processes preceded by a preliminary RA with poststudy and inventory of products handled.,True,bcfLDXoAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,2,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=usKQDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA219&dq=info:vjJV4JB27uQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=t08qVoHzdg&sig=BKhSXFl1HYvpT6F5ricqGmDfhvc,16496252849715753662,/scholar?cites=16496252849715753662,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/adhesives-applications-and-properties/what-are-the-health-risks-of-occupational-exposure-to-adhesive-in-the-shoe-industry-,0,0,0

The used methods were also tested separately to see the extent of the treatment yield of each technique. Experiments were conducted in laboratory confectioned reactors under different operating conditions. Obtained results under the optimized experimental conditions show that both electrooxidation and electrocoagulation applied separately exhibited a limited performance towards suspended matter. chemical oxygen demand. color and turbidity removal. In fact. neither the electrooxidation nor the elecrocoagulation enabled to meet the discharge criteria of wastewater release into the receptor media. It was also noticed that the electrocoagulation favored the removal of suspended matter (95%) whereas the electrooxydation lead to an efficient color removal (96%). On another hand. conjunction of these processes enabled a high pollution reduction rate reaching nearly 98% in terms of color. chemical oxygen demand and suspended matters. The obtained results also indicate that the combination of the above mentioned processes reduced significantly the phytotoxicity of the wastewater and enhanced considerably its biodegradability exhibited through the drop of COD/BOD5 ratio. Based on this. it was suggested that conjunction of electrochemical processes could be another alternative for the enhancement of pollution removal efficiency from textile wastewaters.

With the aim to improve the flocculation stage in terms of reagents safety and ensure dyes removal. the present study explores the flocculating effectiveness of two natural. stable. and eco-friendly cactus formulations. namely 60 C oven-dried (DP) and lyophilized (LP) cladodes. Both formulations were assessed to treat cationic (Methylene blue; MB) and anionic (Methyl Orange; MO) dye solutions as a substitution attempt for the currently questioned employed synthetic chemical flocculants. Obtained results demonstrate that. in conjunction with alum as coagulant. the lyophilized powder (LP) bio-based flocculant appears to be the most efficient cactus formulation. showing a significant color (83%) and a turbidity (69%) abatement for the cationic dye (MB) and. respectively. 63% and 62% for the anionic one (MO). Additionally. the flocculation activity of the LP formula remained high over an eight-month period of storage. Moreover. based on the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis and the chemical characterization of cactus formulations. the occurring flocculation mechanisms of the dye removal are presumed to be based on both adsorption and bridging phenomena. Further. the significant color and turbidity decline achieved upon the addition of the lyophilized cactus cladodes powder (LP). enhancing thus the coagulation performance of the alum-based coagulant. proved the effectiveness of this bio …,True,bcfLDXoAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,1,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/9/1964,2320571504633866878,/scholar?cites=2320571504633866878,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/9/1964/pdf,0,0,0

The occupational health exposure assessment to these volatile chemicals is conducted through quantification of airborne concentrations inside the facilities. Indeed. the lack of such measurements in Tunisia pushed us to conduct the study. After identifying dry cleaners in Sfax city. we conducted door-to-door canvassing in 47 facilities. Then. the levels of perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in the indoor air are measured in two sampling positions: fixed and individual. The pollutants are adsorbed with charcoal sorbent tubes where their amounts correspond to given air volumes that are suctioned through the pump. It is later used to calculate their mean concentrations. These solvents are desorbed using carbon disulfide and analyzed by gas chromatography—flame ionization detection. After the analytical validation of the protocol. 19 air samples were quantified. The measured concentrations of TCE are close to the occupational exposure limit value in almost all facilities. whereas the PCE concentrations are about half of the OELV.

This is because biomolecular systems function in a multicomponent molecular network under out-of-equilibrium conditions.

For instance. a monomer that spontaneously nucleates itself cannot be processed in a manner consistent with LSP. Herein. we report a new method for such a “reactive” monomer. We use a ‘dummy’ monomer which has a similar structure to the reactive monomer but is incapable of one-dimensional supramolecular polymerization. We show that in the presence of the dummy monomer. the reactive monomer is kinetically trapped in the dormant state. In this way. spontaneous nucleation of the reactive monomer is retarded; yet. addition of seeds of a supramolecular polymer can initiate the supramolecular polymerization in a chain growth manner. As a result. we obtain the supramolecular polymer of the reactive monomer with a controlled length. which …,True,YB73eOQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,11,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/sc/c9sc02151e,16624476498711186762,/scholar?cites=16624476498711186762,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/sc/c9sc02151e,0,0,0

However. molecular basis for this pathway remains unclear. Here we employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study two complexes. ValRS·tRNAval·Val-AMP (complex V) and ValRS·tRNAval·Thr-AMP (complex T). and compared their simulation trajectories. in order to understand how the pre-transfer editing pathway is triggered by the noncognate substrate Thr-AMP. The MD simulations showed that the binding of Thr-AMP to ValRS led to different motions from those in complex V: clockwise rotation of the editing domain along the hinge region. and strong motions in the catalytic domain. especially in KMSKS loop. We found that the changed motion of Trp495 induced by Thr-AMP serves as a signal to discriminate Thr-AMP from Val-AMP. and the rigid 491ILFL494 …,True,C49y7YQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,5,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00894-010-0754-0,6173595728459605788,/scholar?cites=6173595728459605788,,,0,0,0

They catalyze the esterification of specific amino acids to the 3′-end of their cognate tRNAs and therefore play a pivotal role in protein synthesis. Although previous studies suggest that aaRS-dependent errors in protein synthesis can be beneficial to some microbial species. evidence that reduced aaRS fidelity can be adaptive is limited. Using bioinformatics analyses. we identified two distinct leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) genes within all genomes of the archaeal family Sulfolobaceae. Remarkably. one copy. designated LeuRS-I. had key amino acid substitutions within its editing domain that would be expected to disrupt hydrolytic editing of mischarged tRNALeu and to result in variation within the proteome of these extremophiles.

The non-enzymatic replication of RNA was likely a key step in the evolution of simple cellular life from prebiotic chemistry. In the current model of template-directed polymerization of activated monomers. the chemical copying of RNA always generates a mixture of 3′–5′ and 2′–5′ backbone linkages due to the similar nucleophilicity and orientation of the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups on the ribose.

The conformations of the ribose/deoxyribose can be elegantly described using the concept of pseudorotation (Altona and Sundaralingam. 1972). and are dominated by the C2′- and C3′-endo conformers. The free energy barrier of the transition between these two major puckering modes can be probed by NMR relaxation experiments (Johnson and Hoogstraten. 2008). but an atomic picture of the transition path per se is only available for several truncated nucleoside analogues (Brameld & Goddard III. 1999).

Most scenarios of Darwinian evolution at the molecular level require self-replicators capable of exponential growth. yet only very few exponential replicators have been reported to date and general design criteria for exponential replication are lacking. Here we show that a peptide-functionalized macrocyclic self-replicator exhibits exponential growth when subjected to mild agitation. The replicator self-assembles into elongated fibres of which the ends promote replication and fibre growth. Agitation results in breakage of the growing fibres. generating more fibre ends.

Analysis of separate dynamic combinatorial libraries made from one of six peptide-functionalized building blocks of different hydrophobicity revealed two selection criteria that govern the emergence of replicators from these systems. First. the replicators need to have a critical macrocycle size that endows them with sufficient multivalency to enable their self-assembly into fibrils. Second. efficient replication occurs only for library members that are of low abundance in the absence of a replication pathway.

While defining life is surprisingly difficult. it is generally accepted the life requires the following key ingredients: compartmentalization1. metabolism2 and reproduction3. Thus far. research in this area has proceeded along mostly separate lines in which chemical systems that model one or two of these three ingredients took centre stage. 4 However. bringing all these lines of research together in one system will help us have a much better understanding of the origin of life.A sophisticated way to fabricate such a chemical system is investigating the emergence of compartments (compartmentalization) made from self-replicating molecules (reproduction) from a network of interconverting molecules (a primitive form of metabolism). Such network can be created by the Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry5 (DCC) approach.

Inkjet printing has provided outstanding results for flexible ohmic sensors in terms of reproducibility of their resistance. However. the reproducibility of the sensitivity. the most critical parameter for sensing application. has been only marginally assessed. In the present paper. CNN-based resistive strain sensors fabricated by inkjet-printing on flexible Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene (EFTE) sheets are presented. The variability on the device initial resistance is studied for 5 different batches of sensors from 3 to 72 devices each. The variability ranges between 8.4% and 43% depending on the size of the batches. with a 20% average.

The development of plasticity also triggers a thermal dissipation due to local mechanical irreversibilities. These phenomena conduct to a heterogeneous state of deformation and temperature which has never been simultaneously observed at the micrometric scale. In this paper. an original experimental setup is presented in order to obtain fully coupled measurements. The objective is to get at the same time strain and temperature fields in the same zone at the microstructure scale of an AISI 316L austenitic stainless steel specimen during a tensile test.

For the first time. this investigation is conducted on a specimen containing hundred of grains. We use a unique experimental setup to access—simultaneously in-situ and in real time—strain and temperature fields of an austenitic stainless steel under tensile loading. We show that strain fields are directly linked to the expression of plasticity at the grain scale. We show. on the other hand. that thermal fields at the last increment of deformation are linked to the microstructural expression of plasticity on a larger lengthscale corresponding. instead. to grain clusters.

These flexible composites that deform in response to an externally applied magnetic field are of special interest in advanced engineering applications such as actuators. artificial muscles or shape control.

In this study. we propose a framework—relying on both specially designed samples and a dedicated experimental setup—to characterize experimentally the coupled magneto-mechanical response of MREs since magnetization within the sample is nearly uniform and structural-dependent effects are minimized.

The non-intuitive interplay between magnetic field and elastic deformation owes to material and geometry selection. namely a ferromagnetic particle composite film bonded on a compliant passive foundation. Cooperation of the two otherwise independent loading mechanisms-mechanical pre-compression and magnetic field-allows one to bring the structure near a marginally stable state and then destabilize it with either magnetic or mechanical fields.

We were thus able to study the influence of the microstructure on strain localization as well as the process of localization in OFHC copper submitted to high-strain rate loading at different rates.

Cham,Magnetorheological elastomers (MREs) are active composite materials that deform under a magnetic field because they are made of a soft elastomer matrix filled with magnetizable micrometric particles. Along with short response times and low magnetic inputs. not only do MREs alter their viscoelastic properties and stiffness in response to external magnetic fields but they can also undergo very high deformation states. While the former effect can be exploited in controllable-stiffness devices. the latter is of interest for haptic devices such as tactile interfaces for the visually impaired. In the perspective of developing a persistent tactile MRE surface exhibiting reversible and large out-of-plane deformations. the first part of this work focuses on the fabrication of MREs that can sustain large deformations. In particular. we determine the critical strain threshold up to which the interfacial adhesion between particles and …,True,UVCnrx4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21762-8_32,16159398993916653175,/scholar?cites=16159398993916653175,,,0,0,0

Here. a way to control the propagation of nanogaps in monolayer graphene during electroburning is demonstrated. A tightly focused femtosecond laser beam is used to induce defects in graphene according to selected patterns. It is shown that. contrary to the pristine graphene devices where nanogap position and shape are uncontrolled. the nanogaps in prepatterned devices propagate along the defect line created by the femtosecond laser. Using passive voltage contrast combined with atomic force microscopy. the reproducibility of the process with a 92% success rate over 26 devices is confirmed.

Carbonyl iron powder. composed of mechanically soft spherical particles with a median size of 3.5 μm and a volume concentration of 3.5%. was mixed in a soft silicone matrix (Shore 00-20); the compound was then degassed and cured under temperature. The presence of a homogeneous magnetic field of 0.3 T during the curing process allowed the formation of particle chains.

Many fine-grain models have been devised to account for CNT motions in carbon nanotube networks (CNN). However. the validation of these models relies on mesoscopic or macroscopic data with very little experimental validation of the physical mechanisms actually arising at the CNT scale. In the present paper. we use in-situ scanning electron microscopy imaging and high-resolution digital image correlation to uncover prominent mechanisms of CNT motions in CNNs under strain. Results show that thin and sparse CNNs feature stronger strain heterogeneities than thicker and denser ones. It is attributed to the complex motions of individual CNTs connected to aggregates within thin and sparse CNNs.

One of the main features of these compounds relies on their ability to form inclusion complexes with cationic and neutral species. This feature. together with their water solubility and apparent biological compatibility. had enabled them to emerge as one the most important host receptors in supramolecular chemistry. Attachment of hydrophobic alkyl chains to these compounds leads to the formation of macrocyclic host molecules with amphiphilic properties. Like other oligomeric surfactants. these compounds present improved performance with respect to their monomeric counterparts. In addition. they hold their recognition abilities and present several structural features that depend on the size of the macrocycle and on the length of the alkyl chain. such as preorganization. flexibility and adopted conformations. which make these molecules very interesting to study structure-aggregation relationships. Moreover. the recognition abilities of p-sulfonatocalixarenes enable them to be applied in the design of amphiphiles constructed from non-covalent. rather than covalent. bonds (supramolecular amphiphiles). In this review. we summarize the developments made on the design and synthesis of p-sulfonatocalixarenes-based surfactants. the characterization of their self-assembly properties and on how their structure affects these properties.

The thermodynamic parameters for the complexation of alkali metal cations and Ag+ were obtained for the first time at neutral pH. The Na+ cation is routinely present as counterion of the calixarene in neutral aqueous solution. and this must be taken into account in the determination of the thermodynamic parameters for the complexation of Na+ and the other cations by considering a sequential or a competitive binding scheme. The ΔH° and ΔS° values show that the inclusion process is entropically driven. although an influence of the temperature on the complexation reaction indicates that the enthalpic term is also an important contributor.

The combination of ITC parameters (binding constants and complexation enthalpy and entropy) and NMR chemical shifts and NOE cross-peaks obtained upon complexation allows us to propose different binding modes. The results point out that the spacer length has an influence on the binding stoichiometry. The bolaforms with larger spacer lengths between polar head groups enable the formation of 2:1 complexes in addition to 1:1. while with the shorter spacer they form only 1:1 complexes. On the other hand. the formation of 1:1 complexes is not affected by the headgroup volume or the spacer length of the bolaform.

Herein. we developed a light-triggerable formulation that takes advantage of host–guest chemistry to complex drugs functionalized with a guest molecule and release it after exposure to near infrared (NIR) light due to the disruption of the non-covalent host–guest interactions. The system is composed by a gold nanorod (AuNR). which generates plasmonic heat after exposure to NIR. a thin layer of hyaluronic acid immobilized to the AuNR upon functionalization with a macrocycle. cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]). and a drug functionalized with a guest molecule that interacts with the macrocycle. For proof of concept. we have used this formulation for the intracellular release of a derivative of retinoic acid (RA). a molecule known to play a key role in tissue development and homeostasis as well as during cancer treatment. We showed that the formulation was able to conjugate approximately 65 μg of RA derivative per mg of CB[6] @AuNR and released it within a few minutes after exposure to a NIR laser. Importantly. the bioactivity of RA released from the formulation was demonstrated in a reporter cell line expressing luciferase under the control of the RA receptor.

The 99mTc-labelled HYNIC-tetrazine was synthesized in 75% yield and exhibited high stability in vitro and in vivo. A trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-labelled bisphosphonate (TCO-BP) that binds to regions of active calcium metabolism was used to evaluate the utility of the labelled tetrazine for bioorthogonal chemistry. The pretargeting approach. with 99mTc-HYNIC-tetrazine administered to mice one hour after TCO-BP. showed significant uptake of radioactivity in regions of active bone metabolism (knees and shoulders) at 6 hours post-injection. For comparison. TCO-BP was reacted with 99mTc-HYNIC-tetrazine before injection and this active targeting also showed high specific uptake in the knees and shoulders. whereas control 99mTc-HYNIC-tetrazine alone did not. A TCO-vancomycin derivative was similarly employed for targeting Staphylococcus aureus infection in vitro and in vivo. Pretargeting and active targeting strategies showed 2.5- and 3-fold uptake. respectively. at the sites of a calf-muscle infection in a murine model. compared to the contralateral control muscle. These results demonstrate the utility of the 99mTc-HYNIC-tetrazine for preparing new technetium radiopharmaceuticals. including those based on small molecule targeting constructs containing TCO. using either active or pretargeting strategies.,True,ml5uH3YAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167425,2532837108813303578,/scholar?cites=2532837108813303578,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167425,0,0,0

Second-generation antihistamines are more lipophobic than first-generation antihistamines and are thought to lack central nervous system (CNS) and cholinergic effects when given at therapeutic doses. 2 Fexofenadine hydrochloride. the active ingredient of Allegra and Telfast. is a second-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonist with the chemical name (±)-4-[1-hydroxy-4-[4-(hydroxyldiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinyl]-butyl]-α. α-dimethylbenzeneacetic acid hydrochloride. and has the chemical structure shown in Fig. 1 (a).

The inhibition efficiency of the investigated compounds was found to increase with increasing the concentration of inhibitor and with decreasing the temperature. The addition of KI to p-aminoazobenzene derivatives increased the inhibition efficiency due to synergistic effect. The presence of iodide ions in the solution stabilized the adsorption of these compounds on the steel surface and. therefore. improved the inhibition efficiency.

Compared to other heteroatoms commonly seen in organic materials. phosphorus offers a unique and distinct geometry as well as electronic properties [1]. Both the trivalent and pentavalent forms of phosphorus offer a pyramidal geometry (Figure 12.1). Because of this geometry. the lone pair of the trivalent phosphorus center in heteroarenes is accessible as a Lewis base for further functionalization. giving rise to the pentavalent species.

RNAi has been quickly and widely applied to discover gene functions and holds great potential to provide a new class of therapeutic agents. However. new chemistry and delivery approaches are greatly needed to silence disease-causing genes without toxic effects. We reasoned that conjugation of the cholesterol moiety to cationic lipids would enhance RNAi efficiencies and lower the toxic effects of lipid-mediated RNAi delivery.

1216106,Methane conversion at low temperature: the combined application of catalysis and non-equilibrium plasma,2004,Barbara Pietruszka and Moritz Heintze,90,Catalysis Today,1-2,151-158,Elsevier,The combined oxygen-steam reforming of methane was investigated in a non-thermal plasma or dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD). It was found that only CH4 and O2 were converted in the plasma. whereas no net conversion of water was detected. A comparison was made between the DBD reactor with an empty discharge gap and with the discharge gap filled by a dielectric material. In the latter arrangement a Ni catalyst on α-alumina was compared with the pure catalyst support. Experimental data are also compared with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Plasma activation leads to CO as a main product. which then however oxidises to CO2 when the catalyst becomes active (>300 °C).

Proceedings of the International Conference",,255,Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. Department of Construction Economics & Property,Curtain walling (CW) systems are expected to perform an increasingly active role within the overall structure of buildings but their mean values of thermal transmittance are above 1. 5 W/(m2. K) and should be reduced to meet the energy efficiency requirements for new constructions. The weakest part of the CW structure is the frame section and improvement of its thermal transmittance will be crucial to reduce the overall UCW values. This can be achieved by inserting an insulation material in small spaces between the glass units in the frame section.

The construction of these biosensors requires the genetic insertion of a judiciously chosen molecular recognition element between two distinct hues of FP. When the molecular recognition element interacts with the analyte of interest and undergoes a conformational change. the ratiometric emission of the construct is altered due to a change in the FRET efficiency. The sensitivity of such biosensors is proportional to the change in ratiometric emission. and so there is a pressing need for methods to maximize the ratiometric change of existing biosensor constructs in order to increase the breadth of their utility. To accelerate the development and optimization of improved FRET-based biosensors. we have developed a method for function-based high-throughput screening of biosensor variants in colonies of Escherichia coli. We have demonstrated this technology by undertaking the optimization of a biosensor for detection of methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27). This effort involved the construction and screening of 3 distinct libraries: a domain library that included several engineered binding domains isolated by phage-display; a lower-resolution linker library; and a higher-resolution linker library. Application of this library screening methodology led to the identification of an optimized H3K27-trimethylation biosensor that exhibited an emission ratio change (66%) that was 2.3 × improved relative to that of the initially constructed biosensor (29%).,True,aNnvocIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,41,https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6750-11-105,7915940357423345648,/scholar?cites=7915940357423345648,,https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6750-11-105,0,0,0

The decrease of the distance among nearest neighbour molecules can give rise to reactive configurations reflecting the crystal arrangement and leading to association processes. In this context. the role of the H-bonds is very peculiar because their usual strengthening with rising pressure does not necessarily configure a decrease of the reaction activation energy but. on the contrary. can give rise to an anomalous stability of the system. In spite of this central role. the mechanisms by which a chemical reaction is favoured or prevented by H-bonding under high pressure conditions is a poorly explored field.

The reaction products. identified by infrared and Raman spectroscopy. indicate a quite selective reactivity ascribable to the two main dissociation channels involving the splitting of the O–H and C–O bonds of ethanol. The ethoxy radical. obtained through the splitting of the O–H bond. has been identified as the main responsible for the phosphorus reactivity. giving rise to triethylphosphate.

Emission and excitation spectra have been measured as a function of pressure on samples compressed in a diamond anvil cell. The different two-photon absorption cross sections to the nπ* and ππ* excited states account for the selectivity in the excitation wavelength observed in the high pressure photoinduced reactivity. The comparison between excitation and emission spectra highlights a remarkable red shift with rising pressure of the higher electronic excited states having ππ* character. which contrasts with the pressure insensitivity of the lowest nπ* states. Pressure is therefore extremely efficient at progressively destabilizing the π bonding orbitals. causing a reduction of the ring aromaticity. and driving the high pressure reactivity.,True,yL7SzwgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,10,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp502020g,9443052369153948911,/scholar?cites=9443052369153948911,,,0,0,0

The formation of these attracting materials is ascribed to stress anisotropy induced by uniaxial compression. In the case of aniline. the attainment of NH2-enriched carbon nanothreads above 30 GPa is related to the intrinsic crystal anisotropy due to the presence of strong directional H-bonds.

As an independent NC microreactor. the carboxyl-terminated hydrogel microspheres were synthesized by seeded copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with micrometer-sized PS seed particles. The as-obtained latices can effectively capture guest metal ion components due to the abundant carboxyl groups on their surfaces. followed by the introduction of chalcogenides. and hence the in-situ generation of higheruptake NCs was realized.

Improvement based on selection of these traits requires a comprehensive understanding of their inheritance. This study estimated quantitative genetic parameters for 20 traits related to three key objectives for the genetic improvement of hop: cone chemistry. cone yield and agronomic characteristics. Significant heritable genetic variation was identified for α-acid and β-acid. as well as their components and relative proportions. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability for these traits (h                     2                    = 0.15 to 0.29) were lower than those reported in previous hop studies. but were based on a broader suite of families (108 from European.

This transition has been achieved through production based on imported varieties grown in Australia (such as Cascade and Willamette). exploration of the flavour potential of established Australian varieties (such as Topaz). and the flavour potential arising from an intensive new variety development program. which has been targeting aroma and flavour since the mid 1980s (resulting in varieties such as Helga [previously Southern Hallertau].

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,,11856-11861,,Lignin is a polymer that is mainly present in plant cell walls. where it provides strength. defense. and allows for water transport through the plant. There is wide interest in understanding the process of lignin biosynthesis and deposition because of its economic relevance. Plant varieties with altered lignin content and composition can have improved performance as fodder crops or in the production of paper and pulp. By studying natural mutants and some genetically engineered transgenic plants. we have come to appreciate that plants can make their crucial lignins with considerable flexibility. A new step in the biosynthesis of the “monolignol” building blocks from which lignin polymers are made was recently discovered in various angiosperm plants. Here. collaborators at Scion in New Zealand have found that a similar gene operates in gymnosperm (eg. pine) plants. and that down-regulating this gene also profoundly affects the lignin composition and structure. For example. in normal pine the monolignol p-coumaryl alcohol only contributes typically 1% toward the polymer; when the gene was down-regulated here. the contribution increased to over 30%. as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Such studies provide the foundations for understanding digestibility limitations for current research aimed at improving the utilization of our crop and forest plant resources.Technical Abstract: The enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) is involved in the production of methoxylated monolignols that are precursors to guaiacyl and syringyl lignin in angiosperm species.

The method uses two miniature accelerometers coupled to the bark of a growing seedling stem to record the acoustic signals and a small striker to generate an acoustic pulse. The two acoustic signals are then time-windowed and cross-correlated in order to calculate the speed of the acoustic pulse. The method measures the sound speed of the seedling stem as a whole and does not selectively measure the fastest path. The method was tested on 1- and 2-year-old Pinus radiata clones.

This is achieved by degrading unmethylated and methylated wood by thioacidolysis and analyzing the resultant product mixtures by quantitative 31P NMR spectroscopy. Applying this new method to compression wood and normal wood from Pinus radiata showed that. whereas 41–47% of etherified guaiacyl C-9 units are condensed at the C5 position. almost all phenolic guaiacyl C-9 units exist as uncondensed moieties. Analysis of milled wood lignin (MWL) isolated from the same wood by 31P NMR spectroscopy before and after thioacidolysis showed that the phenolic guaiacyl C-9 units were more condensed than those in the in situ lignin. This is likely due to partial cleavage of the more condensed etherified linkages during the lignin isolation …,True,yJfUAH4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,11,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf203285r,4869611422585898639,/scholar?cites=4869611422585898639,,,0,0,0

1216314,Chemical characterisation of compression wood in plantation grown Pinus radiata,2007,Bernadette Nanayakkara,,,,,,The primary objective of this study was to find out if changes in chemistry could be used to quantify Pinus radiata compression wood severity or degree of compression wood development. Basic chemical composition and the lignin structure was assessed for a range of different compression wood samples sourced from juvenile wood. mature wood. earlywood. latewood. branches. knots. 2-year and 1-year old Pinus radiata. Fluorescence microscopy was used as the reference method to assess the degree of compression wood development. Lignin structure of compression wood was studied by thioacidolysis. size exclusion chromatography. and thioacidolysis/31P NMR spectroscopy. Variation in the basic chemical composition and lignin structure with compression wood severity was ascertained. Results showed that. as the severity of compression wood changed. progressively from normal through mild to severe. all chemical parameters commonly associated with compression wood changed concurrently. With increasing severity lignin and galactose levels increased while glucose and mannose levels decreased. Lignin structural changes were also associated with changing severity of compression wood. Levels of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) releasable β-ethers increased and guaiacyl (G) releasable β-ethers decreased. Similarly. levels of uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl units increased. while uncondensed guaiacyl units decreased.

Wood formation involves both cell division and cell differentiation including cell expansion. secondary wall formation. lignification. and programmed cell death. As a tree gets older. the type of wood that is formed changes. During the first 10 or so years of growth. juvenile wood is formed. which is characterized typically by fast growth rate. low basic density. low stiffness. short fibers. and more abundant reaction wood. Wood has two main physiological functions: to conduct water from roots to leaves and to support the branches and crown in large trees.

NMR is one of the preeminent structural tools. but obtaining high-resolution solution-state spectra has typically required fractionation and isolation of components of interest. With recent methods for dissolution of. admittedly. finely divided plant cell wall material. the wall can now be studied by solution-state NMR. Exploiting the dispersion of 2D (and even 3D) NMR allows strikingly detailed structural analysis of the wall components without the need for isolation and fractionation. The initial method utilized acetylation of the wall to prepare optimal samples for NMR. but more recently we avoid the acetylation step; spectra from unacetylated walls have improved resolution of some components and allow natural acetylation (of polysaccharides and lignins) to be readily identified. The structural “fingerprint” of the cell wall produced by 2D 13C–1H correlative NMR experiments is potentially unmatched by any other spectroscopy. Dissolution/NMR methods therefore potentially lend themselves well to chemometrics methods once the issues of dealing with multivariate analyses on 2D NMR data have been addressed.

Lane and Zheng Gu and Jianquan Wang,27,Bioconjugate Chem.,,809−814,,Diagnostics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) commonly employ the use of fluorescent thioflavin derivatives having affinity for the amyloid-β (Aβ) proteins associated with AD progression. However. thioflavin probes have limitations in their diagnostic capabilities arising from a number of undesireable qualities. including poor photostability. weak emission intensity. and high emission overlap with the backgound tissue autofluorescence. To overcome such limitations. we have developed nanoformulated probes consisting of a red-emitting fluorescent quantum dot (QD) core encapsulated in a PEGylated shell with benzotriazole (BTA) targeting molecules on the surface (QD-PEG-BTA). The combination of strong red fluorescence. multivalent binding. and decreased backgound signal and nonspecific binding provided the ability of the QD-PEG-BTA probes to achieve detection sensitivites 4 orders of magnitude greater than …,True,0w18nDcAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,14,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00019,7522505391302276778,/scholar?cites=7522505391302276778,,,0,0,0

In many cases. chemical transformations of guest molecules confined within solid host structures proceed with a high degree of selectivity toward a single product. and often with a high degree of stereoselectivity and/or enantioselectivity. as a consequence of the geometrical constraints imposed on the reacting molecules by the host structure. For this reason. the products obtained from such reactions are often significantly different from those obtained from the corresponding reactions in the solution state or in the “pure …,True,OSwbcBcAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470661345.smc164,8350039981107404561,/scholar?cites=8350039981107404561,,,0,0,0

1216377,New Strategies for Exploring Crystallization Processes of Organic Materials,2012,Kenneth DM Harris and Colan E Hughes and Benjamin A Palmer and François Guillaume,43,Transactions of the American Crystallographic Association,,97-112,,Crystal growth processes are crucially important in many aspects of biological and physical sciences. In many situations. however. the outcome of crystallization processes (in terms of the polymorphic form or the morphological properties of the crystals obtained) can be difficult to control. such that it is often challenging to achieve a desired outcome in a reliable and reproducible manner. Progress in this regard will rely to a large extent on improving the current level of fundamental physico-chemical understanding of crystallization processes. This paper gives an overview of two experimental strategies that have been developed recently for exploring fundamental aspects of crystallization processes. First. we describe an in-situ solid-state NMR strategy for monitoring the evolution of the different polymorphs (or other solid forms) that are present as a function of time during crystallization from solution. As an illustrative example. we describe the application of this strategy to investigate the evolution of polymorphic forms during the crystallization of glycine from different solvent systems. Second. we highlight a strategy for retrospective analysis of the growth history of crystals. based on analysis of well-defined variations in the composition of the crystal using confocal Raman microspectrometry. The utility of this strategy to yield insights on changes in crystal morphology during crystal growth is illustrated in the case of urea inclusion compounds prepared by crystallization under conditions of competitive co-inclusion of two different types of guest molecule.,True,OSwbcBcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,3,http://aca.360psg.com/documents/2012%20Transactions/Harris%2097-112.pdf,10337447285566211026,/scholar?cites=10337447285566211026,,http://aca.360psg.com/documents/2012%20Transactions/Harris%2097-112.pdf,0,0,0

For the hydrophilic PVA membrane. the total flux (at 55 0C) for the ethanol-water system decreased from 0.45 to 0.05 kg/m2/hr as the feed ethanolconcentration was increased from 30 to 95 wt.%. The separation factor (water/ethanol) was found to increase by about 100 times for the same range of concentration.

The UNIQUAC theory successfully takes into account the nonidealitiespresent in the alcohol/water-PVA membrane system. The transport of waterand alcohol species through the PVA membrane was modeled using the UNIQUACtheory in conjunction with the conventional activity driving force model. Using themodel and the experimental pervaporation data. the diffusivity correlations andconcentration profiles for various species through the membrane were developed.

To demonstrate the double-checked advantages of probe B+. a near-infrared probe (A) was also prepared by modification of a near-infrared rhodamine dye with ethylenediamine to produce a closed spirolactam residue. Under basic conditions. probe B+ shows only weak fluorescence from the cyanine acceptor while probe A displays nonfluorescence due to retention of the closed spirolactam form of the rhodamine moiety. Upon decrease in solution pH level. probe B+ exhibits a gradual fluorescence increase from rhodamine and cyanine constituents at 623 nm and 743 nm respectively. whereas probe A displays fluorescence increase at 623 nm on the rhodamine moiety as acidic conditions leads to the rupture of the probe spirolactam rings. Probes A and B+ have successfully been used to monitor intracellular pH alternations and possess pK a values of 5.15 and 7.80. respectively.

In both probes. an acetyl group is attached to the phenolic oxygen atom of the hemicyanine platform to decrease the probe fluorescence background. Probe A displays sensitive fluorescence responses and binds preferentially to Zn (II) ions over other metal ions such as Cd 2+ ions with a low detection limit of 0.45 nM. In contrast. the emission spectra of probe B is not significantly affected if Zn (II) ions are added. Probe A possesses excellent membrane permeability and low cytotoxicity. allowing for sensitive imaging of both exogenously supplemented Zn (II) ions in live cells. and endogenously releases Zn (II) ions in cells after treatment of 2. 2-dithiodipyridine.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered to be viable alternatives. because they are broad spectrum and bacteria develop little or no resistance towards AMPs. Interestingly. only few AMPs are used as therapeutics. due to problems such as host toxicity. protease cleavage and short half-life. Therefore. there is a need to improve the efficacy of AMPs by the use of D-peptides and/or delivery vehicles. The introduction of the thesis describes the diversity and various mechanisms of action (MOA) of AMPs. The issues and ways to improve the efficacy of AMPs. which forms the foundation of this thesis. are also discussed. Recently. hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) has gained attention due to its excellent biocompatibility. multifunctionality and long blood circulation time. The body of the thesis describes a methodology to covalently attach aurein 2.2 and its mutants to HPG and study the influence of the molecular weight on the antimicrobial activity. A peptide array was used to design tryptophan and arginine mutants of aurein 2.2. Mutant peptide 77 had significantly superior antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity compared to aurein 2.2 but was more toxic. We found that HPG can be used as a general scaffold to alleviate the toxicity of the peptides. The conjugates/peptides were tested in an in vivo mice skin infection (abscess) model.

Seven hundred master of education students (prospective teachers) were randomly selected from seven Pakistani public universities. Method: Survey method was used to collect data from the sample. Five hundred and sixteen respondents completed the questionnaire. From factor analysis. three factors emerged: entrepreneurial intent and acceptability. entrepreneurial effort and entrepreneurial motivation. Perceptions on the conceptual variables of locus of control. self-efficacy. subjective norms. instrumental readiness and entrepreneurial intentions were also derived. Results: The majority of prospective teachers were found to be positive towards entrepreneurship at all seven universities. Conclusion: Most of the prospective teachers were positively inclined towards entrepreneurship. There was some impact of demographic variables such as university and course attended. parental level of education and gender. Females exhibited a higher entrepreneurial profile (in terms of working hard and entrepreneurial motivation) at most of the universities. The implications for practice and policy are discussed.(Contains 8 tables.),True,7Lg1kpgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,37,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ860820,16363691902907891835,/scholar?cites=16363691902907891835,,https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ860820.pdf,0,0,0

Students in Cape Verde and Pakistan worked through different versions of two instructional programmes intended to teach the visualisation of reflection or rotation respectively in diagrams of three‐dimensional structures. The three versions of the Reflections Programme were concerned respectively with reflections across a different Cartesian plane; the three versions of the Rotations Programme were concerned respectively with rotations about a different Cartesian axis. The results on a post‐test indicated that all six programmes were successful on teaching the particular task in connection with the Cartesian plane or axis in which it had specialised. However. none of the programmes was successful in bringing about any learning to reflect across a different plane. or to rotate about a different axis.,True,7Lg1kpgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,33,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8279.1984.tb02591.x,2686630086834597084,/scholar?cites=2686630086834597084,,,0,0,0

Three hundred and fifty students from the six public sector Pakistani universities returned questionnaires. Assessment framework. learning activities and instructional strategies emerged from factor analysis as common factors. Students' views on five conceptual variables were also analysed: instructional design. active teaching. learning activities. questioning styles; and assessment framework. University teaching in Pakistan was found to be driven by assessment.

Lahore. 54590 Pakistan,Aim of this study was to investigate the availability and utilizations of existing resources of the libraries of those universities and GCETs where ADE and B. Ed.(Hons) elementary programs were launched during the year 2010–2011. Total 70% GCETs and 80% universities were included in the study. Teachers and students were selected as sample on the basis of their availability. The data for this survey was collected through a checklist and questionnaires for both teachers and students. The results revealed that libraries are underutilized despite teachers‟ and students‟ expressed willingness to use libraries. Lack of human and material resources was the main reason for underutilization. Student mostly visit library for reading books. preparation of assignment and consume spare time. Library staff needed professional training. procedures for purchase of library resources need simplification for timely procurement. virtual linkage with national and international libraries needs to be addressed. and enhanced funding and proper utilization of funding is required for improved efficiency. The libraries in GCETs were comparatively more dilapidated than libraries in Universities. It is concluded that improved library services and provisions can enhance the relevance and utilization of libraries.,True,7Lg1kpgAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,18,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1210449,5060940200149658274,/scholar?cites=5060940200149658274,,https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1210449.pdf,0,0,0

Esentepe Campus. Adapazari 54000. Turkey,Computer assisted assessment (CAA) is a common technique of assessment in higher educational institutions in Western countries. but a relatively new concept for students and teachers in Pakistan. It was therefore interesting to investigate students’ perceptions about CAA practices from different universities of Pakistan. Information was collected through a questionnaire. completed by 1877 students. It was concluded that overall sampled students were aware of CAA. Comparatively. female students were found to be more highly inclined towards CAA. Sampled students from different departments (ie. Commerce. Mathematics and Pharmacy) and from universities D and E showed a particularly positive attitude towards CAA. However. overall sampled students felt that CAA overburdened them. and created some administrative and managerial problems. so teachers should probably avoid using this technique of assessment as routine. Prominent advantages regarding CAA referred to by the students included time saving. being more interesting. and being unbiased. Disadvantages included hardware and software related problems during examination.,True,7Lg1kpgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,18,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ989218,17054475470959944002,/scholar?cites=17054475470959944002,,https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ989218.pdf,0,0,0

Esentepe Campus. Adapazari 54000. Turkey,An analysis of Information Technology knowledge of Hungarian and Romanian students was made with the help of a self developed web based Informatics Test. The goal of this research is an analysis of the Computer Science knowledge level of Hungarian and Romanian students attending a Science course or a Mathematics-Informatics course. Analysed was how effectively can students from different grades answer questions dealing with different subjects. After having evaluated the test results correctness of the original presumption emerged. Significance level was 5% through the analysis. It was found significant divergence in knowledge of Hungarian students and Romanian students attending a science course (Profil Real) and a Mathematics-Informatics course. Romanian students attending a science course and a Mathematics-Informatics course scored higher in programming than their Hungarian counterparts specialized in Informatics in the 11th grade. After the calculating values of the partial correlation we have got same results by subjects too.After the evaluation a final conclusion can be made: Romanian students of the Real Profile have the same or more practice in programming than Hungarian students specialized in Informatics. though the latters have the same or higher Computer Science knowledge level. Unfortunately. Hungarian teachers concentrate on word processing and spreadsheet calculation and teach programming just for the students specialized in Informatics. although algorithm thinking would be important for every student before finishing secondary school.,True,7Lg1kpgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,11,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ989272,7490192978112124224,/scholar?cites=7490192978112124224,,https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ989272.pdf,0,0,0

So. at the Earth’s surface. the spectral amplitudes of definite frequency f above the high-velocity heterogeneities are decreasing. and above the low-velocity ones they are increasing. Moreover. the frequency f is connected with the depth of a heterogeneity H and the velocity of the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves V R(f) through the relation H ≈ 0.4V R(f)/f.

In particular. single-walled boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) are considered as intracellular nanovectors that have good biocompatibility and potentially lower cytotoxicity than carbon nanoparticles. However. the nanoscale mechanisms of BNNT interaction with the cell membrane remain largely unknown. In this paper a short steered molecular dynamics study of BNNT insertion into a lipid bilayer is presented and its results are compared with the available free energy estimations for carbon nanotube (CNT) penetration. Two BNNT models having different sets of partial atomic charges (PAC) were utilized. Using potential of mean force analysis. the free energy profiles of CNT and two cases of BNNT were compared. The results show that a BNNT with partial charges of ±0.4 e has a similar free energy profile to CNT. but the depth of the free energy well is about 30% smaller than for CNT. Furthermore in contrast to membrane penetration by CNT. BNNT remains filled with water even when it is inside the lipid interior. In the second case. BNNT with PAC of ±1.05 e demonstrates hydrophilic behavior of the nanotube. and its penetration into the cell membrane is quite complicated. Moreover. in this case BNNT has a quasi-stable state on the lipid-water interface.

В последнее время все большее внимание уделяется проблеме использования микросейсмического поля Земли в качестве основного зондирующего сигнала. Привлекательность использования микросейсм в данном качестве диктуется. по крайней мере. двумя обстоятельствами.

A promising way to solve these problems is to design and develop membranes with slit-shaped nanopores. In the paper. we studied the selectivity and permeability of slit-shaped nanosized pores in the natural mineral (hydroxyapatite) with the use of the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics approach with all-atom models. We showed that the subnanometer-wide slit-shaped pores in hydroxyapatite are able to demonstrate both good salt rejection and relatively high water permeability. In particular. the numerically predicted water permeability of hydroxyapatite with 0.4 nm thick slit-shaped nanopores reaches about 200 L/(m2 h bar) that is higher than that of commercial membranes and has the same order of magnitude as the theoretically predicted water permeability through single-layer MoS2 nanoporous membranes.

This work is the first report of computer-aided analysis of high pressure consolidation (cold sintering) of bimetallic nanoparticles of two immiscible (Fe and Cu) metals using the embedded atom method (EAM). A detailed study of the effect of cold sintering parameters on the internal structure and properties of bulk Fe–Cu nanocomposites was conducted within the limitations of the numerical model. The variation of estimated density and bulk porosity as a function of Fe-to-Cu ratio and consolidation pressure was found in good agreement with the experimental data. For the first time. topological analysis using Minkowski functionals was applied to characterize the internal structure of a bimetallic nanocomposite. The dependence of topological invariants on input processing parameters was described for various components and structural phases. The model presented allows formalizing the relationship between the internal structure and properties of the studied nanocomposites.

1216489,The contents of Pb. Cu. Zn and Cd in meat in nairobi. Kenya,2007,Nathan Oyaro and Juddy Ogendi and Elizabeth NM Murago and Eric Gitonga,,,,,WFLPublisher Science and Technology,The most important uptake of heavy metals by man occurs through ingestion. hence food analysis is of great importance. In Kenya. meat is sold in butcheries. which are strategically situated near the roadsides and near bus stops. Most of these butcheries have their doors open. and there is likelihood that meat is contaminated by heavy metals. In the current research Pb. Cu. Zn and Cd content in meat were determined. Samples of the kidney. liver and muscles from various cattle were taken from Nairobi and its surroundings. The overall concentration of Pb. Cu. Cd and Zn were below 2 ppm. Generally. the muscle had high concentration of Pb and Cd as compared with kidney and liver. This observation is an anomaly from what has been reported in the literature so far with the liver indicating high metal content. Since most of the butcheries in the study area are located along the highway with high vehicular density. there is a high possibility of direct deposition of Pb and Cd in the meat. The Pearson Chi-square gave  a value of 0.231 for the lead and cadmium indicating that the two metals have a common source. which is thought to be vehicular density.,True,8Y61yEsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,141,http://ir-library.mmarau.ac.ke:8080/handle/123456789/1592,4422731098668895780,/scholar?cites=4422731098668895780,,http://ir-library.mmarau.ac.ke:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1592/41.The%20contents%20of%20Pb%2C%20Cu%2C%20Zn%20and%20Cd%20in%20meat%20in%20Nairobi%2C%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1216502,Modelling the dynamics of radicalization with government intervention,2018,O Nathan and G Lawi and J Nthiiri,26,"Neural, parallel, and scientific computations",,211-224,,Radicalization is the process by which people come to adopt increasingly extreme political. social or religious ideologies. When radicalization leads to violence. radical thinking becomes a threat to national and international security. Prevention programs are part of an effort to combat violent extremism and terrorism. This type of initiative seek to prevent radicalization process from occurring and taking hold in the first place. In this paper we introduce a simple compartmental model suitable to describe prevention programs in marginalized population by incorporating government inclusivity. We calculate the basic reproduction number R0. For R0< 1 the system has one globally asymptotically stable equilibrium where no indoctrinated and radicals are present. For R0> 1 the system has an additional equilibrium where indoctrinated and radicals are persistence to the population. A Lyapunov function is used to show that. for R0> 1. the persistence radical equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulation of the model carried out showed that enhanced government inclusivity leads to a slower rate of transition to radical population.,True,8Y61yEsAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC,4,https://www.dynamicpublishers.com/Neural/NPSC2018/2-05-NPSC-NATHAN-LAWI.pdf,9788249066265693411,/scholar?cites=9788249066265693411,,https://www.dynamicpublishers.com/Neural/NPSC2018/2-05-NPSC-NATHAN-LAWI.pdf,0,0,0

1216505,Stability analysis in a mathematical model of corruption in Kenya,2019,OM Nathan and KO Jackob,,Asian Research Journal of Mathematics,,1-15,,The term corruption refers to the process that involves the abuse of a public trust or office for some private benet. Corruption becomes a threat to national development and growth especially when there is no political will to fight it. Prevention and disengagement initiatives are part of EACC strategies used to fight corruption. Prevention strategies aim to stop or discourage citizens from engaging in corruption. Disengagement strategies attempt to reform corrupt individuals and to reclaim the stolen resources back to the public kitty. We describe prevention and disengagement strategies mathematically using an epidemiological compartment model. The prevention and disengagement strategies are modeled using model parameters. The population at risk of adopting corrupt ideology was divided into three compartments: S (t) is the susceptible class. C (t) is the Corrupted class. and M (t) is the corrupt political/sympathersizer class. The model exhibits a threshold dynamics characterised by the basic reproduction number R0. When R 0< 1 the system has a unique equilibrium point that is asymptotically stable. For R 0> 1. the system has additional equilibrium point known as endemic. which is globally asymptotically stable. These results are established by applying lyapunov functions and the LaSalles invariance principle.

However. research over the past decades has revealed new applications for metal boranes including their implementation as ‘energy materials’ and as neutron capture agents in cancer treatment. The energy applications involve the use of boron–hydrogen compounds as ion-conductors for batteries. as hydrogen storage materials. or even rocket fuels. The intensive research focus on metal borohydrides in the early 21st century has recently broadened to encompass higher metal boranes such as metal–B10H10's and B12H12's.

The chelating anions. such as adenosine phosphates. glutamic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt were used as substrates. The origin of the fluorescent response is the complex formation of the substrates with the Eu(III) complexes. which is greatly affected by the equilibrium concentration of the substrates at the surface of the core.

The pathogen can cause prostatitis and epididymitis in men. In women. cervicitis. pelvic inflammatory disease. ectopic pregnancy and acute or chronic pelvic pain are frequent complications. More than half of C. trachomatis-positive patients have minimal or no symptoms. providing an ongoing reservoir for the infection. The lack of sensitive large-scale applicable point- of- care (POC) tests for C. trachomatis detection makes it difficult to diagnose chlamydia infection efficiently in resource-limited environments. A rapid and sensitive assay based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) was combined with antimicrobial peptide lysis. which is able to detect at least 7 C. trachomatis pathogens per reaction directly from urine samples. Our study comprising 91 first-void urine samples showed that specificity of the assay is 100 % and sensitivity 73 % when using antimicrobial peptide lysis mix. Additionally we demonstrate that our assay does not give any cross-reactivity with 30 pathogen’s DNA potentially present in the urine samples. Furthermore. the assay’s novel approach does not require purification or extraction of DNA from clinical sample prior to amplification. so the need for specialized equipment is eliminated. The whole procedure is significantly less laborious. less time-consuming and consequently less expensive for early detection and identification of infectious disease.

These Point-of-Care tests typically employ a Lab-on-a-Chip for liquid handling functionality. and perform isothermal nucleic acid amplification protocols that require low power but high accuracy temperature control in a single well-defined temperature range. We propose temperature control solutions based on commercially available heating elements capable of meeting these challenges. as well as demonstrate the process by which such elements can be fitted to a NINAAT system. Self-regulated and thermostat-controlled resistive heating elements were evaluated through experimental characterization as well as thermal analysis using the finite element method (FEM).

1216614,Modelling and experimental characterisation of self-regulating resistive heating elements for disposable medical diagnostics devices,2015,T Pardy and T Rang and I Tulp,90,WIT Trans. Eng. Sci,,263-271,,Resistive heating elements based on positive temperature coefficient (PTC) ceramics have the inherent advantage of self-regulating their temperature output via a rapid increase in resistance with increasing temperatures. and therefore require no additional control circuitry. This is particularly advantageous for medical devices. especially disposable molecular diagnostics. where minimal space requirements and power dissipation are crucial design factors. as well as low cost per device. However. rapid prototyping and design validation in silico through finite element analysis are hindered by the scarcity of material data on commercially available heating elements. The simplest characterization of the function of these heating elements is through the temperature coefficient of resistance. which is easily measured yet still provides an acceptable approximation. We propose a finite element model that relies only on the temperature coefficient to simulate the function of PTC heating elements. Model validation was done using a commercially available PTC heating element. the temperature coefficient of which was measured and inputted into the model to simulate a PMMA test structure designed to house the heater and accept Lab-ona-Chip devices with typical dimensions (25mm x 75 mm).,True,0DAIsi0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,3,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-c-dBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA263&dq=info:zGOUnpVZs40J:scholar.google.com&ots=Cl6LNZDT0R&sig=yykHslElqOhgmnH5TISPklf64TE,10210603279324570572,/scholar?cites=10210603279324570572,,https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/MC15/MC15024FU1.pdf,0,0,0

Complementary experiments were performed to investigate the effect of adsorption and precipitation reactions on UO2 dissolution. The experiments were performed under anoxic and oxic conditions. Zn2+ had a much greater inhibitory effect on UO2 dissolution than did Ca2+. This inhibition was most substantial under oxic conditions. where the experimental rate of UO2 dissolution was 7 times lower in the presence of Ca2+ and 1450 times lower in the presence of Zn2+ than in water free of divalent cations.

Photoexcitation of Mn2+-doped CdS quantum dots embedded in the device is followed by efficient picosecond energy transfer to Mn2+ with a long-lived (millisecond) excited-state lifetime. Electrons injected into the QDs under applied bias then capture this energy via Auger de-excitation. generating hot electrons that possess sufficient energy to escape over a ZnS blocking layer. thereby producing current.

The next frontier of doping chemistry is taking place on the nanoscale. where quantum confinement effects dramatically change the photophysical properties of semiconductors. This thesis describes recent advances in the doping of colloidal II–VI semiconductor nanocrystals known as “quantum dots.” Interactions between excitonic excited states and Mn2+. a model magnetic dopant. are investigated. primarily by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. These data reveal a new mechanism of nanocrystal doping characterized by thermodynamic addition of cation + anion pairs. followed by diffusional mixing. A broad range of equilibrium compositions are achieved. from less than one to hundreds of impurities per quantum dot. and subsequent cation exchange reactions are utilized to develop a model for dopant diffusion in these nanocrystals. Unique spectroscopic signatures are demonstrated. including nonmonotonic magnetization in the low-doping regime and extraordinarily large (whopping) Zeeman splittings in more highly doped quantum dots. Collectively. these studies provide insight into the fundamental processes of diffusion and magnetic exchange on the nanoscale. and may be useful for future spintronics. spin-photonics. and solar energy conversion technologies.,True,jeEBpLsAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C,0,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/38597,,,,,0,0,0

While SPR sensors were developed almost three decades. SPR detection is not yet able to reduce the time-consuming steps of the analysis. and is hardly amenable for miniaturized. portable platforms required in point-of-care (POC) testing. Recent advances in near-field optics have emerged. resulting in the development of SPR imaging (SPRi) as a powerful optical. label-free monitoring tool for multiplexed detection and monitoring of biomolecular events. The microarrays design of the SPRi chips incorporating various metallic nanostructures make these optofluidic devices more suitable for diagnosis and near-patient testing than the traditional SPR sensors.

Unlike the ordinary kinetic assays performed at constant enzyme concentration and at various substrate concentrations. the isoconversional method requires several extended kinetic curves for constant initial substrate concentration and different enzyme concentrations. The procedure was tested and validated using simulated data obtained for several kinetic models frequently discussed in the literature.

Under this condition. SMEs implement innovation to meet environmental regulations and to achieve environmental competitiveness in sustainability. We examine the impact of environmental innovation on labor productivity in SME manufacturers. The literature shows that complementary assets help SMEs to increase their performance in environmental innovation. Therefore. we study the interactive effects of the SMEs’ business-group affiliation and the listing status on the relationship between environmental innovation and labor productivity. We add these interaction terms to multivariate regressions by using the 2010 Korea Innovation Survey. The results show that SMEs are able to use environmental innovation as a business strategy for green growth with improved labor productivity. Also. the results highlight that the business-group affiliation and the listing status as the complementary assets positively moderate the performance of the environmental innovation of the SMEs.

Coworking spaces need entrepreneurial sustainability as well. Therefore. this study identifies success factors for sustainable business through analysis of users and hosts’ demands and priorities about coworking spaces. To identify the priorities. we conducted a questionnaire survey with 60 hosts and 56 users by using the analytic hierarchy process method. We found that hosts thought community and communication most important. followed by space and interior. service diversity. and price plan. and users considered relationship facilitation the most important. followed by service diversity. price plan. and networking event and party. After discussions with coworking space hosts and users to understand the differences in viewpoints. we combined the results to find the highest priorities. Finally. we identified relationship facilitation. service diversity. and price plan as having the highest priorities for sustainable coworking space operation for both sides. This study has major implications for research into improving management of coworking spaces as it asks users and hosts to select and focus on elements of priority in their decision making for entrepreneurial sustainability and management innovation.

1216692,SME’s appropriability regime for sustainable development-the role of absorptive capacity and inventive capacity,2016,HanGyeol Seo and Yanghon Chung and Chungwon Woo and Dongphil Chun and Soojeen Sarah Jang,8,Sustainability,7,665,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,SMEs need to protect their innovation outcomes and increase profits from their innovations in order to make their growth sustainable. The appropriability regime enables SMEs to secure financial returns on their R&D investment so that SMEs can continuously invest in innovation and obtain financial gains. However. the appropriability regime can change the effects of protecting innovation outcomes depending on the capacity of knowledge exploration. especially for SMEs. and previous studies have not discussed these issues. Thus. the main objective of this paper is to explore how the knowledge exploration capacity affects the relationship between different types of appropriability regimes and innovation performance. Multivariate regression is used to analyze the manufacturing SMEs sampled from the Korea Innovation Survey 2007 (KIS 2007). Our results demonstrate that both formal and informal appropriability regimes can improve firm’s innovation performance. Furthermore. although both inventive and absorptive capacity have positive moderating effects on the relationship between the informal appropriability regime and innovation performance. the inventive capacity moderates negatively the relationship between the formal appropriability regime and innovation performance. As a whole. the significance of this paper lies in providing further understanding of the different types of appropriability regimes and knowledge exploration capacity in SMEs.

1216704,Data-based Method of Selecting Excellent SMEs for Governmental Funding Policy: Focused on Fishery Industry in Korea,2018,Soon-Wook Hwang and Dong-Phil Chun,49,The Journal of Fisheries Business Administration,4,1-17,The Korean Society of Fisheries Business Administration,The Korean fisheries industry is a traditional business. the majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It has played an important role in the South Korean economies in the past several decades. but it currently faces the limitations of growth potential and profitability due to declining workforce. aging populations. deteriorating fishery environments. climate changes. and rapid changes in the global industrial ecosystem. Many studies have suggested solutions for the fisheries industry in macro perspective. but there are rarely any studies taking the strategic approaches for the problem. If it is possible for governments to support the companies that are likely to increase their value-added selectively. it will break through the current situation more effectively. This paper introduces a study on the selection method utilizing data envelopment analysis (DEA) to find SMEs with potentials to increase profits and growth. We suggest selecting SMEs with high management efficiency and ability to utilize intangible assets as the target companies. We also suggest policy objectives for SMEs in the domestic fisheries industry based on the results of DEA analysis and propose a data-based method for the policy decisions.,True,I0XjgQQAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,0,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201826837943341.page,,,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201826837943341.pdf,0,0,0

The DEA-Tobit analysis is used to estimate the impact of policy mix on relative R&D efficiency. As a result of the DEA analysis. the R&D efficiency of the Korean manufacturing industry firms is low. because the R&D investment has not been used effectively. According to the Tobit model. policy mix have a positive effect on R&D efficiency. In particular. the combination of market-oriented. market supply-oriented. and supply demand-oriented policy mix showed a positive relationship with R&D efficiency.

Methods: This study is based on literature studies and case studies considering the initial stage of development of standards as well as lack of domestic and international research examples. In the literature review. we focused on the characteristics of the innovation management system standards at the national. regional and global level. We examined case studies of Spain and Portugal as case studies. Besides. the evaluation items and certification status of domestic innovative SMEs certification were also searched to find out how to introduce them in Korea. Results: The results of this study can be summarized in three major points. First. new international standards of innovation management are being developed under the ISO management system standard and are currently in the DIS stage. Second. in the case of Spain adopting the national innovation management system standard. it has been reported that the innovation management system standard has a significant effect on the innovation ability and management performance. Third. it was not easy to establish a standardized innovation process between the innovation based on creativity and the standardized based product.

Femtosecond visible laser photolysis revealed that the excited state of the closed form in these three derivatives decayed into the ground state with 0.7–8 ps time constants and with low cycloreversion yields that were consistent with those obtained by steady-state light irradiation. On the other hand. the cycloreversion reaction was drastically enhanced by picosecond 532 nm laser excitation for all of the three derivatives.

Polymerization of the resulting species affords highly regioregular poly(3-alkyl-4-fluoro)thiophenes. Comparison of their properties to those of the analogous non-fluorinated polymers shows that backbone fluorination leads to an increase in the polymer ionization potential without a significant change in optical band gap.

We demonstrate that the PFB-group is a particularly useful end-group due to its ability to undergo fast nucleophilic aromatic substitutions. Using this molecular handle. we are able to quantitatively tether a variety of common nucleophiles to the polythiophene backbone. The mild conditions required for the reaction allows sensitive functional moieties. such as biotin or a cross-linkable trimethoxysilane. to be introduced as end-groups. The high yield enabled the formation of a diblock rod-coil polymer from equimolar reactants under transition metal-free conditions at room temperature.

Here we explore the impact of backbone fluorination in block copolymers of poly (3-octyl-4-fluorothiophene) s and poly (3-octylthiophene)(F-P3OT-b-P3OT). Two block co-polymers with varying block lengths were prepared via sequential monomer addition under Kumada catalyst transfer polymerisation (KCTP) conditions.

In both types of system. we find the fluorinated segments tend to dominate the UV–visible absorption and molecular vibrational spectral features. as well as the thermal behavior. In the block copolymer case. non-fluorinated segments appear to slightly frustrate the aggregation of the more fluorinated block.

In this context. we hereby propose angioplasty mimetic “stented ion transport channels (SITCs)” to overcome the stability–efficiency tradeoff in the current channeled membranes. The semi crystalline polyaniline stents enable systematic self-assembling of the ion exchange sites to form electrostatically locked stent walls of almost 2.8 nm thickness (negligible peak broadening in SAXS spectra of the dry and wet stented membranes).

Ice crystal growth is a major problem in cell/tissue cryopreservation for transplantation. transfusion and basic biomedical research. as well as technological applications such as icing of aircraft wings. This review will introduce the rapidly emerging field of synthetic macromolecular (polymer) mimics of antifreeze proteins. Particular focus is placed on designing polymers which have no structural similarities to antifreeze proteins but reproduce the same macroscopic properties. potentially by different molecular-level mechanisms.

As a prototypical example. we focus here on the polo-box domain (PBD) of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). a serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in a wide range of cancers.[7. 8] and is a known anticancer target due to its critical role in mitotic progression.[9] The PBD helps in subcellular localization of the protein by binding to serine-or threoninephosphorylated sequences at a polar phosphopeptide binding site (Figure 1a).[10. 11]Recently. a secondary hydrophobic binding site (Figure 1b) proximal to the primary phosphopeptide binding site has been identified by two independent approaches.[12. 13] Crystal structures …,True,_yZwOzMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,69,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201205676,9156735702463033853,/scholar?cites=9156735702463033853,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ange.201205676,0,0,0

We have identified a new binding site for small molecules on CK2α adjacent to the ATP site and behind the αD loop. termed the αD pocket. An elaborated fragment anchored in this site has been linked with a low affinity fragment binding in the ATP site. creating a novel and selective inhibitor (CAM4066) that binds CK2α with a Kd of 320 nM and shows significantly improved selectivity compared to other CK2α inhibitors.

The results from in vivo experiments showed that after daily oral administration of acteoside (20. 40. and 80 mg/kg body weight/day) for 12 weeks. bone mineral density and bone biomechanical properties of OVX mice were greatly enhanced. with significant improvement in bone microarchitecture. Furthermore. biochemical parameters of bone resorption markers as well as bone formation index. including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. cathepsin K. deoxypyridinoline. alkaline phosphatase. and bone gla-protein. were ameliorated by acteoside treatment. whereas the body. uterus. and vagina wet weights were seemingly not impacted by acteoside administration. Acteoside significantly affected osteoclastogenesis by attenuating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and stimulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signal pathways through down-regulated levels of tumor-necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL).

Therefore. different types of HBLCs were synthesized using two benzoic acid derivatives as proton donors. namely. 4-octyloxybenzoic acid and octylbenzoic acid. The two acids were combined through intermolecular hydrogen-bonding with alkoxyazopyridine derivatives as proton acceptors. Three different types of azopyridines were used either without fluorine substitution or with one lateral fluorine substituent at different positions. The study proved the importance of using core fluorination as a significant tool to modify the liquid crystalline behaviour of HBLCs. where all azopyridines are non-mesomorphic and almost all their complexes exhibit enantiotropic mesophases. The formation of the hydrogen bond between the complementary components was confirmed using FTIR …,True,d3iDCckAAAAJ:Xz60mAmATU4C,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732220317815,16231574546443638167,/scholar?cites=16231574546443638167,,,0,0,0

Here. we discuss direct conjugation of mitochondrial-targeting moieties to anticancer drugs. antioxidants and sensor molecules. Among them. the most widely applied mitochondrial targeting moiety is triphenylphosphonium (TPP). which is a delocalized cationic lipid that readily accumulates and penetrates through the mitochondrial membrane due to the highly negative mitochondrial membrane potential.

In the last few decades. several studies have revealed mitochondrial functions. attracting the focus of many researchers to work in this field over nuclear targeting. Mitochondrial targeting was initiated in 1995 with a triphenylphosphonium-thiobutyl conjugate as an antioxidant agent. The major driving force for mitochondrial targeting in cancer cells is the higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with that of the cytosol. which allows some molecules to selectively target mitochondria. In this review. we discuss mitochondria-targeting ligand-conjugated anticancer agents and their in vitro and in vivo behaviors. In addition. we describe a mitochondria-targeting nanocarrier system for anticancer drug delivery. As previously reported. several agents have been known to have mitochondrial targeting potential; however. they are not sufficient for direct application for cancer therapy. Thus. many studies have focused on direct conjugation of targeting ligands to therapeutic agents to improve their efficacy. There are many variables for optimal mitochondria-targeted agent development. such as choosing a correct targeting ligand and linker. However. using the nanocarrier system could solve some issues related to solubility and selectivity. Thus. this review focuses on mitochondria-targeting drug conjugates and mitochondria-targeted nanocarrier systems for anticancer agent delivery.,True,ReJvzmQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,43,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00922/full,10602688495702079323,/scholar?cites=10602688495702079323,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00922/full,0,0,0

Deuterium labeling indicates that decomposition of the surface ethyl group proceeds exclusively through a β-hydride elimination reaction mechanism without any scrambling between α- and β-hydrogens. For undeuterated TEGa (TEGa-d0). the surface ethyl group decomposes and desorbs simultaneously as C2H4 and H2 at 600 K.

In this work. we synthesized and fully characterized a new porphyrin 3a and the corresponding cationic derivative 3b. The results presented here show that meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (TPPF20. 1) can be used as scaffold to prepare different soluble compounds with interesting photophysical properties.,True,TwMxqKwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403914009393,7125810514701294498,/scholar?cites=7125810514701294498,,,0,0,0

The organic ligands HS–NI and H2N–NI act as bidentate ligands. thereby causing a drastic decrease in the QD emission. This was particularly evident in the case of CS@S–NI. This behavior has been compared with that of commercially available QDs with octadecylamine as the surface ligand and a QD capped with decanethiol ligands (CS@S–D). The interaction between the anchor groups and the QD surface brings about different …,True,TwMxqKwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,13,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp3128252,1433844813793241222,/scholar?cites=1433844813793241222,,,0,0,0

The use of inexpensive acoustic wave sensors to monitor milk coagulation allows monitoring the process in real time. since its early stages. Besides. data are collected with minimum disturbance. which is an advantage over other methodologies. namely rheology.Coagulation of milk was followed by measuring both the frequency and equivalent circuit resistance of a piezoelectric quartz crystal. Three types of milk. ewe. goat and cow. were coagulated using different rennets at three different temperatures. Maximum observed coagulation rate. either with plant or animal rennet. increased with temperature both for ewe and goat milk. Maximum coagulation rate was higher with plant rennet than with animal rennet at 25 °C and 32 °C. while the opposite was found at 50 °C. The time needed to attain maximum coagulation rate was always …,True,TwMxqKwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400514012350,2706033829546172750,/scholar?cites=2706033829546172750,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0925400514012350,0,0,0

C‐Chelate Organoboron Dyes,2018,Francisco Boscá and M Consuelo Cuquerella and Vânia F Pais and Abel Ros and Uwe Pischel,2,ChemPhotoChem,1,34-41,,The excited-state behavior of four-coordinate N.C-chelate organoboron dyes. based on arylisoquinoline ligands with varying degree of charge-transfer character. was characterized. Data related to excited triplet state formation. oxygen quenching. and singlet-oxygen formation were obtained. The results jointly rationalize the previously observed high photostability of the dyes in air-equilibrated media. Furthermore. femtosecond transient absorption experiments enabled the spectroscopic visualization of the excited intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state that gives rise to the fluorescence of the dyes.,True,TwMxqKwAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,http://rabida.uhu.es/dspace/handle/10272/16177,4213427106187376577,/scholar?cites=4213427106187376577,,http://rabida.uhu.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/10272/16177/Excited.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0
