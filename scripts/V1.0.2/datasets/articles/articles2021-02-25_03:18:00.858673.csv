For certain models. e.g. the Blume–Emery–Griffths model and various generalizations. we develop Fortuin Kasteleyn-type representations which lead immediately to Swendsen Wang-type algorithms. For other models. e.g. the random cluster model. that are defined by a graphical representation. we develop cluster algorithms without reference to an underlying spin system. In all cases. phase transitions are related to percolation (or incipient percolation) in the graphical representation which. via the IC algorithm. allows for the rapid simulation of these systems at the transition point. Pertinent examples include the (continuum) Widom–Rowlinson model. the restricted 1-step solid-on-solid model and the XY model.,True,VvgVKVYAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,147,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437197006377,8824091756070901818,/scholar?cites=8824091756070901818,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190590256.pdf,0,0,0

Discrete spin systems,1997,L Chayes and J Machta,239,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,4,542-601,North-Holland,Graphical representations similar to the FK representation are developed for a variety of spin-systems. In several cases. it is established that these representations have (FKG) monotonicity properties which enables characterization theorems for the uniqueness phase and the low-temperature phase of the spin system. Certain systems with intermediate phases and/or first-order transitions are also described in terms of the percolation properties of the representations. In all cases. these representations lead. in a natural fashion. to Swendsen-Wang-type algorithms. Hence. at least in the above-mentioned instances. these algorithms realize the program described by Kandel and Domany. Phys. Rev. B 43 (1991) 8539–8548. All of the algorithms are shown to satisfy a Li-Sokal bound which (at least for systems with a divergent specific heat) implies critical slowing down. However. the representations also give rise to …,True,VvgVKVYAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,147,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437196004384,8824091756070901818,/scholar?cites=8824091756070901818,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.135.3070&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The algorithm samples the critical point of a spin system without a priori knowledge of the critical temperature and provides an efficient way to determine the critical temperature and other observables in the critical region.

The presence of disorder leads to a generalized diffusion equation. with memory kernels having power law long time tails.

The theory is applicable to a wide variety of dynamical and stochastic systems including the Lorentz gas and hopping models. We find new. general expressions for the coefficients of the long time tails which agree with previous results for exactly solvable hopping models and with the low-density results obtained for the Lorentz gas.

The mechanism by which proteins on both sides of the membrane colocalize during signaling events is unknown but may be due to the induction of inner leaflet domains by the outer leaflet. Here we show that liquid domains form in asymmetric Montal–Mueller planar bilayers in which one leaflet9s composition would phase-separate in a symmetric bilayer and the other9s would not. Equally important. by tuning the lipid composition of the second leaflet. we are able to suppress domains in the first leaflet.

The much higher enzymatic activity of human group X sPLA2(hGX) compared with human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) on phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich vesicles is due in large part to the higher affinity of the former enzyme for such vesicles; this result also holds when vesicles contain cholesterol and sphingomyelin. The inclusion of anionic phosphatidylserine in PC vesicles dramatically enhances interfacial binding and catalysis of hGIIA but not of hGX. This is the result of the large number of lysine and arginine residues scattered over the entire surface of hGIIA. which cause the enzyme to form a supramolecular aggregate with multiple vesicles.

The nonlamellar phase behavior of lipid systems is also known to depend on the monolayer spontaneous curvature. The single-channel activity of alamethicin in black lipid bilayer membranes has been shown to be dependent upon the lipid composition of the membrane. Since the monolayer spontaneous curvature properties (e.g.. the monolayer spontaneous curvature. curvature coefficients and bilayer thickness) vary with lipid composition. the single-channel activity of alamethicin presumably also correlates with the monolayer spontaneous curvature properties.

This phenomenon can result from the reversible formation of a chemically distinct liquid product or “condensed complex” between the phospholipid and cholesterol. The present work describes an empirical connection between high melting temperatures of saturated phospholipid bilayers and the appearance of two upper miscibility critical points in cholesterol−phospholipid monolayers. A rough correlation is also found between melting temperature and the composition of the complex. Bilayer melting temperature is a convenient measure of the tendency of the phospholipid acyl chains to order. and this same tendency is evidently important for condensed complex formation. ,True,8V40990AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,84,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp000958g,9565122142347161324,/scholar?cites=9565122142347161324,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arun_Radhakrishnan3/publication/231627483_Saturated_Phospholipids_with_High_Melting_Temperatures_Form_Complexes_with_Cholesterol_in_Monolayers/links/5c8b1612299bf14e7e7ca45b/Saturated-Phospholipids-with-High-Melting-Temperatures-Form-Complexes-with-Cholesterol-in-Monolayers.pdf,0,0,0

Major questions regarding this hypothesis include how the four bases and the sugar in RNA were selected from a mixture of prebiotic compounds and colocalized with such membranes. and how the membranes were stabilized against flocculation in salt water. To address these questions. we explored the possibility that aggregates of decanoic acid. a prebiotic amphiphile. interact with the bases and sugar found in RNA. We found that these bases. as well as some but not all related bases. bind to decanoic acid aggregates. Moreover. both the bases and ribose inhibit flocculation of decanoic acid by salt.

Specifically. when lipid membranes phase separate into coexisting liquid phases. domains in each monolayer leaflet of the membrane are colocalized with domains in the opposite leaflet.

This result indicates that the lipid compositions in one leaflet are strongly coupled to compositions in the opposing leaflet. Predictions of the interleaflet coupling parameter.

It is therefore imperative to ask how to access the information contained in this variability. Yet most studies of development average their observations and. discarding the variability. seek to derive models. biological or physical. that explain these average observations. Here. we analyse this variability in a study of cell sheet folding in the green alga Volvox. whose spherical embryos turn themselves inside out in a process sharing invagination. expansion. involution. and peeling of a cell sheet with animal models of morphogenesis. We generalise our earlier. qualitative model of the initial stages of inversion by combining ideas from morphoelasticity and shell theory. Together with three-dimensional visualisations of inversion using light sheet microscopy. this yields a detailed. quantitative model of the entire inversion process. With this model. we show how the variability of inversion reveals that two separate. temporally uncoupled processes drive the initial invagination and subsequent expansion of the cell sheet.

The relaxation towards the final density follows an inverse logarithmic law. As the system approaches its final state. a growing number of beads have to be rearranged to enable a local density increase. A free volume argument shows that this number grows as N= ϱ (1− ϱ). The time scale associated with such events increases exponentially∼ e N. and as a result a logarithmically slow approach to the final state is found ϱ∞− ϱ (t)∼ 1 ln t.

By balancing the input flux with the number of reactions. they determine that the width w of the reaction zone scales as j-1/3 in the large flux limit. and that the concentration in this zone is proportional to j 2/3.

Two agents may interact and reach consensus. and additionally. individual agents may spontaneously change their opinions by a random. diffusive process. We find three distinct possibilities. For strong diffusion. the distribution of opinions is uniform and no political organizations (parties) are formed.

The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at= 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb− 1. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino. where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop. the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered. including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and …,True,mb5hV7cAAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C,1593,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2014)118,16004868427200167838,/scholar?cites=16004868427200167838,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2014)118,0,0,0

The basic principle of the system is to illuminate the subject with a low-intensity microwave beam. and then from the back-scattered microwave signal. extract the heart and breathing signals that modulate it. The circuit description of the system and some experimental results are presented. Potential applications of the system are noted.,True,mb5hV7cAAAAJ:PFhWnMnuT1QC,338,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4122367/,13776821321661943002,/scholar?cites=13776821321661943002,,,0,0,0
