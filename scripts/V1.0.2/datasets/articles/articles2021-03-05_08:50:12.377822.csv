1108080,Y-mac: An energy-efficient multi-channel mac protocol for dense wireless sensor networks,2008,Youngmin Kim and Hyojeong Shin and Hojung Cha,,,,53-63,IEEE,As the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) becomes widespread. node density tends to increase. This poses a new challenge for medium access control (MAC) protocol design. Although traditional MAC protocols achieve low-power operation. they use only a single channel which limits their performance. Several multi-channel MAC protocols for WSNs have been recently proposed. One of the key observations is that these protocols are less energy efficient than single-channel MAC protocols under light traffic conditions. In this paper. we propose an energy efficient multichannel MAC protocol. Y-MAC. for WSNs. Our goal is to achieve both high performance and energy efficiency under diverse traffic conditions. In contrast to most of previous multi-channel MAC protocols for WSNs. we implemented Y-MAC on a real sensor node platform and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance …,True,B3CtxsAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,397,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4505462/,8101837450326105288,/scholar?cites=8101837450326105288,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.572.852&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1108081,Appscope: Application energy metering framework for android smartphone using kernel activity monitoring,2012,Chanmin Yoon and Dongwon Kim and Wonwoo Jung and Chulkoo Kang and Hojung Cha,,,,387-400,,Understanding the energy consumption of a smartphone application is a key area of interest for end users. as well as application and system software developers. Previous work has only been able to provide limited information concerning the energy consumption of individual applications because of limited access to underlying hardware and system software. The energy consumption of a smartphone application is. therefore. often estimated with low accuracy and granularity. In this paper. we propose AppScope. an Android-based energy metering system. This system monitors application’s hardware usage at the kernel level and accurately estimates energy consumption. AppScope is implemented as a kernel module and uses an event-driven monitoring method that generates low overhead and provides high accuracy. The evaluation results indicate that AppScope accurately estimates the energy consumption of Android applications expending approximately 35mW and 2.1% in power consumption and CPU utilization overhead. respectively.,True,B3CtxsAAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,392,https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc12/technical-sessions/presentation/yoon,417241992189931964,/scholar?cites=417241992189931964,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final171.pdf,0,0,0

While tracking users in outdoor environments is easily done with GPS. the solution for indoor tracking is not trivial. One common technique for indoor user tracking is to employ inertial sensors. but such a system needs to be capable of handling noisy sensors that would normally lead to cumulative locating errors. To reduce such error. additional infrastructure has often been deployed to adjust for these cumulative location errors.

Thus. new content sharing mechanisms should be developed as traditional data delivery schemes are not efficient for content sharing due to the sporadic connectivity between smartphones. To accomplish data delivery in such challenging environments. researchers have proposed the use of store-carry-forward protocols. in which a node stores a message and carries it until a forwarding opportunity arises through an encounter with other nodes. Most previous works in this field have focused on the prediction of whether two nodes would encounter each other. without considering the place and time of the encounter. In this paper. we propose discover-predict-deliver as an efficient content sharing scheme for delay-tolerant smartphone networks.

In this setting. a player attempts to minimize a sequence of adversarially generated convex loss functions. while only observing the value of each function at a single point. In some cases. the minimax regret of these problems is known to be strictly worse than the minimax regret in the corresponding full information setting. We introduce the multi-point bandit setting. in which the player can query each loss function at multiple points. When the player is allowed to query each function at two points. we prove regret bounds that closely resemble bounds for the full information case. This suggests that knowing the value of each loss function at two points is almost as useful as knowing the value of each function everywhere.

The standard proximal gradient method. also known as iterative soft-thresholding when applied to this problem. has low computational cost per iteration but a rather slow convergence rate.

1108142,The design of calamari: an ad-hoc localization system for sensor networks,2002,Kamin Whitehouse,,,,,,The advent of wireless ad-hoc sensor networks has in many ways changed the way we design computing systems. Sensor network systems face tight constraints on power. bandwidth and computation. At the same time. such systems face the challenges of ad-hoc networking. embedded devices. and a multiplicity of nodes. Much work in this new problem domain has therefore shifted focus to issues of scalability and power efficiency. often at the cost of such traditional goals as speed and accuracy.In this paper we apply this new design philosophy to the problem of localization. Existing localization systems have been optimized for precision at the cost of infrastructure. power and deployment time. In sensor networks. however. this is exactly the price that cannot be paid. On the other hand. the exact position of a particular sensor node is usually not necessary. since the spatial frequency of most physical phenomena. such as temperature fluctuation. is quite low.

Traditional flooding protocols can be very slow because of neighborhood contention: nodes cannot propagate the flood until neighboring nodes have finished their transmissions. The Flash flooding protocol avoids this problem by allowing concurrent transmissions among neighboring nodes. It relies on the capture effect to ensure that each node receives the flood from at least one of its neighbors. and introduces new techniques to either recover from or prevent too many concurrent transmissions. We evaluate the Flash flooding protocol on both a 48-node wireless sensor network testbed and in a trace-based simulator. Our results indicate that the Flash flooding protocol can reduce latency by as much as 80%. achieving flooding latencies near the theoretical lower bound without sacrificing coverage. reliability or power …,True,ob_3jn4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,146,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5062177/,13711253980371463388,/scholar?cites=13711253980371463388,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/194007247.pdf,0,0,0

Many of these applications require reliable transmission within latency bounds. Achieving this goal is very difficult because of link burstiness and interference. Based on significant empirical evidence of 21 days and over 3.600.000 packets transmission per link. we propose a scheduling algorithm that produces latency bounds of the real-time periodic streams and accounts for both link bursts and interference. The solution is achieved through the definition of a new metric Bmax that characterizes links by their maximum burst length. and by choosing a novel least-burst-route that minimizes the sum of worst case burst lengths over all links in the route.

Because antibody effector functions are critically dependent on antibody Fc domain glycosylation. we aimed to define the natural glycoforms associated with robust Fc-mediated antiviral activity.

Because accumulating evidence suggests that HIV controllers generate antibodies with enhanced capacity to drive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) that may contribute to viral containment. we profiled an array of extra-neutralizing antibody effector functions across HIV-infected populations with varying degrees of viral control to define the characteristics of antibodies associated with spontaneous control. While neither the overall magnitude of antibody titer nor individual effector functions were increased in ECs. a more functionally coordinated innate immune–recruiting response was observed. Specifically. ECs demonstrated polyfunctional humoral immune responses able to coordinately recruit ADCC. other NK functions. monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis. and complement. This functionally coordinated response was associated with qualitatively superior IgG3/IgG1 responses. whereas HIV-specific IgG2/IgG4 responses. prevalent among viremic subjects. were associated with poorer overall antibody activity.

It is especially pertinent in scientific and engineering applications where we seek to characterize a configuration space or design space in terms of spatial aggregates. and where data collection can become costly. Examples abound in domains such as aircraft design. wireless system simulation. fluid dynamics. and sensor networks.

Generally speaking. two residue positions are considered coupled if. in the sequence record. some of their amino acid type combinations are significantly more common than others. While the proposed approaches have proven useful in finding and describing coupling. a significant missing component is a formal probabilistic model that explicates and compactly represents the coupling. integrates information about sequence. structure. and function. and supports inferential procedures for analysis. diagnosis. and prediction.

Such applications often require the identifi-cation and manipulation of qualitative spatial representations. for example. to detect whether one object will soon occlude another in a digital image or efficiently determine relationships between a proposed road and wetland regions in a geographic data set. Qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) provides representational primitives (a spatial"" vocabulary"") and inference mechanisms for these tasks. This article first reviews representative work on QSR for data-poor scenarios. where the goal is to design representations that can answer qualitative queries without much numeric information. It then turns to the data-rich case. where the goal is to derive and manipulate qualitative spatial representations that efficiently and correctly abstract important spatial aspects of the underlying data for use in subsequent tasks.

Inc.,Therapeutic proteins continue to yield revolutionary new treatments for a growing spectrum of human disease. but the development of these powerful drugs requires solving a unique set of challenges. For instance. it is increasingly apparent that mitigating potential anti-therapeutic immune responses. driven by molecular recognition of a therapeutic protein's peptide fragments. may be best accomplished early in the drug development process. One may eliminate immunogenic peptide fragments by mutating the cognate amino acid sequences. but deimmunizing mutations are constrained by the need for a folded. stable. and functional protein structure.

A key aspect of the response is the recognition and surface display by antigen-presenting cells of epitopes. short peptide fragments derived from the foreign protein. Thus. developing minimal-epitope variants represents a powerful approach to deimmunizing protein therapeutics. Critically. mutations selected to reduce immunogenicity must not interfere with the protein's therapeutic activity. This paper develops methods to improve the likelihood of simultaneously reducing the anti-biotherapeutic immune response while maintaining therapeutic activity. A dynamic programming approach identifies optimal and near-optimal sets of conservative point mutations to minimize the occurrence of predicted T-cell epitopes in a target protein. In contrast with existing methods. those described here integrate analysis of immunogenicity and stability/activity. are broadly applicable to any protein class. guarantee global optimality. and provide sufficient flexibility for users to limit the total number of mutations and target MHC alleles of interest. The input is simply the primary amino acid sequence of the therapeutic candidate. although crystal structures and protein family sequence alignments may also be input when available.

Ltd.,Energy analysis of a fluidized‐bed drying system is undertaken to optimize the fluidized‐bed drying conditions for large wet particles (Group D) using energy models. Three critical factors; the inlet air temperature. the fluidization velocity. and the initial moisture contents of the material (e.g.. wheat) are studied to determine their effects on the overall energy efficiency to optimize the fluidized bed drying process. In order to verify the model. different experimental data sets for wheat material taken from the literature are used. The results show that the energy efficiencies of the fluidized‐bed dryer decrease with increasing drying time and become the lowest at the end of the drying process. It is observed that the inlet air temperature has an important effect on energy efficiency for the material where the diffusion coefficient depends on both the temperature and the moisture content of the particle.

Intended as a text for advanced undergraduates and as a reference for practicing engineers. the book uses the physics of flows in porous materials to tie together a wide variety of important issues from such fields as biomedical engineering. energy conversion. civil engineering. electronics. chemical engineering. and environmental engineering. Thus. for example. flows of water and oil through porous ground play a central role in energy exploration and recovery (oil wells. geothermal fluids). energy conversion (effluents from refineries and power plants). and environmental engineering (leachates from waste repositories). Similarly. the demands of miniaturization in electronics and in biomedical applications are driving research into the flow of heat and fluids through small-scale porous media (heat exchangers. filters. gas exchangers). Filters. catalytic converters. the drying of stored grains. and a myriad of other applications involve flows through porous media. By providing a unified theoretical framework that includes not only the traditional homogeneous and isotropic media but also models in which the assumptions of representative elemental volumes or global thermal equilibrium fail. the book provides practicing engineers the tools they need to analyze complex situations that arise in practice.

Ltd.,Texturing of interfaces in thin film silicon solar cells is essential to enhance the produced photocurrent and thus the efficiencies. A UV nano‐imprint‐lithography (UV‐NIL) replication process was developed to prepare substrates with textures that are suitable for the growth of n‐i‐p thin film silicon solar cells. Morphological and optical analyses were performed to assess the quality of the replicas. A comparison of single junction amorphous solar cells on the original structures and on their replicas on glass revealed good light trapping and excellent electrical properties on the replicated structures. A tandem amorphous silicon/amorphous silicon (a‐Si/a‐Si) cell deposited on a replica on plastic exhibits a stabilized efficiency of 8.1% and a high yield of 90% of good cells in laboratory conditions.

Two recipes for the chemical bath deposition (CBD) of CdS with different bath temperatures (60 and 80 °C) are compared. Coherent Cu–Se precipitates are observed in both cases in the grains of the absorber layer. This precipitation cannot be avoided and seems to be a principal limitation for the performance of Cu-rich CuGaSe2-based thin film solar cells. There is a significant difference between both recipes concerning the interaction with the absorber layer surface. For bath temperatures of 80 °C the interaction is much stronger and Cu–S inclusions are found in the buffer layer. These may be responsible for shunts across the pn junction.

IMT-EPFL has developed an in-house LPCVD process for the deposition of nanotextured boron doped ZnO films used as rough TCO for TF Si solar cells. This paper is a general review and synthesis of the study of the electrical. optical and structural properties of the ZnO:B that has been performed at IMT-EPFL.The influence of the free carrier absorption and the grain size on the electrical and optical properties of LPCVD ZnO:B is discussed.

At the same time. when the film thickness increases. the surface morphology evolves from small rounded grains to large pyramids at a growth temperature of 150 °C.

This can be achieved with thin cells by combining both robust cell design and efficient light management schemes. In this paper. we identify three key requirements for the transparent conductive oxide electrodes. First. strong light scattering into large angles is needed on the entire useful wavelength range: A front electrode texture with large enough features is shown to grant a high total current (typically >26 mA/cm2 with a 2.4-μm-thick absorber material). while sharp features are reported to allow for high top cell current (>13 mA/cm2) and reduced reflection at the ZnO/Si interface.

We address the issue of the narrow absorption range of common upconverter materials. This problem can be overcome by the combination of the upconverter with a broadly absorbing fluorescent material. which emits in the absorption range of the upconverter. However. possible fluorescent materials also absorb in the emission range of the upconverter. We therefore propose an advanced system setup. which avoids unwanted absorption by separating upconverter and fluorescent material with a selectively reflective photonic structure. The incorporation of the fluorescent material in a fluorescent concentrator allows for additional geometric concentration increasing the efficiency of the upconversion process.

CSG cells are fabricated by solid-state crystallisation (SPC) of 1.5–3.5 µm thick precursor diodes prepared by PECVD or ebeam evaporation followed by thermal annealing. hydrogen passivation and metallisation. The highest efficiency of 10.4% was demonstrated on a PECVD minimodule on textured borosilicate glass. The best performing ebeam-evaporated cells on planar glass reached 8.6% efficiency. CSG cells were also produced on low-cost soda-lime glass with 8.1% and 7.1% efficiencies on PECVD and ebeam material respectively. The performance of SPC CSG cells is limited to below 11% because high defect density in SPC material limits VOC and 1.5–3.5 µm cell thickness limits JSC.

We present a method for determining experimentally the dispersion relations of multilayer films by coupling polarized light in a spectral reflection measurement to eigenmodes. using a one-dimensional sinusoidal grating. Because the used grating represents only a minor perturbation that establishes the coupling. the experimental data is well explained by the modal structure of a geometry with flat interfaces.

1108432,Smart wire connection technology,2013,T Söderström and P Papet and J Ufheil,,,,495-499,,For more than five decades. photovoltaic technology has seen continuous improvements. as costs have been consistently lowered. processes have been simplified and temperatures lowered. While significant improvements have been made at the cell level. limitations remain at the module level or at the interface between the cell and the module. which is known as the cell metallization-interconnection. Meyer Burger develops the Smart Wire Connection Technology (SWCT) required to close this gap and get the highest possible benefit out of high-efficiency solar cell performance. SWCT technology implies a change of paradigm. It requires the combination of lamination and interconnection into a single lamination step. Moreover. the module's silver paste consumption can be significantly reduced (< 2.4 g/60 cells module) and even eliminated when Cu plating is used.

The reduction is done under low hydrogen pressure. The reduction initiates at the NiO/YSZ interface. then moves to the center of the NiO grain. At higher temperature the reduction occurs also at the free NiO surface and the NiO/NiO grain boundaries. The growth of Ni is epitaxial on its oxide. Due to high volume decrease. nanopores are formed during reduction. During oxidation. oxide nanocrystallites are formed on the nickel surface. The crystallites fill up the nickel porosity and create an inhomogeneous structure with remaining voids. This change in structure causes the nickel oxide to expand during a RedOx cycle.,True,wMxdVJoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,31,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.3205743/meta,14008784324066020116,/scholar?cites=14008784324066020116,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40425815/In_situ_Reduction_and_Oxidation_of_Nicke20151127-6809-nv3elw.pdf,0,0,0

The effectiveness of the SOIR layer in increasing the photo‐carrier generation in the a‐Si:H top absorber is compared for p–i–n devices deposited on different rough. highly transparent. front ZnO layers. High haze and low doping level for the front ZnO strongly enhance the current density (Jsc) in the μc‐Si:H bottom cell whereas Jsc in the top cell is influenced by the angular distribution of the transmitted light and by the reflectivity of the SOIR related to different surface roughness.

This allows developing ZnO layers combining interesting properties such as low surface roughness (below 15 nm) and low sheet resistance (below 15 Ω/⎕). More generally. it is shown that the pyramidal feature density can be controlled by tuning the precursor flows. This leads to film surfaces characterized by zones with a rough morphology mixed with zones with almost flat features.

Furthermore. advanced superstrates have recently been developed based on. e.g.. multiscales textures. ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography. and bilayers. leading to very promising results. While efficiencies of 12.7% initial and 11.3% stable were achieved with a bottom cell that is only 1.1 μm thick on a rough front zinc oxide electrode. a high 12% initial efficiency was also reached on a textured replica.

However. the growth of silicon layers with low defect density. which are necessary for high-performance solar cells. often requires the rough surface morphology of as-deposited zinc oxide films to be smoothened. This is usually achieved by a post-deposition argon plasma-etching treatment. We investigate here an alternative method to modify the surface morphology by changing the zinc oxide growth conditions over only the last hundreds of nanometers of the total film thickness.

In contrast to a standard 80 nm-ZnO/Ag BR design. for which the BR nearly strictly follows the texture of the underlying μc-Si:H layers. placing the Ag BR far from the μc-Si:H layers allows for a variation of the BR topography. Irrespective of the investigated BR topographies and also for a conventional white paint BR. long distances (of several micrometers) between the BR and the μc-Si:H layers are found to be detrimental for the light trapping.

The identification of this phase is validated on the synthesized and simulated species by scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) techniques; its possible formation is predicted by thermodynamic analysis of the stability of perovskite compounds in the presence of combined Cr and S polluting conditions.

Cells on p-type wafers suffer from reduced minority carrier lifetime in the low-carrier-injection range. mainly due to the asymmetry in interface defect capture cross sections. This leads to slightly lower fill factors than for n-type cells. However. these losses can be minimized by using high-quality passivation layers. High Vocs were obtained on both types of FZ wafers: up to 735 mV on n-and 726 mV on p-type. The best Voc measured on CZ p-type wafers was only 692 mV. whereas it reached 732 mV on CZ n-type.

For microcrystalline silicon solar cells. when associated with highly crystalline i-layers deposited at high rates. all electrical parameters are improved.

Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) plays a crucial role therein—as absorber layers. but also as doped layers to build p-i-n junctions. This thesis is devoted to a-Si: H. with the main focus on thin-film silicon solar cells. but also with applications for opto-electronic devices. detectors. and other types of solar cells such as heterojunction solar cells. We discuss models of a-Si: H and develop further the representation of defects by amphoteric states. Using a simple model. we show—in agreement with layer-by-layer simulations and experimental results—that trapped electrons tend to dominate the electric field deformation in the initial state. whereas positively charged defects dominate in the degraded state. Experimentally. we define the deposition parameter space accessible by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and explore that space by varying the deposition temperature. pressure. excitation frequency. power. and H2/SiH4 ratio for intrinsic absorber layers.

Synchrotron-based XRF has become an integral characterization technique for a variety of research topics. particularly due to its non-destructive nature and its high sensitivity. Today. synchrotrons can acquire fluorescence data at spatial resolutions well below a micron. allowing for the evaluation of compositional variations at the nanoscale.

In the low-carrier-injection range. cells on p-type wafers suffer from reduced minority carrier lifetime. mainly due to the asymmetry in interface defect capture cross sections. This leads to slightly lower fill factors than for n-type cells. By using high-quality passivation layers. however. these losses can be minimized.

Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational. experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes. estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such. conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies.

For centuries. it has been believed that forests provide protection against flooding.

Using data collected from 1990 to 2000 from 56 developing countries. we show using generalized linear and mixed‐effects models contrasted with information‐theoretic measures of parsimony that flood frequency is negatively correlated with the amount of remaining natural forest and positively correlated with natural forest area loss (after controlling for rainfall. slope and degraded landscape area).

Yet the final descent to extinction is often driven by synergistic processes (amplifying feedbacks) that can be disconnected from the original cause of decline. We review recent observational. experimental and meta-analytic work which together show that owing to interacting and self-reinforcing processes. estimates of extinction risk for most species are more severe than previously recognised. As such. conservation actions which only target single-threat drivers risk being inadequate because of the cascading effects caused by unmanaged synergies.

1108796,Tropical turmoil: a biodiversity tragedy in progress,2009,Corey JA Bradshaw and Navjot S Sodhi and Barry W Brook,7,,2,79-87,Ecological Society of America,All is not well for biodiversity in the tropics. Despite recent debate over the extent of future tropical extinctions and the effectiveness of reserve systems. the continued disappearance of habitat. soaring human population. and loss of vital ecosystem services demand immediate action. This crisis is worrying. given that tropical regions support over two‐thirds of all known species and are populated by some of the world's poorest people. who have little recourse to lower environmental‐impact lifestyles.

The loss of a species is expected to result in the loss of other species that depend on it (coextinction). leading to cascading effects across trophic levels. Such effects are likely to be most severe in mutualistic and parasitic interactions. Indeed. models suggest that coextinction may be the most common form of biodiversity loss. Paradoxically. few historical or contemporary coextinction events have actually been recorded. We review the current knowledge of coextinction by: (i) considering plausible explanations for the discrepancy between predicted and observed coextinction rates; (ii) exploring the potential consequences of coextinctions; (iii) discussing the interactions and synergies between coextinction and other drivers of species loss. particularly climate change; and (iv) suggesting the way forward for understanding the …,True,2chBjFMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,411,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2009.0413,5338893944444379104,/scholar?cites=5338893944444379104,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2009.0413,0,0,0

Here we show that limestone karsts are “arks” of biodiversity and often contain high levels of endemism. Humans have exploited karsts for a variety of products and services. but unsustainable practices have caused population declines and extinctions among site-endemic taxa.

However. most of these projections are based on ecological proxies or experiments on single species or simplified food webs. How energy fluxes are likely to change in marine food webs in response to future climates remains unclear. hampering forecasts of ecosystem functioning. Using a sophisticated mesocosm experiment. we model energy flows through a species-rich multilevel food web. with live habitats. natural abiotic variability. and the potential for intra- and intergenerational adaptation. We show experimentally that the combined stress of acidification and warming reduced energy flows from the first trophic level (primary producers and detritus) to the second (herbivores). and from the second to the third trophic level (carnivores). Warming in isolation also reduced the energy flow from herbivores to carnivores. the efficiency of energy transfer from primary producers and detritus to herbivores and detritivores. and the living biomass of detritivores. herbivores. and carnivores. Whilst warming and acidification jointly boosted primary producer biomass through an expansion of cyanobacteria. this biomass was converted to detritus rather than to biomass at higher trophic levels—i.e.. production was constrained to the base of the food web. In contrast. ocean acidification affected the food web positively by enhancing trophic flow from detritus and primary producers to herbivores. and by increasing the biomass of carnivores.

1108835,Correlation between fitness and genetic diversity,2003,David H Reed and Richard Frankham,17,Conservation biology,1,230-237,Blackwell Science. Inc., Genetic diversity is one of the three forms of biodiversity recognized by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) as deserving conservation. The need to conserve genetic diversity within populations is based on two arguments: the necessity of genetic diversity for evolution to occur. and the expected relationship between heterozygosity and population fitness. Because loss of genetic diversity is related to inbreeding. and inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness. a correlation is expected between heterozygosity and population fitness. Long‐term effective population size. which determines rates of inbreeding. should also be correlated with fitness. However. other theoretical considerations and empirical observations suggest that the correlation between fitness and heterozygosity may be weak or nonexistent. We used all the data sets we could locate (34 ) to perform a meta‐analysis and resolve the issue.

Inbreeding depression. loss of genetic diversity and mutation accumulation have been hypothesised to increase extinction risk. There is now compelling evidence that inbreeding depression and loss of genetic diversity increase extinction risk in laboratory populations of naturally outbreeding species. There is now clear evidence for inbreeding depression in wild species of naturally outbreeding species and strong grounds from individual case studies and from computer projections for believing that this contributes to extinction risk.

1108838,Relationship of genetic variation to population size in wildlife,1996,Richard Frankham,10,Conservation biology,6,1500-1508,Blackwell Science Inc,Genetic diversity is one of three levels of biological diversity requiring conservation. Genetic theory predicts that levels of genetic variation should increase with effective population size. Soulé (1976) compiled the first convincing evidence that levels of genetic variation in wildlife were related to population size. but this issue remains controversial. The hypothesis that genetic variation is related to population size leads to the following predictions: (1) genetic variation within species should be related to population size; (2) genetic variation within species should be related to island size; (3) genetic variation should be related to population size within taxonomic groups; (4) widespread species should have more genetic variation than restricted species; (5) genetic variation in animals should be negatively correlated with body size; (6) genetic variation should be negatively correlated with rate of chromosome evolution; (7 …,True,RMlaxcMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1525,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10061500.x,15779797515868928377,/scholar?cites=15779797515868928377,,http://people.cst.cmich.edu/swans1bj/frankham_96.pdf,0,0,0

Many authors have asserted that species are usually driven to extinction before genetic factors have time to impact them. but few studies have seriously addressed this issue. If this assertion is true. there will be little difference in genetic diversity between threatened and taxonomically related nonthreatened species. We compared average heterozygosities in 170 threatened taxa with those in taxonomically related nonthreatened taxa in a comprehensive metaanalysis. Heterozygosity was lower in threatened taxa in 77% of comparisons. a highly significant departure from the predictions of the no genetic impact hypothesis.

Published data on levels of genetic variation for allozymes. nuclear DNA markers. mitochondrial DNA. inversions and quantitative characters in island and mainland populations were analysed. A large and highly significant majority of island populations have less allozyme genetic variation than their mainland counterparts (165 of 202 comparisons). the average reduction being 29 per cent.

Although molecular measures are widely used as surrogates for quantitative genetic variation. there is controversy about the strength of the relationship between the two. To resolve this issue. we carried out a meta‐analysis based on 71 datasets. The mean correlation between molecular and quantitative measures of genetic variation was weak (r = 0.217). Furthermore. there was no significant relationship between the two measures for life‐history traits (r =−0.11) or for the quantitative measure generally considered as the best indicator of adaptive potential. heritability (r =−0.08).

Inbreeding depression is one possible explanation for this. Insular populations are expected to suffer increased inbreeding relative to mainland populations due to bottlenecks at foundation and to lower subsequent population sizes. Inbreeding coefficients for 182 nonendemic and 28 endemic island populations were estimated from allozyme and microsatellite heterozygosities in island and related mainland populations.

Although these effects can usually be reversed by re‐establishing gene flow between population fragments. managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders’ equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection. genetic diversity. effective population sizes. and generations of isolation.

I review empirical evidence on (i) the genetic basis of adaptive changes in captivity.

Resolving taxonomy uncertainties and identifying diverged evolutionary units within species are both bedevilled by a plethora of definitions: the challenge for the conservation community is to come to an agreed definition of species and for a unit within species for conservation purposes. For genetic management in the wild. the main challenge is to apply well-established genetic principles to management. especially of fragmented populations. Fears about outbreeding depression are preventing rational use of gene flow for genetic rescue; predicting the risk of outbreeding depression is the most important unmet scientific challenge in the field.

Without gene flow from another population within the species (genetic rescue). these populations are likely to be extirpated. However. there have been only ~ 20 published cases of such outcrossing for conservation purposes. probably a very low proportion of populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of genetic rescue effects in wild species. I carried out a meta‐analysis. Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in 92.9% of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding depression.

Oil palm agriculture has become a major driver of tropical deforestation over the last few decades.

We show that converting a hectare of forest for palm oil production will be more profitable (yielding net present values of $3.835–$9.630) to land owners than preserving it for carbon credits ($614–$994). which are currently restricted to voluntary carbon markets.

In addition. CBFM enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore. CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure. report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM. in this paper we assess:(1) the feasibility of using small. low-cost drones (ie. remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs;(2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities. partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization. coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge. would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so. we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones. including forest monitoring. and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations. governments and forest data …,True,KR3AV20AAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,247,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/5/6/1481,14053885783793706440,/scholar?cites=14053885783793706440,,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/5/6/1481/pdf,0,0,0

Rising global demand for palm oil is likely to exacerbate deforestation rates in oil palmproducing countries. This will lead to a net reduction in biodiversity unless measures can be taken to improve the value of oil palm plantations.2. Here. I investigate whether the biodiversity of oil palm plantations can be increased by determining how forest-dwelling butterflies and birds in these plantations are affected by vegetation characteristics at the local level (eg epiphyte prevalence) and by natural forest cover at the landscape level (eg old-growth forests surrounding oil palm estates). 3. Across transects. vegetation variables explained 0–1· 2% of the variation in butterfly species richness and 0–7% of that in bird species richness.

Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this. we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability. namely sensitivity. exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species’ biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date. we applied this approach to each of the world’s birds. amphibians and corals (16.857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated. including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds. and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species. and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608–851 bird (6–9%). 670–933 amphibian (11–15%). and 47–73 coral species (6–9%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the IUCN Red List.

Here we present a first attempt to provide a global framework for the next step of strategically expanding the network to cover mammals. amphibians. freshwater turtles and tortoises. and globally threatened birds. We identify unprotected areas of the world that have remarkably high conservation value (irreplaceability) and are under serious threat.

To minimize global biodiversity losses. conservationists need to identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In this Review. we summarize different currencies used for assessing species' climate change vulnerability. We describe three main approaches used to derive these currencies (correlative. mechanistic and trait-based). and their associated data requirements. spatial and temporal scales of application and modelling methods.

However. we do not yet have an adequate way of monitoring progress towards achieving this target. Here we present a method for producing indices based on the IUCN Red List to chart the overall threat status (projected relative extinction risk) of all the world's bird species from 1988 to 2004. Red List Indices (RLIs) are based on the number of species in each Red List category. and on the number changing categories between assessments as a result of genuine improvement or deterioration in status. The RLI for all bird species shows that their overall threat status has continued to deteriorate since 1988. Disaggregated indices show that deteriorations have occurred worldwide and in all major ecosystems. but with particularly steep declines in the indices for Indo-Malayan birds (driven by intensifying deforestation of the Sundaic lowlands) and for albatrosses and petrels (driven by incidental mortality in commercial longline fisheries). RLIs complement indicators based on species population trends and habitat extent for quantifying global trends in the status of biodiversity. Their main weaknesses are that the resolution of status changes is fairly coarse and that delays may occur before some status changes are detected. Their greatest strength is that they are based on information from nearly all species in a taxonomic group worldwide. rather than a potentially biased subset. At present. suitable data are only available for birds. but indices for other taxonomic groups are in …,True,RMg7RqkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,543,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020383,10568972737468392233,/scholar?cites=10568972737468392233,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020383,0,0,0

Predictions of species' responses to climate change. incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal. allow us to explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns. shifts at the edge of the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For Romerolagus diazi (volcano rabbit). the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700 m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation. as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare). we modelled the British metapopulation.

It has been widely recognised as an important component of the suite of indicators needed to measure progress towards the international target of significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. However. further application of the RLI (to non-avian taxa in particular) has revealed some shortcomings in the original formula and approach: It performs inappropriately when a value of zero is reached; RLI values are affected by the frequency of assessments; and newly evaluated species may introduce bias. Here we propose a revision to the formula. and recommend how it should be applied in order to overcome these shortcomings.

The goal of this essay is to review the potential applications of metapopulation concepts and models in reserve design and conservation management. Our perspective is forward-looking. We show how some key problems of where to direct conservation effort and how to manage populations can be addressed in the context of regional habitat structure and the survival and renewal of habitat patches. We also mention several cases of successful metapopulation management and point out practical problems (for example. see Box 5.1) We emphasize:1. that the viability of a population may depend on surrounding populations. in which case metapopulation processes influence or determine reserve design and management options; 2. that understanding the dynamic processes of populations requires models. which make assumptions that need validating; 3. that the principle limitation of metapopulation models is their single-species focus.Conservation strategies clearly depend on the particular social. economic and ecological circumstances of each region. and concepts such as the metapopulation can seem irrelevant to practical concerns. We aim to show. nevertheless. that an understanding of metapopulation dynamics can be vital to asking pertinent questions and seeking potential solutions.

1108915,The impact of Aboriginal landscape burning on the Australian biota,1998,David MJS Bowman,140,,3,385-410,Cambridge University Press,One of the most complex and contentious issues in Australian ecology concerns the environmental impact of Aboriginal landscape burning. This issue is not only important for the development of a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Australian biota. but is central to the formulation of appropriate strategies for the conservation of the nation's biodiversity. Ethnographic evidence leaves little doubt that Aboriginal burning played a central role in the maintenance of the landscapes subsequently colonized by Europeans. Both 19th century European colonists and anthropologists in the 20th century documented the indispensability of fire as a tool in traditional Aboriginal economies. which have aptly been described as ‘fire‐stick farming’. Aborigines used fire to achieve short‐term outcomes such as providing favourable habitats for herbivores or increasing the local abundance of food plants …,True,RExHKW8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,516,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1998.00289.x,11397038036041288391,/scholar?cites=11397038036041288391,,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1998.00289.x,0,0,0

Why is fire a critical ecological factor in every Australian landscape? What were the consequences of the use of fire by the Ice Age colonists? In this original and challenging book. David Bowman critically examines all hypotheses that have been advanced to answer these questions. He demonstrates that fire is the most critical factor in controlling the distribution of rainforest throughout Australia. Furthermore. while Aboriginal people used fire to skillfully manage and preserve habitats. he concludes that they did not significantly influence the evolution of Australia's unique flora and fauna.

Climate is clearly important. but extensive savannas in some high rainfall areas suggest a decoupling of climate and vegetation. In some situations edaphic factors are important. with forest often associated with high nutrient availability. Fire also plays a key role in limiting forest. with fire exclusion often causing a switch from savanna to forest. These observations can be captured by a broad conceptual model with two components: (1) forest and savanna are alternative stable states. maintained by tree cover‐fire feedbacks. (2) the interaction between tree growth rates and fire frequency limits forest development; any factor that increases growth (e.g. elevated availability of water. nutrients.

Australia is among the most fire-prone continents. with most of the landmass occupied by the fire-dependent sclerophyll and savanna biomes. In contrast to biomes with similar climates in other continents. Australia has a tree flora dominated by a single genus. Eucalyptus. and related Myrtaceae. A unique mechanism in Myrtaceae for enduring and recovering from fire damage likely resulted in this dominance. Here. we find a conserved phylogenetic relationship between post-fire resprouting (epicormic) anatomy and biome evolution. dating from 60 to 62 Ma. in the earliest Palaeogene.

Here we synthesize the most highly cited literature on treefalls. from 1985 to 2016 (in three-year blocks). highlighting the importance of the causes. characteristics and consequences of such events. We then ask how this knowledge might contribute to the broader conceptual model of forest dynamics. and develop two conceptual models. which we use to illustrate both the classic and alternative views of how forests ‘work’. Treefalls are one of the few ‘integrating’attributes of forests. because of their ubiquity and longevity. and therefore can inform a variety of processes (eg. tree mortality. turnover rates. structural impacts. recruitment. and fire frequency) due to their impacts occurring simultaneously over space (patterns). and time (legacy effects).

Here we argue that past attempts to define forests and forest degradation. focusing on attributes of living trees (eg. height. canopy cover). combined with regenerating processes such as recruitment and succession. whilst useful. are ecologically incomplete. These approaches do not adequately represent processes that. operating over long time scales. determine whether a forest system is structurally healthy (as opposed to degraded). functional and persistent. We support our case using a conceptual model to illustrate how deeper-time processes. as well as instantaneous or chronic disturbances that cause degradation. might be revealed through analysis of the patterns of size structure and density of the fallen wood. in relation to the living trees and standing dead. We propose practical ways in which researchers can incorporate dynamic. long-term processes into definitions of forests and forest degradation. using measurements of dead and fallen trees.

Climate change. habitat loss. and recent extinctions are examples of impacts on natural systems that have been used as markers of global environmental degradation associated with the expanding influence of humans (Barnosky et  al.. 2012; McGill et al.. 2015). Past civilizations have faced rapid declines and even collapsed in the face of regional environmental degradation. drought. and other environmental challenges (Scheffer. 2016; Butzer and Endfield. 2012). This begs the question of whether long-term societal relationships with the planet’s ecology may be approaching a global tipping point as the human population hurtles toward ten billion people. If this is indeed the case. the future of both biodiversity and humanity hangs in the balance. The hypothesis is that without urgent action to prevent reaching a global tipping point. the natural life support systems that sustain humanity may fail abruptly. with drastic consequences.,True,x2kBtmQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,3,http://ecite.utas.edu.au/122674,2621799121692996026,/scholar?cites=2621799121692996026,,,0,0,0

When human activities act to disaggregate once-contiguous forest or other terrestrial ecosystems. and convert intervening spaces into a ‘matrix’ of agriculture. roads and urban areas. it can be difficult for resident species to sustain connected populations (Saunders. Hobbs & Margules 1991). Dispersal ability and inter-patch migration rates are therefore important determinants of a species’ ability to persist and navigate throughout these human-altered environments. But mobility can also be a double-edged sword (Fahrig 2007). Movement involves certain risk to individuals. resulting in costs to energy expenditure that amplifies with time spent moving. and increased mortality risk that has the potential to deplete source populations of potential future breeders. The trade-off between the benefits and costs of mobility in fragmented landscapes and its implications for extinction risk have consequently been a central problem for conservation.,True,x2kBtmQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,http://ecite.utas.edu.au/117209,14918757357367103965,/scholar?cites=14918757357367103965,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1365-2435.12639,0,0,0

This prediction has been demonstrated in experimental settings (two-species mixtures) but is yet to be observed in the field with more realistically complex communities. We used a combination of (a) field measurements of tree-community composition.(b) sampling of soil from a subset of these sites (ie. the local environment). and (c) a decomposition experiment of forest litter to examine whether there is a local-scale effect of the nitrogen-fixing Acacia dealbata Link (presence and abundance) on nitrogen availability. and whether increases in this essential nutrient led to greater biomass of the canopy tree species. Eucalyptus obliqua L’Hér. Average A. dealbata tree size was a significant predictor of forest basal area in 24 plots (12% deviance explained) and. when combined with average distance between trees. explained 29.1% variance in E. obliqua biomass. However. static patterns of local nitrogen concentration were unrelated to the presence or size of A. dealbata. despite our experiments showing that A. dealbata leaf litter controls decomposition rates in the soil (due to three times higher N). Such results are important for forest management in the context of understanding the timing and turnover of shorter-lived species like acacias. where higher N (through either litter or soil) might be better detected early in community establishment (when growth is faster and intraspecific competition more intense) but with that early signal subsequently dissipated.

Many animals. particularly scavengers. use roads as they provide a reliable source of food. such as carrion left after vehicle collisions. Tasmania is often cited as the 9roadkill capital of Australia9. with the isolated offshore islands in the Bass Strait experiencing similar. if not higher. levels of roadkill. However. native mammalian predators on the islands are extirpated. meaning the remaining scavengers are likely to experience lower interference competition. In this study. we use a naturally occurring experiment to examine how the loss of mammalian carnivores within a community impacts roadside foraging behaviour by avian scavengers. We monitored the locations of roadkill and forest ravens (Corvus tasmanicus). an abundant scavenger species. on eight road transects across the Tasmanian mainland (high scavenging competition) and the Bass Strait islands (low scavenging competition). We represented raven observations as one-dimensional point patterns. using hierarchical Bayesian models to investigate the dependence of raven spatial intensity on habitat. season. distance to roadkill and route location. We found that roadkill carcasses were a strong predictor of raven presence along road networks. The effect of roadkill was amplified on roads on the Bass Strait islands. where roadside carrion was a predictor of raven presence across the entire year. In contrast. ravens were more often associated with roadkill on Tasmanian mainland roads in the autumn. when other resources were low.

Extirpated from mainland Australia in the mid-Holocene. the large island of Tasmania became the species9 final stronghold. Following European settlement. the Thylacine was heavily persecuted and pushed to the margins of its range. The last captive animal died in 1936. but numerous sightings were reported thereafter. Here we collate and characterize the type. quality. and uncertainty of over a thousand unique sighting records of Thylacines since 1910. We use this novel and unique curated database to underpin a detailed reconstruction and mapping of the species9 spatio-temporal distributional dynamics. to pinpoint refugia of late survival and estimate the bioregional patterns of extirpation. Contrary to expectations. the inferred extinction window is wide and relatively recent. spanning from the 1980s to the present day. with extinction most likely in the late 1990s or early 2000s. While improbable. these aggregate data and modelling suggest some chance of ongoing persistence in the remote wilderness of the island.

Studies of distribution often use occurrence data to build models of the environmental niche of a species. Environmental suitability (ES) derived from such models may be used to predict the potential distributions of species. The ability of such models to predict spatial patterns in abundance is unknown; we argue that there should be a positive relationship between ES and local abundance. This will be so if ES reflects how well the species’ physiological and ecological requirements are met at a site and if those factors also determine local abundance. However. the presence of other factors may indicate that potential abundance is not attained at all sites. Therefore.

Living large herbivores are a small remnant of the assemblages of giants that existed in most terrestrial ecosystems 50 000 years ago. The extinction of so many large herbivores may well have triggered large changes in plant communities. In several parts of the world. palaeoecological studies suggest that extinct megafauna once maintained vegetation openness. and in wooded landscapes created mosaics of different structural types of vegetation with high habitat and species diversity. Following megafaunal extinction. these habitats reverted to more dense and uniform formations.

However. apex predators are often subject to lethal control aimed at minimizing attacks on livestock. Lethal control can affect both the abundance and behaviour of apex predators. These changes could in turn influence the abundance and behaviour of mesopredators. We used remote camera surveys at nine pairs of large Australian rangeland properties. comparing properties that controlled dingoes Canis lupus dingo with properties that did not. to test the effects of predator control on dingo activity and to evaluate the responses of a mesopredator. the feral cat Felis catus.

Impacts are rarely direct. and usually appear driven via indirect pathways. such as changes to predator-prey dynamics. Fire events and grazing may improve habitat and/or hunting success for the predators of small mammals. however. such impacts have not been documented. To test for such an interaction. we investigated fine-scale habitat selection by feral cats in relation to fire. grazing and small-mammal abundance. Our study was conducted in north-western Australia. where small mammal populations are sensitive to changes in fire and grazing management. We deployed GPS collars on 32 cats in landscapes with contrasting fire and grazing treatments. Fine-scale habitat selection was determined using discrete choice modelling of cat movements. We found that cats selected areas with open grass cover. including heavily-grazed areas. They strongly selected for areas recently burnt by intense fires. but only in habitats that typically support high abundance of small mammals. Intense fires and grazing by introduced herbivores created conditions that are favoured by cats. probably because their hunting success is improved. This mechanism could explain why. in northern Australia. impacts of feral cats on small mammals might have increased. Our results suggest the impact of feral cats could be reduced in most ecosystems by maximising grass cover. minimising the incidence of intense fires. and reducing grazing by large herbivores.,True,C0N6fXsAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC,175,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109097,5723806285250283306,/scholar?cites=5723806285250283306,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109097,0,0,0

Many host communities could be affected by increased prevalence of disease. heightening the risk of extinction for many already threatened species. To understand how host communities could be affected by changing parasite distributions. we need information on the distribution of parasites in relation to variables like temperature and rainfall that are predicted to be affected by climate change.   Methodology/Principal Findings We determined relations between prevalence of blood parasites. temperature. and seasonal rainfall in a bird community of the Australian Wet Tropics along an elevation gradient. We used PCR screening to investigate the prevalence and lineage diversity of four genera of blood parasites (Plasmodium. Haemoproteus. Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma) in 403 birds. The overall prevalence of the four genera of blood parasites was 32.3%. with Haemoproteus the predominant genus. A total of 48 unique lineages were detected. Independent of elevation. parasite prevalence was positively and strongly associated with annual temperature. Parasite prevalence was elevated during the dry season.   Conclusions/Significance Low temperatures of the higher elevations can help to reduce both the development of avian haematozoa and the abundance of parasite vectors. and hence parasite prevalence. In contrast. high temperatures of the lowland areas provide an excellent environment for the development and transmission of haematozoa.

Body mass is linked to extinction risk in Australian mammals. but the nature of this association is controversial. A widely held view is that species of intermediate body mass (between 35 and 5500 g. the ‘critical weight range’. CWR) have declined most severely. However. the existence of the CWR has been disputed. In this paper we clarify the relationship of decline status and body mass in Australian marsupials. We show that the form of this relationship differs for ground‐living versus arboreal species. and for species from low versus high rainfall areas. Among ground‐living species and those from low‐rainfall areas. declines were strongly size‐selective and concentrated on species within the CWR.

Such interactions between predator species can reduce the intensity of predation on vulnerable prey. Suppression of mesopredators by top predators is a potentially important process that could protect small prey species from unsustainable predation.  2 There is some evidence that in Australia. the dingo Canis lupus suppresses populations of the red fox Vulpes vulpes. This interaction could be significant to biodiversity conservation because while dingoes have been in Australia for several thousand years and coexist with a wide range of small mammals. the fox is a recent arrival which has caused declines and extinctions. and continues to threaten many prey species.  3 However the strength of the effect of dingoes on foxes is unclear. and some published data have been interpreted as …,True,C0N6fXsAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,138,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01650.x,4659686090403775381,/scholar?cites=4659686090403775381,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01650.x,0,0,0

These effects are poorly understood due to the difficulty of observing actual hunting behaviours. We attached collar-mounted video cameras to feral cats living in a tropical savanna environment in northern Australia. and measured variation in hunting success among different microhabitats (open areas. dense grass and complex rocks). From 89 hours of footage. we recorded 101 hunting events. of which 32 were successful. Of these kills. 28% were not eaten. Hunting success was highly dependent on microhabitat structure surrounding prey. increasing from 17% in habitats with dense grass or complex rocks to 70% in open areas. This research shows that habitat structure has a profound influence on the impacts of small predators on their prey. This has broad implications for management of vegetation and disturbance processes (like fire and grazing) in areas where feral cats threaten native fauna.

This application of SA models hinges on two fundamental assumptions: the resultant landscape matrix is inhospitable to the taxa of interest; and edge effects do not factor into extinction risks. Despite growing consensus that these assumptions are unrealistic. the SA approach continues to be used in assessments of biodiversity decline and conservation planning. 2.  We propose an overhaul of the SA approach by accounting for taxon‐specific responses to landscape‐specific matrix quality and deleterious effects of habitat edges. We pitted nine variants of an improved SA model (calibrated for edge and/or matrix) against two variants of the conventional model (calibrated with island or continental z values) to predict species extinction and endangerment in 15 tropical biodiversity hotspots. 3.  The matrix …,True,euw7CcQAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,63,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01860.x,16418872540175764258,/scholar?cites=16418872540175764258,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01860.x,0,0,0

1109029,Predicting the evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting on a quantitative trait,2018,Tim Coulson and Susanne Schindler and Lochran Traill and Bruce E Kendall,82,The Journal of Wildlife Management,1,46-56,,Some ecologists suggest that trophy hunting (e.g.. harvesting males with a desirable trait above a certain size) can lead to rapid phenotypic change. which has led to an ongoing discussion about evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting. Claims of rapid evolution come from the statistical analyses of data. with no examination of whether these results are theoretically plausible. We constructed simple quantitative genetic models to explore how a range of hunting scenarios affects the evolution of a trophy such as horn length. We show that trophy hunting does lead to trophy evolution defined as change in the mean breeding value of the trait.

Alternative hypotheses relating the effect of climatic and environmental parameters to diversity were tested using generalized linear models and ranked according to information-theoretic statistics.

There was a lack of statistical support for our hypothesis that regional spatial variation in arid region diversity can be explained by climate topography. Arid South Australian species diversity appears to be largely driven by environmental parameters at the localized scale–beyond the resolution of available survey data.

Among ungulates. bovids are particularly vulnerable as many species are harvested as bushmeat and have large home range requirements. Here we determined the extent of geographic distribution and species richness (extent of range overlap) for bovids (Order. Artiodactyla. Family.

Based on the extent of range overlap. we found that bovid species richness is relatively high in the tropics. particularly across central and east Africa. We used generalised linear mixed models and multimodel inference to determine the parameters associated with extirpation. accounting for evolutionary relatedness (random effects). The best predictor of bovid extinction risk was body mass. Overall model deviance explained was low (3% for the global model). suggesting that localised correlates of population decline (not accounted for at a macro-ecological scale) may be key to conservation effort.

MVP has seen practical application in conservation management and species recovery programs. and is relevant to the IUCN’s Red List criteria regarding small and range-restricted populations.

We identify and discuss five areas of enquiry that are of high importance for species distribution modelling: (1) clarification of the niche concept; (2) improved designs for sampling data for building models; (3) improved parameterization; (4) improved model selection and predictor contribution; and (5) improved model evaluation. The challenges discussed in this essay do not preclude the need for developments of other areas of research in this field.

To investigate ecosystem service supply during the 21st century. we used a range of ecosystem models and scenarios of climate and land-use change to conduct a Europe-wide assessment. Large changes in climate and land use typically resulted in large changes in ecosystem service supply. Some of these trends may be positive (for example. increases in forest area and productivity) or offer opportunities (for example. “surplus land” for agricultural extensification and bioenergy production).

The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present‐day climate–species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However. there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea. for the first time. and provide tests for two null hypotheses: (H0 1) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo.

Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here. we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico. the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future. under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario. and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action.

In this article. we compare and discuss the different uses of four forecasting methods: (1) models that consider species individually. (2) niche-theory models that group species by habitat (more specifically. by environmental conditions under which a species can persist or does persist). (3) general circulation models and coupled ocean–atmosphere–biosphere models. and (4) species–area curve models that consider all species or large aggregates of species. After outlining the different uses and limitations of these methods. we make eight primary suggestions for improving forecasts. We find that greater use of the fossil record and of modern genetic studies would improve forecasting methods.

Wiley,The degree to which species' distributions are at equilibrium with current climate is an important issue in the ecological literature (Davis 1986. Gaston 2003). Distin-guishing the relative roles of present and past climates in determining species' distributions is not only of theoretical interest. but is key to understanding responses of species to climate change. Recent work has demonstrated significant departures from equilibrium with current climate for tree distributions in Europe (Sven-ning and Skov 2004). yet differences in the degree of equilibrium can be expected across organisms whose dispersal abilities (and hence ability to track changing climate conditions) vary greatly.

Yet. uncertainty regarding their applicability remains because of inconsistency of definitions. a lack of standard methods for estimating effectiveness. and variable spatial scales considered. We present a Bayesian meta-analysis of the effectiveness of biological surrogates in marine ecosystems. Surrogate effectiveness was defined both as the proportion of surrogacy tests where predictions based on surrogates were better than random (i.e.. low probability of making a Type I error; P) and as the predictability of targets using surrogates (R2). A total of 264 published surrogacy tests combined with prior probabilities elicited from eight international experts demonstrated that the habitat. spatial scale. type of surrogate and statistical method used all influenced surrogate effectiveness. at least according to either P or R2. The type of surrogate used (higher-taxa. cross-taxa or subset taxa) was the best predictor of P. with the higher-taxa surrogates outperforming all others. The marine habitat was the best predictor of R2. with particularly low predictability in tropical reefs. Surrogate effectiveness was greatest for higher-taxa surrogates at a <10-km spatial scale. in low-complexity marine habitats such as soft bottoms. and using multivariate-based methods.

The theta‐logistic is a simple and flexible model for describing how the growth rate of a population slows as abundance increases. Starting at rm (taken as the maximum population growth rate). the growth response decreases in a convex or concave way (according to the shape parameter θ) to zero when the population reaches carrying capacity. 2. We demonstrate that fitting this model to census data is not robust and explain why.

Here. we present the first quantitative systematic review of this form. using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories. including invertebrates. herbaceous plants and long-lived trees. and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. We found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However. establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches. with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely. no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study (field to global) or methodology (observational. experimental. or proxy) used.

Here. we show that species of Australian marsupials are at higher risk if they belong to genera that are species‐poor. old or phylogenetically distinct. Extinction risk in this group is also related to habitat and body size. being higher for species from non‐forested habitats and of intermediate body size. We tested the extent to which the phylogenetic selectivity of extinction was explained by this ecological pattern. We found that while genus size and distinctiveness explain no variation in extinction risk that is not accounted for by habitat and body size. there is a significant residual association of genus age with extinction risk. This suggests that while species in small and distinctive genera are at high risk because they are overrepresented in non‐forested habitats and intermediate body size classes. species in …,True,yauSjlkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,55,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1017/S1367943002002196,7471050190234078047,/scholar?cites=7471050190234078047,,,0,0,0

Quantifying the environmental factors that affect the persistence of avian influenza virus is important for influencing our ability to predict future outbreaks and target surveillance and control methods. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the environmental factors that affect the decay of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in water. Abiotic factors affecting the persistence of LPAIV have been investigated for nearly 40 years. yet published data was produced by only 26 quantitative studies. These studies have been conducted by a small number of principal authors (n = 17) and have investigated a narrow range of environmental conditions. all of which were based in laboratories with limited reflection of natural conditions. The use of quantitative meta-analytic techniques provided the opportunity to assess persistence across a greater range of conditions than each individual study can achieve. through the estimation of mean effect-sizes and relationships among multiple variables.

Dugong and calf data were obtained from standardized aerial surveys conducted along the study region. A range of lagged versions of each of the focal climatic drivers (1 to 4 years) were included in a global model containing the proportion of calves in each population crossed with each of the lagged versions of the climatic drivers to explore relationships. The relative influence of each predictor was estimated via Gibbs variable selection. The relationships between the proportion of dependent calves and the climatic drivers varied spatially and temporally. with climatic drivers influencing calf counts at sub-regional scales.

We demonstrate that the shapes of the dose distributions can be used to assess the likelihood that aliquots consist only of grains that were well-bleached at the time of deposition. The more asymmetric the distribution. the greater the probability that the aliquots with the lowest dose most closely represent the true burial dose. Single grains with differing doses are present in each of the samples examined. and the population with the lowest dose gives an optical age consistent with the expected burial age.

This paper briefly reviews the key historical developments in luminescence dating. from its roots in thermoluminescence dating of heated minerals to the development of optical dating methods for sunlight-exposed sediments. We describe the principles and practicalities of the various techniques commonly used in luminescence dating. including multiple-aliquot. single-aliquot and single-grain procedures. and we discuss some of the latest approaches to recognising and minimising potential errors in age estimation (e.g.. by means of component analysis and dose distribution methods in optical dating).

1109138,Stochastic modelling of multi-grain equivalent dose (De) distributions: Implications for OSL dating of sediment mixtures,2009,Lee J Arnold and Richard G Roberts,4,Quaternary Geochronology,3,204-230,Elsevier,A number of recent optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) studies have cited post-depositional mixing as a dominant source of equivalent dose (De) scatter across a range of sedimentary environments. including those previously considered ‘best suited’ for OSL dating. The potentially insidious nature of sediment mixing means that this problem may often only be identifiable by careful statistical analysis of De data sets. This study aims to address some of the important issues associated with the characterisation and statistical treatment of mixed De distributions at the multi-grain scale of analysis. using simulated De data sets produced with a simple stochastic model. Using this Monte Carlo approach we were able to generate theoretical distributions of single-grain De values. which were then randomly mixed together to simulate multi-grain aliquot De distributions containing a known number of mixing components …,True,A0gmHuMAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,282,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871101408000605,4674884845514662043,/scholar?cites=4674884845514662043,,,0,0,0

One approach to testing. and perhaps circumventing. this assumption is to examine the apparent date of last exposure to daylight of individual sediment grains. This paper reports on the application. for the first time. of 2 new measurement protocols to the estimation of the radiation dose received during burial for individual quartz grains from an aeolian deposit of known age (10.000 year old). which is considered likely to have been completely reset by sunlight at deposition.

We foresee (i) major expansion and intensification of tropical agriculture. especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America; (ii) continuing rapid loss and alteration of tropical old-growth forests. woodlands. and semi-arid environments; (iii) a pivotal role for new roadways in determining the spatial extent of agriculture; and (iv) intensified conflicts between food production and nature conservation.

The protocol involves three steps: (1) identification of focal taxa of particular conservation or management interest. (2) measurement of an ‘edge function’ that describes the response of these taxa to induced edges. and (3) use of a ‘Core-Area Model’ to extrapolate edge function parameters to existing or novel situations. The Core-Area Model accurately estimates the total area of pristine habitat contained within fragments. Moreover. it can be used to predict the amount of unaltered habitat preserved within any hypothetical fragment. such as a planned park or nature reserve. regardless of its size or shape.

Empirical studies of fragmented landscapes often reveal strong effects of fragment area and isolation on species richness. although other predictions of the theory. such as accelerated species turnover in fragments. have been tested less frequently. As predicted by IBT. biota in fragments typically ‘relax’ over time towards lower species richness. Beyond these broad generalizations. however. the relevance of IBT for understanding fragmented ecosystems is limited. First.

We find that across 59 sites. the above–ground dry biomass in trees that are more than 10 cm in diameter (AGB) has increased since plot establishment by 1.22 ± 0.43 Mg per hectare per year (ha−1 yr−1). where 1 ha = 104 m2). or 0.98 ± 0.38 Mg ha−1 yr−1 if individual plot values are weighted by the number of hectare years of monitoring. This significant increase is neither confounded by spatial or temporal variation in wood specific gravity. nor dependent on the allometric equation used to estimate AGB.

Such prioritization is often qualitative. subjective. and sometimes biased. relying mostly on expert and stakeholder consultation. In recent years. cluster based analyses have been used to investigate regional pest species assemblages or pest profiles to indicate the risk of new organism establishment. Such an approach is based on the premise that the cooccurrence of well-known global invasive pest species in a region is not random. and that the pest species profile or assemblage integrates complex functional relationships that are difficult to tease apart. In other words. the assemblage can help identify and prioritise species that pose a threat in a target region. A computational intelligence method called a Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM). a type of artificial neural network. was the first clustering method applied to analyse assemblages of invasive pests. The SOM is a well known dimension reduction and visualization method especially useful for high dimensional data that more conventional clustering methods may not analyse suitably. Like all clustering algorithms. the SOM can give details of clusters that identify regions with similar pest assemblages. possible donor and recipient regions.

This approach asks the participants to identify the factors which are important to the management and performance of their orchards and to link these on a map. An aggregated or group map was produced from each of the individual orchardist maps. Data from the group map were used to characterise the overall orchard system as well as each of the three management systems being studied. A predominant finding is the degree of similarity in the maps of growers from across all three panels. Despite these overall findings. there were still differences operating between the three panels of growers. The overall group map reflects a production orientation and that the kiwifruit system is perceived as more of a management system rather than an environmental one. Organic orchardists produced a group map having the most distinctive qualities but they also shared a small number of distinctive characteristics with Gold orchardists. Both used more connections and more double arrows compared to Green. We conclude that the evidence supports the claim that at the aggregate level of the 36 kiwifruit orchardists the orchard system is not overly complex but at the level of each individual orchardist it is complex. Further. orchardists do not show a high level of holistic thinking about their orchard.,True,Z29KBKYAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,15,http://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/71,4170804753457698323,/scholar?cites=4170804753457698323,,http://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10182/71/argos_rr_2006_09.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

These strengths include fast and accurate learning. good generalisation capabilities. excellent explanation facilities in the form of semantically meaningful fuzzy rules. and the ability to accommodate both data and existing expert knowledge about the problem under consideration. The paper presents one particular architecture called FuNN and discusses two alternative ways to optimise its structure. namely a genetic algorithm and a method of learning-with-forgetting. The optimised structure has much less connections and can easily be interpreted in terms of fuzzy rules.

Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales. the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers. we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses. and lack of strong continental interconnectivity. probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale. without an expectation of marked tipping patterns.

However. published future food demand estimates range substantially. making it difficult to determine optimal policies. Here we present a systematic review of the food demand literature—including a meta-analysis of papers reporting average global food demand predictions—and test the effect of model complexity on predictions. We show that while estimates of future global kilocalorie demand have a broad range. they are not consistently dependent on model complexity or form.

With food demand projected to rise. one of the central challenges in minimizing agriculture's impacts on the climate and biodiversity is to increase crop production with higher yields rather than more cropland. However. quantifying progress is challenging. When analyzed at the most aggregated. global level. yields can be defined as the total crop output per unit area per year. but aggregate yields are driven by multiple factors. only some of which have a clear relationship to improved agricultural production. To date. there is no research that simultaneously determines how much of rising crop production has been met by rising aggregate yields versus cropland expansion. while also quantifying the unique contribution of each yield driver.

Although these estimates of risk can be accurate. the lists have inevitably become linked to several decision-making processes.

1109218,Bias in species range estimates from minimum convex polygons: implications for conservation and options for improved planning,2003,Mark A Burgman and Julian C Fox,6,Animal Conservation,1,19-28,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Minimum convex polygons (convex hulls) are an internationally accepted. standard method for estimating species' ranges. particularly in circumstances in which presence‐only data are the only kind of spatially explicit data available. One of their main strengths is their simplicity. They are used to make area statements and to assess trends in occupied habitat. and are an important part of the assessment of the conservation status of species. We show by simulation that these estimates are biased. The bias increases with sample size. and is affected by the underlying shape of the species habitat. the magnitude of errors in locations. and the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort. The errors affect both area statements and estimates of trends. Some of these errors may be reduced through the application of α‐hulls. which are generalizations of convex hulls. but they cannot be eliminated entirely. α‐hulls …,True,O4YYKCsAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,501,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1017/S1367943003003044,12539190908232551312,/scholar?cites=12539190908232551312,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d6ef/997e5b9d08fa11f5d9e7f454c40bb0424de9.pdf,0,0,0

Failure to acknowledge and treat uncertainty can lead to poor decisions. To illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty. we reanalyze a decision problem for the Sumatran rhino. Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. using information‐gap theory to propagate uncertainties and to rank management options. Rather than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at the outset. information‐gap theory addresses the question of how much uncertainty can be tolerated before our decision would change.

Although the IUCN Red List criteria provide an effective assessment protocol for species. a standard global assessment of risks to higher levels of biodiversity is currently limited. In 2008. IUCN initiated development of risk assessment criteria to support a global Red List of ecosystems. We present a new conceptual model for ecosystem risk assessment founded on a synthesis of relevant ecological theories. To support the model. we review key elements of ecosystem definition and introduce the concept of ecosystem collapse. an analogue of species extinction. The model identifies four distributional and functional symptoms of ecosystem risk as a basis for assessment criteria: A) rates of decline in ecosystem distribution; B) restricted distributions with continuing declines or threats; C) rates of environmental (abiotic) degradation; and D) rates of disruption to biotic processes. A fifth criterion. E) quantitative estimates of the risk of ecosystem collapse. enables integrated assessment of multiple processes and provides a conceptual anchor for the other criteria. We present the theoretical rationale for the construction and interpretation of each criterion. The assessment protocol and threat categories mirror those of the IUCN Red List of species.

To do this. conservation areas must be able to mitigate at least some of the proximate threats to biodiversity. Information on threatening processes and the relative vulnerability of areas and natural features to these processes is therefore crucial for effective conservation planning. However. measuring and incorporating vulnerability into conservation planning have been problematic. We develop a conceptual framework of the role of vulnerability assessments in conservation planning and propose a definition of vulnerability that incorporates three dimensions: exposure. intensity. and impact.

Australia,2002,Jane Elith and Mark A Burgman,,Predicting species occurrences: issues of accuracy and scale,,303-314,,Predictions of species distributions may be useful in prioritising land acquisitions for reserve status. Models of the probability or likelihood of species presence use the relationship between presence-only or presence-absence species data and associated environmental variables to predict species distribution at un-surveyed sites. usually over a continuous area. In this paper we present modeled distributions for eight plant species (four classified as rare) developed with four modeling methods (bioclimatic profiles. a genetic algorithm. generalized additive models and generalized linear models) from existing government flora records and environmental data. The ability of the models to discriminate between sites of presence and sites of absence has been assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics calculated on both the modeling data set and an independent validation data set. At a regional scale. most models showed good discrimination (ROC area greater than 0.85 for 91% of models). but at a subcatchment scale the majority of models do not show sufficient discrimination to be useful in land-use decisions. The ROC statistics calculated on the modeling data over-estimated the abililty of the models to discriminate between presence and absence sites in new cells. While there was a trend for the three methods based on presence-absence data to perform better than the presence-only method. the differences were not substantial.

We modelled a range of zero-emissions energy scenarios across nations that were designed to meet projected final energy demand in 2060. and optimised to derive the best globally aggregated results in terms of minimising costs and land use (a surrogate for environmental impacts).

Here we seek to challenge that viewpoint. We argue that a completely decarbonized. energy-rich and sustainable future could be achieved with a dominant deployment of next-generation nuclear fission and associated technologies for synthesizing liquid fuels and recycling waste. By contrast. non-dispatchable energy sources like wind and solar energy are arguably superfluous. other than for niche applications. and run the risk of diverting resources away from viable and holistic solutions. For instance. the pairing of variable renewables with natural-gas backup fails to address many of the entrenched problems we seek to solve. Our conclusion is that. given the urgent time frame and massive extent of the energy-replacement challenge. half-measures that distract from or stymie effective policy and infrastructure investment should be avoided.

Tasmania and Tenerife,2018,Sanghyun Hong and Barry W Brook,11,Energies,10,2587,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) offer the promise of providing carbon-free electricity and heat to small islands or isolated electricity grids. However. the economic feasibility of SMRs is highly system-dependent and has not been studied in this context. We selected three case-study islands for such an evaluation: Jeju. Tasmania and Tenerife based on their system complexity. We generated 100.000 electricity-mix cases stochastically for each island and examined the system-level generation-cost changes by incrementing the average generation cost of SMRs from USD $60 to 200 MWh− 1. SMRs were found to be economically viable when average generation cost was< $100 MWh− 1 for Jeju and< $140 MWh− 1 for Tenerife. For Tasmania the situation was complex; hydroelectric power is an established competitor. but SMRs might be complementary in a future “battery of the nation” scenario where most of the island’s hydro capacity was exported to meet peak power demand on the mainland grid. The higher average generation cost of SMRs makes it difficult for them to compete economically with a fossil fuel/renewable mix in many contexts. However. we have demonstrated that SMRs can be an economically viable carbon-free option for a small island with a limited land area and high energy demand.

Moreover. in many East Asian and European countries with large demand and high population densities. there is limited land for energy production. In this thesis I look at the problem of fossil-fuel replacement by nuclear and renewables. focusing on three relevant case studies (South Korea. Japan and Australia). I first calculate the maximum limits of renewable-energy sources in South Korea. revealing that geophysical constraints mean that renewable energy could only supply < 35% of electricity consumption.

In this study. we propose a multi-criteria assessment framework to evaluate the future application of energy storage for a future electricity grid. We have selected six energy applications for a grid that can be provided by electrical energy storage: 1) bulk energy applications. 2) transmission related applications. 3) distributed network applications. 4) ancillary energy applications. 5) renewable energy integration applications. and 6) customer energy quality applications. We. then. identify the role of energy storage for each energy scenario using a quantitative multi-criteria assessment. Criteria are defined based on the technical characteristics of selected energy mixes. The proposed framework effectively presents energy storage applications for future energy scenarios. and identifies ‘no-regret’ options. Although the proposed framework is tested here against National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios for the United Kingdom. the methodology can be applied to any other scenarios and countries with some modifications.,True,1sUV8yEAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC,0,http://ecite.utas.edu.au/120962,,,,,0,0,0

Taking the argument much further. David Pearce and his colleagues show how progress towards sustainability in the UK can be measured. They set out the conditions for sustainable development and the measures of economic progress these imply. before looking in detail at all the main areas of economic activity to which the measures are applicable. The result is a wide-ranging and cogent critique of existing policies which also offers new options-options which will require far-reaching reform of this country's existing political and institutional structure.

This is the so-called resource curse hypothesis. Using cross-country regressions. we offer evidence that the curse may itself be a manifestation of the inability of governments to manage large resource revenues sustainably. In particular. these results offer another perspective on the resource curse hypothesis: the countries where growth has lagged are those where the combination of natural resource. macroeconomic and public expenditure policies have led to a low rate of genuine saving (net saving adjusted for resource depletion).,True,dL9oTQQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,635,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X03001529,18344586424564067247,/scholar?cites=18344586424564067247,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49046583/saving_growth_and_r_c_hypothesis.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper we investigate two such theoretical frameworks and the indicators that they suggest. Indicators associated with weak sustainability are characterized by aggregative indicators such as green national income. We conclude. however. that a more promising offshoot of green accounting is measures of genuine savings (i.e. savings adjusted for loss of assets). To achieve SD. genuine savings rates must not be persistently negative. Strong sustainability indicators accord a more central role to the conservation of critical natural assets within the broader goal of prudently managing a nation's portfolio of assets over time. We discuss two approaches—carrying capacity and resilience—and conclude that. while measures of resilience are potentially attractive. more research is required regarding the resilience-SD …,True,dL9oTQQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,297,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44378810,565704290312093485,/scholar?cites=565704290312093485,,,0,0,0

We use GTAP data and input–output analysis to estimate the flows of virtual carbon implicit in domestic production technologies and the pattern of international trade. The results present striking evidence on the wide variation in the carbon-intensiveness of trade across countries. with major developing countries being large net exporters of virtual carbon. Our analysis suggests that a tax on virtual carbon could lead to very substantial effective tariff rates on the exports of the most carbon-intensive developing nations. As an illustration. we find that average tariff rates of 10%. 8% and 12% would be faced by imports from China. India and South Africa if carbon is taxed at $50/ton CO2.

Economic theory suggests that there should be a link between future wellbeing and current wealth. This book explores this linkage under a variety of headings: population growth. technological change. deforestation and natural resource trade. While the relevant theory is presented briefly. the chief emphasis is on empirical measurement of the change in real wealth: this measure of net or genuine saving is a key indicator of sustainable development. The methodological and empirical work is bolstered by tests of the predictive power of genuine saving in explaining future consumption and economic growth. Just as importantly. the authors show that many resource-abundant countries would be considerably wealthier today had they managed to save and invest the profits from natural resource exploitation in the past.

A number of possible indicators have been suggested. all of which come under the general umbrella of “green accounting.” In response to the need for better environmental information. indicators such as air quality indices and water quality classifications have proliferated. 2 Policymakers …,True,dL9oTQQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,83,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00139157.1996.9930982,7670169906133598734,/scholar?cites=7670169906133598734,,http://materiales.untrefvirtual.edu.ar/documentos_extras/01118/doc/biblioteca/Atkinson_y_Hamilton_1996.pdf,0,0,0

The model implies that pollution emissions are properly valued at their marginal social costs in the measurement of green NNP. The level of genuine savings. net savings less the value of resource depletion and pollution emissions. is shown to provide a useful indicator of sustainable development.

Perhaps the most basic tenet of economics is that market equilibrium entails supply equalling demand; that if demand should exceed supply. prices will rise. decreasing demand and/or increasing supply until demand and supply are equated at the new equilibrium price. So if prices do their job. rationing should not exist. However. credit rationing and unemployment do in fact exist. They seem to imply an excess demand for loanable funds or an excess supply of workers.One method of"" explaining"" these conditions associates them with short-or long-term disequilibrium. In the short term they are viewed as temporary disequilibrium phenomena; that is. the economy has incurred an exogenous shock. and for reasons not fully explained. there is some stickiness in the prices of labor or capital (wages and interest rates) so that there is a transitional period during which rationing of jobs or credit …",True,2AF4iHIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,20317,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1802787,16729688553838169049,/scholar?cites=16729688553838169049,,https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8VX0SHB/download,0,0,0

Kratak pogled na njegovu biografiju otkriva i razloge za to. Nobelova nagrada. predavač na najistaknutijim američkim sveučilištima. veliki broj objavljenih radova u prestižnim svjetskim časopisima samo su neka od njegovih akademskih dostignuća. Uz akademske doprinose. Stiglitz je našao vremena i za „primijenjenu “ekonomiju. Tako je bio član. a potom i predsjednik Vijeća ekonomskih savjetnika u vrijeme kada je Clinton bio predsjednik Sjedinjenih Američkih Država. No. najznačajnije za ovu knjigu jest vrijeme provedeno u Svjetskoj banci. gdje je obnašao dužnost potpredsjednika i glavnog ekonomista u razdoblju od godine 1997. do 2000. Osim toga. Stiglitz je sudjelovao i na desetak misija Svjetske banke. koje su u knjizi često upotrebljavane kao „case studies “na kojima se pokazuje kako globalna birokracija funkcionira. Ti su prikazi dali dodatnu dozu autentičnosti izlaganju i autor se njima često koristi kao prikazom stvarnog stanja na terenu.

It is well known that problems can arise for three broad reasons: distributive justice; external effects; and scale economies. This paper is concerned with the last of these. The basic principle is easily stated.'A commodity should be produced if the costs can be covered by the sum of revenues and a properly defined measure of consumer's surplus. The optimum amount is then found by equating the demand price and the marginal cost. Such an optimum can be realized in a market if perfectly discriminatory pricing is possible. Otherwise we face conflicting problems. A competitive market fulfilling the marginal condition would be unsustainable because total profits would be negative. An element of monopoly would allow positive profits. but would violate the …,True,2AF4iHIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12751,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831401,13216738375522383451,/scholar?cites=13216738375522383451,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/268957/files/twerp_64.pdf,0,0,0

And yet it occupies a slum dwelling in the town of economics. Mostly it is ignored: the best technology is assumed to be known; the relationship of commodities to consumer preferences is a datum. And one of the information-producing industries. advertising. is treated with a hostility that economists normally reserve for tariffs or monopolists. There are a great many problems in economics for which this neglect of ignorance is no doubt permissible or even desirable. But there are some for which this is not true. and I hope to show that some important aspects of economic organization take on a new meaning when they are considered from the viewpoint of the search for information.

Clearly not. for then those who arbitrage make no (private) return from their (privately) costly activity. Hence the assumptions that all markets. including that for information. are always in equilibrium and always perfectly arbitraged are inconsistent when arbitrage is costly. We propose here a model in which there is an equilibrium degree of disequilibrium: prices reflect the information of informed individuals (arbitrageurs) but only partially. so that those who expend resources to obtain information do receive compensation. How informative the price system is depends on the number of individuals who are informed; but the number of individuals who are informed is itself an endogenous variable in the model.

The presence of such unemployment raises the question of why wages do not fall to clear labor markets. In this paper we show how the information structure of employer-employee relationships. in particular the inability of employers to costlessly observe workers' on-the-job effort. can explain involuntary unemployment'as an equi-librium phenomenon. Indeed. we show that imperfect monitoring necessitates unemployment in equilibrium.The intuition behind our result is simple. Under the conventional competitive paradigm. in which all workers receive the market wage and there is no unemployment. the worst that can happen to a worker who shirks on the job is that he is fired. Since he can immediately be rehired. however. he pays no penalty for his misdemeanor.

Stiglitz explains. while those at the top enjoy the best health care. education. and benefits of wealth. they fail to realize that “their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live.” Stiglitz draws on his deep understanding of economics to show that growing inequality is not inevitable: moneyed interests compound their wealth by stifling true. dynamic capitalism. They have made America the most unequal advanced industrial country while crippling growth. trampling on the rule of law. and undermining democracy. The result: a divided society that cannot tackle its most pressing problems. With characteristic insight.

Amartya Sen (Advisor) and Jean Paul Fitoussi (Coordinator) to create a Commission. subsequently called “The Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress”(CMEPSP). The Commission’s aim has been to identify the limits of GDP as an indicator of economic performance and social progress. including the problems with its measurement; to consider what additional information might be required for the production of more relevant indicators of social progress; to assess the feasibility of alternative measurement tools. and to discuss how to present the statistical information in an appropriate way.2) In effect. statistical indicators are important for designing and assessing policies aiming at advancing the progress of society. as well as for assessing and influencing the functioning of economic markets. Their role has increased significantly over the last two decades. This reflects improvements in the level of education in the population. increases in the complexity of modern economies and the widespread use of information technology.

Flawed government policy and unscrupulous personal and corporate behavior in the United States created the current financial meltdown. which was exported across the globe with devastating consequences.

Stiglitz is “an insanely great economist. in ways you can’t really appreciate unless you’re deep into the field”(Paul Krugman. New York Times). In Freefall. Stiglitz traces the origins of the Great Recession. eschewing easy answers and demolishing the contention that America needs more billion-dollar bailouts and free passes to those “too big to fail.” while also outlining the alternatives and revealing that even now there are choices ahead that can make a difference. The system is broken. and we can only fix it by examining the underlying theories that have led us into this new “bubble capitalism.” Ranging across a host of topics that bear on the crisis.

While capital-requirement regulation can induce prudent behavior. the policy yields Pareto-inefficient outcomes. Capital requirements reduce gambling incentives by putting bank equity at risk. However. they also have a perverse effect of harming banks' franchise values. thus encouraging gambling. Pareto-efficient outcomes can be achieved by adding deposit-rate controls as a regulatory instrument. since they facilitate prudent investment by increasing franchise values. Even if deposit-rate ceilings are not binding on the equilibrium path. they may be useful in deterring gambling off the equilibrium path. (JEL G2. E4.

One partial solution is peer monitoring: having neighbors who are in a good position to monitor the borrower be required to pay a penalty if the borrower goes bankrupt. Peer monitoring is largely responsible for the successful financial performance of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh and of similar group lending programs elsewhere. But peer monitoring has a cost. It transfers risk from the bank. which is in a better position to bear risk. to the cosigner.

Joseph Stiglitz explains how the neoclassical. or Walrasianmodel (the formal articulation of Adam Smith's invisible hand). which has dominated economic thoughtover the past half century. may have wrongly encouraged the belief that market socialism could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model. based on the economics of information. that provides greatertheoretical insight into the workings of a market economy and clearer guidance for the setting ofpolicy in transitional economies. Stiglitz sees the critical failing in the standard neoclassicalmodel underlying market socialism to be its assumptions concerning information. particularly itsfailure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs ofacquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerningcompleteness of markets. competitiveness of markets. and the absence of innovation. Stiglitz arguesthat not only did the existing paradigm fail to provide much guidance on the vital question of thechoice of economic systems. the advice it did provide was often misleading.

This literature has examined the optimal structure for particular types of taxation taken in isolation. such as the optimal rates of excise tax and the optimal income tax schedule.

To illustrate this. we reexamine the age-old question of direct versus indirect taxation and the relationship of these taxes to the goals of efficiency. vertical equity and horizontal equity.

London,I would like to discuss improvements in our understanding of economic development. in particular the emergence of what is sometimes called the ‘post-Washington Consensus’. My remarks elaborate on two themes. The first is that we have come to a better understanding of what makes markets work well. The Washington Consensus held that good economic performance required liberalized trade. macroeconomic stability and getting prices right (see Williamson. 1990). Once the government dealt with these issues -essentially. once the government ‘got out of the way’ — private markets would allocate resources efficiently and generate robust growth. To be sure. all of these are important for markets to work well: it is very difficult for investors to make good decisions when inflation is running at 100 per cent a year and highly variable.

Forests are a particular focus of environmental concern; in many countries the value of non-timber forest benefits-many of them nonmarketed-may be increasing faster than the prices of wood products. One result is that certain forest areas are increasingly valued more for the environmental benefits they provide than for their timber. Hence the “set-side” of timber-rich areas for wildlife conservation. and the increasing attention of public agencies to managing forests for recreational or aesthetic values.Problems arise when policy-makers try to balance the twin objectives of timber production and environmental protection. When values conflict. what is the appropriate trade-off? What opportunities exist for “win-win” solutions. where timber and non-timber benefits are complementary? This report focuses on recent advances in the economic evaluation of forestry activities and. in particular. on how techniques for valuing non-timber forest benefits in monetary terms can assist the development of forest policy and management systems. The report considers the nature of non-market values and the need for valuation. as well as the different techniques used to estimate nonmarket forest benefits. It considers the use of valuation results in cost-benefit analysis and in forest policy and management.

1109324,Economic adjustment policies and the environment: a case study of Brazil.,1997,Carlos Eduardo Frickmann Young,,,,,,Adjustment programmes in developing countries have been the subject of intense debate since the debt crisis in the early 1980s. Consideration of environmental consequences of adjustment policies has added a new dimension to the discussion. This thesis focuses on this issue. examining the links between adjustment policies and the use of natural resources. The first part of the thesis comprises a review of the international literature and the development of a macroeconomic model relating effective demand and the use of natural resources. The second part is dedicated to the analysis of environmental consequences of adjustment policies in Brazil. It starts with a brief review of macroeconomic policy in Brazil since the oil crisis in the mid-1970s. Then three environmental problems are looked at: deforestation in the Amazon. mineral depletion and industrial water and air pollution. In the three cases there are important links between adjustment policies and the worsening of environmental conditions. The thesis suggests two broad conclusions. First. while the final outcome of the adjustment policies may be positive or negative. a failure to integrate macroeconomic models with sustainability concerns has meant that existing 'models' of adjustment have not been able to identify the potential inconsistency between the requirements of macroeconomic reform and resource conservation. From the adjustment country perspective. consumption of natural capital is a simple and effective response to the requirements of short term improvement in the economic performance. The second conclusion is that adjustment programmes should be designed so that …,True,8Twvc_gAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,44,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10102569/,2899186937210857142,/scholar?cites=2899186937210857142,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10102569/1/10017436.pdf,0,0,0

1109345,Worth of watersheds: a producer surplus approach for valuing drought mitigation in Eastern Indonesia,2001,Subhrendu K Pattanayak and Randall A Kramer,,Environment and Development Economics,,123-146,Cambridage University Press,This study combines hydrological modeling with applied micro-econometric techniques to value a complex ecosystem service: drought mitigation provided by tropical forested watersheds to agrarian communities. Spatial variation in current baseflow allows estimation of drought mitigation values as the marginal profit accruing to agricultural households. The paper shows that this uncommon focus on producer (not consumer) surplus measures is appropriate for valuation as long as markets for commodities related to the environmental services are complete.

1109347,Valuing tropical forests: methodology and case study of Madagascar,1995,Randall A. Kramer and Narendra Sharma and Mohan Munasinghe,,,,,The World Bank,The loss of large areas of tropical forests has become a major concern of the world community. Although there are many causes of tropical deforestation and forest degradation. an important cause appears to be an undervaluation of forests by markets and governments. One reason for this undervaluation is that many forest products. such as food and medicinal products. are traded in informal markets for which there are little data. Another reason is that many services provided by forests. such as carbon storage. biodiversity protection. recreation. and watershed protection. are not traded in markets; hence. their economic values are often ignored. Even where environmental values are recognized. they may not be measured or used to promote efficient resource management. This volume examines some causes of tropical deforestation and explores forest valuation issues in context of a protected area project.

On the grounds of published statistical data. data compilations and estimation procedures for material flows not covered by international statistical sources. we compiled a quantitative estimate of annual global extraction of biomass. fossil energy carriers. metal ores. industrial minerals and construction minerals for the period 1900 to 2005. This period covers important phases of global industrialisation and economic growth. The paper analyses the observed changes in the overall size and composition of global material flows in relation to the global economy. population growth and primary energy consumption. We show that during the last century. global materials use increased 8-fold. Humanity currently uses almost 60 billion tons (Gt) of materials per year. In particular. the period after WWII was characterized by rapid physical growth. driven by both population and economic growth. Within this period there was a shift from the dominance of renewable biomass towards mineral materials. Materials use increased at a slower pace than the global economy. but faster than world population. As a consequence. material intensity (ie the amount of materials required per unit of GDP) declined. while materials use per capita doubled from 4.6 to 10.3 t/cap/yr.

Basically. EF calculations convert the use of selected materials in a country into the area needed to sustain this material flow. Therefore. biological productivity essentially determines the outcome of EF calculations. given a certain pattern of socioeconomic metabolism. In most EF calculations published thus far. material and energy flows are converted to area (hectares) using global yields of the respective year.

The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) provides a useful measure of human intervention into the biosphere. The productive capacity of land is appropriated by harvesting or burning biomass and by converting natural ecosystems to managed lands with lower productivity. This work analyzes trends in HANPP from 1910 to 2005 and finds that although human population has grown fourfold and economic output 17-fold. global HANPP has only doubled. Despite this increase in efficiency. HANPP has still risen from 6.9 Gt of carbon per y in 1910 to 14.8 GtC/y in 2005. i.e.. from 13% to 25% of the net primary production of potential vegetation.

Our results show that urban expansion will result in a 1.8–2.4% loss of global croplands by 2030. with substantial regional disparities. About 80% of global cropland loss from urban expansion will take place in Asia and Africa. In both Asia and Africa. much of the cropland that will be lost is more than twice as productive as national averages. Asia will experience the highest absolute loss in cropland. whereas African countries will experience the highest percentage loss of cropland.

From 1950 to about 1980. Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s. largely through agricultural intensification. Since then. the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction. to preserve the existing farm structure. as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence. since the 1980s yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area.

In order to estimate the area of arable land. pastures and forests needed to sustain Austria's socio-economic metabolism I used country-specific yields. contrary to the conventional Ecological Footprint approach that expresses its results in global average hectares. This study explicitly assesses the countries of origin of all imported biomass products. Forest areas were evaluated using two methods. In the ‘production’ approach country-specific felling rates were used. in the ‘sustainable yield approach’ wood increment per country was taken as a proxy for maximum sustainable yield.

We present an assessment of the global use of materials since the beginning of the 20 th century based on the conceptual and methodological principles of material flow accounting (MFA). On the grounds of published statistical data. data compilations and estimation procedures for material flows not covered by international statistical sources. we compiled a quantitative estimate of annual global extraction of biomass. fossil energy carriers. metal ores. industrial minerals and construction minerals for the period 1900 to 2005. This period covers important phases of global industrialisation and economic growth. The paper analyses the observed changes in the overall size and composition of global material flows in relation to the global economy. population growth and primary energy consumption. We show that during the last century. global materials use increased 8-fold. Humanity currently uses almost 60 billion tons (Gt) of materials per year. In particular. the period after WWII was characterized by rapid physical growth. driven by both population and economic growth. Within this period there was a shift from the dominance of renewable biomass towards mineral materials. Materials use increased at a slower pace than the global economy. but faster than world population. As a consequence. material intensity (ie the amount of materials required per unit of GDP) declined. while materials use per capita doubled from 4.6 to 10.3 t/cap/yr.

The circular economy (CE) is a simple. but convincing. strategy. which aims at reducing both input of virgin materials and output of wastes by closing economic and ecological loops of resource flows. This article applies a sociometabolic approach to assess the circularity of global material flows. All societal material flows globally and in the European Union (EU‐27) are traced from extraction to disposal and presented for main material groups for 2005. Our estimate shows that while globally roughly 4 gigatonnes per year (Gt/yr) of waste materials are recycled. this flow is of moderate size compared to 62 Gt/yr of processed materials and outputs of 41 Gt/yr.

Basically. EF calculations convert the use of selected materials in a country into the area needed to sustain this material flow. Therefore. biological productivity essentially determines the outcome of EF calculations. given a certain pattern of socioeconomic metabolism. In most EF calculations published thus far. material and energy flows are converted to area (hectares) using global yields of the respective year. In contrast. we analyze the effect different assumptions on yields have on the results of EF calculations by assuming: (1) constant global yields as of 1995; (2) variable global yields; and (3) variable local yields for domestic extraction and variable global yields for imported biomass.

This framework is an integrated toolbox to account for socio-economic metabolism and colonization of natural processes; above all. land use.

Sustainable Consumption and Production Branch,,,,,UNEP/Earthprint,By 2050. humanity could devour an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals. ores. fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current appetite unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison. the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. With the growth of both population and prosperity. especially in developing countries. the prospect of much higher resource consumption levels is far beyond what is likely sustainable if realised at all given finite world resources. warns this report by UNEP's International Resource Panel. Already the world is running out of cheap and high quality sources of some essential materials such as oil. copper and gold. the supplies of which. in turn. require ever-rising volumes of fossil fuels and freshwater to produce. Improving the rate of resource productivity (doing more with less) faster than the economic growth rate is the notion behind decoupling. the panel says. That goal. however. demands an urgent rethink of the links between resource use and economic prosperity. buttressed by a massive investment in technological. financial and social innovation. to at least freeze per capita consumption in wealthy countries and help developing nations follow a more sustainable path.,True,jEEj9j8AAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C,432,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dGt0Rogq6MIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA12&dq=info:u32QYjP6yRUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jxG1iuSRC1&sig=JoxruDvw7tHHMPQ7wqFNpouoMI0,1570061043719241147,/scholar?cites=1570061043719241147,,https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/14631/decoupling_report_2011.pdf?sequence=11,0,0,0

We compare the level and composition of domestic material consumption (DMC) in the EU-15 member states and identify determinants of the observed differences. Across the European Union member states overall DMC per capita varies by a factor of three ranging between 12 tonnes per capita in Italy and the United Kingdom and 37 tonnes per capita in Finland.

From 1950 to about 1980. Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s. largely through agricultural intensification. Since then. the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction. to preserve the existing farm structure. as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence. since the 1980s yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area.

We present an assessment of the global use of materials since the beginning of the 20 th century based on the conceptual and methodological principles of material flow accounting (MFA). On the grounds of published statistical data. data compilations and estimation procedures for material flows not covered by international statistical sources. we compiled a quantitative estimate of annual global extraction of biomass. fossil energy carriers. metal ores. industrial minerals and construction minerals for the period 1900 to 2005. This period covers important phases of global industrialisation and economic growth. The paper analyses the observed changes in the overall size and composition of global material flows in relation to the global economy. population growth and primary energy consumption. We show that during the last century. global materials use increased 8-fold. Humanity currently uses almost 60 billion tons (Gt) of materials per year. In particular. the period after WWII was characterized by rapid physical growth. driven by both population and economic growth. Within this period there was a shift from the dominance of renewable biomass towards mineral materials. Materials use increased at a slower pace than the global economy. but faster than world population.

This framework is an integrated toolbox to account for socio-economic metabolism and colonization of natural processes; above all. land use. We argue that. even though it is at present impossible to define precision sustainability thresholds with respect to many material and energy flows. the MEFA framework is a valuable tool because it tracks these flows in a consistent manner for regions of any scale over time.,True,w3vepsEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,453,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837703000942,1887070576788563062,/scholar?cites=1887070576788563062,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33112038/070._Haberl__Fischer-Kowalski__Krausmann__Weisz__Winiwarter_2004_Progress_Towards_Sustainability.pdf,0,0,0

Challenges for another Great Transformation,2011,Helmut Haberl and Marina Fischer‐Kowalski and Fridolin Krausmann and Joan Martinez‐Alier and Verena Winiwarter,19,Sustainable development,1,1-14,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Over the last two million years. humans have colonized almost the entire biosphere on Earth. thereby creating socio‐ecological systems in which fundamental patterns and processes are co‐regulated by socio‐economic and ecological processes. We postulate that the evolution of coupled socio‐ecological systems can be characterized by a sequence of relatively stable configurations. here denoted as ‘socio‐metabolic regimes’. and comparatively rapid transitions between such regimes. We discern three fundamentally different socio‐metabolic regimes: hunter‐gatherers. agrarian societies and industrial society. Transitions between these regimes fundamentally change socio‐ecological interactions. whereas changes and variations within each regime are gradual. Two‐thirds of the world population are currently within a rapid transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime.

Sociometabolic regimes represent dynamic equilibria of society–nature interactions and are characterized by typical patterns of material and energy flows (metabolic profiles). From this perspective. industrialization appears as a process of transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime. This article presents a global data set on the socioeconomic metabolism of 175 nations for the year 2000. We group the countries into six clusters differentiated by economic development and population density. reflecting the historical path of (agrarian) development and resource endowment.Our analysis reveals that per capita material and energy use in industrialized clusters is higher than in developing regions by a factor of 5 to 10.

1109424,Decoupling natural resource use and environmental impacts from economic growth,2011,International Resource Panel and United Nations Environment Programme. Sustainable Consumption and Production Branch,,,,,UNEP/Earthprint,By 2050. humanity could devour an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals. ores. fossil fuels and biomass per year three times its current appetite unless the economic growth rate is decoupled from the rate of natural resource consumption. Developed countries citizens consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison. the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. With the growth of both population and prosperity. especially in developing countries. the prospect of much higher resource consumption levels is far beyond what is likely sustainable if realised at all given finite world resources. warns this report by UNEP's International Resource Panel. Already the world is running out of cheap and high quality sources of some essential materials such as oil. copper and gold. the supplies of which. in turn. require ever-rising volumes of fossil fuels and freshwater to produce. Improving the rate of resource productivity (doing more with less) faster than the economic growth rate is the notion behind decoupling. the panel says. That goal. however. demands an urgent rethink of the links between resource use and economic prosperity. buttressed by a massive investment in technological. financial and social innovation. to at least freeze per capita consumption in wealthy countries and help developing nations follow a more sustainable path.,True,w3vepsEAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC,384,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dGt0Rogq6MIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA12&dq=info:u32QYjP6yRUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jxG1iuTJt3&sig=ravPkfazjwG79d1BWqW_WPXowYA,1570061043719241147,/scholar?cites=1570061043719241147,,https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/14631/decoupling_report_2011.pdf?sequence=11,0,0,0

The framework focuses on the mutual dependencies of symbolic/cultural and biophysical processes that are relevant for societal dynamics. thus linking social and economic development to environmental change. We begin with a description of three overall models of society-nature interactions. as proposed by scientists from three different disciplines whose theoretical concepts have substantially inﬂuenced our own approach. We then proceed to our own model. starting with a description of two key processes of society-nature interactions: socioeconomic metabolism and coloniza—tion of natural processes.

Catth and Dunlap (1978) claimed it would not sufﬁce if environmental sociology turned into just another subgroup within the discipline. Instead. it would have to offer a new paradigm. a fundamental concept of society differing from the hegemonic ‘human exceptionalism paradigm’. This new paradigm should view humans as but one of many species interlaced in the ‘web of nature’. in which purposive human action produces many unintended consequences. and it should accept that the world is physically and biologically limited (Catton and Dunlap. 1978: 45; see also Catton and Dunlap. 1980). This paradigm should support the study of interaction between society and the environment. the core task of environmental sociology (Schnaiberg. 1980). Could a view of society as having a material and energetic metabolism and. there—fore. depending upon continuous energetic and material ﬂows from and to its environment. provide a core concept of such a paradigm? And could the study of the social (that is economic. technological and cultural) regulation of society’s metabolism become a genuine sociological task of highly practical value in view of the ecological problems confronting industrial society? Contemporary research on human-induced global environmental change increasingly focuses on two broad and overlapping ﬁelds of study: 1 One of them is industrial metabolism. 2 focusing on the ﬂow of materials and energy in modern industrial society through the chain of extraction. production. consumption and disposal.

The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) provides a useful measure of human intervention into the biosphere. The productive capacity of land is appropriated by harvesting or burning biomass and by converting natural ecosystems to managed lands with lower productivity. This work analyzes trends in HANPP from 1910 to 2005 and finds that although human population has grown fourfold and economic output 17-fold. global HANPP has only doubled. Despite this increase in efficiency. HANPP has still risen from 6.9 Gt of carbon per y in 1910 to 14.8 GtC/y in 2005. i.e.. from 13% to 25% of the net primary production of potential vegetation.

This article presents a comprehensive and systemic account of a nation's carbon budget. comprising socioeconomic as well as ecological carbon flows in a historic time series. The example of Austria 1830–2000. for which excellent databases facilitate a comprehensive assessment. suggests that changes in socioeconomic metabolism during the agrarian−industrial transition are intimately linked with changes in land use and natural carbon flows. In the preindustrial agrarian colonization of Austria (during the thousands of years before 1830). a huge amount of carbon was released due to the expansion of agricultural land. At the dawn of Austria's industrialization (1830–1880). this process was terminated. and carbon inflows and outflows of ecosystems were approximately balanced.

This analysis sees the agroecosystem as a set of energy loops between nature and society. and adopts a farm-operator standpoint at landscape level that involves setting specific system boundaries. This in turn entails a specific form to account for energy outputs as well as inputs. According to this conceptual approach. a clear distinction between Unharvested Phytomass. Land Produce and Final Produce is established. and also a sharp divide is adopted between the energy content of internal flows of Biomass Reused and external Societal Inputs when accounting for the amount of Total Inputs Consumed. Treating the conversion of solar radiation into local biomass as a gift of nature. enthalpy values of energy carriers are accounted for net Final Produce going outside as well as for Biomass Reused or Unharvested Phytomass. given that all these flows are evaluated from inside the agroecosystem. On the other hand. the external energy carriers are accounted for as embodied values by adding up direct and indirect energy carriers required to produce or deliver these Societal Inputs to the agroecosystem. The human Labour performed by the farm operators is treated as a special case of external input. It is accounted for the fraction of their energy intake devoted to perform agricultural work. by only using enthalpy or adding transport embodied values depending on the local or external origin of ingredients of the food basket.

Based on a dynamic stock-flow model. we analyze stocks. inflows. and outflows of all materials and their relation to economic growth. energy use. and CO2 emissions from 1900 to 2010.

We assess the biophysical option space for feeding the world in 2050 in a hypothetical zero-deforestation world. We systematically combine realistic assumptions on future yields. agricultural areas. livestock feed and human diets. For each scenario. we determine whether the supply of crop products meets the demand and whether the grazing intensity stays within plausible limits. We find that many options exist to meet the global food supply in 2050 without deforestation. even at low crop-yield levels. Within the option space. individual scenarios differ greatly in terms of biomass harvest. cropland demand and grazing intensity. depending primarily on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of human diets.

An exploration of diverging techno-political choices,2017,Daniel Hausknost and Ernst Schriefl and Christian Lauk and Gerald Kalt,9,Sustainability,4,669,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,To date the concept of the bioeconomy—an economy based primarily on biogenic instead of fossil resources—has largely been associated with visions of “green growth” and the advancement of biotechnology and has been framed from within an industrial perspective. However. there is no consensus as to what a bioeconomy should effectively look like. and what type of society it would sustain. In this paper. we identify different types of narratives constructed around this concept and carve out the techno-political implications they convey. We map these narratives on a two-dimensional option space. which allows for a rough classification of narratives and their related imaginaries into four paradigmatic quadrants. We draw the narratives from three different sources:(i) policy documents of national and supra-national authorities;(ii) stakeholder interviews; and (iii) scenarios built in a biophysical modelling exercise. Our analysis shows that there is a considerable gap between official policy papers and visions supported by stakeholders. At least in the case of Austria there is also a gap between the official strategies and the option space identified through biophysical modelling. These gaps testify to the highly political nature of the concept of the bioeconomy and the diverging visions of society arising from it.

Provided that agricultural land can be diverted from food and feed production without impairing food security. energy plantations on current agricultural land appear as a beneficial option in terms of renewable. climate‐friendly energy supply. However. instead of supporting energy plantations. land could also be devoted to natural succession. It then acts as a long‐term C sink which also results in C benefits. We here compare the sink strength of natural succession on arable land with the C saving effects of bioenergy from plantations.

We briefly outline the global importance of land use practices as the material and symbolic basis for people’s livelihoods. particularly the provision of food security and well-being. We chart the development over time from research on land cover towards research on drivers of land use practices as part of an integrated land systems science. The increasingly spatially. temporally and functionally distributed nature of these drivers poses multiple challenges to research on land use practices. We propose the notion of ‘competition’ to respond to some of these challenges and to better understand how alternative land use practices are negotiated.

Vienna’s layout and city budget are still influenced by interventions undertaken in the 19th century or even earlier. This introduction to a thematic issue on the Viennese Danube’s environmental history from 1500 to 1890 offers a short overview of important events in Vienna’s and the Danube’s intertwined histories as well as an overview of the study’s conceptual basis and summarizes the main results. ranging from method development and floodplain evolution reconstruction to the histories of settlement. sewage and regulation. Today. Vienna is a city with almost 2 million inhabitants. the capital of a small. landlocked country. Since the great regulation of the 1870s. the Danube river has flowed straight through it.

This article describes the different types of historical sources used for the GIS-based reconstruction. the underlying methodological approach and its limitations regarding reliability and information value. The reconstruction was based on three cornerstones: (1) the available historical sources; (2) knowledge about morphological processes typical for the Austrian Danube prior to regulation; and (3) the interpretation of past hydraulic measures with respect to their effectiveness and their impact on the river’s behaviour. We compiled ten historical states of the riverscape step-by-step going backwards in time to the early 16th century.

Long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER) extends its temporal scope significantly with contributions from environmental history. This chapter discusses the Danube. Europe’s second longest. and the world’s most international river. as a long-term case study. We approach the river as a ‘socio-natural site‘. i.e. the nexus of arrangements (such as harbours. bridges. power plants or dams) with practices (such as river regulation. transportation. food- and energy-procuring). Arrangements and practices are both understood as socio-natural hybrids. We discuss how and why practices and arrangements developed over time and which legacies past practices and arrangements had.

1109563,Soil scientists in ancient Rome,2006,Verena Winiwarter,,"Warkentin, B.(Hg.): Footprints in the Soil. People and Ideas in Soil History, Elsevier: Amsterdam/Oxford",,3-16,,Soil fertility is a common concern of all agricultural societies. Fertility management is a decisive factor in the long-term development of any such culture at a given locale. Soil fertility however. is not a given. It is a function of natural factors such as parent mineral. climate. surface water regime. natural vegetation and morphology on one hand and of the agricultural techniques employed on a given piece of land on the other hand. This functional coupling of natural factors and human intervention has long been known. as ancient agricultural texts from all over the world show. A multitude of interventions into soils is known to have been conducted in ancient times. among them physical. chemical and biological treatments. The first soil scientists were those that were concerned with the land’s fertility. be they farmers or land-owners. From around 500 BCE to about the 5th century CE the Mediterranean and later on western and central Europe were increasingly dominated both politically and culturally by the Romans. Latin became the lingua franca in a large part of this empire. and it certainly makes sense to discuss it as an entity in some respects. although over the long time span of roughly a millennium. and given the considerable diversity of bio-regions. very different techniques to work the soil were developed and crops and tillage methods were highly diversified. An applied soil science. in the sense of a systematic experimental investigation into the properties and processes of the earth’s living skin. and the development of measures to alter its properties. was developed by experts on agriculture. in close connection with the practical use of soil.

1109566,Souls and soils: A survey of worldviews,2006,Verena Winiwarter and Winfried EH Blum,,"Warkentin, B.(Hg.)(2006): Footprints in the Soil. People and Ideas in Soil History, Elsevier: Amsterdam/Oxford",,107-122,,No thinking person can live without forming some views about life and the world (Mbiti. 1996: 174). Humans perceive the world around them and try to make sense of it in terms of their daily existence as well as for their entire life and that of their community. In doing so. they have to define themselves in their relation to non-human nature. Anthropological theories have long pointed out that the impetus to define oneself in context and relation to nature yields systems of bringing order into nature’s chaos (eg Douglas. 1966). The task to structure the world around oneself is immense. Therefore. all worldviews are essentially an attempt to reduce the complexity one has to deal with. For the better part of human history. myth was the central tool to create order and to reduce complexity. in other words to yield a worldview which would enable humans to simplify their life by structuring it and narrating it in a way that could make sense–the latter being a central need for the complex brain humans evolved to have (Schmidt. 1997). Myth is different from history in that its time is out of the reach of humans–myth is before them. in a sense that makes myth unreachable by humans in their (historical) time. Anthropologists have argued that the privileged theme of myth is the conflict between nature and culture and its resolution in mediation (Levi Strauss quoted in Herren. 2002: 2). In structuralist theory. the nature–culture conflict projected onto the screen of human imagination is a reflection of the very instrument that projects it. The human being belongs to nature. yet does not. and it is this dialectic which is mirrored in the nature–culture conflict played out in myth …,True,jemev1AAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,21,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=wPeHdyRdQcMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=info:s8UbjqWh_DUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=YCPNoq6DHW&sig=zjzo7Jaz7TjS_6Ksd32CeGSpbrM,3890161910567126451,/scholar?cites=3890161910567126451,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33112186/082._Winiwarter__Blum_2006_Souls_and_soils._A_survey_of_worldviews.pdf,0,0,0
