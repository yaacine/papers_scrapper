This paper discusses an application of partially linear additive quantile regression models for predicting short term electricity demand during the peak demand hours (ie from 18: 00 to 20: 00) using South African data for January 2009 to June 2012. Additionally the bounded variable mixed integer linear programming technique is used on the forecasts obtained in order to find an optimal number of units to commit (switch on or off.

1085952,Daily peak electricity load forecasting in South Africa using a multivariate non-parametric regression approach,2010,Caston Sigauke and Delson Chikobvu,26,ORiON,2,,,Accurate prediction of daily peak load demand is very important for decision makers in the energy sector. This helps in the determination of consistent and reliable supply schedules during peak periods. Accurate short term load forecasts enable eective load shifting between transmission substations. scheduling of startup times of peak stations. load ow analysis and power system security studies. A multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) modelling approach towards daily peak electricity load forecasting in South Africa is presented in this paper for the period 2000 to 2009. MARS is a non-parametric multivariate regression method which is used in high-dimensional problems with complex model structures. such as nonlin-earities. interactions and missing data. in a straight forward manner and produces results which may easily be explained to management. The models developed in this paper consist of components that represent calendar and meteorological data.

1085953,Forecasting medium-term electricity demand in a South African electric power supply system,2017,Caston Sigauke,28,Journal of Energy in Southern Africa,4,54-67,Energy Research Centre,The paper discusses an application of generalised additive models (GAMs) in predicting medium-term hourly electricity demand using South African data for 2009 to 2013. Variable selection was done using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) via hierarchical interactions. resulting in a model called GAM-Lasso. The GAM-Lasso model was then extended by including tensor product interactions to yield a second model. called GAM-te-Lasso. Comparative analyses of these two models were done with a gradient-boosting model to act as a benchmark model and the third model. The forecasts from the three models were combined using a forecast combination algorithm where the average loss suffered by the models was based on the pinball loss function. The results showed significantly improved accuracy of forecasts. making this study a useful tool for decision-makers and system operators in power utility companies. particularly in maintenance planning including medium-term risk assessment.

1085955,Extreme daily increases in peak electricity demand: Tail-quantile estimation,2013,Caston Sigauke and Andréhette Verster and Delson Chikobvu,53,Energy Policy,,90-96,Elsevier,A Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) is used to model extreme daily increases in peak electricity demand. The model is fitted to years 2000–2011 recorded data for South Africa to make a comparative analysis with the Generalized Pareto-type (GP-type) distribution. Peak electricity demand is influenced by the tails of probability distributions as well as by means or averages. At times there is a need to depart from the average thinking and exploit information provided by the extremes (tails). Empirical results show that both the GP-type and the GPD are a good fit to the data. One of the main advantages of the GP-type is the estimation of only one parameter. Modelling of extreme daily increases in peak electricity demand helps in quantifying the amount of electricity which can be shifted from the grid to off peak periods.

In order to ensure an economic operation of a national grid. including its stability. it is important to have accurate forecasts of solar power. The current paper discusses probabilistic forecasting of twenty-four hours ahead of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) using data from the Tellerie radiometric station in South Africa for the period August 2009 to April 2010. Variables are selected using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) via hierarchical interactions and the parameters of the developed models are estimated using the Barrodale and Roberts’s algorithm. Two forecast combination methods are used in this study. The first is a convex forecast combination algorithm where the average loss suffered by the models is based on the pinball loss function. A second forecast combination method. which is quantile regression averaging (QRA). is also used. The best set of forecasts is selected based on the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP). prediction interval normalised average width (PINAW) and prediction interval normalised average deviation (PINAD). The results demonstrate that QRA gives more robust prediction intervals than the other models. A comparative analysis is done with two machine learning methods—stochastic gradient boosting and support vector regression—which are used as benchmark models. Empirical results show that the QRA model yields the most accurate forecasts compared to the machine learning methods based on the probabilistic error measures.

1085959,Probabilistic Hourly Load Forecasting Using Additive Quantile Regression Models,2018,Caston Sigauke and Murendeni Maurel Nemukula and Daniel Maposa,11,Energies,9,1-21,MDPI,Short-term hourly load forecasting in South Africa using additive quantile regression (AQR) models is discussed in this study. The modelling approach allows for easy interpretability and accounting for residual autocorrelation in the joint modelling of hourly electricity data. A comparative analysis is done using generalised additive models (GAMs). In both modelling frameworks. variable selection is done using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) via hierarchical interactions. Four models considered are GAMs and AQR models with and without interactions. respectively. The AQR model with pairwise interactions was found to be the best fitting model. The forecasts from the four models were then combined using an algorithm based on the pinball loss (convex combination model) and also using quantile regression averaging (QRA). The AQR model with interactions was then compared with the convex combination and QRA models and the QRA model gave the most accurate forecasts. Except for the AQR model with interactions. the other two models (convex combination model and QRA model) gave prediction interval coverage probabilities that were valid for the 90%. 95% and the 99% prediction intervals. The QRA model had the smallest prediction interval normalised average width and prediction interval normalised average deviation.

We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian method to estimate the parameters of the GEV distribution in order to estimate extreme flood heights and their return periods in the lower Limpopo River basin of Mozambique. The return periods of extreme flood heights based on the Bayesian approach show an improvement over the frequentist approach based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. However. both approaches indicate that the 13 m extreme flood height that occurred at Chokwe in the year 2000 due to cyclone Eline and Gloria had a return period in excess of 200 years. which implies that this event has a very small likelihood of being equalled or exceeded at least once in 200 years.,True,OKgPPJAAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,11,https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2014-197/,11434024896192442670,/scholar?cites=11434024896192442670,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/2/5401/2014/nhessd-2-5401-2014.pdf,0,0,0

This calls for load curtailment strategies to either redistribute or reduce electricity demand during peak periods. This thesis attempts to address this problem by providing relevant information through a frequentist and Bayesian modelling framework for daily peak electricity demand using South African data. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part deals with modelling of short term daily peak electricity demand. This is done through the investigation of important drivers of electricity demand using (i) piecewise linear regression models. (ii) a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) modelling approach. (iii) a regression with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (Reg-SARIMA) model (iv) a Reg-SARIMA model with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic errors (Reg-SARIMA-GARCH).

The modeling of extreme daily share returns at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) over the period 2002 to 2011 is discussed in this paper. Stock returns at the JSE market are highly volatile and non-normal. Parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution are estimated by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

The developed model captures a wide variety of electricity demand drivers such as temperature. seasonal. lagged demand and calendar effects. A Bayesian analysis provides a way of taking into account uncertainty in the estimation of the piecewise linear regression parameters. Uncertainty about the true values of the Bayesian parameter estimates is incorporated into the analysis through the use of a non-informative prior distribution. The results obtained are easy to explain to management.

It is during the non-winter period when Eskom. South Africa’s power utility company usually carries out its maintenance of power plants. Extreme peak loads together with high unplanned and planned outages usually cause disruptions to the power plants’ maintenance programmes during this period. A detailed analysis of peak electricity demand is useful to maintain the stability of the power grid. If not properly managed this may result in negative economic impacts as electricity is one of the major drivers of any economy. Initially the data is detrended using a time-varying threshold.

Murendeni Nemukula and Caston Sigauke,10,Jàmbá - Journal of Disaster Risk Studies,1,1-11,AOSIS,Natural hazards (events that may cause actual disasters) are established in the literature as major causes of various massive and destructive problems worldwide. The occurrences of earthquakes. floods and heat waves affect millions of people through several impacts. These include cases of hospitalisation. loss of lives and economic challenges. The focus of this study was on the risk reduction of the disasters that occur because of extremely high temperatures and heat waves. Modelling average maximum daily temperature (AMDT) guards against the disaster risk and may also help countries towards preparing for extreme heat. This study discusses the use of the r largest order statistics approach of extreme value theory towards modelling AMDT over the period of 11 years. that is. 2000-2010. A generalised extreme value distribution for r largest order statistics is fitted to the annual maxima. This is performed in an effort to study the behaviour of the r largest order statistics. The method of maximum likelihood is used in estimating the target parameters and the frequency of occurrences of the hottest days is assessed. The study presents a case study of South Africa in which the data for the non-winter season (September-April of each year) are used. The meteorological data used are the AMDT that are collected by the South African Weather Service and provided by Eskom. The estimation of the shape parameter reveals evidence of a Weibull class as an appropriate distribution for modelling AMDT in South Africa.

Fundamental to the design of rapid state responses is the ability to perform epidemiological model parameter inference for localised trajectory predictions. In this work. we perform Bayesian parameter inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models with time-varying spreading rates for South Africa. The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data.

However. its intermittent. unstable and stochastic nature hampers its representation among other renewable energy sources. This work addresses the forecasting of wind speed. a primary input needed for wind energy generation. using data obtained from the South African Wind Atlas Project. Forecasting is carried out on a two days ahead time horizon. We investigate the predictive performance of artificial neural networks (ANN) trained with Bayesian regularisation. decision trees based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and generalised additive models (GAMs). The results of the comparative analysis suggest that ANN displays superior predictive performance based on root mean square error (RMSE). In contrast. SGB shows outperformance in terms of mean average error (MAE) and the related mean average percentage error (MAPE). A further comparison of two forecast combination methods involving the linear and additive quantile regression averaging show the latter forecast combination method as yielding lower prediction accuracy.

We performed the first in-depth study of user behavior with regard to the location field in Twitter user profiles. We found that 34% of users did not provide real location information. frequently incorporating fake locations or sarcastic comments that can fool traditional geographic information tools. When users did input their location. they almost never specified it at a scale any more detailed than their city. In order to determine whether or not natural user behaviors have a real effect on the'locatability'of users. we performed a simple machine learning experiment to determine whether we can identify a user's location by only looking at what that user tweets.

It emerged as a simple yet powerful way of disseminating information in the Twitter social network. Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter. little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others.

1086033,Semi-automatic image annotation using event and torso identification,2004,Bongwon Suh and Benjamin B Bederson,,"Human Computer Interaction Laboratory, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA",,,,Annotation is important for personal photo collections because acquired metadata plays a crucial role in image management and retrieval. Bulk annotation. where multiple images are annotated at once. is a desired feature for image management tools because it reduces users’ burden when making annotations. This paper describes an approach for automatically creating meaningful image clusters for efficient bulk annotation. These techniques are not perfect and so are integrated into a bulk annotation interface where users can manually correct errors. We present hierarchical event clustering and torso based human identification techniques. Hierarchical event clustering provides multiple levels of “event” groups. For identifying people in images. we introduce a new technique which uses torso information rather than human facial features.,True,-nlhtEkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,42,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.80.1673&rep=rep1&type=pdf,3372201774266021715,/scholar?cites=3372201774266021715,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.80.1673&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A question almost as old as the web itself is. ""Who is using it. and for what?"" One way to answer this question is to use paper surveys. telephone surveys. or diaries which are some of the the same methods used to measure the audiences of other one-way media such as television and radio. However. something interesting happened in early 1994: the implementation of HTML Forms turned the web into a two-way medium which made it possible to contact the audience directly. To test the viability of the web as a survey medium and collect preliminary data on the web population. the first GVU WWW User Survey was conducted in January 1994. Subsequent surveys have been conducted approximately every six months.

In this paper. we present a caching algorithm that flexibly adapt its parameters to the hit rates and access patterns of users requesting documents. The algorithm is derived from an analysis of user accesses in a WWW database.

Results show that the model predicts document access with a high degree of accuracy.

Thus. it is not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the sensitive attribute.Here. we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural network.

In this paper we study a complete graph from a large who-follows-whom network and spot lockstep behavior that large groups of followers connect to the same groups of followees. Our first contribution is that we study strange patterns on the adjacency matrix and in the spectral subspaces with respect to several flavors of lockstep.

This general purpose nature results in systems that do not take advantage of the characteristics of the particular application and data of the user. With SageDB we present a vision towards a new type of a data processing system. one which highly specializes to an application through code synthesis and machine learning. By modeling the data distribution. workload. and hardware. SageDB learns the structure of the data and optimal access methods and query plans.

However. today Internet security is a quickly growing concern. The prevalence of Internet attacks has increased significantly. but still the challenge of detecting such attacks generally falls on the end hosts and service providers. requiring system administrators to detect and block attacks on their own. In particular. as social networks have become central hubs of information and communication. they are increasingly the target of attention and attacks. This creates a challenge of carefully distinguishing malicious connections from normal ones.

Instead of using low-rank factorization we take a drastically different approach. based on the simple insight that an additive model of co-clusterings allows one to approximate matrices efficiently. This allows us to build a concise model that. per bit of model learned. significantly beats all factorization approaches in matrix completion. Even more surprisingly. we find that summing over small co-clusterings is more effective in modeling matrices than classic co-clustering. which uses just one large partitioning of the matrix.

1086101,The information visualizer. an information workspace,1991,Stuart K Card and George G Robertson and Jock D Mackinlay,,,,181-186,,This paper proposes a concept for the user interface of information retrieval systems called an information workspace. The concept goes beyond the usual notion of an information retrieval system to encompass the cost structure of information from secondary storage to immediate use. As an implementation of the concept. the paper describes an experimental system. called the Information Visualizer. and its rationale. The system is based on (1) the use of 3D/Rooms for increasing the capacity of immediate storage avaitable to the user.(2) the Cognitive Co-processor scheduler-based user interface interaction architecture for coupling the user to information agents. and (3) the use of information visualization for interacting with information structure.,True,ccCNF08AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1019,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/108844.108874,12987937771785470939,/scholar?cites=12987937771785470939,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49926939/The_Information_Visualizer_an_Informatio20161027-28550-1hrr755.pdf,0,0,0

To address these issues. we have created prefuse. a software framework for creating dynamic visualizations of both structured and unstructured data. prefuse provides theoretically-motivated abstractions for the design of a wide range of visualization applications. enabling programmers to string together desired components quickly to create and customize working visualizations. To evaluate prefuse we have built both existing and novel visualizations testing the toolkit's flexibility and performance. and have run usability studies and usage surveys finding that programmers find the toolkit usable and effective.,True,ccCNF08AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,996,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1054972.1055031,8250135603751706292,/scholar?cites=8250135603751706292,,http://christianbehrens.com/lab/gentrification/docs/MASTER_GuidoSchulz_2015.pdf,0,0,0

1086104,The cost structure of sensemaking,1993,Daniel M Russell and Mark J Stefik and Peter Pirolli and Stuart K Card,,,,269-276,,Making sense of a body of data is a common activity in any kind of analysis. Sensemaking is the process of searching for a representation and encoding data in that representation to answer task-specific questions. Different operations during sensemaking require different cognitive and external resources. Representations are chosen and changed to reduce the cost of operations in an information processing task. The power of these representational shifts is generally under-appreciated as is the relation between sensemaking and information retrieval.,True,ccCNF08AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,848,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/169059.169209,10771202077647531398,/scholar?cites=10771202077647531398,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.95.3353&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A conversation to share information. a grocery list to aid memory. a pocket calculator to compute square roots—all effectively augment a cognitive ability otherwise severely constrained by what is in its limited knowledge. by limited attention. and by limitations on reasoning. But the most profound leverage on cognitive ability is the ability to invent new representations. procedures. or devices that augment cognition far beyond its unaided biological endowment—and bootstrap these into even more potent inventions. This chapter is about one class of inventions for augmenting cognition. collectively called “information visualization.” Other senses could be employed in this pursuit—audition. for example. or a multi-modal combination of senses—the broader topic is really information perceptualization; however. in this chapter. we restrict ourselves to visualization. Visualization employs the sense with the most information capacity; recent advances in graphically agile computers have opened opportunities to exploit this capacity. and many visualization techniques have now been developed.

However. this potential requires development of viewpoint movement techniques that support rapid and controlled movement through workspaces. Rapid movement through large distances avoids wasted work time; controlled movement near target objects allows the user to examine and interact with objects in the workspace. Current techniques for viewpoint movement typically use high velocities to cover distances rapidly. but high velocities are hard to control near objects. This paper describes a new technique for targeted viewpoint movement that solves this problem. The key idea is to have the user indicate a point of interest (target) on a 3D object and use the distance to this target to move the viewpoint logarithmically. by moving the same relative …,True,ccCNF08AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,487,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/97879.97898,4299181207439514253,/scholar?cites=4299181207439514253,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stuart_Card/publication/220721036_Rapid_Controlled_Movement_through_a_Virtual_3D_Workspace/links/09e41508383ba01f22000000/Rapid-Controlled-Movement-through-a-Virtual-3D-Workspace.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,This paper discusses the prospects of psychology playing a significant role in the progress of human-computer interaction. In any field. hard science (science that is mathematical or otherwise technical) has a tendency to drive out softer sciences. even if the softer sciences have important contributions to make. It is possible that. as computer science and artificial intelligence contributions to human-computer interaction mature. this could happen to psychology. It is suggested that this trend might be prevented by hardening the applicable psychological science. This approach. however. has been criticized on the grounds that the resulting body of knowledge would be too low level. too limited in scope. too late to affect computer technology. and too difficult to apply. The prospects for overcoming each of these obstacles are analyzed here.,True,ccCNF08AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,443,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327051hci0103_1,3147789522576012135,/scholar?cites=3147789522576012135,,,0,0,0

Good learners differed from poor learners primarily in their techniques for and success at encoding spatial information. their ability to accurately evaluate their learning progress. and their ability to focus attention on unlearned information.

In this study we examined how the influence of “elite” vs.“common” users changed over time in Wikipedia.

Understanding the motivating factors that lead to high quality work could have significant benefits. However. researchers have so far found that motivating factors such as increased monetary reward generally increase workers’ willingness to accept a task or the speed at which a task is completed. but do not improve the quality of the work. We hypothesize that factors that increase the intrinsic motivation of a task–such as framing a task as helping others–may succeed in improving output quality where extrinsic motivators such as increased pay do not. In this paper we present an experiment testing this hypothesis along with a novel experimental design that enables controlled experimentation with intrinsic and extrinsic motivators in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. a popular crowdsourcing task market. Results suggest that intrinsic motivation can indeed improve the quality of workers’ output. confirming our hypothesis. Furthermore. we find a synergistic interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivators that runs contrary to previous literature suggesting “crowding out” effects.

Recent analysis has identified weaknesses in this approach even as it is typically employed in relatively simple task contexts. We suggest that in realistically complex circumstances. people share activities and not merely concepts.

One consequence is that work groups are increasingly becoming intergenerational. Because group work relies on many collaborative tools (e.g. email. shared calendars). it is essential to understand the special requirements that intergenerational groups have for groupware. Can we design collaborative tools that leverage the differing abilities and contributions of older and younger workers in groups? We focus on how best to support intergenerational groups. offering an analytical framework that combines ideas from the theory of small groups and activity theory. We consider design implications for computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and outline design principles for groupware that supports intergenerational groups.

Cham,Visual relationships capture a wide variety of interactions between pairs of objects in images (e.g. “man riding bicycle” and “man pushing bicycle”). Consequently. the set of possible relationships is extremely large and it is difficult to obtain sufficient training examples for all possible relationships. Because of this limitation. previous work on visual relationship detection has concentrated on predicting only a handful of relationships. Though most relationships are infrequent. their objects (e.g. “man” and “bicycle”) and predicates (e.g. “riding” and “pushing”) independently occur more frequently. We propose a model that uses this insight to train visual models for objects and predicates individually and later combines them together to predict multiple relationships per image.

However. AI models still fail to match humans in high-level vision tasks due to the lack of capacities for deeper reasoning. Recently the new task of visual question answering (QA) has been proposed to evaluate a model's capacity for deep image understanding. Previous works have established a loose. global association between QA sentences and images. However. many questions and answers. in practice. relate to local regions in the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image regions by object-level grounding. It enables a new type of QA with visual answers. in addition to textual answers used in previous work.

Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content. making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However. understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design. since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online.

1086187,Handbook of collective intelligence,2015,Thomas W Malone and Michael S Bernstein,,,,,MIT Press,Experts describe the latest research in a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field. the study of groups of individuals acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent. Intelligence does not arise only in individual brains; it also arises in groups of individuals. This is collective intelligence: groups of individuals acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent. In recent years. a new kind of collective intelligence has emerged: interconnected groups of people and computers. collectively doing intelligent things. Today these groups are engaged in tasks that range from writing software to predicting the results of presidential elections. This volume reports on the latest research in the study of collective intelligence. laying out a shared set of research challenges from a variety of disciplinary and methodological perspectives. Taken together. these essays—by leading researchers from such fields as computer science. biology. economics. and psychology—lay the foundation for a new multidisciplinary field. Each essay describes the work on collective intelligence in a particular discipline—for example. economics and the study of markets; biology and research on emergent behavior in ant colonies; human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence; and cognitive psychology and the “wisdom of crowds” effect. Other areas in social science covered include social psychology. organizational theory. law. and communications. Contributors Eytan Adar. Ishani Aggarwal. Yochai Benkler. Michael S. Bernstein.

In this paper we present a strategy for detecting author commitment to the truth/falsity of complement clauses based on their syntactic type and on the meaning of their embedding predicate. We show that the implications of a predicate at an arbitrary depth of embedding about its complement clause depend on a globally determined notion of relative polarity. We. moreover. observe that different classes of complement-taking verbs have a different effect on the polarity of their complement clauses and that this effect depends recursively on their own embedding.

1086204,Entailments in finite-state temporality,2005,Tim Fernando and Rowan Nairn,,Proc. 6th International Workshop on Computational Semantics,,128-138,Tilburg University,The “surge in use of finite-state methods”([10]) in computational linguistics has largely. if not completely. left semantics untouched. The present paper is directed towards correcting this situation. Techniques explained in [1] are applied to a fragment of temporal semantics through an approach we call finite-state temporality. This proceeds from the intuition of an event as “a series of snapshots”([15]; see also [12]). equating snapshots with symbols that collectively form our alphabet. A sequence of snapshots then becomes a string over that alphabet. evoking comic/film strips. Jackendoff has. among others. objected to conceptualizing events in terms of snapshots ([8]). To counter these objections. we step up from events-as-strings to event-typesas-regular languages ([5. 6]). recognizing the need for variable granularity. Beyond the introduction of disjunction implicit in the step from a single string up to a set of strings. we obtain a useful logic from the regular operations and a careful choice of the snapshots (constituting our alphabet). To a first approximation. a snapshot is simply a set of formulas. or fluents. described to hold at some point in time. These sets are not to be construed as exhaustive: the absence of a fluent ϕ from a set α need not mean that ϕ does not hold at the time described by α—only that α does not describe ϕ as holding at that time. Hence. a snapshot α is at least as informative as β if β is a subset of α. β⊆ α. We define a subsumption relation⊵ in section 2 that extends this notion of underspecification to strings of the same length and more generally. to languages.

1086210,Mail2tag: Augmenting email for sharing with implicit tag-based categorization,2011,Les Nelson and Rowan Nairn and Ed H Chi and Gregorio Convertino,,,,23-30,IEEE,New technology can disrupt existing social processes. especially those formed within the workplace email habitat. Recent abundance of sharing tool choices and disruption of practices makes for a lack of agreement and coherence in the use of information sharing tools. At work. email remains the primary way for sharing information. despite years of knowledge management research. We examine the design of a system for lightweight organizational sharing called Mail2Tag. which augments email by utilizing existing email sharing practices to help gather content. implicitly organize that content. and evolve both the shared content and the groups of people interested in that content. The vision is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. without increasing overall information noise.,True,SLg5E9cAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5928661/,5731830563750782425,/scholar?cites=5731830563750782425,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.294.7378&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

From field interviews studying news sharing in organizations we find that news proliferates through and within organizational boundaries along social networks. with people filtering for each other and according to their roles in the organization. We find that people actively target information at the perceived right people. but this is a hurried and incomplete assessment that arises frequently. We report here on a novel email-based news sharing system called Mail2Tag that uses tagging keywords as email addresses. We present the unique features supporting lightweight collaboration that extends the observed practices of news sharing in the enterprise.

London,The Mail2Tag system leverages existing practices around enterprise email to move relevant information out from individual inboxes. With Mail2Tag users share information by emailing content to a special email address. such as CC to sometag@share.company.com. where ‘sometag’ can be any keyword. The system then adaptively redistributes the information based on profiles inferred from prior user activity in the system. In this way no changes to the email client are required for users to participate in the system and information is routed based on individual need. while the amount of information noise is reduced. We study the Mail2Tag system and its 20-month deployment in an organization as a lens to understand how to measure the adoption for this type of tool for sharing.

1086215,Implementation of a finite-state semantic framework,2004,Rowan Nairn,,,,,,This paper documents the implementation of a framework for temporal semantics 1. The framework is based on the idea of describing courses of events with sequences of snapshots. where snapshots are propositional descriptions of the world at individual timepoints. These sequences (or strings) define the underspecified structure of an event over an ordered set of times. Sets of strings (or languages) define an event-type. The framework constrains such languages to be regular to explore the benefits of processing with the well-studied computational formalism of finite-state automata (FSA). The implementation uses van Noord’s [5] finite-state automata utilities. FSA6. written in Prolog.

Putting aside any attempt to assess whether the rumors are true or false. it is valuable to identify trending rumors as early as possible.

In many settings. finding out the sensitive input attribute can be prohibitively expensive even during model training. and sometimes impossible during model serving. For example. in recommender systems. if we want to predict if a user will click on a given recommendation. we often do not know many attributes of the user. eg. race or age. and many attributes of the content are hard to determine. eg. the language or topic. Thus. it is not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the sensitive attribute.Here. we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural network. In particular. we study how the choice of data for the adversarial training effects the resulting fairness properties.

1086235,Understanding and improving knowledge distillation,2020,Jiaxi Tang and Rakesh Shivanna and Zhe Zhao and Dong Lin and Anima Singh and Ed H Chi and Sagar Jain,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.03532,,,,Knowledge distillation is a model-agnostic technique to improve model quality while having a fixed capacity budget. It is a commonly used technique for model compression. where a higher capacity teacher model with better quality is used to train a more compact student model with better inference efficiency. Through distillation. one hopes to benefit from student's compactness. without sacrificing too much on model quality. Despite the large success of knowledge distillation. better understanding of how it benefits student model's training dynamics remains under-explored. In this paper. we dissect the effects of knowledge distillation into three main factors:(1) benefits inherited from label smoothing.(2) example re-weighting based on teacher's confidence on ground-truth. and (3) prior knowledge of optimal output (logit) layer geometry. Using extensive systematic analyses and empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets. we confirm that the aforementioned three factors play a major role in knowledge distillation. Furthermore. based on our findings. we propose a simple. yet effective technique to improve knowledge distillation empirically.,True,TRZB0J4AAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC,8,https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03532,13224920041032685298,/scholar?cites=13224920041032685298,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03532,0,0,0

Consequently. this approach leads to a higher overall parameter cost. along with higher technical maintenance for serving multiple models. Learning a single multi-task model that is able to do well for all the tasks has been a challenging and yet attractive proposition. In this paper. we propose\textsc {HyperGrid}. a new approach for highly effective multi-task learning. The proposed approach is based on a decomposable hypernetwork that learns grid-wise projections that help to specialize regions in weight matrices for different tasks. In order to construct the proposed hypernetwork. our method learns the interactions and composition between a global (task-agnostic) state and a local task-specific state. We apply our proposed\textsc {HyperGrid} on the current state-of-the-art T5 model. demonstrating strong performance across the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks when using only a single multi-task model.

Past work in academia has not been adopted by industry in part due to concerns about liability over false positives. However. blacklist-based methods heavily used in industry are slow in responding to new phish attacks. and tend to be easily overwhelmed by phishing techniques such as fast-flux and the proliferation of toolkits. In this paper. we present the design and evaluation of two blacklist-enhanced content-based algorithms. The key insight behind our algorithms is to leverage existing human-verified whitelists and blacklists. and relax them via probabilistic methods to attain high true positive rates while maintaining extremely low false positive rates. Comprehensive experiments over a diverse spectrum of data sources show that our approach currently achieves a false positive rate of 0.0434 with a true positive rate of 87.42. Our algorithms are able to adapt quickly to new phishing attacks by incremental retraining. and present a new framework that will generalize to evolving attacks.Descriptors:,True,YgtBXP0AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,8,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA530899,1934583713561194184,/scholar?cites=1934583713561194184,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA530899.pdf,0,0,0

1086292,Automatic word sense discrimination,1998,Hinrich Schütze,24,Computational linguistics,1,97-123,,This paper presents context-group discrimination. a disambiguation algorithm based on clustering. Senses are interpreted as groups (or clusters) of similar contexts of the ambiguous word. Words. contexts. and senses are represented in Word Space. a high-dimensional. real-valued space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity. Similarity in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to the same sense cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application: senses are induced from a corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge sources.

The author proposes that the semantics of words and contexts in a text be represented as vectors. The dimensions of the space are words and the initial vectors are determined by the words occurring close to the entity to be represented. which implies that the space has several thousand dimensions (words). This makes the vector representations (which are dense) too cumbersome to use directly. Therefore. dimensionality reduction by means of a singular value decomposition is employed.

A simple way to speed up clustering is to speed up the distance calculations at the heart of clustering routines. We study two techniques for improving the cost ofdistance calculations. LSI and trrmcation. and determine both how much these techniques speed up clustering and how much they affect the quality of the resulting clusters. We find that the speed increase is significant while—surprisingly—the quality of clustering is not adversely affected.

It is a classic problem. and the natural and empirically most popular approach to its solution has been the EM algorithm. As in other settings. this is prone to bad local minima; however. each iteration is very fast (alternating between guessing labels. and solving with those labels). In this paper we provide a new initialization procedure for EM. based on finding the leading two eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. We then show that with this. a re-sampled version of the EM algorithm provably converges to the correct vectors. under natural assumptions on the sampling distribution. and with nearly optimal (unimprovable) sample complexity.

The popular EM algorithm and its variants. is a much used algorithmic tool; yet our rigorous understanding of its performance is highly incomplete. Recently. work in Balakrishnan et al.(2014) has demonstrated that for an important class of problems. EM exhibits linear local convergence. In the high-dimensional setting. however. the M-step may not be well defined. We address precisely this setting through a unified treatment using regularization. While regularization for high-dimensional problems is by now well understood. the iterative EM algorithm requires a careful balancing of making progress towards the solution while identifying the right structure (eg. sparsity or low-rank). In particular. regularizing the M-step using the state-of-the-art high-dimensional prescriptions (eg. Wainwright (2014)) is not guaranteed to provide this balance.

Here. we define clustering error in a discriminative fashion. demonstrating fundamental connections between classification (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised). For both classification and clustering. our lower bounds show that without enough samples. the best any classifier or clustering rule can do is close to random guessing. For classification. as part of our upper bound analysis. we show that Fisher's linear discriminant achieves a fast minimax rate  with enough samples .

To model large-vocab sparse categorical features. typical recommender models learn a joint embedding space for both queries and items. With millions to billions of items to choose from. the quality of learned embedding representations is crucial to provide high quality recommendations to users with various interests.

1086338,A convex formulation for mixed regression: Near optimal rates in the face of noise,2013,Yudong Chen and Xinyang Yi and Constantine Caramanis,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.7006,,,,Mixture models represent the superposition of statistical processes. and are natural in machine learning and statistics. Despite the prevalence and importance of mixture models. little is known in the realm of efficient algorithms with strong statistical guarantees. The Expectation-Minimization (EM) approach is perhaps the most popular. yet save for the Gaussian mixture clustering problem [27]. few guarantees exist. For mixed regression in the noiseless setting. in particular. only recently has an EM-like algorithm been able to provide near-tight guarantees. In the noisy setting. tensor approaches have recently succeeded in providing a tractable and statistically consistent approach. but require a sample complexity much higher than the information-theoretic limits.We consider the mixed regression problem with two components. under adversarial and stochastic noise. Using a lifting to a higher dimensional space. we give a convex optimization formulation that provably recovers the true solution. with near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds. In the noiseless setting. our results remove the extra log factor from recent (and best-to-date) work. thus achieving exact recovery with order-wise as many samples as the degrees of freedom.

It significantly affects model performance. and especially on tail items. To improve tail-item recommendation. we conduct research to transfer knowledge from head items to tail items. leveraging the rich user feedback in head items and the semantic connections between head and tail items. Specifically. we propose a novel dual transfer learning framework that collaboratively learns the knowledge transfer from both model-level and item-level. The model-level knowledge transfer builds a generic meta-mapping of model parameters from few-shot to many-shot model. It captures the implicit data augmentation on the model level to improve the representation learning of tail items. The item-level transfer connects head and tail items through item-level features. to ensure a smooth transfer of meta-mapping from head items to tail items. The two types of transfers are incorporated to ensure the learned knowledge from head items can be well applied for tail item representation learning in the long-tail distribution settings. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. results show that our proposed dual transfer learning framework significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for tail item recommendation in hit ratio and NDCG. It is also very encouraging that our framework further improves head items and overall performance on top of the gains on tail items.,True,r0c4bz4AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15982,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15982,0,0,0

Typically. the model creates a huge embedding table that each row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every feature value. In practice. to handle new (ie. out-of-vocab) feature values and reduce the storage cost. the hashing trick is often adopted. that randomly maps feature values to a smaller number of hashing buckets. Essentially. thess embedding methods can be viewed as 1-layer wide neural networks with one-hot encodings. In this paper. we propose an alternative embedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE). with non-one-hot encodings and a deep neural network (embedding network) to compute embeddings on the fly without having to store them. DHE first encodes the feature value to a dense vector with multiple hashing functions and then applies a DNN to generate the embedding. DHE is collision-free as the dense hashing encodings are unique identifiers for both in-vocab and out-of-vocab feature values. The encoding module is deterministic. non-learnable. and free of storage. while the embedding network is updated during the training time to memorize embedding information. Empirical results show that DHE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing-based embedding learning algorithms. and achieves comparable AUC against the standard one-hot encoding. with significantly smaller model sizes.

With such Profiles. users do not just depict themselves. but help shape the representation of others on the system. In this paper. we will discuss how the performance of social identity and relationships shifted the Profile from being a static representation of self to a communicative body in conversation with the other represented bodies. We draw on data gathered through ethnography and reaffirmed through data collection and visualization to analyze the communicative aspects of Profiles within the Friendster service.

1086352,Protovis: A graphical toolkit for visualization,2009,Michael Bostock and Jeffrey Heer,15,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,6,1121-1128,IEEE,Despite myriad tools for visualizing data. there remains a gap between the notational efficiency of high-level visualization systems and the expressiveness and accessibility of low-level graphical systems. Powerful visualization systems may be inflexible or impose abstractions foreign to visual thinking. while graphical systems such as rendering APIs and vector-based drawing programs are tedious for complex work. We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response. we contribute Protovis. an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis. designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data.

These systems are achieving widespread success in E-commerce nowadays. especially with the advent of the Internet. The tremendous growth of customers and products poses three key challenges for recommender systems in the E-commerce domain. These are producing high quality recommendations. performing many recommendations per second for millions of customers and products. and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. One successful recommender system technology is collaborative filtering. which works by matching customer preferences to other customers in making recommendations. Collaborative filtering has been shown to produce high quality recommendations. but the performance degrades with the number of customers and products. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations. even for very largescale problems. This paper presents two different experiments where we have explored one technology called Singular Value Decomposition SVD to reduce the dimensionality of recommender system databases.

Information filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and the development of a personal user interest profile. Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially combined.This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a community of users to produce better recommendations than either agents or users can produce alone. It also shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a set of agents produces better results than either individual agents or other combination mechanisms. One key implication of these results is that users can avoid having to select among agents; they can use them all and let the CF framework select the best ones for them.,True,PH4mytYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1273,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1999/AAAI99-063.pdf,13225749640287826755,/scholar?cites=13225749640287826755,,https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1999/AAAI99-063.pdf,0,0,0
1086380,Collaborative filtering recommender systems,2011,Michael D Ekstrand and John T Riedl and Joseph A Konstan,,,,,Now Publishers Inc,Recommender systems are an important part of the information and e-commerce ecosystem. They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks. information needs. and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders. and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis. system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems provides a broad overview of the current state of collaborative filtering research. It discusses the core algorithms for collaborative filtering and traditional means of measuring their performance against user rating data sets. It then moves on to discuss building reliable. accurate data sets; understanding recommender systems in the broader context of user information needs and task support; and the interaction between users and recommender systems.

Instead of performing content indexing or content analysis. collaborative filtering systems rely entirely on interest ratings from members of a participating community. Since predictions are based on human ratings. collaborative filtering systems have the potential to provide filtering based on complex attributes. such as quality. taste. or aesthetics. Many implementations of collaborative filtering apply some variation of the neighborhood-based prediction algorithm.

Recently. they have attained record accuracy on standard benchmark tasks of sentiment analysis across different text domains. SDAs learn robust data representations by reconstruction. recovering original features from data that are artificially corrupted with noise. In this paper. we propose marginalized SDA (mSDA) that addresses two crucial limitations of SDAs: high computational cost and lack of scalability to high-dimensional features. In contrast to SDAs. our approach of mSDA marginalizes noise and thus does not require stochastic gradient descent or other optimization algorithms to learn parameters? in fact. they are computed in closed-form. Consequently. mSDA. which can be implemented in only 20 lines of MATLAB^{TM}. significantly speeds up SDAs by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore. the representations learnt by mSDA are as effective as the traditional SDAs. attaining almost identical accuracies in benchmark tasks.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,737,https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4683,6344703355217664124,/scholar?cites=6344703355217664124,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.4683,0,0,0
1086395,Co-Training for Domain Adaptation.,2011,Minmin Chen and Kilian Q Weinberger and John Blitzer,24,Nips,,2456-2464,,Domain adaptation algorithms seek to generalize a model trained in a source domain to a new target domain. In many practical cases. the source and target distributions can differ substantially. and in some cases crucial target features may not have support in the source domain. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that bridges the gap between source and target domains by slowly adding to the training set both the target features and instances in which the current algorithm is the most confident. Our algorithm is a variant of co-training [7]. and we name it CODA (Co-training for domain adaptation). Unlike the original co-training work. we do not assume a particular feature split. Instead. for each iteration of cotraining. we formulate a single optimization problem which simultaneously learns a target predictor. a split of the feature space into views. and a subset of source and target features to include in the predictor. CODA significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art on the 12-domain benchmark data set of Blitzer et al.[4]. Indeed. over a wide range (65 of 84 comparisons) of target supervision CODA achieves the best performance.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,372,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.230.8008&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6437352312869659389,/scholar?cites=6437352312869659389,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.230.8008&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Recent advances have significantly improved the state-of-the-art in retrieval accuracy with algorithms based on nearest neighbor classification in carefully learned metric spaces. But this comes at a price of increased computational complexity during training and testing. We propose FastTag. a novel algorithm that achieves comparable results with two simple linear mappings that are co-regularized in a joint convex loss function. The loss function can be efficiently optimized in closed form updates. which allows us to incorporate a large number of image descriptors cheaply. On several standard real-world benchmark data sets. we demonstrate that FastTag matches the current state-of-the-art in tagging quality. yet reduces the training and testing times by several orders of magnitude and has lower asymptotic complexity.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,223,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/chen13j.html,13083149037450044125,/scholar?cites=13083149037450044125,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/chen13j.pdf,0,0,0
1086397,Learning with marginalized corrupted features,2013,Laurens Maaten and Minmin Chen and Stephen Tyree and Kilian Weinberger,,,,410-418,PMLR,The goal of machine learning is to develop predictors that generalize well to test data. Ideally. this is achieved by training on very large (infinite) training data sets that capture all variations in the data distribution. In the case of finite training data. an effective solution is to extend the training set with artificially created examples–which. however. is also computationally costly. We propose to corrupt training examples with noise from known distributions within the exponential family and present a novel learning algorithm. called marginalized corrupted features (MCF). that trains robust predictors by minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corrupting distribution–essentially learning with infinitely many (corrupted) training examples. We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be trained efficiently. may generalize substantially better to test data. and are more robust to feature deletion at test time.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,169,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/vandermaaten13.html,6142503578748153832,/scholar?cites=6142503578748153832,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/vandermaaten13.pdf,0,0,0

During training. DAEs make many passes over the training dataset and reconstruct it from partial corruption generated from a pre-specified corrupting distribution. This process learns robust representation. though at the expense of requiring many training epochs. in which the data is explicitly corrupted. In this paper we present the marginalized Denoising Auto-encoder (mDAE). which (approximately) marginalizes out the corruption during training. Effectively. the mDAE takes into account infinitely many corrupted copies of the training data in every epoch. and therefore is able to match or outperform the DAE with much fewer training epochs. We analyze our proposed algorithm and show that it can be understood as a classic auto-encoder with a special form of regularization.

Here. the CPU cost during test-time must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper. we address the challenge of balancing test-time cost and the classifier accuracy in a principled fashion. The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by the computation required for feature extraction-which can vary drastically across features. We incorporate this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers. through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. By only computing features for inputs that benefit from them the most. our cost-sensitive tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current state-of-the-art at a small fraction of the computational cost.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,120,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/xu13.html,16877901752129101475,/scholar?cites=16877901752129101475,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/xu13.pdf,0,0,0

Document Vector through Corruption (Doc2VecC). Doc2VecC represents each document as a simple average of word embeddings. It ensures a representation generated as such captures the semantic meanings of the document during learning. A corruption model is included. which introduces a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing the embeddings of common and non-discriminative ones to be close to zero. Doc2VecC produces significantly better word embeddings than Word2Vec. We compare Doc2VecC with several state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms. The simple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the state-of-the-art in generating high-quality document representations for sentiment analysis. document classification as well as semantic relatedness tasks. The simplicity of the model enables training on billions of words per hour on a single machine.

Here. the operational cost during test-time has to be taken into account when an algorithm is designed. This operational cost is affected by the average running time and the computation time required for feature extraction. When a diverse set of features is used. the latter can vary drastically. In this paper we propose an algorithm that constructs a cascade of classifiers that explicitly trades-off operational cost and classifier accuracy while accounting for on-demand feature extraction costs. Different from previous work. our algorithm re-optimizes trained classifiers and allows expensive features to be scheduled at any stage within the cascade to minimize overall cost.

In these applications. the test-time CPU cost must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper. we examine two main components of the test-time CPU cost. classifier evaluation cost and feature extraction cost. and show how to balance these costs with the classifier accuracy. Since the computation required for feature extraction dominates the test-time cost of a classifier in these settings. we develop two algorithms to efficiently balance the performance with the test-time cost. Our first contribution describes how to construct and optimize a tree of classifiers. through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific sub-partition of the input space. Our second contribution is a natural reduction of the tree of classifiers into a cascade. The cascade is particularly useful for class-imbalanced data sets as the majority of instances can be early-exited out of the cascade when the algorithm is sufficiently confident in its prediction.

Learning long-term dependencies using these models remains difficult though. due to exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper. we draw connections between recurrent networks and ordinary differential equations. A special form of recurrent networks called the AntisymmetricRNN is proposed under this theoretical framework. which is able to capture long-term dependencies thanks to the stability property of its underlying differential equation. Existing approaches to improving RNN trainability often incur significant computation overhead. In comparison. AntisymmetricRNN achieves the same goal by design.

While many successful recurrent architectures employ a notion of gating. the exact mechanism that enables such remarkable performance is not well understood. We develop a theory for signal propagation in recurrent networks after random initialization using a combination of mean field theory and random matrix theory. To simplify our discussion. we introduce a new RNN cell with a simple gating mechanism that we call the minimalRNN and compare it with vanilla RNNs. Our theory allows us to define a maximum timescale over which RNNs can remember an input. We show that this theory predicts trainability for both recurrent architectures. We show that gated recurrent networks feature a much broader. more robust. trainable region than vanilla RNNs. which corroborates recent experimental findings. Finally. we develop a closed-form critical initialization scheme that achieves dynamical isometry in both vanilla RNNs and minimalRNNs. We show that this results in significantly improved training dynamics.

Although simple and intuitive. sBoW style representations suffer from their inherent over-sparsity and fail to capture word-level synonymy and polysemy. Especially when labeled data is limited (eg in document classification). or the text documents are short (eg emails or abstracts). many features are rarely observed within the training corpus. This leads to overfitting and reduced generalization accuracy. In this paper we propose Dense Cohort of Terms (dCoT). an unsupervised algorithm to learn improved sBoW document features. dCoT explicitly models absent words by removing and reconstructing random sub-sets of words in the unlabeled corpus. With this approach. dCoT learns to reconstruct frequent words from co-occurring infrequent words and maps the high dimensional sparse sBoW vectors into a low-dimensional dense representation. We show that the feature removal can be marginalized out and that the reconstruction can be solved for in closed-form.

Especially when labeled data is limited (eg in document classification). or the text documents are short (eg emails or abstracts). many features are rarely observed within the training corpus. This leads to overfitting and reduced generalization accuracy. In this paper we propose Dense Cohort of Terms (dCoT). an unsupervised algorithm to learn improved sBoW document features. dCoT explicitly models absent words by removing and reconstructing random sub-sets of words in the unlabeled corpus. With this approach. dCoT learns to reconstruct frequent words from co-occurring infrequent words and maps the high dimensional sparse sBoW vectors into a low-dimensional dense representation. We show that the feature removal can be marginalized out and that the reconstruction can be solved for in closed-form. We demonstrate empirically. on several benchmark datasets. that dCoT features significantly improve the classification accuracy across several document classification tasks.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:SsmmYIE5d0AC,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kilian_Weinberger/publication/235356723_An_alternative_text_representation_to_TF-IDF_and_Bag-of-Words/links/0deec526536f3cec35000000.pdf,435278927807631605,/scholar?cites=435278927807631605,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kilian_Weinberger/publication/235356723_An_alternative_text_representation_to_TF-IDF_and_Bag-of-Words/links/0deec526536f3cec35000000.pdf,0,0,0

When rewards are fully observed. we show that the expected reward objective exhibits suboptimal plateaus and exponentially many local optima in the worst case. To overcome the poor landscape. we develop a convex surrogate that is calibrated with respect to entropy regularized expected reward. We then consider the partially observed case. where rewards are recorded for only a subset of actions. Here we generalize the surrogate to partially observed data. and uncover novel objectives for batch contextual bandit training. We find that surrogate objectives remain provably sound in this setting and empirically demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.,True,kR7DersAAAAJ:12oLulcdP1kC,10,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJlZANSeLB,17077983814867308392,/scholar?cites=17077983814867308392,,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJlZANSeLB,0,0,0

In this extended abstract. we show that learned filters can handle multidimensional data particularly well. giving space savings of up to 72% in our experiments.

A standard approach is to map each unique feature value to an embedding vector. The size of the produced embedding table grows linearly with the size of the vocabulary. Therefore. a large vocabulary inevitably leads to a gigantic embedding table. creating two severe problems:(i) making model serving intractable in resource-constrained environments;(ii) causing overfitting problems.

However. the sparse and large feature space requires exhaustive search to identify effective crosses. Deep & Cross Network (DCN) was proposed to automatically and efficiently learn bounded-degree predictive feature interactions. Unfortunately. in models that serve web-scale traffic with billions of training examples. DCN showed limited expressiveness in its cross network at learning more predictive feature interactions. Despite significant research progress made. many deep learning models in production still rely on traditional feed-forward neural networks to learn feature crosses inefficiently.In light of the pros/cons of DCN and existing feature interaction learning approaches. we propose an improved framework DCN-M to make DCN more practical in large-scale industrial settings. In a comprehensive experimental study with extensive hyper-parameter search and model tuning. we observed that DCN-M approaches outperform all the state-of-the-art algorithms on popular benchmark datasets. The improved DCN-M is more expressive yet remains cost efficient at feature interaction learning. especially when coupled with a mixture of low-rank architecture. DCN-M is simple. can be easily adopted as building blocks. and has delivered significant offline accuracy and online business metrics gains across many web-scale learning to rank systems.,True,qYYPst0AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13535,13719054876746774033,/scholar?cites=13719054876746774033,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13535,0,0,0

To model large-vocab sparse categorical features. typical recommender models learn a joint embedding space for both queries and items. With millions to billions of items to choose from. the quality of learned embedding representations is crucial to provide high quality recommendations to users with various interests. Inspired by the recent success in self-supervised representation learning research in both computer vision and natural language understanding. we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for sparse neural models in recommendations.

1086451,Towards Supporting Search over Trending Events with Social Media,2013,Sanjay R Kairam and Meredith Ringel Morris and Jaime Teevan and Dan Liebling and Susan Dumais,,,,,AAAI,Many search engines identify bursts of activity around particular topics and reflect these back to users as Popular Now or Hot Searches. Activity around these topics typically evolves quickly in real-time during the course of a trending event. Users’ informational needs when searching for such topics will vary depending on the stage at which they engage with an event. Through a survey and log study. we observe that interaction with content about trending events varies significantly with prior awareness of the event. Building on this observation. we conduct a larger-scale analysis of query logs and social media data associated with hundreds of trending events. We find that search and social media activity tend to follow similar temporal patterns. but that social media activity leads by a few hours. While user interest in trending event content predictably diverges during peak activity periods. the overlap between content searched and shared increases.

1086462,Identifying best practices for visualizing photo statistics and galleries using treemaps,2016,John A Guerra-Gomez and Cati Boulanger and Sanjay Kairam and David A Shamma,,,,60-63,,Online photo collections are often presented along with numeric data. such as views. likes. or comments. Treemaps are ideal for visualizing such collections. as they present numeric values using rectangular blocks. within which photos can be presented. Despite abundant research showing that photo treemaps and similar space-filling approaches are useful and appealing for users. understanding of the ideal parameters for constructing these representations remains limited. To address this. we contribute a series of experiments targeted at identifying design parameters for building photo treemaps. Our first study explores the number of photos presented at each level in the treemap. finding that using fewer photos makes visualizations more searchable and preferable to users.

We find strong indications. from multiple corroborating methods. of low-dimensional dynamics in the performance of a simple program running on a popular Intel computer—including the first experimental evidence of chaotic dynamics in real computer hardware. We also find that the dynamics change completely when we run the same program on a different type of Intel computer. or when that program is changed slightly. This not only validates our framework; it also raises important issues about computer analysis and design.

Needleman-Wunsch. Smith-Waterman. and Longest Common Subsequence. In dynamic programming. the subproblems that do not depend on each other. and thus can be computed in parallel. form stages or wavefronts. The algorithm presented in this paper provides additional parallelism allowing multiple stages to be computed in parallel despite dependences among them. The correctness and the performance of the algorithm relies on rank convergence properties of matrix multiplication in the tropical semiring. formed with plus as the multiplicative operation and max as the additive operation.This paper demonstrates the efficiency of the parallel algorithm by showing significant speed ups on a variety of important dynamic programming problems.

Unfortunately. previous approaches for collecting path profiles are expensive: they need to either execute additional instructions (to track calls and returns) or they need to walk the stack. The state-of-the-art techniques for call path profiling slow down the program by 7% (for C programs) and 20% (for Java programs). This paper describes an innovative technique that collects minimal information from the running program and later (offline) infers the full call paths from this information.The key insight behind our approach is that readily available information during program execution - the height of the call stack and the identity of the current executing function - are good indicators of calling context.

A system may perform well during some parts of its execution and poorly during others. To understand why a system behaves in this way performance analysts need to study its time-varying behavior. Fortunately. modern microprocessors support hardware performance monitors which enable performance analysts to collect time-varying metrics with relative ease. Unfortunately. even though modern microprocessors can collect hundreds of metrics. they can collect only a few of these metrics simultaneously. Prior work has proposed time-interpolation techniques for circumventing this limitation. Time interpolation collects different metrics at different points in time. either within the same trace (multiplexing) or in different traces (trace alignment). and interpolates the results to allow reasoning across all metrics at the same points in time.

Ltd.,The performance of a program often varies significantly over the course of the program's run. Thus. to understand the performance of a program it is valuable to look not just at end‐to‐end metrics (e.g. total number of cache misses) but also the time‐varying performance of the program. Unfortunately. analyzing time‐varying performance is both cumbersome and difficult. This paper makes three contributions. all geared toward helping others in working with traces. First. it describes a system. the TraceAnalyzer. designed specifically for working with performance traces; a performance trace captures the time‐varying performance of a program run. Second. it describes lessons that we have learned from many years of working with these traces. Finally. it uses a case study to demonstrate how we have used the TraceAnalyzer to understand a performance anomaly. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons.

The research in this paper develops and tests an adaptation and theoretical extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by explaining intent to use not only in terms of variables related to functional evaluation like perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. but also variables that relate to social interaction. The new model was tested using controlled experiment and longitudinal data collected regarding three different social agents at elderly care facilities and at the homes of older adults. The model was strongly supported accounting for 59–79% of the variance in usage intentions and 49–59% of the variance in actual use.

In a randomized manner. a set of candidate new components is generated. For each of these candidates. we find the locally optimal new component and insert it into the existing mixture. The resulting algorithm resolves the sensitivity to initialization of state-of-the-art methods. like expectation maximization. and has running time linear in the number of data points and quadratic in the (final) number of mixture components.

The display was presented briefly and followed after a variable amount of time by a mask. We found that presenting a pre-cue. designating the target position. facilitated target detectability. Attention is directed to the cued location. When the observer has to detect a (second) target among the non cued elements. performance for locations close to the cue is not significantly different from performance for locations further away. This suggests that there is no “scan-path” or proximity effect. We also found that the identification of the cued element delayed the detectability of the subsequent target by more than 160 msec.

We evaluate our method using three large real world data sets and show our approach achieves good classification performance in a home for which little or no labelled data is available.,True,qU1NHTwAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC,168,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12654-3_17,18238880193204363253,/scholar?cites=18238880193204363253,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Van_Kasteren/publication/225137376_Transferring_Knowledge_of_Activity_Recognition_across_Sensor_Networks/links/55ae62fe08aed9b7dcdd9aa2/Transferring-Knowledge-of-Activity-Recognition-across-Sensor-Networks.pdf,0,0,0

Typically. probabilistic models such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) or conditional random fields (CRF) are used to map the observed sensor data onto the hidden activity states. A weakness of these models. however. is that the type of distribution used to model state durations is fixed. Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMM) and semi-Markov conditional random fields (SMCRF) model duration explicitly. allowing state durations to be modelled accurately. In this paper we compare the recognition performance of these models on multiple fully annotated real world datasets consisting of several weeks of data. In our experiments the HSMM consistently outperforms the HMM. showing that accurate duration modelling can result in a significant increase in recognition performance.

We present a method to automatically group the images into groups that correspond to convex subspaces in the environment which are related to the human concept of rooms. Pairwise similarities between the images are computed using local features extracted from the images and geometric constraints. The images with the proposed similarity measure can be seen as a graph or in a way as a base level dense topological map. From this low level representation the images are grouped using a graph-clustering technique which effectively finds convex spaces in the environment.

With this formalism the adequacy of the linear model is investigated. paying special attention to the estimation of the error in the secondary structure estimates. It is shown that the linear model is only adequate for the α-helix class. Since the failure of the linear model is most likely due to nonlinear effects. a locally linearized model is introduced.

1086534,Absorption and scattering correction in fluorescence confocal microscopy,1991,TD Visser and FCA Groen and GJ Brakenhoff,163,Journal of Microscopy,2,189-200,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,In three‐dimensional (3‐D) fluorescence images produced by a confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM). the contribution of the deeper layers is attenuated due to absorption and scattering of both the excitation and the fluorescence light. Because of these effects a quantitative analysis of the images is not always possible without restoration. Both scattering and absorption are governed by an exponential decay law. Using only one (space‐dependent) extinction coefficient. the total attenuation process can be described. Given the extinction coefficient we calculate within a non‐uniform object the relative intensity of the excitation light at its deeper layers. We also give a method to estimate the extinction coefficients which are required to restore 3‐D images. An implementation of such a restoration filter is discussed and an example of a successful restoration is given.,True,e2JmeJUAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,96,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2818.1991.tb03171.x,4283962985858308480,/scholar?cites=4283962985858308480,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45760272/Absorption_and_scattering_correction_in_20160518-5721-86638h.pdf,0,0,0

In the literature it has been shown. however. that the performance of the method improves if complex. often locally defined metrics are chosen. In this paper we demonstrate that in many real world discrimination problems comparable or even better classification results can be obtained with a simple global metric based on the Box-Cox transformation. In three case studies this is demonstrated: synthetic data. the IRIS data and real radar data. In the latter experiment. a large reduction in classification error of more than a factor four is achieved.

Using this description. they propose a new alignment method. the time-smoothed zero phase representation. which they compare to existing alignment methods in terms of classification performance. Classification is performed using a training set of simulated profiles to classify both simulated and measured test profiles.

1086541,Colour based off-road environment and terrain type classification,2005,Paul Jansen and Wannes van der Mark and Johan C van den Heuvel and Frans CA Groen,,,,61-66,Piscataway. NJ: IEEE,Terrain classification is an important problem that still remains to be solved for off-road autonomous robot vehicle guidance. Often. obstacle detection systems are used which cannot distinguish between solid obstacles such as rocks or soft obstacles such as tall patches of grass. Terrain classification is needed to prevent that the robot is stopped needlessly by the obstacle detection system. It can also be used to recognize sand roads or other drivable areas.In this paper we present a colour based method to classify typical terrain coverings such as sand. grass or foliage. Using colour recognition outdoors is difficult. because the observed colour of a material is heavily influenced by environment conditions such as the scene composition and illumination. A new approach to colour based classification is presented. It is based on the assumption that images with large similarities in environment related properties such as illumination. materials and geometry also have similar pixel distributions in a colour space. Classification based on a Maximum Likelihood method with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is improved by first distinguishing image sets in the training set that share the same environment state. Because the terrain type colours are modelled separately for each found image set. the influence of changing environment conditions is reduced. Terrain types in a new image are classified with the GMMs of the environment state that is the most similar to it. The results show that our approach is able to classify terrain types in real images with large differences in illumination.,True,e2JmeJUAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,74,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frans_Groen/publication/224621245_Colour_based_off-road_environment_and_terrain_type_classification/links/555a210908aeaaff3bfaba30.pdf,13861490022079072919,/scholar?cites=13861490022079072919,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frans_Groen/publication/224621245_Colour_based_off-road_environment_and_terrain_type_classification/links/555a210908aeaaff3bfaba30.pdf,0,0,0

Improving traffic control is important because it can lead to higher traffic throughput and reduced traffic congestion. This chapter describes multiagent reinforcement learning techniques for automatic optimization of traffic light controllers. Such techniques are attractive because they can automatically discover efficient control strategies for complex tasks. such as traffic control. for which it is hard or impossible to compute optimal solutions directly and hard to develop hand-coded solutions. First. the general multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is described. which is used to control traffic lights in this work.

Its purpose is to identify an object in the scene. together with its position and orientation. This technique is based on an intensive preprocessing stage. done off-line. where transformation invariant features of the models are indexed into a hash table. This makes the actual recognition particularly efficient. The algorithm stands out for its high inherent parallelism and its ability to deal with occluded scenes.

The process of AG matching proceeds as follows. First. an observed AG (AGO) is constructed from single-pixel-width line-representation of an observed symbol. Second. the pose of the AGO is estimated in terms of translation. rotation and scale with respect to the model AGs (AGMs). The search space is effectively pruned by introducing the concept of control vertex and applying geometrical constraints in an early stage. In this step. a small number of candidate AGMs are selected. Third. correspondences between components of the observed AG after normalization (AGON) and those of the AGMs are found for the given poses.

They have much higher accuracy requirements. since movements are less constrained in open places. and alternatives like alleys in an old town centre are in closer proximity. Location-based tourism information systems like tour guides are designed to provide context-driven interpretation of sights situated in the immediate vicinity. Current pedestrian navigation systems exclusively rely on GPS assisted by a map for localization. Hard to reproduce anecdotal evidence suggests that pedestrian navigators have difficulty to provide accurate navigational guidance. This paper examines the actual accuracy of positioning for various GPS receivers in areas of the city of Görlitz relevant to a tourist. These measurements are based on a comparison between a dense network of reference points of known locations and the estimated positions provided by the GPS receivers. The error of GPS localization is largely determined by the interaction of the current constellation of GPS satellites and the built-up in the immediate proximity. Since the constellation changes constantly the localization error of the same position varies significantly over time. A fraction of the error is reproducible and can therefore be used to correct the position estimate. The error along the street or alley is much smaller than the orthogonal error. This is of strategic importance for the design of mobile information systems targeting a tourist with interpretive information.,True,f89BorsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,189,http://modsching.com/papers/FieldtrialonGPSAccuracy10pages2006-02-10_06crcit.pdf,1348648794228259698,/scholar?cites=1348648794228259698,,http://modsching.com/papers/FieldtrialonGPSAccuracy10pages2006-02-10_06crcit.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Tourists who don’t select standard guided tours have to rely on a map or on signs to explore an unknown city on their own. They often end up looking for information about an attraction they’re at – but there’s none available. They need a guidance leading them wherever they want. giving them information about whatever they find and furthermore care for their return in time. This is the main objective of the Dynamic Tour Guide (DTG). The DTG is a mobile agent enabling a personalized spontaneous guided tour. It selects attractions. plans an individual tour. provides navigational guidance during the execution and offers environmental information.

This article presents the results of a field study in which the user acceptance of two kinds of mobile information systems for tourists was evaluated by means of a questionnaire survey and interviews. The first mode (Planner) provides tourists with a personalized tour. and besides multimedia-based information at the sights. it offers navigation instructions as well. The second mode (Explorer) shows nearby sights and offers multimedia-based information that can be requested manually.

Especially online travel reviews written by consumers are ever more available and used to inform travel-related decisions. A Web-based survey of users of the most prominent travel review site. TripAdvisor. was conducted to investigate how other travellers' reviews inform the trip planning process. Since current CGC statistics show generational and gender differences. the study also aimed at examining whether those carry over into the realm of travel review use. The results show that reviews are used mostly to inform accommodation decisions and are currently not used much for en route travel planning. Gender differences were found for perceived impacts of reviews. with females reaping greater benefits from using reviews. especially in terms of enjoyment and idea generation.

The new consumers of tourism products and services are more informed. more independent. more individualistic and more involved (Poon. 1993). In addition. the new travellers are used to having many choices. expect speed. and use technologies to overcome the physical constraints of bodies and borders.

Vienna,As the use of online reviews grows. so does the risk of providers trying to influence review postings through the submission of false reviews. It is difficult for users of online review platforms to detect deception as important cues are missing in online environments. Automatic screening technologies promise a reduction in the risk but need to be informed by research as to how to classify reviews as suspicious. Using findings from deception theory. a study was conducted to compare the language structure of deceptive and truthful hotel reviews. The results show that deceptive and truthful reviews are different in terms of lexical complexity. the use of first person pronouns. the inclusion of brand names. and their sentiment.

1086598,Selfie-taking as touristic looking,2016,Anja Dinhopl and Ulrike Gretzel,57,Annals of Tourism Research,,126-139,Pergamon,This paper reconceptualises the tourist gaze as facilitated by smart phones and social media. with a focus on selfies. It presents selfie-taking as a new way of touristic looking in which tourists become the objects of the self-directed tourist gaze. The paper suggests that the practice of selfie-taking in tourism is constituted by othering. stylized performing and producing/consuming visual culture of the self. Through these processes. tourists are able to ascribe the characteristics they otherwise associate with tourist sights onto themselves. Rather than fetishizing the extraordinary at the tourist destination. tourists seek to capture the extraordinary within themselves.

We examine two algorithms for frame synchronization: the first algorithm is based on an evaluation of periodic structures. Since it is completely independent of a frequency offset it may be applied for system acquisition and burst synchronization.

First. the optimal receiver is derived for digitally phase-modulated signals when transmitted over a frequency-nonselective fading channel with memory. The memory results from the fact that usually the coherence time of the channel is larger than the symbol period. Symbols adjacent in time cannot be detected independently and therefore the well-known quadratic receiver is not optimal in this case.

Due to its feedforward operation. clock synchronization and frequency offset compensation are hang-up free. and the demodulator is well suited for a digital implementation. The sampled baseband signal is passed through a nonlinearity and smoothed by a digital filter. The magnitude of the filter output directly drives the clock recovery process.

Special emphasis is placed on an all-digital implementation where carrier and clock synchronization do not require a feedback of signals to the analog part. which simplifies the analog front-end design (mixing oscillator and A/D converter sampling clock run at fixed frequency). An important advantage of the proposed algorithms is that a high clock rate is not required; only two-four times the symbol rate is needed. depending on amplitude quantization. Implementation aspects. e.g. architecture. and quantization. are considered. A prototype is described which was implemented to prove the feasibility of the concept and to evaluate the performance under practical conditions.< >,True,120B2eYAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,124,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/31179/,373017814528159370,/scholar?cites=373017814528159370,,,0,0,0

Existing methods for trust management. that are based on reputation. focus on the semantic properties of the trust model. They do not scale as they either rely on a central database or require to maintain global knowledge at each agent to provide data on earlier interactions. In this paper we present an approach that addresses the problem of reputation-based trust management at both the data management and the semantic level. We employ at both levels scalable data structures and algorithms that require no central control and allow to assess trust by computing an agents reputation from its former interactions with other agents.

In unstructured P2P systems in principle peers are unaware of the resources that neighboring peers in the overlay networks maintain. Typically they resolve search requests by flooding techniques. Gnutella [9] is the most prominent example of this class. In contrast. in structured P2P systems peers maintain information about what resources neighboring peers offer. Thus queries can be directed and in consequence substantially fewer messages are needed. This comes at the cost of increased maintenance efforts during changes in the overlay network as a result of peers joining or leaving.

Companies focus on their core business and outsource secondary activities to other organizations. Growing complexity of products requires co-makership relations between organizations. Value chains require a tight cooperation between companies participating in these chains. As a result. the creation of virtual organizations has become a major issue. To enable their operation. the information processing infrastructures of the participating organizations need to be linked. In the context of the close cooperation between companies. automated support for processes crossing organizational boundaries is an essential element [27]. The advent of business-to-business electronic commerce adds a dynamic dimension to this: virtual enterprises are formed and dismantled dynamically in rapidly evolving markets. Consequently. their process support infrastructure must be constructed dynamically. Workflow management systems that control the processes in the individual organizations are a key element here. In today’s businesses. the application of workflow management systems (WFMSs) for automated process support is widespread. The use of WFMSs ensures a well-structured and standardized management of processes within organizations [12]. Traditionally. the emphasis of workflow management has been on homogeneous environments within the boundary of a single organization.

Berlin. Heidelberg,We introduce autonomous gossiping (A/G). a new genre epidemic algorithm for selective dissemination of information in contrast to previous usage of epidemic algorithms which flood the whole network. A/G is a paradigm which suits well in a mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) environment because it does not require any infrastructure or middleware like multicast tree and (un)subscription maintenance for publish/subscribe. but uses ecological and economic principles in a self-organizing manner in order to achieve any arbitrary selectivity (flexible casting). The trade-off of using a stateless self-organizing mechanism like A/G is that it does not guarantee completeness deterministically as is one of the original objectives of alternate selective dissemination schemes like publish/subscribe. We argue that such incompleteness is not a problem in many non-critical real-life civilian application scenarios and …,True,ifU81ikAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,197,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30145-5_8,10774938763326148878,/scholar?cites=10774938763326148878,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-30145-5_8.pdf,0,0,0

Reputation-based trust management has been identified in the literature as a viable solution to the problem. The current work in the field can be roughly divided into two groups: social networks that rely on aggregating the entire available feedback in the network in hope achieving as much robustness against possible misbehavior as possible and probabilistic models that rely on the well known probabilistic estimation techniques but use only a limited fraction of the available feedback.

In unstructured P2P systems in principle peers are unaware of the resources that neighboring peers in the overlay networks maintain. Typically they resolve search requests by flooding techniques. Gnutella [9] is the most prominent example of this class. In contrast. in structured P2P systems peers maintain information about what resources neighboring peers offer. Thus queries can be directed and in consequence substantially fewer messages are needed. This comes at the cost of increased maintenance efforts during changes in the overlay network as a result of peers joining or leaving.

A Web service is an accessible application that other applications and humans can discover and invoke to satisfy multiple needs. To reduce the complexity featuring the composition of Web services. two concepts are put forward. namely. software agent and context. A software agent is an autonomous entity that acts on behalf of users and the context is any relevant information that characterizes a situation. During the composition process. software agents engage in conversations with their peers to agree on the Web services that participate in this process. Conversations between agents take into account the execution context of the Web services.

Several obstacles still hinder the seamless provisioning of Web services in mobile environments. Examples of such obstacles are: throughput and connectivity of wireless networks. limited computing resources of mobile devices. and risks of communication channel disconnections. In the proposed framework. software agents represent users. providers of services. and providers of resources. The business logic of composite services is expressed as a process model using statecharts formalism. Among other things. the use of agents provides an infrastructure that has the ability to handle disconnections during service preparation for execution. The framework also integrates a service execution planning approach to optimally select computing resources (fixed or mobile) on top of which …,True,V1ADQtIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,90,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ITEM.0000031581.31936.b9,15396929269283437263,/scholar?cites=15396929269283437263,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zakaria_Maamar/publication/2569168_On_Composite_Web_Services_Provisioning_in_an_Environment_of_Fixed_and_Mobile_Computing_Resources/links/02bfe512ebbd90a067000000.pdf,0,0,0

It is critical to verify the compatibility of component Web services to ensure the correctness of the whole composition in which these components participate. Traditionally. two conditions need to be satisfied during the verification of compatibility: reachable termination and proper termination. Unfortunately. it is complex and time consuming to verify those two conditions. To reduce the complexity of this verification. we model Web services using colored Petri nets (PNs) so that a specific property of their structures is looked into. namely. well structuredness.

1086699,Design of a secure distance-bounding channel for RFID,2011,Gerhard P Hancke,34,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,3,877-887,Academic Press,Distance bounding is often proposed as a countermeasure to relay attacks and distance fraud in RFID proximity identification systems. Although several distance-bounding protocols have been proposed the security of these proposals are dependent on the underlying communication channel. Conventional communication channels have been shown to be inappropriate for implementing distance bounding. as these channels introduce latency that can be exploited to obscure attempted attacks. Distance-bounding channels for RFID tokens have been proposed but have failed to address distance fraud or have not been practically implemented in an RFID environment.

Therefore. it is an approximation of the reality with regard to a particular purpose (Bedard & Chevallier. 1989) which is useful to understand. memorize. communicate and simulate. In everyday life. various types of models have different applications: texts. diagrams. maps. etc. Generally. the models created have to be as representative as possible of the reality they reflect (“homomorphism”) since they constitute knowledge communication channels between different interlocutors (Bidard. 1986). Therefore. a model is built to be ultimately communicated. read. interpreted and its content assimilated.Every model is necessarily developed using a language oformalism. A data model is no exception. A formalism or language is made up of semantic components (the content. eg. the set of notions represented by the words of the French language dictionary). structural rules (the directions for use. eg. French grammar rules) and a formal notation (the form. eg. letters and punctuation to present the content)(Caron. 1991). A formalism must make it possible to create efficient models. This efficiency is rendered by a richness of expression (meaning the ability to express as many concepts of the reality as possible required to achieve the objective). along with the capacity to be easily read and comprehended (the language must be as simple and intuitive as possible). qualities that often find themselves in opposition (Caron. 1991).

Traditionally. the relevance of a service is determined by computing an overall score that aggregates individual QoS values. Users are required to assign weights to QoS attributes. This is a rather demanding task and an imprecise specification of the weights could result in missing some user desired services. Recent approaches focus on computing service skyline over a set of QoS aspects. This can completely free users from assigning weights to QoS attributes. However. two main drawbacks characterize such approaches. First. the service skyline often privileges services with a bad compromise between different QoS attributes.

This allows for the manipulation of the captured context data at various levels of abstraction. for instance. in the case of a context parameter representing location. preferences …,True,LboZwd0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,43,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17427370710863158/full/html,6764857040887783698,/scholar?cites=6764857040887783698,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43042882/jpcc07.pdf,0,0,0
1086733,Recognition of printed Arabic text using neural networks,1997,Adnan Amin and Wathiq Mansoor,2,,,612-615,IEEE,The main theme of the paper is the automatic recognition of Arabic printed text using artificial neural networks in addition to conventional techniques. This approach has a number of advantages: it combines rule based (structural) and classification tests; feature extraction is inexpensive; and execution time is independent of character font and size. The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is preprocessing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. Second. global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number of subwords. number of peaks within the subword. number and position of the complementary character. etc. Finally. an artificial neural network is used for character classification.

1086752,Detection and Mitigation of RPL Rank and Version Number Attacks in Smart Internet of Things,2020,Zahrah A Almusaylim and Abdulaziz Alhumam and Wathiq Mansoor and Pushpita Chatterjee and Noor Zaman Jhanjhi,,,,,Preprints,The rapid growth of the smart Internet of Things (IoT) and massive propagation of wireless technologies revealed the recent opportunities for development in various domains of real life such as smart cities and E-Health applications. A slight defense against different forms of attacks is offered for the current secure and lightweight Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) of IoT resource-constrained devices. Data packets are highly likely to be exposed while transmitting them during data packets routing. The RPL rank and version number attacks. which are two forms of RPL attacks. can have critical consequences for RPL networks. The studies conducted on these attacks have several security defects and performance shortcomings. The research proposes a Secure RPL Routing Protocol (SRPL-RP) for rank and version number attacks. It mainly detects. mitigates and isolates attacks in the RPL networks. The detection is based on a comparison of ranks strategy. The mitigation uses threshold and attacks status tables. and the isolation adds them to a blacklist table and alerts relevant nodes to skip them. SRPL-RP supports diverse types of network topologies and is comprehensively analyzed with multiple studies such as Standard RPL with Attacks. SBIDS and RPL+ Shield. The analysis results showed that the SRPL-RP achieves great improvements with Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 98.48%. control message value of 991 packets/second. and average energy consumption of 1231.75 joules.

This paper formally demonstrates an optimal way to reduce energy via voltage over-scaling at the cost of errors due to timing starvation in addition. We identify a fundamental trade-off between error frequency and error magnitude in a timing-starved adder. We introduce a formal model to prove that for signal processing applications using a quadratic signal-to-noise ratio error measure. reducing bit-wise error frequency is sub-optimal.

In this paper we study the problem of leakage power minimization through dual Vth design techniques in the presence of significant Vth variation. For the first time we consider the optimal selection of Vth under a statistical model of threshold variation. Probabilistic analytical models are introduced to account for the impact of Vth uncertainty on leakage power and timing slack. Using this model. we show that the non-probabilistic analysis significantly (by 3x) underestimates the leakage power.

1086778,Multi-level approximate logic synthesis under general error constraints,2014,Jin Miao and Andreas Gerstlauer and Michael Orshansky,,,,504-510,IEEE,We address the problem of multi-level approximate logic synthesis. Our strategy assumes existence of an optimized exact Boolean network. which is critical in practice since arithmetic blocks are rarely synthesized from 2-level representation automatically. The goal is to produce minimum cost circuits whose logic function deviates in a controlled manner from the exact function with deviations quantified by the magnitude and frequency of errors. We rely on network simplifications allowed by external don't cares (EXDCs).

1086779,Modeling of NBTI-induced PMOS degradation under arbitrary dynamic temperature variation,2008,Bin Zhang and Michael Orshansky,,,,774-779,IEEE,Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) is one of the primary limiters of reliability lifetime in nano-scale integrated circuits. NBTI manifests itself in a gradual increase in the magnitude of PMOS threshold voltage. resulting in the degradation of circuit performance over time. NBTI is highly sensitive to operating temperature. making the amount of degradation strongly dependent on the thermal history of the chip. In order to accurately predict the amount of threshold voltage increase. the precise temperature profile must be utilized. The existing models are based on the simplified analysis which assumes that the temperature takes up to two possible fixed values over time. These models are inaccurate when predicting the impact of continuously-changing temperature that spans a large range. Our experiments show that proposed model accounting for temperature variation provides a significantly tighter bound for the …,True,vae65B0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,47,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4479836/,8043856657612568449,/scholar?cites=8043856657612568449,,,0,0,0

This significantly limits their potential as reliable security primitives. We introduce a novel strong silicon PUF based on the exponential current-voltage behavior in subthreshold region of FET operation which injects strong nonlinearity into the response of the PUF. The PUF. which we term subthreshold current array (SCA) PUF. is implemented as a pair of two-dimensional n × k transistor arrays with all devices subject to stochastic variability operating in subthreshold region. Our PUF is fundamentally different from earlier attempts to inject nonlinearity via digital control techniques. which could also be used with SCA-PUF. Voltages produced by nominally identical arrays are compared to produce a random binary response.

The major themes anthropologists have covered in the study of tourism may be divided conceptually into two halves: One half seeks to understand the origins of tourism. and the other reveals tourism's impacts. Even when taken together. these two approaches seem to produce only a partial analysis of tourism. The problem is that most studies aimed at understanding the origins of tourism tend to focus on tourists. and most research concerning the impacts of tourism tend to focus on locals.

SAGE Publications, London",,333-351,,The tourism industry has been described as one of the global economic success stories of the last 40 years (Coccossis and Parpairis. 1995). Governments in developing countries often invest in tourism with the assumption that it will contribute to economic development (Hall. 1995). Tourism is viewed as a means for national and regional development to increase employment. foreign exchange earnings. balance of payments advantages. and infrastructure (Edwards. 2004; Glasson et al.. 1995). In developing countries. sustainable tourism is especially important because it has the potential to bring social. economic. and environmental benefits. The objective of this chapter is to assess the practices and prospects of sustainable tourism and ecotourism in developing countries. We begin by examining definitions and concepts. and then we move to a discussion of socioeconomic and environmental impacts. and strategies for managing impacts.

We start with a theoretical critique of ecotourism development and conservation at the intersection of the macro-global and micro-local levels. Insights from the existential philosopher. Martin Heidegger (1889—1976) help identify spaces and relationships in natural area destinations that illustrate the paradox of ecological modernization. A longitudinal case study of a community-based ecotourism initiative in the Peruvian Amazon is used to illustrate our argument. Local residents work in partnership with a private tour company to market and operate the lodge. but negotiations go beyond splitting profits or commodifying resources.

Despite the “win-win” idea. scholars and practitioners debate the meaning and merits of ecotourism. We conducted a review of 30 years of ecotourism research. looking for empirical evidence of successes and failures. We found the following trends: Ecotourism is often conflated with outdoor recreation and other forms of conventional tourism; impact studies tend to focus on either ecological or social impacts. but rarely both; and research tends to lack time series data. precluding authors from discerning effects over time. either on conservation. levels of biodiversity. ecosystem integrity. local governance. or other indicators.

Especially online travel reviews written by consumers are ever more available and used to inform travel-related decisions. A Web-based survey of users of the most prominent travel review site. TripAdvisor. was conducted to investigate how other travellers' reviews inform the trip planning process. Since current CGC statistics show generational and gender differences. the study also aimed at examining whether those carry over into the realm of travel review use. The results show that reviews are used mostly to inform accommodation decisions and are currently not used much for en route travel planning.

Vienna,As the use of online reviews grows. so does the risk of providers trying to influence review postings through the submission of false reviews. It is difficult for users of online review platforms to detect deception as important cues are missing in online environments. Automatic screening technologies promise a reduction in the risk but need to be informed by research as to how to classify reviews as suspicious. Using findings from deception theory. a study was conducted to compare the language structure of deceptive and truthful hotel reviews.

1086816,Premises and promises of social media marketing in tourism,2013,Ulrike Gretzel and Kyung-Hyan Yoo,,The Routledge handbook of tourism marketing,,491-504,Routledge,The term social media refers to a collection of technological applications and platforms that were originally designed to support social interactions among individuals. While some of them (eg virtual communities) have been available for quite some time. there has been a recent surge in development of such applications. which has prompted a need to create a summary term and to better understand their use. Enticed by the large numbers of prospective customers reachable through these media and encouraged by the technology developers who integrated advertising-based business models to attract funding. it did not take long for companies to discover the commercial potential of social media. The viral component of social media makes them especially attractive as messages can achieve enormous reach without big marketing investments. However. due to the infancy and ongoing development of most of these social media. companies have yet to determine how to best use social media for marketing purposes. It is therefore important to look at the fundamental principles of social media and related consumer behaviours. and to infer theoretical foundations in order to identify marketing opportunities and inform marketing practice.Interactive media. ie computer-based media that are able to respond to individual consumer inputs with specific content. offer unique possibilities for marketers to promote products and services but also require adjustments of marketing strategies (Schlosser & Kanfer. 2000).

By conceptualizing the advice seeking and giving relationship as a fundamentally social process. important avenues for understanding the persuasiveness of recommender systems open up. Specifically. research regarding influential factors in advice seeking relationships. which is abundant in the context of human-human relationships. can provide an important framework for identifying potential influence factors in recommender system context. This book reviews the existing literature on the factors in advice seeking relationships in the context of human-human. human-computer. and human-recommender system interactions.

By conceptualizing the advice seeking and giving relationship as a fundamentally social process. important avenues for understanding the persuasiveness of recommender systems open up. Specifically. research regarding the influence of source characteristics. which is abundant in the context of humanhuman relationships. can provide an important framework for identifying potential influence factors.

Vienna,While opinion leadership has been recognized as important in tourism. there has been very little empirical research investigating the phenomenon. Given new developments in social media technologies. it is especially important to understand whether travel opinion leadership and seeking are drivers of specific social media perceptions and behaviours. Based on an online survey of US online travellers. this paper seeks to identify travel opinion leaders and seekers and their characteristics. Further. the research conducted investigated linkages between travel opinion leadership/seeking and travel social media use. The findings suggest that travel opinion leadership and seeking are distinct but connected.

Given the experiential nature of tourism. such first-hand knowledge communicated by other travelers is especially useful for travel decision-making. The characteristics of a recommendation source are extensively used to judge whether advice should be taken into account. The study presented in this paper investigated how gender. age and residence of the travel reviewer influence perceptions of credibility and liking of the source and the willingness to accept advice from the travel reviewer.

Specifically. the study tested hypotheses that host image has a positive impact on destination personality that in return will have a positive effect on intent to return and word of mouth. To assess the mediating role of the destination personality. direct effects of host image on intent to return and word of mouth were also investigated. The data were collected from a sample of 365 German travelers to the Mediterranean region of Turkey.

Specifically. the study investigated latent (i.e.. facial expressions. gestures) and manifested (i.e.. roles. activities) characteristics delineating relationships between men and women and the roles and meanings associated with these depictions. The results suggest that women are depicted in “traditional stereotypical” poses (i.e.. subordinate. submissive. dependent) disproportionately more often than men.

They developed and applied a number of theories to explain tourist behavior. The sign–gestalt paradigm. better known as the ‘push–pull factor’compendium theory by Tolman (1959) and later by Dann (1977). is perhaps the most recognized theory within the realm of tourism research. While models containing variables such as perceptions. images. attitudes. emotions. cultural conditioning. and learning contributed to an increased understanding of tourist behavior. motivation seems to be responsible for explaining much of the consumption behavior in tourism. thus making it a critical variable to study on its own right (Gnoth. 1997; Sirakaya et al.. 2003). The authors of this chapter support the definition suggested by Fodness (1994). when he said ‘[it is] the driving force behind all behavior.’A motivated person acts on psychological or physiological stimuli in order to satisfy a felt need or achieve an anticipated goal (Dunn Ross and Iso-Ahola. 1991; Fodness. 1994; Gnoth. 1997). An improved understanding of travel motivations would help in segmenting the markets. thereby allowing tourism marketers to allocate scarce tourism resources more efficiently. It has been suggested that the field of tourism would greatly benefit from a segmentation technique based on motivations because it could provide cues and/or insights that destination marketers could use in developing and promoting their tourism destinations.

1086867,Information search for travel decisions,2006,Y Hwang and Ulrike Gretzel and Zheng Xiang and Daniel R Fesenmaier,42,Destination recommendation systems: Behavioral foundations and applications,4,357-371,CAB International,One of the most important behavioural processes underlying travel decisionmaking can be generally described as the information search and processing. Travel decisions require a large amount of internal as well as external information and potentially encompass a number of information search. evaluation and integration tasks and activities. Travellers often actively seek information as part of their travel-planning effort. considering it an important component of the travel experience. Travel information available to individuals has a substantial influence on different aspects of travellers’ decision-making. particularly on destination choice (Crompton. 1979; Snepenger et al.. 1990; Mansfeld. 1992; Um and Crompton. 1992; Gursoy and Chen. 2000; Jeng and Fesenmaier. 2002). Many studies have indicated that the main function of information search is to support decision-making and product choice by reducing risk and uncertainty (Bettman. 1979; Vogt et al.. 1993; Gitelson and Kerstetter. 1994). Research on travellers’ information search and processing behaviour has a long history and has made substantial contributions to tourism marketing (Fodness and Murray. 1998; Vogt and Fesenmaier. 1998; Bieger and Laesser. 2004; Gursoy and McCleary. 2004). With the exponential growth of the amount of information available to consumers on the Internet. issues related to consumer information search and processing behaviour need to be re-examined and reinterpreted within this context (Hoffman and Novak. 1996; Dholakia and Bagozzi. 2001; Ratchford et al.. 2003).

The Internet now provides access to over 161 million travel-related web pages (Google. 2004). enabling potential travellers to obtain detailed information about almost any destination worldwide. This enormous amount of information available at one’s fingertips can greatly help travellers in planning trips and/or formulating expectations about tourism experiences. At the same time. it can lead to information overload. making it difficult for information seekers to find relevant information (Pan and Fesenmaier. 2002). Fortunately. information technology also provides the means for building systems that can simplify the decision-making process by identifying destinations that meet specific needs or desires and by enabling potential visitors to ‘experience’the destination prior to a purchase. These systems vary in sophistication. ranging from simple retrieval or filtering applications to comprehensive recommendation systems (Spiekermann and Paraschiv. 2002). Whereas the more basic forms of such decision aids have been widely adopted and integrated into search engines and database query systems. the latter have only been implemented to a certain extent and are still lacking vital elements before they can match or even exceed the quality of human recommendations (Häubl and Trifts. 2000).

1086877,Travel destination choice models,2006,Y Hwang and Ulrike Gretzel and Zheng Xiang and D Fesenmaier,29,Destination recommendation systems: Behavioural foundations and applications,,,Wallingford: CAB International,Travel decision-making involves a complex and multifaceted decision process (Park and Lutz. 1982; Moutinho. 1987; Woodside and MacDonald. 1994; Tay et al.. 1996; Dellaert et al.. 1998a; Fesenmaier and Jeng. 2000; Jeng and Fesenmaier. 2002). Among the many aspects of a trip that require the consideration. evaluation and elimination of alternatives. choosing a destination represents one of the core decisions to be made. Travel. by definition. represents a spatial movement from an original location to one or more destinations. and tourism products and services (attractions. accommodations. activities) are closely tied to these destinations. Also. this central role of destination choice implies that the selection of a travel destination is one of the first decisions made in the trip-planning process and influences all subsequent decisions (Jeng and Fesenmaier. 2002). Thus. travellers’ destination choice forms an essential part of their entire trip-planning process and has long been recognized as an important topic by researchers in tourism. In its simplest form. destination choice can be defined as a process of choosing one destination among a number of alternatives for the purpose of fulfilling the travel-related needs at hand. Following from research in consumer behaviour. travellers are understood to follow a funnel-like procedure of narrowing down choices that involves a series of well-defined stages:(i) recognition that there is a choice to be made;(ii) formulation of goals and objectives;(iii) generation of alternative set of destinations;(iv) search for information about the properties of the alternatives under consideration;(v) judgement or choice among …,True,72PpZ98AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,29,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TfVCXUn9N7sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=info:HnzheQ83ojUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=eh6o20DYgM&sig=ug_CY352fK8uC3nvEFtjpst4hN8,3864711969846164510,/scholar?cites=3864711969846164510,,,0,0,0

It is rather inevitable. because of this reason. for tourism to be one of the heaviest information dependent industries. As new forms of information technology have emerged. especially the World Wide Web (WWW). people have access to more tourism information than ever before. However. too much information from too many sources has caused an information overload (Good. et al.. 1999; Hibbard. 1997). According to Yahoo magazine. there are over 2.1 billion web pages at the time of September 2000 (Yahoo. 2000); thus it is impossible to search information manually in the WWW. As the amount of information distributed through the Internet increases. the issue for potential travelers is not the amount of information about a destination. but rather the relevance of the information to their interest.From a marketing viewpoint. the Internet as an effective information source has emerged as a new battleground of marketing (Rita. 2000) and has resulted in the development of a variety of new technologies such as Collaborate Filtering (CF).

Assessing attitudes towards destinations with the implicit association test,2011,Dae‐Young Kim and Zhijian Chen and Yeong‐Hyeon Hwang,13,International Journal of Tourism Research,5,468-481,John Wiley & Sons.

A total of 84 college students (30 Caucasian. 27 Chinese and 27 Korean) were employed to complete self‐report surveys and computer‐based IATs. The results show that participants' attitudes toward selected destinations (i.e. China and England) vary depending on which of the two different attitude measures is employed. Specifically. it appears that attitudes toward the two countries are not significantly different in self‐report survey. but differences in attitudes are significant in the IAT.

Selecting the right amount of virtualized resources for an application in such an environment is not an easy task and requires the utilization of three strongly interconnected resource management areas: resource modeling. resource estimation and resource discovery & selection. Most solutions enable an accurate selection of the most appropriate virtual resource package for specific application types already.

The idea to attach performance footprints to compute resources in order to select an appropriate setup for any application is very appealing. Especially in the scientific cloud. a lot of resources can be preserved by using just the right setup instead of needlessly over-provisioned instances. In this paper. we briefly list existing efforts that have been made in this area and explain the need for a generic benchmark model to combine the results found in previous work to reduce the benchmarking effort for new resources and applications. We propose such a model which is build on our previously presented resource and application model and highlight its advantages.

In the area of discrete optimization. most well-known problems are covered by a large variety of problem instances already. However. while exploring the area of lesser-known optimization problems there is usually not a sufficient amount or variety of such benchmark instances available. The reasons for this lack of data vary from privacy or confidentiality issues to technical difficulties that prevent the collection of such data. This results in the inability to evaluate new optimization algorithms on these problems.

The proposed strategy considers that repair recommendations for an ensemble of equipments close to each other can be combined to one maintenance visit. For that purpose two recommenders that are trained with different false positive rate limits are used. The more sensitive recommender. i.e. the one with a higher false positive rate. is used to create repair recommendations that are only considered positive if a maintenance worker is already on-site or nearby. In case the travel cost is higher than the costs for the components to be replaced in the medical equipment. it is shown that a greedy recommender is helpful. As greedy recommender we consider an algorithm that recommends a replacement very early. which is further specified in the paper.

The work is motivated by the necessity of meeting privacy constraints when focusing on the importance and broad application of data mining but also by the growing demand for privacy preservation in general. GenPAC. which can be used with any standard classification method. relies on clustering data to obfuscate information. The method is particularly useful in multi-party data mining scenarios where privacy is of interest. Its application has only minor impact on the classification performance of the used underlying data mining method whilst privacy preservation can be provided at the cost of a higher execution time.

This paper presents a new class of locally optimal algorithms called “Joint Equilibriumbased search for policies (JESP)”. We first describe an exhaustive version of JESP and subsequently a novel dynamic programming approach to JESP. Our complexity analysis reveals the potential for exponential speedups due to the dynamic programming approach. These theoretical results are verified via empirical comparisons of the two JESP versions with each other and with a globally optimal brute-force search algorithm.

NY,Recent years have seen a significant expansion in research on computational models of human emotional processes. driven both by their potential for basic research on emotion and cognition as well as their promise for an ever-increasing range of applications. This has led to a truly interdisciplinary. mutually beneficial partnership between emotion research in psychology and in computational science. of which this volume is an exemplar. To understand this partnership and its potential for transforming existing practices in emotion research across disciplines and for disclosing important novel areas of research. we explore in this chapter the history of work in computational models of emotion including the various uses to which they have been put. the theoretical traditions that have shaped their development. and how these uses and traditions are reflected in their underlying architectures.For an outsider to the field. the last 15 years have seen the development ofa seemingly bewildering array of competing and complementary computational models. Figure 1.2. 1 lists a ‘family tree’of a few of the significant models and the theoretical traditions from which they stem. Although there has been a proliferation of work. the field is far from mature: the goals that a model is designed to achieve are not always clearly articulated; research is rarely incremental. more often returning to motivating theories rather than extending prior computational approaches; and rarely are models contrasted with each other in terms of their ability to achieve their set goals.

1086898,EMA: A process model of appraisal dynamics,2009,Stacy C Marsella and Jonathan Gratch,10,Cognitive Systems Research,1,70-90,Elsevier,A computational model of emotion must explain both the rapid dynamics of some emotional reactions as well as the slower responses that follow deliberation. This is often addressed by positing multiple levels of appraisal processes such as fast pattern directed vs. slower deliberative appraisals. In our view. this confuses appraisal with inference. Rather. we argue for a single and automatic appraisal process that operates over a person’s interpretation of their relationship to the environment. Dynamics arise from perceptual and inferential processes operating on this interpretation (including deliberative and reactive processes).

1086908,Serious games for language learning: How much game. how much AI?,2005,W Lewis Johnson and Hannes Högni Vilhjálmsson and Stacy Marsella,125,AIED,1,306-313,,Modern computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users. but also in promoting learning. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games. games that have nonentertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter. the techniques employed are very different. Can AIED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques. or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS). a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling. pedagogical agents. and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world. interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties. and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.,True,LkoaA0gAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,259,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OALvAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA306&dq=info:GFrNhWJWGhAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ng5zzqaUgV&sig=gUILOFnJELeBFyWqRwSQrUDRnog,1160334835152935448,/scholar?cites=1160334835152935448,,http://www.hr.is/kennarar/hannes/publications/AIED2005.pdf,0,0,0

For example. it is critical to designing virtual humans. human-like autonomous agents that interact with people in virtual worlds. A key factor in human social interaction is our beliefs about others. in particular a theory of mind. Whether we believe a message depends not only on its content but also on our model of the communicator. The actions we take are influenced by how we believe others will react. However. theory of mind is usually ignored in computational models of social interaction. In this paper. we present PsychSim. an implemented multiagent-based simulation tool for modeling interactions and influence among groups or individuals.

Our method employs Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate motion data into visually meaningful components called style components. The user then interactively identifies suitable style components and manipulates them based on a proposed set of operations. In particular. the user can transfer style components from one motion to another in order to create new motions that retain desirable aspects of the style and expressiveness of the original motion. For example. a clumsy walking motion can be decomposed so as to separate the clumsy nature of the motion from the underlying walking pattern. The clumsy style component can then be applied to a running motion. which will then yield a clumsy-looking running motion. Our approach is simple. efficient and intuitive since the components are themselves motion data.

The 3D models that are captured are suitable for use in applications where recognition and distinction among characters by shape. form. or clothing is important. such as small group or crowd simulations or other socially oriented applications.

1086929,Avatar reshaping and automatic rigging using a deformable model,2015,Andrew Feng and Dan Casas and Ari Shapiro,,,,57-64,,3D scans of human figures have become widely available through online marketplaces and have become relatively easy to acquire using commodity scanning hardware. In addition to static uses of such 3D models. such as 3D printed figurines or rendered 3D still imagery. there are numerous uses for an animated 3D character that uses such 3D scan data. In order to effectively use such models as dynamic 3D characters. the models must be properly rigged before they are animated. In this work. we demonstrate a method to automatically rig a 3D mesh by matching a set of morphable models against the 3D scan. Once the morphable model has been matched against the 3D scan. the skeleton position and skinning attributes are then copied. resulting in a skinning and rigging that is similar in quality to the original hand-rigged model.

Our method is able to synthesize collision-free motions for specified linkages of multiple animated characters in synchrony with the characters' full-body motions.

1086932,On the beat!: timing and tension for dynamic characters,2007,Brian Allen and Derek Chu and Ari Shapiro and Petros Faloutsos,,,,239-247,,Dynamic simulation is a promising complement to kinematic motion synthesis. particularly in cases where simulated characters need to respond to unpredictable interactions. Moving beyond simple rag-doll effects. though. requires dynamic control. The main issue with dynamic control is that there are no standardized techniques that allow an animator to precisely specify the timing of the motion while still providing natural response to external disturbances. The few proposed techniques that address this problem are based on heuristically or manually tuning proportional-derivative (PD) control parameters and do not generalize easily. We propose an approach to dynamic character control that is able to honor timing constraints. to provide naturallooking motion and to allow for realistic response to perturbations. Our approach uses traditional PD control to interpolate between key-frames. The key innovation is that the parameters of the PD controllers are computed for each joint analytically. By continuously updating these parameters over time. the controller is able to respond naturally to both external perturbations and changes in the state of the character.,True,3plYmtsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,45,https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~pfal/Petros_Faloutsos/Publications_files/SCA-07-on.pdf,5764316049708470186,/scholar?cites=5764316049708470186,,https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~pfal/Petros_Faloutsos/Publications_files/SCA-07-on.pdf,0,0,0

Previous approaches to emotion recognition have mostly focused on extraction of carefully engineered features and have trained simple classifiers for the emotion task. There has been limited effort at representation learning for affect recognition. where features are learnt directly from the signal waveform or spectrum. Prior work also does not investigate the effect of transfer learning from affective attributes such as valence and activation to categorical emotions. In this paper. we investigate emotion recognition from spectrogram features extracted from the speech and glottal flow signals; spectrogram encoding is performed by a stacked autoencoder and an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is used for classification of four primary emotions. We perform two experiments to improve RNN training:(1) Representation Learning-Model training on the glottal flow signal to investigate the effect of speaker and phonetic invariant features on classification performance (2) Transfer Learning-RNN training on valence and activation. which is adapted to a four emotion classification task.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members. preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However. research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example. service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA. which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members. we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA.

Most existing approaches to gesture recognition with hidden states employ a Hidden Markov Model or suitable variant (e.g.. a factored or coupled state model) to model gesture streams; a significant limitation of these models is the requirement of conditional independence of observations. In addition. hidden states in a generative model are selected to maximize the likelihood of generating all the examples of a given gesture class. which is not necessarily optimal for discriminating the gesture class against other gestures. Previous discriminative approaches to gesture sequence recognition have shown promising results. but have not incorporated hidden …,True,APgaFK0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,630,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1640937/,11409044739113870763,/scholar?cites=11409044739113870763,,,0,0,0

In this paper. we develop a discriminative framework for simultaneous sequence segmentation and labeling which can capture both intrinsic and extrinsic class dynamics. Our approach incorporates hidden state variables which model the sub-structure of a class sequence and learn dynamics between class labels. Each class label has a disjoint set of associated hidden states. which enables efficient training and inference in our model. We evaluated our method on the task of recognizing human gestures from unsegmented video streams and performed experiments on three different datasets of head and eye gestures.

Perceived stigma prevents many from reporting their symptoms. Stigma is a particularly pervasive problem among military service members. preventing them from reporting symptoms of combat-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However. research shows increased reporting by service members when anonymous assessments are used. For example. service members report more symptoms of PTSD when they anonymously answer the Post-Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) symptom checklist compared to the official PDHA. which is identifiable and linked to their military records. To investigate the factors that influence reporting of psychological symptoms by service members. we used a transformative technology: automated virtual humans that interview people about their symptoms. Such virtual human interviewers allow simultaneous use of two techniques for eliciting disclosure that would otherwise be incompatible; they afford anonymity while also building rapport. We examined whether virtual human interviewers could increase disclosure of mental health symptoms among active-duty service members that just returned from a year-long deployment in Afghanistan. Service members reported more symptoms during a conversation with a virtual human interviewer than on the official PDHA. They also reported more to a virtual human interviewer than on an anonymized PDHA.

The database contains 3D models for 23 subjects and 15 expressions. as well as photometric information that allow for photorealistic rendering. It is also facial action units annotated. using FACS standards. Using the ICT-3DRFE database we create an image set of different expressions/illuminations to study the effect of illumination on automatic expression recognition. We compared the output scores from automatic recognition with expert FACS annotations and found that they agree when the illumination is uniform. Our results show …,True,r2OOH4cAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885612000169,9005663523442583923,/scholar?cites=9005663523442583923,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA560069.pdf,0,0,0
1087040,Towards an affective interface for assessment of psychological distress,2015,Gale M Lucas and Jonathan Gratch and Stefan Scherer and Jill Boberg and Giota Stratou,,,,539-545,IEEE,Even with the rise in use of TeleMedicine for health care and mental health. research suggests that clinicians may have difficulty reading nonverbal cues in computer-mediated situations. However. the recent progress in tracking affective markers (i.e.. displays of emotional expressions on face and in voice) has opened the door to new clinical applications that might help health care providers better read nonverbal behaviors when employing TeleMedicine. For example. an interface that automatically quantified affective markers could assist clinicians in their assessment of and treatment for psychological distress (i.e.. symptoms of depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)). To move towards this prospect. we will show that clinicians' judgments of these nonverbal affective markers (e.g.. smile. frown. eye contact. tense voice) could be informed by such technology.

The descriptors are extracted from visually sensed heart-rate signals obtained during the course of a semi-structured interview with a virtual human and can potentially integrate question context as well. The proposed descriptors are motivated by prior related work and are constructed based on histogram-based approaches. time and frequency domain analysis of heart-rate variability. In order to contextualize our descriptors. we use information about the polarity and intimacy levels of the questions asked. Our experiments reveal that the descriptors. both with and without context. perform far better than chance in predicting anxiety.

(a) constraints arising from facial morphology. (b) prior published evidence. (c) claims arising from basic emotion theory. We performed factor analysis on a large data set and recovered factors that have been discussed in the literature as psychologically meaningful. Further we show that some of these factors have external validity in that they predict participant behaviors in an iterated prisoner's dilemma task and in fact with more precision than the individual AUs. These results both reinforce the validity of automatic recognition (as these factors would be expected from accurate AU detection) and suggest the benefits of using such factors for understanding these facial expressions as social signals.,True,r2OOH4cAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8273635/,12991603996583203955,/scholar?cites=12991603996583203955,,http://orca.cf.ac.uk/104417/1/van%20der%20Schalk%20Refactoring%20facial.pdf,0,0,0

Emotion and emotional signaling is an important element of how people resolve these dilemmas. With the rise of affective computing. emotion is also an important element of how people resolve these dilemmas with machines. In this article. we learn a predictive model of how people make decisions in an iterative social dilemma. We further show that model accuracy improves by incorporating a player’s emotional displays as input to this model. and provide some insight into which emotions influence social decisions. Finally. we show how this model can be used to perform “social planning”: ie. to generate a sequence of actions and expressions that achieve social goals (such as maximizing individual rewards).

Inc.,It has long been recognized that facial expressions. body posture/gestures and vocal parameters play an important role in human communication and the implicit signalling of emotion. Recent advances in low cost computer vision and behavioral sensing technologies can now be applied to the process of making meaningful inferences as to user state when a person interacts with a computational device. Effective use of this additive information could serve to promote human interaction with virtual human (VH) agents that may enhance diagnostic assessment. The same technology could also be leveraged to improve engagement in teletherapy approaches between remote patients and care providers. This paper will focus on our current research in these areas within the DARPA-funded “Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals” project. with specific attention to the SimSensei application use case. SimSensei is a virtual human interaction platform that is able to sense and interpret real-time audiovisual behavioral signals from users interacting with the system. It is specifically designed for health care support and leverages years of virtual human research and development at USC-ICT. The platform enables an engaging face-to-face interaction where the virtual human automatically reacts to the state and inferred intent of the user through analysis of behavioral signals gleaned from facial expressions. body gestures and vocal parameters.

The proposed method is based on a space of blendable example motions collected by motion capture. This space is explored by a sampling-based planner that is able to produce motions around obstacles while keeping solutions similar to the original examples. The results therefore largely maintain the humanlike characteristics observed in the example motions. The method is applied to generic upper-body actions and is complemented by a locomotion planner that searches for suitable body placements for executing upper-body actions successfully. As a result. our overall multi-modal planning method is able to automatically coordinate whole-body motions for action execution among obstacles. and the produced motions remain similar to example motions given as input to the system.,True,lWyTFm4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,22,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6095133/,3903065714933292550,/scholar?cites=3903065714933292550,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.669.9070&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1087099,Shape DNA: Basic generating functions for geometric moment invariants,2017,Erbo Li and Yazhou Huang and Dong Xu and Hua Li,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.02242,,,,Geometric moment invariants (GMIs) have been widely used as basic tool in shape analysis and information retrieval. Their structure and characteristics determine efficiency and effectiveness. Two fundamental building blocks or generating functions (GFs) for invariants are discovered. which are dot product and vector product of point vectors in Euclidean space. The primitive invariants (PIs) can be derived by carefully selecting different products of GFs and calculating the corresponding multiple integrals. which translates polynomials of coordinates of point vectors into geometric moments. Then the invariants themselves are expressed in the form of product of moments. This procedure is just like DNA encoding proteins. All GMIs available in the literature can be decomposed into linear combinations of PIs. This paper shows that Hu's seven well known GMIs in computer vision have a more deep structure. which can be further divided into combination of simpler PIs. In practical uses. low order independent GMIs are of particular interest. In this paper. a set of PIs for similarity transformation and affine transformation in 2D are presented. which are simpler to use. and some of which are newly reported. The discovery of the two generating functions provides a new perspective of better understanding shapes in 2D and 3D Euclidean spaces. and the method proposed can be further extended to higher dimensional spaces and different manifolds. such as curves. surfaces and so on.,True,lWyTFm4AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,7,https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02242,10512240655005211687,/scholar?cites=10512240655005211687,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02242,0,0,0

Researchers in areas such as cognitive science. philosophy. and artificial intelligence have proposed a variety of models of emotions.

In this paper. we propose that the experience of playing a video game. like Assassin’s Creed. is a personal experience shaped through one’s emotional values. expectations. knowledge. and attitudes as influenced by culture. As we set out to review the Assassin’s Creed game. we discovered that each one of us had a different experience with the game. In this paper. we draw on our Assassin’s Creed play sessions. This experience is shaped by our different cultural viewpoints. including Middle-Eastern and Western. as well as intellectual disciplinary backgrounds. which include architecture. theatre. and computer science. To Maha and Magy. for example. the game aroused many nostalgic feelings through its simulated Middle-Eastern cities. the use of Arabic words. accents and gestures. and the detailed Middle-Eastern architectural design.

In a match of such games. players compete in two teams of five. each controlling an in-game avatar. known as heroes. selected from a roster of more than 100. The selection of heroes. also known as pick or draft. takes place before the match starts and alternates between the two teams until each player has selected one hero. Heroes are designed with different strengths and weaknesses to promote team cooperation in a game.

A key element of SAC networks is entropy regularization. which prevents the SAC actor from optimizing against fine grained features. oftentimes transient. of the state-action value function. This results in better sample efficiency during early training. We take this idea one step further by artificially bandlimiting the target critic spatial resolution through the addition of a convolutional filter. We derive the closed form solution in the linear case and show that bandlimiting reduces the interdependency between the low and high frequency components of the state-action value approximation. allowing the critic to learn faster. In experiments. the bandlimited SAC outperformed the classic twin-critic SAC in a number of Gym environments. and displayed more stability in returns.

In such games. players compete in teams against each other by controlling selected game avatars. each of which is designed with different strengths and weaknesses. Intuitively. putting together game avatars that complement each other (synergy) and suppress those of opponents (opposition) would result in a stronger team. In-depth understanding of synergy and opposition relationships among game avatars benefits player in making decisions in game avatar drafting and gaining better prediction of match events. However. due to intricate design and complex interactions between game avatars. thorough understanding of their relationships is not a trivial task.In this paper. we propose a latent variable model. namely Game Avatar Embedding (GAE). to learn avatars' numerical representations which encode synergy and opposition relationships between pairs of avatars.

Heidelberg,Developing an embodied conversational agent able to exhibit a humanlike behavior while communicating with other virtual or human agents requires enriching the dialogue of the agent with non-verbal information. Our agent. Greta. is defined as two components: a Mind and a Body. Her mind reflects her personality. her social intelligence. as well as her emotional reaction to events occurring in the environment. Her body corresponds to her physical appearance able to display expressive behaviors. We designed a Mind—Body interface that takes as input a specification of a discourse plan in an XML language (DPML) and enriches this plan with the communicative meanings that have to be attached to it. by producing an input to the Body in a new XML language (APML).

Gesture. gaze. facial expression. and body orientation all give information about what we are saying and help the interlocutor understand our attitude toward her. our emotion. and our relation to what we are saying (for instance. in emphasis or irony). They may also act as syntax markers: if a person punctuates the end of her statement with a raised eyebrow. her statement could be interpreted as a question. For example. a person is saying Peter is going to Boston. and she raises her eyebrow at the word Boston and sustains the raised eyebrow during the pause following her utterance; the sentence will be interpreted as the nonsyntactically marked question Peter is going to Boston? rather than the affirmation Peter is going to Boston. Intonation may also serve as syntactic markers: high pitch at the end of an utterance may mark a question while a statement may be indicated by a low pitch (Bolinger 1989; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1987; Prevost 1996). Several studies (Argyle and Cook 1976; Ekman 1979; Kendon 1993; McNeill 1992) have shown the importance of nonverbal signals within a conversation. They have reported the different functions of these signals. The meaning of such signals may complement the meaning of what is being said (eg. showing a direction with the index finger while saying He went in this street); they may substitute words (shaking the index finger to a child to say no); they may modify the conversation (making a mocking face while saying,True,n9ZNrsEAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,151,http://teilab-static.arch.tamu.edu/quek/Classes/Aware+EmbodiedInteraction/EmbodiedInteractionPAPERS/PogP00.pdf,1882313318095901067,/scholar?cites=1882313318095901067,,http://teilab-static.arch.tamu.edu/quek/Classes/Aware+EmbodiedInteraction/EmbodiedInteractionPAPERS/PogP00.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we concentrate on the study and generation of coordinated linguistic and gaze communicative acts. In this view we analyse gaze signals according to their functional meaning rather than to their physical actions. We propose a formalism where a communicative act is represented by two elements: a meaning (that corresponds to a set of goals and beliefs that the agent has the purpose to transmit to the interlocutor) and a signal. that is the nonverbal expression of that meaning.

In particular. we have developed a model of multimodal behaviours that includes dynamism and complex facial expressions. The first feature refers to the qualitative execution of behaviours. Our model is based on perceptual studies and encompasses several parameters that modulate multimodal behaviours. The second feature. the model of complex expressions. follows a componential approach where a new expression is obtained by combining facial areas of other expressions. Lately we have been working on adding temporal dynamism to expressions. So far they have been designed statically. typically at their apex. Only full-blown expressions could be modelled.

Extended Abstract FearNot! is a story-telling application originally created in the EU FP5 project VICTEC and now extended in the FP6 project eCIRCUS [eCIRCUS 07]. It has applied ideas from Forum Theatre [Boal 79] to the domain of education against bullying. In Forum Theatre. sections of an audience take responsibility for a specific character in the unfolding drama. played by an actor who always stays in role. Episodes in which the actors improvise within an overall narrative framework are broken by interaction sections in which the audience sections talk over with ‘their’ character what they should do in the next dramatic segment. The actor is free to reject advice that seems incompatible with their role. and may also suspend a dramatic episode if it seems necessary to get further advice.,True,p5jXWHgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,110,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-77039-8_19,4412384137933278146,/scholar?cites=4412384137933278146,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruth_Aylett/publication/221594553_FearNot_-_An_Emergent_Narrative_Approach_to_Virtual_Dramas_for_Anti-bullying_Education/links/0912f50ca5259995a0000000/FearNot-An-Emergent-Narrative-Approach-to-Virtual-Dramas-for-Anti-bullying-Education.pdf,0,0,0

An agent perceives and acts in a world and the model of the world influences how the agent makes decisions.

Inspired by four dimensions that are commonly postulated by appraisal theories of emotions. we construct a set of reward features to guide the learning process and behaviour of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that inhabits an environment of which it has only limited perception.

In this paper. we investigate the impact of intrinsic motivation mechanisms in multiagent learning scenarios. by considering how such motivational system may drive an agent to engage in behaviors that are “socially aware”.

Role assignment is a way to organize interpersonal encounters and can result in uncertainty decrease when facing a novel interaction with someone we just met. or even to rediscover new roles within previous relationships. When people interact with synthetic characters - such as robots - it seems they also assign roles to these agents. just as they do with humans. Within the field of human-robot interaction (HRI). robots are being developed to fulfill specific roles. This enables researchers to design concrete behaviors that match the desired role that a robot will play in a given task. It would then be expected that if a robot is developed with such a specific role. users too would assign the same role to that robot.

1087190,Socio-Emotional Reward Design for Intrinsically Motivated Learning Agents,2013,Pedro Sequeira,,,,,,Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational approach which models autonomous agents facing a sequential decision problem in a dynamic environment. The behavior of the agent is guided by a reward mechanism embedded into the agent by its designer. Designing flexible reward mechanisms. capable of guiding the agent in learning the task intended by its designer. is a very demanding endeavor: on one hand. artificial agents have inherent limitations that often impact the ability to actually solve the task they were initially designed to accomplish; On the other hand. traditional approaches to RL are too restrictive given the agents limitations. potentially leading to poor performances. Therefore. applying RL in complex problems often requires a great amount of manual fine-tuning on the agents so that they perform well in a given scenario. and even more when we want them to operate in a variety of different situations. often involving complex interactions with other agents.In this thesis we adopt a recent framework for intrinsically-motivated reinforcement learning (IMRL) that proposes the use of richer reward signals related to aspects of the agent’s relationship with its environment that may not be directly related with the task intended by its designer. We propose to take inspiration from information processing mechanisms present in natural organisms to build more flexible and robust reward mechanisms for autonomous RL agents. Specifically. we focus on the role of emotions as an evolutionary adaptive mechanism and also on the way individuals interact and cooperate with each other as a social group.

1087192,Interestingness Elements for Explainable Reinforcement Learning through Introspection.,2019,Pedro Sequeira and Eric Yeh and Melinda T Gervasio,,,,7,,We propose a framework toward more explainable reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The framework uses introspective analysis of an agent’s history of interaction with its environment to extract several interestingness elements regarding its behavior. Introspection operates at three distinct levels. first analyzing characteristics of the task that the agent has to solve. then the behavior of the agent while interacting with the environment. and finally by performing a meta-analysis combining information gathered at the lower levels. The analyses rely on data that is already collected by standard RL algorithms. We propose that additional statistical data can easily be collected by a RL agent while learning that helps extract more meaningful aspects.

Our research aims to contribute towards the creation of artificial agent negotiators that can be used for training purposes to improve human negotiation skills. To achieve that. we address the challenge of identifying differences in human negotiation styles and relating those differences to individuals' personality traits. In particular. we follow a data-driven approach by collecting data on how people negotiate against an agent using a fixed-response strategy during a task involving the partition of a set of items. We then use different machine learning techniques to: 1) analyze the relationship between negotiation styles and personality traits; 2) characterize changes in the human negotiation behavior during the game; 3) discover human behavior patterns in response to different offers by the agent player.

We use an associative tree structure to identify associations between the perceived stimuli and use this structure to measure the degree of similarity between states in factored Markov decision problems. Our approach provides a state-space metric that requires no prior knowledge on the structure of the underlying decision problem and is designed to be learned online. i.e.. as the agent interacts with its environment. Our metric is thus amenable to application in reinforcement learning (RL) settings. allowing the learning agent to generalize its experience to unvisited states and improving the overall learning performance.

The causes underlying the severity and prolongation of these shortages are complex. in part due to the complexity of the underlying supply chain networks. which involve supplier-buyer interactions across multiple entities with competitive and cooperative goals. This leads to interesting challenges in maintaining consistent interactions and trust among the entities. Furthermore. disruptions in supply chains influence trust by inducing over-reactive behaviors across the network. thereby impacting the ability to consistently meet the resulting fluctuating demand. To explore these issues. we model a pharmaceutical supply chain with boundedly rational artificial decision makers capable of reasoning about the motivations and behaviors of others. We use multiagent simulations where each agent represents a key decision maker in a pharmaceutical supply chain. The agents possess a Theory-of-Mind capability to reason about the beliefs. and past and future behaviors of other agents. which allows them to assess other agents’ trustworthiness. Further. each agent has beliefs about others’ perceptions of its own trustworthiness that. in turn. impact its behavior. Our experiments reveal several counter-intuitive results showing how small. local disruptions can have cascading global consequences that persist over time. For example. a buyer. to protect itself from disruptions. may dynamically shift to ordering from suppliers with a higher perceived trustworthiness. while the supplier may prefer buyers with more stable ordering behavior.

1087239,Real-time expressive gaze animation for virtual humans,2009,Marcus Thiebaux and Brent Lance and Stacy Marsella,,,,321-328,,Gaze is an extremely important aspect of human face to face interaction. Over the course of an interaction. a single individual’s gaze can perform many different functions. such as regulating communication. expressing emotion. and attending to task performance. When gaze shifts occur. where they are directed. and how they are performed all provide critical information to an observer of the gaze shift. The goal of this work is to allow virtual humans to mimic the gaze capabilities of humans in face to face interaction. This paper introduces the SmartBody Gaze Controller (SBGC). a highly versatile framework for realizing various manners of gaze through a rich set of input parameters. Using these parameters. the SBCG controls aspects of movement such as velocity. postural bias. and the selection of joints committed to a particular gaze task. We provide a preliminary implementation that demonstrates how related work on the Expressive Gaze Model (EGM) can be used to inform management of these input parameters. The EGM is a model for manipulating the style of gaze shifts for the purpose of expressing emotion [11].

Las Vegas, Nevada",,,,To address a part of the challenge of testing and comparing various 3D user interface devices and methods. we are currently developing and testing a VR 3D User Interface benchmarking scenario. The approach outlined in this paper focuses on the capture of human interaction performance on object selection and manipulation tasks using standardized and scalable block configurations that allow for measurement of speed and efficiency with any interaction device or method. The block configurations that we are using as benchmarking stimuli are accompanied by a pure mental rotation visuospatial assessment test. This feature will allow researchers to test users’ existing spatial abilities and statistically parcel out the variability due to innate ability. from the actual hands-on performance metrics. This statistical approach could lead to a more pure analysis of the ergonomic features of interaction devices and methods separate from existing user abilities. An initial test was conducted at two sites using this benchmarking system to make comparisons between 3D/gesture-based and 2D/mouse-based interactions for 3D selection and manipulation. Our preliminary results demonstrated. as expected. that the 3D/gesture based method in general outperformed the 2D/mouse interface.

For example. earthquake scientists can now study earthquake phenomena in detail via “first principle.” physics-based. large-scale simulations in a time-volumetric space. Interactive visualization benefits the iterative scientific process to extract information from data and help scientists adapt their methods. Single-system visualization software running on high-end commodity machines can no longer sustain interactive browsing of these large science data due to their limited I/O and processing capabilities. A distributed and incremental approach is needed. to allow selective filtering of the parts of the data that the scientist wishes to view. In this paper. we introduce a flexible and extensible Grid-based visualization framework for visual browsing of spatially and temporally large datasets in a Grid environment. Our framework leverages Grid infrastructure for access to shared scalable computation and data storage. In particular. we assume commodity machines for both user-interaction and bulk processing. exploiting distributed parallelism to scale the input data-handling capabilities.

However. when relevance judgments are incomplete. the value of bpref deviates from this value. though it continues to rank systems in a manner similar to average precision evaluated with a complete judgment set. In this work. we propose three evaluation measures that (1) are approximations to average precision even when the relevance judgments are incomplete and (2) are more robust to incomplete or imperfect relevance judgments than bpref. The proposed estimates of average precision are simple and …,True,-spRnaQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,334,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1183614.1183633,15363742955437528264,/scholar?cites=15363742955437528264,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.331.5032&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1087272,The threeballot voting system,2006,Ronald L Rivest,,,,,Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project,We present a new paper-based voting method with interesting security properties. The attempt here is to see if one can achieve the same security properties of recently proposed cryptographic voting protocols. but without using any cryptography. using only paper ballots. We partially succeed.(Initially. I thought the proposal accomplished this goal. but several readers discovered a vote-buying attack (see Section 4.4) that appears to be rather difficult to fix without making the resulting system much less usable in practice. Currently. this paper should thus be viewed more as an academic proposal than a practical proposal. Perhaps some variation on these ideas in this paper might still turn out to be of practical use. The “OneBallot with Exchanged Receipts” system sketched at the end of Section 5.3. 1. looks particularly promising at the moment...) The principles of ThreeBallot are simple and easy to understand.In this proposal. not only can each voter verify that her vote is recorded as she intended. but she gets a “receipt” that she can take home that can be used later to verify that her vote is actually included in the final tally. Her receipt. however. does not allow her to prove to anyone else how she voted. In this “ThreeBallot” voting system. each voter casts three paper ballots. with certain restrictions on how they may be filled out. so the tallying works. These paper ballots are of course “voter-verifiable.” All ballots cast are scanned and published on a web site. so anyone may correctly compute the election result. A voter receives a copy of one of her ballots as her “receipt”. which she may take home.

Existing methods only focus on the concept of frequency because of the assumption that sequences’ behaviors do not change over time. Several efficient algorithms for maintaining sequential patterns have been developed.. old datasets are deleted while some other datasets are updated. It is obvious time stamp as an important attribute of each dataset. also it is important in the process of data mining and it can gives us more accurate and useful information. Although there have been many recent studies on the sequential patterns in static database. But the complexity of sequential pattern mining is when increasing the data in dynamically.

1087305,Quantitative evaluation of performance and validity indices for clustering the web navigational sessions,2015,Zahid Ansari and MF Azeem and Waseem Ahmed and A Vinaya Babu,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.03340,,,,Clustering techniques are widely used in Web Usage Mining to capture similar interests and trends among users accessing a Web site. For this purpose. web access logs generated at a particular web site are preprocessed to discover the user navigational sessions. Clustering techniques are then applied to group the user session data into user session clusters. where intercluster similarities are minimized while the intra cluster similarities are maximized. Since the application of different clustering algorithms generally results in different sets of cluster formation. it is important to evaluate the performance of these methods in terms of accuracy and validity of the clusters. and also the time required to generate them. using appropriate performance measures. This paper describes various validity and accuracy measures including Dunn's Index. Davies Bouldin Index. C Index. Rand Index. Jaccard Index. Silhouette Index. Fowlkes Mallows and Sum of the Squared Error (SSE). We conducted the performance evaluation of the following clustering techniques: k-Means. k-Medoids. Leader.

With the rapid growth in hardware. software and networking technology there is outstanding growth in the amount data collection. Organizations collect huge volumes of data from heterogeneous databases which also contain sensitive and private information about and individual. The data mining extracts novel patterns from such data which can be used in various domains for decision making. The problem with data mining output is that it also reveals some information. which are considered to be private and personal. Easy access to such personal data poses a threat to individual privacy. There has been growing concern about the chance of misusing personal information behind the scene without the knowledge of actual data owner. Privacy is becoming an increasingly important issue in many data mining applications in distributed environment. Privacy preserving data mining technique gives new direction to solve this problem.

To consider the high dimensionality of user session data. we propose a fuzzy approach for assigning weights to user sessions. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) and fuzzy c-medoids (FCMed) algorithms are used to cluster the user sessions.

1087329,A fuzzy approach for feature evaluation and dimensionality reduction to improve the quality of web usage mining results,2015,Zahid Ansari and MF Azeem and A Vinaya Babu and Waseem Ahmed,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.00690,,,,Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to web usage log repositories in order to discover the usage patterns that can be used to analyze the users navigational behavior. During the preprocessing stage. raw web log data is transformed into a set of user profiles. Each user profile captures a set of URLs representing a user session. Clustering can be applied to this sessionized data in order to capture similar interests and trends among users navigational patterns. Since the sessionized data may contain thousands of user sessions and each user session may consist of hundreds of URL accesses. dimensionality reduction is achieved by eliminating the low support URLs. Very small sessions are also removed in order to filter out the noise from the data. But direct elimination of low support URLs and small sized sessions may results in loss of a significant amount of information especially when the count of low support URLs and small sessions is large. We propose a fuzzy solution to deal with this problem by assigning weights to URLs and user sessions based on a fuzzy membership function. After assigning the weights we apply a Fuzzy c-Mean Clustering algorithm to discover the clusters of user profiles. In this paper. we describe our fuzzy set theoretic approach to perform feature selection (or dimensionality reduction) and session weight assignment. Finally we compare our soft computing based approach of dimensionality reduction with the traditional approach of direct elimination of small sessions and low support count URLs. Our results show that fuzzy feature evaluation and dimensionality reduction results in better …,True,CwNpNpAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,13,https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00690,16108272761285268075,/scholar?cites=16108272761285268075,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00690,0,0,0

Queries in Gnutella-like unstructured systems that use flooding or random walk to search must visit O(n) nodes in a network of size n. thus consuming significant amounts of bandwidth. In this paper. we propose a query routing protocol that allows low bandwidth consumption during query forwarding using a low cost mechanism to create and maintain information about nearby objects. To achieve this. our protocol maintains a lightweight probabilistic routing table at each node that suggests the location of each object in the network. Following the corresponding routing table entries. a query can reach the destination in a small number of hops with high probability. However. maintaining routing tables in a large and highly dynamic network requires non-traditional mechanisms.

We design a practical DDoS defense system that can protect the availability of web services during severe DDoS attacks. The basic idea behind our system is to isolate and protect legitimate traffic from a huge volume of DDoS traffic when an attack occurs.

Therefore. by provisioning adequate resource (e.g.. bandwidth) to legitimate traffic separated by this process. we are able to provide adequate service to a large percentage of clients during DDoS attacks.

1087355,Sketch Guided Sampling-Using On-Line Estimates of Flow Size for Adaptive Data Collection.,2006,Abhishek Kumar and Jun (Jim) Xu,,,,,,Monitoring the traffic in high-speed networks is a data intensive problem. Uniform packet sampling is the most popular technique for reducing the amount of data the network monitoring hardware/software has to process. However. uniform sampling captures far less information than can be potentially obtained with the same overall sampling rate. This is because uniform sampling (unnecessarily) draws the vast majority of samples from large flows. and very few from small and medium flows. This information loss on small and medium flows significantly affects the accuracy of the estimation of various network statistics.In this work. we develop a new packet sampling methodology called “sketch-guided sampling”(SGS). which offers better statistics than obtainable from uniform sampling. given the same number of raw samples gathered. Its main idea is to make the probability with which an incoming packet is sampled a decreasing sampling function¢ of the size of the flow the packet belongs to. This way our scheme is able to significantly increase the packet sampling rate of the small and medium flows at slight expense of the large flows. resulting in much more accurate estimations of various network statistics. However. the exact sizes of all flows are available only if we keep per-flow information for every flow. which is prohibitively expensive for highspeed links. Our SGS scheme solves this problem by using a small (lossy) synopsis data structure called counting sketch to encode the approximate sizes of all flows. Our evaluation on real-world Internet traffic traces shows that our sampling theory based the approximate flow size estimates from the …,True,mHwonDEAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,145,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.178&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1732806957184620748,/scholar?cites=1732806957184620748,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.178&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we explore the problem of tuning network configurations in order to mitigate any potential impact due to a planned upgrade which takes the base station off-air. The objective is to recover the loss in service performance or coverage which would have occurred without any modifications. To our knowledge. impact mitigation for planned base station downtimes has not been explored before in the literature. The primary contribution of this work is a proactive approach based on a predictive model that uses operational data of user density distributions and path loss (rather than idealized analytical models of these) to quickly estimate the best power and tilt configuration of neighboring base stations that enables high recovery.

NADV selects neighbors with the optimal trade-off between proximity and link cost. Coupled with the local next hop decision in geographic routing. NADV enables an adaptive and efficient cost-aware routing strategy. Depending on the objective or message priority. applications can use the NADV framework to minimize various types of link cost. We present efficient methods for link cost estimation and perform detailed simulations in diverse scenarios. Our results show that NADV outperforms current schemes in many aspects: for example. in high noise environments with frequent packet losses. the use of NADV leads to 81% higher delivery ratio.

Limited bandwidth and a high degree of mobility require that routing protocols for ad hoc networks be robust. simple. and energy-conserving. This paper proposes a new ad hoc multicast routing protocol called neighbor-supporting multicast protocol (NSMP). NSMP adopts a mesh structure to enhance resilience against mobility.

The absence of a central authorization facility in dynamic and distributed environments requires collaboration among nodes. When a source searches for a route to a destination. an intermediate node can reply with its cached entry. To strengthen correctness of such a routing discovery process. we propose a method in which the intermediate node requests its next hop to send a confirmation message to the source. After receiving both a route reply and confirmation message. the source determines the validity of a path according to its policy. As a result. this strategy discourages malicious nodes from intercepting packets.

Recent approaches have used physical layer confidence estimates or additional error detection codes embedded in each transmission to identify corrupt bits. or have applied forward error correction to repair without such explicit knowledge. In contrast to these approaches. our goal is a practical design that simultaneously:(a) requires no extra bits in correct packets.(b) reduces recovery latency. except in rare instances.(c) remains compatible with existing 802.11 devices by obeying timing and backoff standards. and (d) can be incrementally deployed on widely available access points and wireless cards. In this paper. we design. implement. and evaluate Maranello. a novel partial packet recovery mechanism for 802.11. In Maranello. the receiver computes checksums over blocks in corrupt packets and bundles these checksums into a negative acknowledgment sent when the sender expects to receive an acknowledgment. The sender then retransmits only those blocks for which the checksum is incorrect. and repeats this partial retransmission until it receives an acknowledgment. Successful transmissions are not burdened by additional bits and the receiver needs not infer which bits were corrupted. We implemented Maranello using OpenFWWF (open source firmware for Broadcom wireless cards) and deployed it in a small testbed. We compare Maranello to alternative recovery protocols using a trace-driven simulation and to 802.11 using a live implementation under various channel conditions. To our knowledge.

While there have been notable prior attempts at tackling the challenge with assistance from proxies (cloud). achieving a responsive and energy efficient browsing experience remains an elusive goal.

With the recent WiMAX standard for high-speed. non-line-of-sight fixed wireless links. multihop wireless backhauls might now overcome this bottleneck. However an important remaining challenge is to provide rate and delay guarantees for customer connections similar to wired backhauls. We provide several schemes for performing admission control for connections with QoS requirements over a multihop wireless backhaul.

In this paper. we consider the problem of estimating packet error rate (PER) in wireless networks. Most existing schemes use observed error rates of probe messages as representative packet error rates for wireless links. However. since typical data packets are larger than probe messages. the actual data packet error rate is often higher than the observed error rate of probe messages. Instead of directly using measurement statistics. our approach is to analyze them to determine the link characteristics and estimate the link quality (e.g.. PER) based on the understanding.

Unfortunately. traffic matrices are generally unavailable in large operational IP networks. On the other hand. link load measurements are readily available in IP networks. In this paper. we propose a new method for practical and rapid inference of traffic matrices in IP networks from link load measurements. augmented by readily available network and routing configuration information.

We develop an efficient algorithm for detecting stepping stones by monitoring a site’s Internet access link. The algorithm is based on the distinctive characteristics (packet size. timing) of interactive traffic. and not on connection contents. and hence can be used to find stepping stones even when the traffic is encrypted. We evaluate the algorithm on large Internet access traces and find that it performs quite well. However. the success of the algorithm is tempered by the discovery that large sites have many users who routinely traverse stepping stones for a variety of legitimate reasons.

1087431,On selfish routing in internet-like environments,2003,Lili Qiu and Yang Richard Yang and Yin Zhang and Scott Shenker,,,,151-162,ACM,A recent trend in routing research is to avoid inefficiencies in network-level routing by allowing hosts to either choose routes themselves (eg. source routing) or use overlay routing networks (eg. Detour or RON). Such approaches result in selfish routing. because routing decisions are no longer based on system-wide criteria but are instead designed to optimize host-based or overlay-based metrics.

It is challenging to estimate proximity measures in online social networks due to their massive scale (with millions of users) and dynamic nature (with hundreds of thousands of new nodes and millions of edges added daily). To address this challenge. we develop two novel methods to efficiently and accurately approximate a large family of proximity measures.

In cases where a traffic matrix cannot be measured directly. it may still be estimated from indirect data (such as link measurements). but these estimates contain errors. Yet little thought has been given to the effects of inexact traffic estimates on traffic engineering. In this paper we consider how well traffic engineering works with estimated traffic matrices in the context of a specific task; namely that of optimizing network routing to minimize congestion. measured by maximum link-utilization.

The optimal torque command is directly obtained from the estimated rotor speed for the DTC by which the maximum power point tracking control of the wind turbine generator is achieved without the need for wind speed or rotor position sensors.

Skylines are essentially sets of most interesting (undominated) tuples in a database.

While this marketing technique has been beneficial for advertisers. it has not been shown how the social network providers such as Facebook and Twitter can benefit from it. In this paper. we initiate the study of sponsored viral marketing where a social network provider that has complete knowledge of its network is hired by several advertisers to provide viral marketing. Each advertiser has its own advertising budget and a fixed amount they are willing to pay for each user that adopts their product or shares their ads. The goal of the social network provider is to gain the most revenue from the advertisers.

Regret minimization is an approach for selecting k representative points from a database such that every user's ideal point in the entire database is similar to one of the k points. This approach combines benefits of the methods top-k and skyline; it controls the size of the output but does not require knowledge of users' preferences. Prior work with k-regret queries assumes users' preferences to be modeled by linear utility functions.

However. time-based localization is tightly coupled with clock synchronization. Thus. the reliability of timestamps in time-based localization becomes an important yet challenging task to deal with. In this paper. we propose robust time-based localization strategies to locate a target node with the help of anchors (nodes with known positions) in asynchronous networks. Two kinds of asynchronous networks are considered: one only with clock offsets. labeled quasi-synchronous networks. whereas the other with not only clock offsets but also clock skews. labeled fully asynchronous networks.

In the literature. the perturbation analysis of SVD has been well documented in the context of subspace decomposition. The contribution of the signal subspace to the perturbation of the singular vectors that span the signal subspace is often ignored as it is treated as second and higher order terms. and thus the first-order perturbation is typically given as the column span of the noise subspace. In this correspondence. we show that not only the noise subspace. but also the signal subspace. contribute to the first-order perturbation of the singular vectors. We further show that the contribution of the signal subspace does not impact on the performance analysis of algorithms that rely on the signal subspace for parameter estimation. but it affects the analysis of algorithms that depends on the individual basis vectors.

However. it is also well known that LEs provide inferior performance relative to a maximum-likelihood equalizer (MLE) or other near-MLEs. because LEs usually cannot collect the diversity order enabled by the transmitter and at the same time they lose mutual information. More importantly. unlike MLE or near-MLEs. the performance of LEs has not been well quantified. This hinders more general applications of LEs in wireless systems. In this paper. we reveal a fundamental link between a channel parameter-orthogonality deficiency ( od ) of the channel matrix-and the diversity and capacity of LEs.

A major disadvantage of OFDM is the large dynamic range of its time-domain waveforms. making OFDM vulnerable to nonlinearities (including clipping effects) of the power amplifier (PA) and causing the PA to yield low efficiency on the RF to dc power conversion. A commonly used metric to characterize a signal's dynamic range is the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR). To suppress the nonlinear effects. one may want to reduce the signal PAR. However. this results in the increase of error vector magnitude (EVM). and may violate the spectral mask.

The landmark model does not follow traditional similarity models that rely on pointwise Euclidean distance. Instead. it leads to landmark similarity. a general model of similarity that is consistent with human intuition and episodic memory.

Most previous clustering models have focused on grouping objects with similar values on a (sub)set of dimensions (e.g.. subspace cluster) and assumed that every object has an associated value on every dimension (e.g.. bicluster). These existing cluster models may not always be adequate in capturing coherence exhibited among objects. Strong coherence may still exist among a set of objects (on a subset of attributes) even if they take quite different values on each attribute and the attribute values are not fully specified. This is very common in many applications including bio-informatics analysis as well as collaborative filtering analysis. where the data may be incomplete and subject to biases.

The concept of bicluster was introduced by Cheng and Church (2000) to capture the coherence of a subset of genes and a subset of conditions. A set of heuristic algorithms were also designed to either find one bicluster or a set of biclusters. which consist of iterations of masking null values and discovered biclusters. coarse and fine node deletion. node addition. and the inclusion of inverted data. These heuristics inevitably suffer from some serious drawback.

Much work has been dedicated to supporting basic graph operations such as subgraph matching. reachability. regular expression matching. etc. In many cases. graph indices are employed to speed up query processing. Typically. most indices require either super-linear indexing time or super-linear indexing space. Unfortunately. for very large graphs. super-linear approaches are almost always infeasible. In this paper. we study the problem of subgraph matching on billion-node graphs. We present a novel algorithm that supports efficient subgraph matching for graphs deployed on a distributed memory store. Instead of relying on super-linear indices. we use efficient graph exploration and massive parallel computing for query processing.

But state-of-the-art systems and methods still cannot handle web scale RDF data effectively.

Internet routing. ontology queries based on RDF/OWL. etc. Many applications involve huge graphs and require fast answering of reachability queries. Several reachability labeling methods have been proposed for this purpose. They assign labels to the vertices. such that the reachability between any two vertices may be decided using their labels only. For sparse graphs. 2-hop based reachability labeling schemes answer reachability queries efficiently using relatively small label space.

Quality of service is a major concern in outsourcing. In particular. query integrity. which means that query results returned by the service provider are both correct and complete. must be assured. Previous work requires clients to manage data locally to audit the results sent back by the server. or database engine to be modified for generating authenticated results. In this paper. we introduce a novel integrity audit mechanism that eliminating these costly requirements. In our approach. we insert a small amount of records into an outsourced database so that the integrity of the system can be effectively audited by analyzing the inserted records in the query results. We study both randomized and deterministic approaches for generating the inserted records. as how these records are generated has significant implications for storage and performance.

With the overall increasing number of winter haze days in this period. the 5 decades were divided into three sub-periods based on the changes of winter haze days (WHD) in central North China (30–40° N) and eastern South China (south of 30° N) for east of 109° E mainland China. Results show that WHD kept gradually increasing during 1960–1979. remained stable overall during 1980–1999. and increased fast during 2000–2012.

Among all the possible climate factors. variability of the autumn Arctic sea ice extent. local precipitation and surface wind during winter is most influential to the haze pollution change. The joint effect of fast increase of total energy consumption. rapid decline of Arctic sea ice extent and reduced precipitation and surface winds intensified the haze pollution in central North China after 2000.

1087529,Detecting emotion in music,2003,Tao Li and Mitsunori Ogihara,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,Detection of emotion in music sounds is an important problem in music indexing. This paper studies the problem of identifying emotion in music by sound signal processing. The problem is cast as a multiclass classification problem. decomposed as a multiple binary classification problem. and is resolved with the use of Support Vector Machines trained on the timbral textures. rhythmic contents. and pitch contents extracted from the sound data. Experiments were carried out on a data set consisting of 499 30-second long music sounds over ambient. classical. fusion. and jazz. Classification into the ten adjective groups of Farnsworth (plus three additional groups) as well as classification into six supergroups that are formed by combining these basic groups was attempted.

Most current work assumes that the database is static. and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new database. In this paper. we propose novel techniques for maintaining sequences in the presence of a) database updates. and b) user interaction (eg modifying mining parameters). This is a very challenging task. since such updates can invalidate existing sequences or introduce new ones. In both the above scenarios. we avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset. thereby reducing execution time.

Support vector machines (SVMs) excel at binary classification problems. but the elegant theory behind large-margin hyperplane cannot be easily extended to their multi-class counterparts.

The current algorithms proposed for data mining of association rules make repeated passes over the database to determine the commonly occurring item sets (or set of items). For large databases. the I/O overhead in scanning the database can be extremely high. The authors show that random sampling of transactions in the database is an effective method for finding association rules. Sampling can speed up the mining process by more than an order of magnitude by reducing I/O costs and drastically shrinking the number of transactions to be considered.

Diverse signals such as thrombin. ADP and epinephrine transduce signals through their respective GPCRs to activate protein kinases that ultimately lead to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin αIIbβ3 and augment its function. The signaling pathways that transmit signals from the GPCR to the cytosolic domain of the integrin are not well defined. In an effort to better understand these pathways. we employed a combination of proteomic profiling and computational analyses of isolated human platelets. We analyzed ten independent human samples and identified a total of 1507 unique proteins in platelets. This is the most comprehensive platelet proteome assembled to date and includes 190 membrane-associated and 262 phosphorylated proteins. which were identified via independent proteomic and phospho-proteomic profiling. We used this proteomic dataset to create a platelet protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and applied novel contextual information about the phosphorylation step to introduce limited directionality in the PPI graph. This newly developed contextual PPI network computationally recapitulated an integrin signaling pathway. Most importantly. our approach not only provided insights into the mechanism of integrin αIIbβ3 activation in resting platelets but also provides an improved model for analysis and discovery of PPI dynamics and signaling pathways in the future.,True,vdMVIH4AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,140,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007627,6471123165521566452,/scholar?cites=6471123165521566452,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007627,0,0,0

Not surprisingly. progress in this emerging science is uneven. with a greater volume of empirical studies mounted in the physical health care field than in the fields of mental health. substance use. or social services. due largely to medicine’s early focus on quality of care and. more recently. on comparative effectiveness. However. despite these important scientific efforts. there remains a lack of consensus on methodological approaches to the study of dissemination and implementation processes and especially tests of implementation strategies. 1 To begin to address these deficiencies. this chapter reviews design issues for dissemination and implementation research. and also presents an overview of some of the analytic approaches to dissemination and implementation research. recognizing that this analytic work is still at an early stage of development. Finally. the chapter presents a case study of research that crosses three of four recognized dissemination and implementation phases and illustrates a number of design and analysis issues. Note the following major changes in the 2nd edition as compared with the 1st edition.

In particular. we identify natural complexity classes for which the problems of (a) determining if a system of linear equations is feasible and (b) computing the rank of an integer matrix (as well as other problems) are complete under logspace reductions.¶As an important part of presenting this classification. we show that the ""exact counting logspace hierarchy"" collapses to near the bottom level. We review the definition of this hierarchy below. We further show that this class is closed under NC1-reducibility. and that it consists of exactly those languages that have logspace uniform span programs (introduced by Karchmer and Wigderson) over the rationals.¶In addition. we contrast the complexity of these problems with the complexity of determining if a system of linear equations has an integer solution.

It was observed by Ratnasamy et al. that existing DHT schemes either (a) have a routing table of size /spl Oscr/(log/sub 2/n) and network diameter of /spl Omega/(log/sub 2/n). or (b) have a routing table of size d and network diameter of /spl Omega/(n/sup 1/d/). They asked whether this represents the best asymptotic ""state-efficiency"" tradeoffs. Our first major result is to show that there are straightforward routing algorithms. which achieve better asymptotic tradeoffs.

Probiotics are increasingly used in nutraceuticals. functional foods or in microbial interference treatment. However. the effectiveness of probiotic organism is considered to be population-specific due to variation in gut microflora. food habits and specific host-microbial interactions. Most of the probiotic strains available in the market are of western or European origin. and a strong need for exploring new indigenous probiotic organisms is felt.  Methods and Findings An indigenous isolate Lp9 identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by molecular-typing methods was studied extensively for its functional and probiotic attributes. viz.. acid and bile salt tolerance. cell surface hydrophobicity. autoaggregation and Caco-2 cell-binding as well as antibacterial and antioxidative activities. Lp9 isolate could survive 2 h incubation at pH 1.5–2.0 and toxicity of 1.5–2.0% oxgall bile. Lp9 could deconjugate major bile salts like glycocholate and deoxytaurocholate. indicating its potential to cause hypocholesterolemia. The isolate exhibited cell-surface hydrophobicity of ∼37% and autoaggregation of ∼31%. Presence of putative probiotic marker genes like mucus-binding protein (mub). fibronectin-binding protein (fbp) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) were confirmed by PCR. Presence of these genes suggested the possibility of specific interaction and colonization potential of Lp9 isolate in the gut. which was also suggested by a good adhesion ratio of 7.4±1.3% with Caco-2 cell …,True,gv8xteIAAAAJ:oJBA3oede64C,254,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008099,13521149511343861438,/scholar?cites=13521149511343861438,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008099,0,0,0

A perennial herb belonging to the ginger family. turmeric measures up to 1 m high with a short stem and tufted leaves (Figure 23.1 A). The parts used are the rhizomes. Perhaps the most active component in turmeric is curcumin. which may make up 2 to 5% of the total spice in turmeric (Figure 23.1 B). Curcumin is a diferuloylmethane present in extracts of the plant. Curcuminoids are responsible for the yellow color of turmeric and curry powder. They are derived from turmeric by ethanol extraction. The pure orange-yellow. crystalline powder is insoluble in water. The structure of curcumin (C21H20O6) was first described in 1815 by Vogel and Pellatier and in 1910 was shown to be diferuloylmethane by Lampe et al.[1]. Chemical synthesis in 1913 confirmed its identity [2].Turmeric is widely consumed in the countries of its origin for a variety of uses. including as a dietary spice. a dietary pigment. and an Indian folk medicine for the treatment of various illnesses. It is used in the textile and pharmaceutical industries [3] and in Hindu religious ceremonies in one form or another. Current traditional Indian medicine uses it for biliary disorders. anorexia. cough. diabetic wounds. hepatic disorders. rheumatism. and sinusitis [4]. The old Hindu texts have described it as an aromatic stimulant and carminative [5].

Lipin harboring the fld2j (Gly84 → Arg) mutation exhibited relatively little PAP activity. These results indicate that lipin is a major PAP in vivo and that the loss of PAP activity contributes to the fld phenotype. PAP activity was readily detected in immune complexes of lipin from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. where the protein was found both as a microsomal form and a soluble. more highly phosphorylated. form. Fifteen phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometric analyses. Insulin increased the phosphorylation of multiple sites and promoted a gel shift that was due in part to phosphorylation of Ser106.

Queries in Gnutella-like unstructured systems that use flooding or random walk to search must visit O(n) nodes in a network of size n. thus consuming significant amounts of bandwidth. In this paper. we propose a query routing protocol that allows low bandwidth consumption during query forwarding using a low cost mechanism to create and maintain information about nearby objects. To achieve this. our protocol maintains a lightweight probabilistic routing table at each node that suggests the location of each object in the network. Following the corresponding routing table entries. a query can reach the destination in a small number of hops with high probability.

Providing an accurate list of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) along the forwarding path would make traceroute even more valuable to researchers and network operators. However. conventional approaches to mapping traceroute hops to AS numbers are not accurate enough. Address registries are often incomplete and out-of-date. BGP routing tables provide a better IP-to-AS mapping. though this approach has significant limitations as well. Based on our extensive measurements. about 10% of the traceroute paths have one or more hops that do not map to a unique AS number. and around 15% of the traceroute AS paths have an AS loop.

1087585,BGP routing stability of popular destinations,2002,Jennifer Rexford and Jia Wang and Zhen Xiao and Yin Zhang,,,,197-202,,The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) plays a crucial role in the delivery of traffic in the Internet. Fluctuations in BGP routes cause degradation in user performance. increased processing load on routers. and changes in the distribution of traffic load over the network. Although earlier studies have raised concern that BGP routes change quite often. previous work has not considered whether these routing fluctuations affect a significant portion of the traffic. This paper shows that the small number of popular destinations responsible for the bulk of Internet traffic have remarkably stable BGP routes. The vast majority of BGP instability stems from a small number of unpopular destinations.

ViAggre does not require any changes to router software and routing protocols and can be deployed independently and autonomously by any ISP. ViAggre is effectively a scalability technique that allows an ISP to modify its internal routing such that individual routers in the ISP’s network only maintain a part of the global routing table.We evaluate the application of ViAggre to a few tier-1 and tier-2 ISPs and show that it can reduce the routing table on routers by an order of magnitude while imposing almost no traffic stretch and negligible load increase across the routers. We also deploy Virtual Aggregation on a testbed comprising of Cisco routers and benchmark this deployment. Finally. to understand and address concerns regarding the configuration overhead that our proposal entails. we implement a configuration tool that automates ViAggre configuration. While it remains to be seen whether most. if not all. of the management concerns can be eliminated through such automated tools. we believe that the simplicity of the proposal and its possible short-term impact on routing scalability suggest that it is an alternative worth considering.,True,dWmFNAoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,229,https://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/ballani/ballani.pdf,12572487278135272877,/scholar?cites=12572487278135272877,,https://static.usenix.org/event/nsdi09/tech/full_papers/ballani/ballani.pdf,0,0,0

Our method is motivated by two key observations: when a prefix is not hijacked. 1) the hop count of the path from a source to this prefix is generally stable; and 2) the path from a source to this prefix is almost always a super-path of the path from the same source to a reference point along the previous path. as long as the reference point is topologically close to the prefix.

Despite having poor visibility into these routing changes. operators often need to react quickly by tuning the network configuration to alleviate congestion or by notifying other ASes about serious reachability problems. Fortunately. operators can improve their visibility by monitoring the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) decisions of the routers at the periphery of their AS.

Client programs have to be modified according to these changes in order to use the new APIs. Unlike client programs of a local API. which could continue to use the old API. clients of a web API often do not have the option not to upgrade. since the old version of the API may not be provided as a service anymore. Therefore. migrating clients of web APIs is a more critical task.

However. software-based approaches suffer from high CPU overhead and processing latency; FPGA based platforms are difficult to program and incur high cost; and OpenFlow focuses on control plane functions at present.In this paper. we design a ServerSwitch to address the above problems. ServerSwitch is motivated by the observation that commodity Ethernet switching chips are becoming programmable and that the PCI-E interface provides high throughput and low latency between the server CPU and I/O subsystem.

Recent reports show that most available spectrum has been allocated. While some of the spectrum bands (e.g.. unlicensed band.

This drives the emergence of open spectrum and dynamic spectrum access concepts. which allow unlicensed users equipped with cognitive radios to opportunistically access the spectrum not used by primary users. Cognitive radio has many advanced features. such as agilely sensing the existence of primary users and utilizing multiple spectrum bands simultaneously.

However. standard TCP fails to fully utilize the network capacity due to the limitation in its conservative congestion control (CQ algorithm. Some works have been proposed to improve the connection's throughput by adopting more aggressive loss-based CC algorithms. These algorithms. although can effectively improve the link utilization. have the weakness of poor RTT fairness. Further. they may severely decrease the performance of regular TCP flows that traverse the same network path. On the other hand. pure delay-based approaches that improve the throughput in high-speed networks may not work well when the traffic is mixed with both delaybased and greedy loss-based flows. In this paper. we propose a novel Compound TCP (CTCP) approach. which is a synergy of delay-based and loss-based approach. Specifically. we add a scalable delay-based component into the standard TCP Reno congestion avoidance algorithm (a.k.a.. the loss-based component). The sending rate of CTCP is controlled by both components. This new delay-based component can rapidly increase sending rate when network path is under utilized. but gracefully retreat in a busy network when bottleneck queue is built. Augmented with this delay-based component. CTCP provides very good bandwidth scalability with improved RTT fairness. and at the same time achieves good TCP-fairness. irrelevant to the windows size.

Observing that spectrum resource can be better matched to traffic demand of secondary users with the help of relay node that has rich spectrum resource. in this paper we exploit a new research direction for cognitive radio networks by utilizing cooperative relay to assist the transmission and improve spectrum efficiency. An infrastructure-based secondary network architecture has been proposed to leverage relay-assisted discontiguous OFDM (D-OFDM) for data transmission. In this architecture. relay node will be selected which can bridge the source and the destination using its common channels between …,True,XTlaQMkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,283,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5062156/,7965416709352013498,/scholar?cites=7965416709352013498,,https://repository.ust.hk/ir/bitstream/1783.1-6603/1/cooprelay.pdf,0,0,0
1087671,From QoS to QoE: A tutorial on video quality assessment,2015,Yanjiao Chen and Kaishun Wu and Qian Zhang,17,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,2,1126-1165,IEEE,Quality of experience (QoE) is the perceptual quality of service (QoS) from the users' perspective. For video service. the relationship between QoE and QoS (such as coding parameters and network statistics) is complicated because users' perceptual video quality is subjective and diversified in different environments. Traditionally. QoE is obtained from subjective test. where human viewers evaluate the quality of tested videos under a laboratory environment. To avoid high cost and offline nature of such tests. objective quality models are developed to predict QoE based on objective QoS parameters. but it is still an indirect way to estimate QoE. With the rising popularity of video streaming over the Internet. data-driven QoE analysis models have newly emerged due to availability of large-scale data.

Providing efficient quality of service (QoS) support is essential for such networks. as they need to deliver real-time services like video. audio. and voice over IP besides the traditional data service. Various solutions have been proposed to provide soft QoS over multihop wireless networks from different layers in the network protocol stack.

To reduce this delay. we have developed a fast handoff scheme called Proactive Scan. It employs two new techniques. The first is to decouple the time-consuming channel scan from the actual handoff. and to eliminate channel scan delay by doing scan early and interleaving it with ongoing traffic in a non-intrusive way. The second technique is a smart trigger that takes into account both uplink and downlink quality and explicitly addresses the link asymmetry which has yet not been touched in previous work.

Most widely used unstructured P2P networks rely on central directory servers or massive message flooding. clearly not scalable. Structured overlay networks based on distributed hash tables (DHT) are expected to eliminate flooding and central servers. but can require many long-haul message deliveries.

1087679,Compound TCP: A scalable and TCP-friendly congestion control for high-speed networks,2006,Kun Tan Jingmin Song and Q Zhang and M Sridharan,,Proceedings of PFLDnet 2006,,,,Many applications require fast data transfer over high speed and long distance networks. However. standard TCP fails to fully utilize the network capacity in high-speed and long distance networks due to its conservative congestion control (CC) algorithm. Some works have been proposed to improve the connection’s throughput by adopting more aggressive loss-based CC algorithms. which may severely decrease the throughput of regular TCP flows sharing the network path. On the other hand. pure delay-based approaches may not work well if they compete with loss-based flows. In this paper. we propose a novel Compound TCP (CTCP) approach. which is a synergy of delay-based and loss-based approach. More specifically. we add a scalable delay-based component into the standard TCP Reno congestion avoidance algorithm (aka. the loss-based component). The sending rate of CTCP is controlled by both components. This new delay-based component can rapidly increase sending rate when the network path is under utilized. but gracefully retreat in a busy network when a bottleneck queue is built. Augmented with this delay-based component. CTCP provides very good bandwidth scalability and at the same time achieves good TCP-fairness. We conduct extensive packet level simulations and test our CTCP implementation on the Windows platform over a production high-speed network link in the Microsoft intranet.

In this work. we report the first publicly known experimental and analytical characterization of CMOS image sensors.

Through in situ transmission electron microscopy. we image the real-time formation and evolution of the filament in a silicon oxide resistive switch. The electroforming process is revealed to involve the local enrichment of silicon from the silicon oxide matrix. Semi-metallic silicon nanocrystals with structural variations from the conventional diamond cubic form of silicon are observed. which likely accounts for the conduction in the filament. The growth and shrinkage of the silicon nanocrystals in response to different electrical stimuli show energetically viable transition processes in the silicon forms. offering evidence for the switching mechanism.

The key in such architecture-based maintenance and evolution is to recover software architecture from existing systems. Almost all studies on architecture recovery focus on analyzing the source code and other documents. Such recovered software architecture can hardly capture runtime states and behaviors of the system. At the same time. current work pays little attention on how to change the system directly via manipulating the recovered software architecture.

Interwoven into our daily communications. they have become a ubiquitous new language. However. little has been done to analyze the usage of emojis at scale and in depth. Why do some emojis become especially popular while others don't? How are people using them among the words? In this work. we take the initiative to study the collective usage and behavior of emojis. and specifically. how emojis interact with their context. We base our analysis on a very large corpus collected from a popular emoji keyboard. which contains a full month of inputs from millions of users. Our analysis is empowered by a state-of-the-art machine learning tool that computes the embeddings of emojis and words in a semantic space.

In this work. we propose an efficient FL protocol. which involves a hierarchical aggregation mechanism in the local-area network (LAN) due to its abundant bandwidth and almost negligible monetary cost than WAN. Our proposed FL can accelerate the learning process and reduce the monetary cost with frequent local aggregation in the same LAN and infrequent global aggregation on a cloud across WAN. We further design a concrete FL platform. namely LanFL. that incorporates several key techniques to handle those challenges introduced by LAN: cloud-device aggregation architecture. intra-LAN peer-to-peer (p2p) topology generation. inter-LAN bandwidth capacity heterogeneity. We evaluate LanFL on 2 typical Non-IID datasets. which reveals that LanFL can significantly accelerate FL training (1.5 x-6.0 x). save WAN traffic (18.3 x-75.6 x). and reduce monetary cost (3.8 x-27.2 x) while preserving the model accuracy.,True,hFmJwKQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11612,5138954394783700277,/scholar?cites=5138954394783700277,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11612,0,0,0

In this paper. we propose an approach that guarantees message transmission in minimal time. In this approach. mobile hosts actively modify their trajectories to transmit messages.

Its port-switching based source routing (PSSR) further makes SecondNet applicable to arbitrary network topologies using commodity servers and switches. SecondNet introduces a centralized VDC allocation algorithm for bandwidth guaranteed virtual to physical mapping.

Generally. people have been reluctant to patch their systems immediately. because patches are perceived to be unreliable and disruptive to apply. To address this problem. we propose a first-line worm defense in the network stack. using shields--vulnerability-specific. exploit-generic network filters installed in end systems once a vulnerability is discovered. but before a patch is applied. These filters examine the incoming or outgoing traffic of vulnerable applications. and correct traffic that exploits vulnerabilities.

For many important data-center applications such as MapReduce and Search. this many-to-one traffic pattern is common.

When the IP address of the end host and one of the peers changes. the end host's new IP address can be sent to each neighbor of the peer so that communication between the end host and the peer will not be lost. The order in which the neighbors of the peer are stored can be prioritized for faster delivery of the end host's changed IP address to the peer. The prioritizing can be by available bandwidth of the neighbors. proximity of the neighbors. trust between the peer and its neighbors. the probability that the IP address of the neighbors will change. etc. Proximity of the peers from each other and the end host can be a function of the identifier. which can be generated from a public key.,True,bM44mNEAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,105,https://patents.google.com/patent/US7536467B2/en,3211522448986700043,/scholar?cites=3211522448986700043,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a9/3c/f7/718f182a79fad8/US7536467.pdf,0,0,0

Third. for those segments that are not covered in the first two steps. we use IP traceroute to identify the access routers of those segments.

The repository provides a cyclist with data archiving. retrieval. and visualization services. BikeNet promotes the social networking of the cycling community through the provision of a web portal that facilitates back end sharing of real-time and archived cycling-related data from the repository. Furthermore. we design and build the sensing system to collect the data to feed into this portal. In this paper. we present: a description of the system architecture and implementation; an evaluation of sensing and inferencing that quantifies cyclist performance and the cyclist environment; a study of the potential for data and resource sharing between cyclists en route; a report on networking performance in an environment characterized by bicycle mobility and human unpredictability; as well as describing BikeNet system …,True,IleoLUgAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,257,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.539.3492&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8126338731389215938,/scholar?cites=8126338731389215938,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.539.3492&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In particular. modern image sensors are not energy proportional; for low resolution and low frame rate capture. the image sensor consumes almost the same amount of energy as it does at high resolutions and high frame rates. We reveal two system-level energy proportional mechanisms:(i) using an optimal pixel clock frequency;(ii) entering low power standby mode between frames.

Unfortunately. any change in sensor resolution leads to a substantial pause in frame delivery--as much as 280 ms. Frame delivery is bottlenecked by a sequence of reconfiguration procedures and memory management in current operating systems before it resumes at the new resolution. This latency from reconfiguration impedes the adoption of otherwise beneficial resolution-energy tradeoff mechanisms. We propose Banner as a media framework that provides a rapid sensor resolution reconfiguration service as a modification to common media frameworks. eg. V4L2.

Many researchers advocate pushing processing close to the sensor to substantially reduce data movement. However. continuous near-sensor processing raises the sensor temperature. impairing the fidelity of imaging/vision tasks. We characterize the thermal implications of using 3D stacked image sensors with near-sensor vision processing units. Our characterization reveals that near-sensor processing reduces system power but degrades image quality. For reasonable image fidelity. the sensor temperature needs to stay below a threshold. situationally determined by application needs. Fortunately. our characterization also identifies opportunities--unique to the needs of near-sensor processing--to regulate temperature based on dynamic visual task requirements and rapidly increase capture quality on demand. Based on our characterization. we propose and investigate two thermal management strategies--stop-capture-go and seasonal migration--for imaging-aware thermal management. We present parameters that govern the policy decisions and explore the trade-offs between system power and policy overhead.

WHYPER achieves an average precision of 82.8%. and an average recall of 81.5% for three permissions (address book. calendar. and record audio) that protect frequently used security and privacy sensitive resources.

1087915,Symstra: A framework for generating object-oriented unit tests using symbolic execution,2005,Tao Xie and Darko Marinov and Wolfram Schulte and David Notkin,,,,365-381,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Object-oriented unit tests consist of sequences of method invocations. Behavior of an invocation depends on the method’s arguments and the state of the receiver at the beginning of the invocation. Correspondingly. generating unit tests involves two tasks: generating method sequences that build relevant receiver-object states and generating relevant method arguments. This paper proposes Symstra. a framework that achieves both test generation tasks using symbolic execution of method sequences with symbolic arguments. The paper defines symbolic states of object-oriented programs and novel comparisons of states. Given a set of methods from the class under test and a bound on the length of sequences. Symstra systematically explores the object-state space of the class and prunes this exploration based on the state comparisons.

Modelbased testing is a popular and important testing approach that operates on a model of an app’s behavior. However. such a model is often not available or of insufficient quality. To address this issue. we present a novel grey-box approach for automatically extracting a model of a given mobile app. In our approach. static analysis extracts the set of events supported by the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the app. Then dynamic crawling reverse-engineers a model of the app. by systematically exercising these events on the running app. We also present a tool implementing this approach for the Android platform.

To address the space-explosion issue in path exploration. we propose a novel approach called Fitnex. a search strategy that uses state-dependent fitness values (computed through a fitness function) to guide path exploration.

Since current approaches focus their analyses on the types of security-sensitive resources being accessed (e.g.. network). these evasive techniques in malware make differentiating between malicious and benign app behaviors a difficult task during app analysis. We propose that the malicious and benign behaviors within apps can be differentiated based on the contexts that trigger security-sensitive behaviors. i.e.. the events and conditions that cause the security-sensitive behaviors to occur.

First. some branches involve complex program logics and generating tests to cover them requires deep knowledge of the program structure and semantics.

1087924,Rostra: A framework for detecting redundant object-oriented unit tests,2004,Tao Xie and D Notkin and D Marinov,,,,196-205,IEEE,Object-oriented unit tests consist of sequences of method invocations. Behavior of an invocation depends on the state of the receiver object and method arguments at the beginning of the invocation. Existing tools for automatic generation of object-oriented test suites. such as Jtest and J Crasher for Java. typically ignore this state and thus generate redundant tests that exercise the same method behavior. which increases the testing time without increasing the ability to detect faults.

Through the design of Epsilon. we identify and tackle several technique challenges. In particular. we establish and experimentally verify the optical channel model for localization.

1087938,Walkie-Markie: Indoor pathway mapping made easy,2013,Guobin Shen and Zhuo Chen and Peichao Zhang and Thomas Moscibroda and Yongguang Zhang,,,,85-98,,We present Walkie-Markie–an indoor pathway mapping system that can automatically reconstruct internal pathway maps of buildings without any a-priori knowledge about the building. such as the floor plan or access point locations. Central to Walkie-Markie is a novel exploitation of the WiFi infrastructure to define landmarks (WiFi-Marks) to fuse crowdsourced user trajectories obtained from inertial sensors on users’ mobile phones. WiFi-Marks are special pathway locations at which the trend of the received WiFi signal strength changes from increasing to decreasing when moving along the pathway. By embedding these WiFi-Marks in a 2D plane using a newly devised algorithm and connecting them with calibrated user trajectories. Walkie-Markie is able to infer pathway maps with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that Walkie-Markie is able to reconstructa high-quality pathway map for a real office-building floor after only 5-6 rounds of walks. with accuracy gradually improving as more user data becomes available. The maximum discrepancy between the inferred pathway map and the real one is within 3m and 2.8 m for the anchor nodes and path segments. respectively.,True,egm70s0AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,335,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/shen,10345683009511525883,/scholar?cites=10345683009511525883,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final130.pdf,0,0,0

However. cover query. which is to find all the ranges currently in the system that cover a given key. is rarely touched. In this paper. we first identify that cover query is a highly desired functionality by some popular P2P applications. and then propose distributed segment tree (DST). a layered DHT structure that incorporates the concept of segment tree. Due to the intrinsic capability of segment tree in maintaining the sturcture of ranges. DST is shown to be very efficient for supporting both range query and cover query in a uniform way. It also possesses excellent parallelizability in query operations and can achieve O (1) complexity for moderate query ranges. To balance the load among DHT nodes. we design a downward load stripping mechanism that controls tradeoffs between load and performance.

In this paper. we propose a novel HTTP-based Peer-to-Peer (HPTP) framework to relieve this tension. The key idea is to exploit the widely deployed web cache proxies of ISPs to trick them to cache P2P traffic. This is achieved via a process we refer to as “HTTPifying”: we segment (if necessary) large P2P files or streams into smaller chunks. encapsulate and transport them using the HTTP protocol so that they are cacheable. We outline the design of several key tools of the proposed HPTP framework–HTTPifying. cache detection and usability test tools. and describe a cache-aware tree construction (CATC) protocol for delivering P2P streaming traffic as an example to showcase the HPTP framework. Simulation results demonstrate that HPTP can lead to significant performance improvement.

The system implements a technique that enables the GPU to perform motion estimation for video encoding. The technique allows the GPU to perform a motion estimation process in parallel with the video encoding process performed by the CPU. The performance of video encoding using such a system is greatly accelerated as compared to encoding using just the CPU. Also. data related to motion estimation is arranged and provided to the GPU in a way that utilizes the capabilities of the GPU. Data about video frames may be collocated to enable multiple channels of the GPU to process tasks in parallel.

1087981,Solving QBF with combined conjunctive and disjunctive normal form,2006,Lintao Zhang,21,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,1,143,Menlo Park. CA; Cambridge. MA; London; AAAI Press; MIT Press; 1999,Similar to most state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. all contemporary Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) solvers require inputs to be in the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Most of them also store the QBF in CNF internally for reasoning. In order to use these solvers. arbitrary Boolean formulas have to be transformed into equi-satisfiable formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form by introducing additional variables. In this paper. we point out an inherent limitation of this approach. namely the asymmetric treatment of satisfactions and conflicts. This deficiency leads to artificial increase of search space for QBF solving. To overcome the limitation. we propose to transform a Boolean formula into a combination of an equisatisfiable CNF formula and an equi-tautological DNF formula for QBF solving.

1087982,Searching for truth: techniques for satisfiability of boolean formulas,2003,Lintao Zhang,,,,,,The problem of determining whether a propositional Boolean formula can be true is called the Boolean Satisfiability Problem or SAT. SAT is an important and widely studied problem in computer science. In practice. SAT is a core problem in many applications such as Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This thesis investigates various problems in the design and implementation of SAT solvers.Even though researchers have been studying SAT solving algorithms for a long time. efforts were mainly concentrated on improving the algorithms to prune search spaces. In this thesis. the implementation issues of SAT solvers are studied and some of the most widely used techniques are quantitatively evaluated.

1088005,Semantic streams: A framework for composable semantic interpretation of sensor data,2006,Kamin Whitehouse and Feng Zhao and Jie Liu,,,,5-20,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,We present a framework called Semantic Streams that allows users to pose declarative queries over semantic interpretations of sensor data. For example. instead of querying raw magnetometer data. the user queries whether vehicles are cars or trucks; the system decides which sensor data and which operations to use to infer the type of vehicle. The user can also place constraints on values such as the the amount of energy consumed or the confidence with which the vehicles are classified. We demonstrate how this system can be used on a network of video. magnetometer. and infrared break beam sensors deployed in a parking garage with three simultaneous and independent users.,True,4C46Y8EAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,260,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11669463_4,8004051003312663802,/scholar?cites=8004051003312663802,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.110.5159&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This paper introduces a novel iterative method ILS for node localization starting with a relatively small number of anchor nodes in a large network. At each iteration. nodes are localized using a least-squares based algorithm. The computation is lightweight. fast. and any-time. To prevent error from propagating and accumulating during the iteration. the error control mechanism of the algorithm uses an error registry to select nodes that participate in the localization. based on their relative contribution to the localization accuracy. Simulation results have shown that the active selection strategy significantly mitigates the effect of error propagation.

Furthermore. stale QoS state information causes the performance of these QoS routing schemes to degrade drastically. In order to circumvent these problems. we focus on localized QoS routing schemes where the edge routers make routing decisions using only local information and thus reducing the overhead at core routers.

Furthermore. stale QoS state information causes the performance of these QoS routing schemes to degrade drastically. In order to circumvent these problems. we focus on localized QoS routing schemes where the edge routers make routing decisions using only local information and thus reducing the overhead at core routers.

Commonly deployed link state routing protocols such as OSPF react to link failures through global link state advertisements and routing table recomputations causing significant forwarding discontinuity after a failure. Careful tuning of various parameters to accelerate routing convergence may cause instability when the majority of failures are transient. To enhance failure resiliency without jeopardizing routing stability. we propose a local rerouting based approach called failure insensitive routing. The proposed approach prepares for failures using interface-specific forwarding. and upon a failure. suppresses the link state advertisement and instead triggers local rerouting using a backwarding table.

A number of researchers have considered transmitting stored video from server to a client using smoothing algorithms to reduce this rate variability. These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities and determine a ""smooth"" rate transmission schedule. while ensuring that a client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. We investigate how video smoothing impacts the statistical multiplexing gains available with such traffic. and we show that a significant amount of statistical multiplexing gains can still be achieved.

We observe that for a majority of these traces. the (second-order) scaling exponents at small time scales (1 ms - 100 ms) are fairly close to 0.5. indicating that traffic fluctuations at these time scales are (nearly) uncorrelated. In addition. the traces manifest mostly monofractal behaviors at small time scales. The objective of the paper is to understand the potential causes or factors that influence the small-time scalings of Internet backbone traffic via empirical data analysis.

Commonly deployed link state routing protocols such as OSPF react to link failures through global (i.e.. network-wide) link state advertisements and routing table recomputations. causing significant forwarding discontinuity after a failure.

1088050,Community preserving network embedding,2017,Xiao Wang and Peng Cui and Jing Wang and Jian Pei and Wenwu Zhu and Shiqiang Yang,31,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,,,Network embedding. aiming to learn the low-dimensional representations of nodes in networks. is of paramount importance in many real applications. One basic requirement of network embedding is to preserve the structure and inherent properties of the networks. While previous network embedding methods primarily preserve the microscopic structure. such as the first-and second-order proximities of nodes. the mesoscopic community structure. which is one of the most prominent feature of networks. is largely ignored. In this paper. we propose a novel Modularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (M-NMF) model to incorporate the community structure into network embedding. We exploit the consensus relationship between the representations of nodes and community structure. and then jointly optimize NMF based representation learning model and modularity based community detection model in a unified framework. which enables the learned representations of nodes to preserve both of the microscopic and community structures. We also provide efficient updating rules to infer the parameters of our model. together with the correctness and convergence guarantees.

The probing tool enables network QoS probing between peers that connect through a network address translator. The list of peers to probe is provided by a connection server based on prior probe results and an estimate of the network condition. The list includes those peers which are predicted to have the best QoS with the requesting peer. Once the list is obtained. the requesting peer probes the actual QoS to each peer on the list. and returns these results to the connection server. P2P probing in parallel using a modified packet-pair scheme is utilized. If anomalous results are obtained. a hop-by-hop probing scheme is utilized to determine the QoS of each link.

To this end. we identify a shared-most OS model for multiple coherence domains: creating per-domain instances of core OS services with no shared state. while enabling other extended OS services to share state across domains. To test the model. we build K2. a prototype OS on the TI OMAP4 SoC. by reusing most of the Linux 3.4 source.

1088072,SmartAds: bringing contextual ads to mobile apps,2013,Suman Nath and Felix Xiaozhu Lin and Lenin Ravindranath and Jitendra Padhye,,,,111-124,ACM,A recent study showed that while US consumers spent 30% more time on mobile apps than on traditional web. advertisers spent 1600% less money on mobile ads. One key reason is that unlike most web ad providers. today's mobile ads are not contextual---they do not take into account the content of the page they are displayed on. Thus. most mobile ads are irrelevant to what the user is interested in. For example. it is not uncommon to see gambling ads being displayed in a Bible app. This irrelevance results in low clickthrough rates. and hence advertisers shy away from the mobile platform. Using data from top 1200 apps in Windows Phone marketplace. and a one-week trace of ad keywords from Microsoft's ad network. we show that content displayed by mobile apps is a potential goldmine of keywords that advertisers are interested in.,True,f6FFhS8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,71,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2462456.2464452,10411440328280265861,/scholar?cites=10411440328280265861,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.352.5363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

It allows mobile devices to fetch remote resources easily. Unfortunately. the increasing demand of the mobility brings many new wireless management challenges such as security. energy-saving and location-awareness.

Limited by technics and tools. we rely on the census to obtain this information in the past. which is coarse and costly. The popularity of mobile phones gives us a new opportunity to investigate population estimation. However. real-time and accurate population estimation is still a challenging problem because of the coarse localization and complicated user behaviors. With the help of the passively collected human mobility and locations from the mobile networks including call detail records and mobility management signals. we develop a bimodal model beyond the prior work to better estimate real-time population distribution at metropolitan scales. We discuss how the estimation interval. space granularity. and data type will influence the estimation accuracy. and find the data collected from the mobility management signals with the 30 min estimation interval performs better which reduces the population estimation error by 30% in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

1088161,Epsilon: A Visible Light Based Positioning System,2014,Liqun Li and Pan Hu and Chunyi Peng and Guobin Shen and Feng Zhao,,,,,USENIX,Exploiting the increasingly wide use of Light-emitting Diode (LED) lighting. in this paper. we study the problem of using visible LED lights for accurate localization. The basic idea is to leverage the existing lighting infrastructure and apply trilateration to localize any devices with light sensing capability (eg. a smartphone). using LED lamps as anchors. Through the design of Epsilon. we identify and tackle several technique challenges. In particular. we establish and experimentally verify the optical channel model for localization. We adopt BFSK and channel hopping to enable reliable location beaconing from multiple. uncoordinated light sources over the shared optical medium. We handle realistic situations towards robust localization. for example. we exploit user involvement to resolve the ambiguity in case of insufficient LED anchors. We have implemented the Epsilon system and evaluated it with a small scale hardware testbed as well as moderate-size simulations. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of Epsilon: the 90th percentile accuracies are 0.4 m. 0.7 m and 0.8 m for three typical office environments. Even in the extreme situation with a single light. the 90th percentile accuracy is 1.1 m.

Future networks must schedule delay-tolerant software updates. data backup. and other transfers from IoT devices while maintaining strict service guarantees for conventional real-time applications such as voice-calling and video. This problem is extremely challenging because conventional traffic is highly dynamic across space and time. so its performance is significantly impacted if all IoT traffic is scheduled immediately when it originates. In this paper. we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based scheduler that can dynamically adapt to traffic variation. and to various reward functions set by network operators. to optimally schedule IoT traffic. Using 4 weeks of real network data from downtown Melbourne.

Most backscatter protocols operate in a sequential TDMA-like manner due to the fact that most nodes cannot overhear each other's transmissions. which is detrimental for throughout and energy consumption. Recent efforts to separate concurrent signals by inverting a system of linear equations is also problematic due to varying channel coefficients caused by system and environmental dynamics. In this paper. we introduce BST. a novel physical layer for backscatter communication that enables concurrent transmission by leveraging intra-bit multiplexing of OOK signals from multiple tags.

Wireless networks strive to avoid scheduling multiple transmissions at the same time in order to prevent interference. This paper adopts the opposite approach; it encourages strategically picked senders to interfere. Instead of forwarding packets. routers forward the interfering signals. The destination leverages network-level information to cancel the interference and recover the signal destined to it. The result is analog network coding because it mixes signals not bits.So. what if wireless routers forward signals instead of packets? Theoretically. such an approach doubles the capacity of the canonical 2-way relay network. Surprisingly. it is also practical.

Although the scheduler delivers opportunistic gains. it misses some of the inherent features of the 802.11 MAC. For example. it prevents spatial reuse and thus may underutilize the wireless medium. It also eliminates the layering abstraction. making the protocol less amenable to extensions to alternate traffic types such as multicast.This paper presents MORE. a MAC-independent opportunistic routing protocol.

Our key conceptual contribution is a principled refactoring of wireless protocols into processing and decision planes. The processing plane includes directed graphs of algorithmic actions (eg. 54Mbps OFDM WiFi or special encoding for video). The decision plane contains the logic which dictates which directed graph is used for a particular packet (eg. picking between data and video graphs). The decoupling provides a declarative interface to program the platform while hiding all underlying complexity of execution. An operator only expresses decision plane rules and corresponding processing plane action graphs to assemble a protocol.

Sophisticated relaying strategies at the physical layer have been developed for a single flow. but multiple flows are typically handled by time sharing the channel between the flows at the network level.

1088209,Pinpoint: Localizing interfering radios,2013,Kiran Joshi and Steven Hong and Sachin Katti,,,,241-253,,This paper presents PinPoint. a technique for localizing rogue interfering radios that adhere to standard protocols in the inhospitable ISM band without any cooperation from the interfering radio. PinPoint is designed to be incrementally deployed on top of existing 802.11 WLAN infrastructure. and used by network administrators to identify and troubleshoot sources of interference which may be disrupting the network. PinPoint’s key contribution is a novel algorithm that accurately computes the line of sight angle of arrival (AoA) and cyclic signal strength indicator (CSSI) of the target interfering signal at all APs. even when the line of sight (LoS) component is buried by stronger multipath components. interference and noise. PinPoint leverages this algorithm to design an optimization technique. which can localize interfering radios and simultaneously identify the type of interference. Unlike several localization techniques which require extensive pre-deployment calibration (eg RF-Fingerprinting). PinPoint requires very little calibration by the network administrator. and uses a novel algorithm to self-initialize its bearings. even if the locations of some AP are initially unknown and are oriented randomly. We implement PinPoint on WARP software radios and deploy in an indoor testbed spanning an entire floor of our department. We compare PinPoint with the best known prior RSSI [8. 11] and MUSIC-AoA based approaches and show that PinPoint achieves a median localization error of 0. 97 meters. which is around three times lower compared to the RSSI [8. 11] and MUSIC-AoA based approaches.,True,cc4Qi_IAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,162,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/joshi,17705495955410190551,/scholar?cites=17705495955410190551,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final180.pdf,0,0,0

This cable significantly limits the player’s mobility and. hence. her VR experience. The high data rate requirement of this link (multiple Gbps) precludes its replacement by WiFi. Thus. in this paper. we focus on using mmWave technology to deliver multi-Gbps wireless communication between VR headsets and their game consoles. We address the two key problems that prevent existing mmWave links from being used in VR systems. First. mmWave signals suffer from a blockage problem. ie. they operate mainly in line-of-sight and can be blocked by simple obstacles such as the player lifting her hand in front of the headset. Second. mmWave radios use highly directional antennas with very narrow beams; they work only when the transmitter’s beam is aligned with the receiver’s beam. Any small movement of the headset can break the alignment and stall the data stream. We present MoVR. a novel system that allows mmWave links to sustain high data rates even in the presence of a blockage and mobility. MoVR does this by introducing a smart mmWave mirror and leveraging VR headset tracking information.

1088233,QualComp: a new lossy compressor for quality scores based on rate distortion theory,2013,Idoia Ochoa and Himanshu Asnani and Dinesh Bharadia and Mainak Chowdhury and Tsachy Weissman and Golan Yona,14,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-16,BioMed Central,Next Generation Sequencing technologies have revolutionized many fields in biology by reducing the time and cost required for sequencing. As a result. large amounts of sequencing data are being generated. A typical sequencing data file may occupy tens or even hundreds of gigabytes of disk space. prohibitively large for many users. This data consists of both the nucleotide sequences and per-base quality scores that indicate the level of confidence in the readout of these sequences. Quality scores account for about half of the required disk space in the commonly used FASTQ format (before compression). and therefore the compression of the quality scores can significantly reduce storage requirements and speed up analysis and transmission of sequencing data. In this paper. we present a new scheme for the lossy compression of the quality scores. to address the problem of storage. Our framework allows the user to specify the rate (bits per quality score) prior to compression. independent of the data to be compressed. Our algorithm can work at any rate. unlike other lossy compression algorithms. We envisage our algorithm as being part of a more general compression scheme that works with the entire FASTQ file. Numerical experiments show that we can achieve a better mean squared error (MSE) for small rates (bits per quality score) than other lossy compression schemes. For the organism PhiX. whose assembled genome is known and assumed to be correct. we show that it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in size with little compromise in performance on downstream applications (e.g.. alignment).

Meanwhile. there is a growing concern that individual trajectories can be de-anonymized when the data is shared. using information from external sources (eg online social networks). To understand this risk. prior works either estimate the theoretical privacy bound or simulate de-anonymization attacks on synthetically created (small) datasets. However. it is not clear how well the theoretical estimations are preserved in practice.In this paper. we collected a large-scale ground-truth trajectory dataset from 2.161.500 users of a cellular network. and two matched external trajectory datasets from a large social network (56.683 users) and a check-in/review service (45.790 users) on the same user population. The two sets of large ground-truth data provide a rare opportunity to extensively evaluate a variety of de-anonymization algorithms (7 in total). We find that their performance in the real-world dataset is far from the theoretical bound. Further analysis shows that most algorithms have underestimated the impact of spatio-temporal mismatches between the data from different sources. and the high sparsity of user generated data also contributes to the underperformance. Based on these insights. we propose 4 new algorithms that are specially designed to tolerate spatial or temporal mismatches (or both) and model user behavior.

There is a typical scenario that two interaction domains (location based check-in service. for example) combine data to perform the cross-domain location recommendation task. Existing approaches are based on the assumption that the interaction data from the auxiliary domain can be directly shared across domains. However. such an assumption is not reasonable. since in the real world those domains may be operated by different companies. Therefore. directly sharing raw data may violate business privacy policy and increase the risk of privacy leakage since the user-location interaction records are very sensitive.In this paper. we propose a framework named privacy-preserving …,True,PNbioq0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,13,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3314398,3523204156828961383,/scholar?cites=3523204156828961383,,,0,0,0

Knowing when and where certain apps are used is instrumental for app developers to improve app usability and for Internet service providers (ISPs) to optimize their network services.

PinPoint is designed to be incrementally deployed on top of existing 802.11 WLAN infrastructure. and used by network administrators to identify and troubleshoot sources of interference which may be disrupting the network. PinPoint’s key contribution is a novel algorithm that accurately computes the line of sight angle of arrival (AoA) and cyclic signal strength indicator (CSSI) of the target interfering signal at all APs. even when the line of sight (LoS) component is buried by stronger multipath components. interference and noise. PinPoint leverages this algorithm to design an optimization technique. which can localize interfering radios and simultaneously identify the type of interference. Unlike several localization techniques which require extensive pre-deployment calibration (eg RF-Fingerprinting). PinPoint requires very little calibration by the network administrator. and uses a novel algorithm to self-initialize its bearings. even if the locations of some AP are initially unknown and are oriented randomly. We implement PinPoint on WARP software radios and deploy in an indoor testbed spanning an entire floor of our department. We compare PinPoint with the best known prior RSSI [8. 11] and MUSIC-AoA based approaches and show that PinPoint achieves a median localization error of 0. 97 meters. which is around three times lower compared to the RSSI [8. 11] and MUSIC-AoA based approaches.,True,W7HIfQ4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,162,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/joshi,17705495955410190551,/scholar?cites=17705495955410190551,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final180.pdf,0,0,0

SpotOn does not require any software or hardware modifications at the access points or the radio that needs to be located. Thus. SpotOn presents a case for widely deployable indoor localization system. SpotOn requires just a WiFi radio to be present on the target device to be located and can accurately localize even when the target device is stationary. This expands the application scenarios of SpotOn indoor localization system beyond localizing mobile devices carried by humans. SpotOn achieves localization using Channel State Information (CSI) calculated for each packet during regular WiFi OFDM communication.

Cognitive Radio has become an important research area in the field of wireless communications. It can play an important role in dynamic spectrum management and interference identification. There are many spectrum sensing techniques proposed in literature for cognitive radio. but all those techniques detect only presence or absence of the primary user in the designated band and do not give any information about the used modulation scheme. In certain applications. in cognitive radio receiver. it is necessary to identify the modulation type of the signal so that the receiver parameters can be adjusted accordingly. Most of the modulated signals exhibit the property of Cyclostationarity that can be used for the purpose of correct detection of primary user and the modulation type. In this paper. we have proposed an enhanced signal detection algorithm for cognitive radio receiver which makes use of cyclostationarity property of the modulated signal to exactly detect. the modulation type of the received signal using a trained neural network. The algorithm gives better accuracy of signal detection even in low SNR conditions. The use of a trained neural network makes it more flexible and extendible for future applications,True,W7HIfQ4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/63905357/36_1Aug18_15Apr_12697_Enhanced_Signal.doc_edit_mita20200713-25714-d2ciyy.pdf,8047518608051961493,/scholar?cites=8047518608051961493,,https://www.academia.edu/download/63905357/36_1Aug18_15Apr_12697_Enhanced_Signal.doc_edit_mita20200713-25714-d2ciyy.pdf,0,0,0
1088273,Co-operative communication with SNR weighted algorithm in cognitive radios,2015,Ranjana Bhanage and Sheetal Borde and Kalyani Joshi,,,,1-4,IEEE,Nowadays wireless networks are regulated by fixed spectrum access policy. But all the fixed assigned spectrums are not utilized fully at all times. At the same time frequency spectrum need has increased drastically as the spectrum is being used for different multimedia applications with voice communication. It gives rise to a need to dynamically access the available frequency spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) is the intelligent technology which can sense vacant frequency spectrum i.e. the spectrum not being used by licensed users at the time when CR requires it. So sensing vacant channel is very important in CR technology. Sometimes due to fading and shadowing effects single CR user can't detect the presence of licensed (Primary) user. Co-operative spectrum sensing helps in improving the sensing process and getting more reliable results.

In such a case. keeping a single round trip time (RTT) estimator for a multi-path flow is insufficient as each path may experience different round trip times. To solve this problem. it has been proposed to use multiple RTT estimators to predict network condition. In this paper. we examine an alternative approach to this problem.

However. a number of challenges. including energy efficiency and training data acquisition. must be addressed before unobtrusive audio sensing is practical on mobile devices. We built SpeakerSense. a speaker identification prototype that uses a heterogeneous multi-processor hardware architecture that splits computation between a low power processor and the phone’s application processor to enable continuous background sensing with minimal power requirements.

1088339,A dual-space approach to tracking and sensor management in wireless sensor networks,2002,Jie Liu and Patrick Cheung and Feng Zhao and Leonidas Guibas,,,,131-139,ACM,Wireless ad hoc sensor networks have the advantage of spanning a large geographical region and being able to collaboratively detect and track non-local spatio-temporal events. This paper presents a dual-space approach to event tracking and sensor resource management in sensor networks. The dual-space transformation maps a non-local phenomenon. eg. the edge of a half-plane shadow. to a single point in the dual space. and maps locations of distributed sensor nodes to a set of lines that partitions the dual space. The detection problem becomes finding and tracking the cell that contains the point in the arrangement defined by these lines. This mechanism can be effectively used for power management of the sensor network-nodes that will not be immediately visited by an event can be turned off to save energy required for sensing. processing. and communication.

Programming embedded systems with multiple reactive tasks is difficult due to the complex nature of managing the concurrency of execution threads and consistency of shared states. This paper describes a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous model (TinyGALS) for programming event-driven embedded systems.

As payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction. the channel eventually becomes depleted and cannot support further payments in that direction; hence. naive routing schemes like shortest-path routing can deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system. Today’s PCNs also route payments atomically. worsening the problem. In this paper. we present Spider. a routing solution that"" packetizes"" transactions and uses a multi-path transport protocol to achieve high-throughput routing in PCNs. Packetization allows Spider to complete even large transactions on low-capacity payment channels over time. while the multi-path congestion control protocol ensures balanced utilization of channels and fairness across flows. Extensive simulations comparing Spider with state-of-the-art approaches shows that Spider requires less than 25% of the funds to successfully route over 95% of transactions on balanced traffic demands. and offloads 4x more transactions onto the PCN on imbalanced demands.",True,AUOr90cAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,58,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/sivaraman,12367967415074081585,/scholar?cites=12367967415074081585,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20-paper-sivaraman.pdf,0,0,0

Our previous work NFC-wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) proves that the generated NFC signal from an NFC enabled phone can power a tag (NFC-WISP) with display and sensing capabilities in addition to identification. However. accurately aligning and placing the NFC tag’s antenna to ensure the high power delivery efficiency and communication performance is very challenging for the users. In addition. the performance of the NFC tag is not only range and alignment sensitive but also is a function of its run-time load impedance. This makes the execution of power-hungry tasks on an NFC tag (like the NFC-WISP) very challenging. Therefore. we explore a low-cost tag antenna design to achieve higher power delivered to the load (PDL) by utilizing two different antenna configurations (2-coil/3-coil). The two types of antenna configurations can be used to dynamically adapt to the requirements of varied range. alignment and load impedance in real-time. therefore. we achieve continuous high PDL and reliable communication.

The battery life of wearable camera systems (such as Google Glass. or Snap Spectacles) is under an hour when capturing video. Similarly. due to power requirements. wireless cameras (such as surveillance and monitoring cameras) are either battery-powered and require very frequent recharge. or must be plugged in. which increases cost and decreases reliability (since the camera can be disabled by attacking its power supply). In addition. power wires limit wireless camera deployment to places that have access to power lines. Existing approaches to wireless camera design optimize the camera and communication modules individually to minimize their power consumption. However. designing a wireless camera device requires power consuming hardware components and computationally intensive compression blocks (CODECs) that interface the camera and the communication modules.

1088411,Far Field Energy Harvesting and Backscatter Communication,2018,Saman Naderiparizi and Aaron N Parks and Zerina Kapetanovic and Joshua R Smith,,Recent Wireless Power Transfer Technologies via Radio Waves,,143,River Publishers,The energy efficiency of computing has been improving exponentially for the last 70 years. In fact. today’s microelectronics are about one trillion times more energy efficient than early computers such as the Eniac [1. 2]. Around the early 2000s. this trend in energy efficiency made it possible to power general purpose microcontrollers and low-power sensors using only propagating radio waves [3–5]. Compared to other ways of delivering or collecting power. RF harvesting has the benefit of only requiring an antenna for transduction. which connected devices generally already contain; other forms of energy harvesting require non-standard materials and components. such as photovoltaic cells. thermoelectric junctions. or mechanical generators. not just ordinary conductors and semiconductors. Compared to solar. thermal or vibration harvesting. ambient RF energy harvesting has an added advantage in that it typically does not have any downtime. which in turn can allow low-power ambient RF harvesting devices to be made battery-free. One of the most commonly observed uses of RF energy harvesting is in RFID systems. RFID tags. generally used in inventory management systems. consist of a low-cost printed antenna and an RF-powered communication IC. Readers. or interrogators. power up the tags and communicate with them. usually transferring simple information such as the ID number of the tag. RFID has not found widespread use beyond what essentially constitutes,True,cqtpVYkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=b_9tDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA143&dq=info:sDQqk8OZml0J:scholar.google.com&ots=YAv8m5NW0A&sig=d0TuqVdLcDAiGQaJkbjP3xacCoY,,,,,0,0,0

SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes. yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First. SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second. it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path.

Specifically. we show that it is possible to design devices and WiFi APs such that the WiFi AP in the process of transmitting data to normal WiFi clients can decode backscatter signals which the devices generate by modulating information on to the ambient WiFi transmission. We show via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and 1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters.

This paper shows we can. we present the design and implementation ofWiDeo. a novel system that enables accurate. high resolution. device free human motion tracing in indoor environments using WiFi signals and compact WiFi radios. The insight behind WiDeo is to mine the backscatter reflections from the environment that WiFi transmissions naturally produce to trace where reflecting objects are located and how they are moving. We invent novel backscatter measurement techniques that work in spite of the low bandwidth and dynamic range of WiFi radios. new algorithms that separate out the moving backscatter from the clutter that static reflectors produce and then trace the original motion that produced the backscatter in spite of the fact that it could have undergone multiple reflections.

Localizing IoT devices using existing ubiquitous WiFi infrastructure enables rapid and universal deployment of IoT devices empowered with localization service. However. current WiFi-based localization systems require the target. that needs to be localized. to be equipped with a WiFi radio that actively transmits WiFi signals.

In recent years radio frequency (RF) hardware has become more widely available. for example. many cars are equipped with a RADAR. and almost every home has a WiFi device. In the context of imaging. RF spectrum holds many advantages compared to visible light systems. In particular. in this regime. EM energy effectively interacts in different ways with matter. This property allows for many novel applications such as privacy preserving computer vision and imaging through absorbing and scattering materials in visible light such as walls. Here. we expand many of the concepts in computational photography in visible light to RF cameras. The main limitation of imaging with RF is the large wavelength that limits the imaging resolution when compared to visible light. However. the output of RF cameras is usually processed by computer vision and perception algorithms which would benefit from multi-modal sensing of the environment. and from sensing in situations in which visible light systems fail.

Existing research has attempted to develop explanation techniques to provide interpretable explanations for each classification decision. Unfortunately. current methods are optimized for non-security tasks (eg. image analysis). Their key assumptions are often violated in security applications. leading to a poor explanation fidelity. In this paper. we propose LEMNA. a high-fidelity explanation method dedicated for security applications. Given an input data sample. LEMNA generates a small set of interpretable features to explain how the input sample is classified.

We look at the performance of time-dependent pricing on a large scale cellular network comprising ten thousand base stations. Our investigation reveals two important observations. First. time-dependent pricing performs well in reducing the peak-average ratio of the overall traffic of the network. However. the single price used by the network does not achieve good performance when we look at base stations in specific regions. such as office regions. Second. we observe that location is another important factor that affects the traffic profile of a base station.

The first category operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make such restrictive assumptions; however. it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location.

TurboTrack's unique capability is that it can localize backscatter nodes with sub-centimeter accuracy without any constraints on their locations or mobility. TurboTrack makes two key technical contributions. First. it presents a pipelined architecture that can extract a sensing bandwidth from every single backscatter packet that is three orders of magnitude larger than the backscatter communication bandwidth. Second. it introduces a Bayesian space-time super-resolution algorithm that combines time series of the sensed bandwidth across multiple antennas to enable accurate positioning.

A first key point lies in that both input and output biasing voltages of the solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) are dynamically controlled according to the RF power level associated with the symbol to be transmitted. The leading idea is that the dynamic biasing control is designed and implemented to keep fixed amplitude (AM/AM) and phase (AM/PM) conversion values. while the RF input power level changes. The power gain of the PAs can then be dynamically tuned to a fixed power gain corresponding to the compression gain behavior for which the PAE is optimum at low-. medium-. and high-input RF power levels.

The proposed method is applied to optimize the package of a 15W power GaN HEMT for high efficiency performance over 39% bandwidth (S-band). It is demonstrated that the internal pre-matching of package ensures that the impedance seen by the GaN die at the second-harmonic frequency remains confined inside a high-efficiency region over a wide bandwidth whatever loads presented to the output of the package. In fact. when the 2 nd -harmonic frequency termination of the package is varied all over the entire Smith Chart. the packaged transistor demonstrates a limited variation of PAE (70±3)% at 3.2GHz.

The main goal of this study is to perform the characterization of the bandpass response of a nonlinear device-under-test (DUT) driven by modulated carriers. The proposed setup enables the generation of L- or S-band (1-4 GHz) carriers with a modulation bandwidth up to 100 MHz. The carrier harmonics generated by the nonlinear DUT are ignored and considered to be sufficiently filtered. This characterization setup enables calibrated time-domain measurements of the complex envelopes of both incoming and outgoing RF waves at the input and output of the DUT.

This principle used in the large signal network analyzer (LSNA) enables to transform a measured RF spectrum into an IF spectrum which is then digitized by ADCs. Unfortunately in this principle IF spectrum bandwidth is limited to 10MHz due to the need of high dynamic range ADCs (14bits). In this paper. we propose a new method that enables to accurately measure the phase relationships and the amplitudes of the spectral components of broadband microwave signals. Measurements of a 62MHz bandwidth multitone signal at L band have been performed and are shown. The extension of the proposed method to wider bandwidth is absolutely possible.

This calibration is based on the use of wideband multi-sine signal and is applied to a 4 channel Track and Hold Amplifier (THA) based measurement setup. The absolute magnitude and phase calibration is performed with a calibrated coherent interleaving sampling oscilloscope as reference. The new calibration procedure without any IF calibration assumption allows a 10 kHz resolution over 3 GHz bandwidth. A 40 W GaN high power amplifier. driven by a pulsed RF signal at the input. is characterized with this time-domain measurement setup.

Free-space fields that are expressed in terms of continuous spectra of symmetrized plane waves are matched to the current modes using the method of moments. The resulting set of equations are solved for the unknown current amplitudes. The calculations show that for increasing bow length the antenna impedance spirals rapidly to a value predicted by transmission line theory. The theory also shows that the  -plane pattern of a two wavelength.  bow-tie antenna is dominated by low-loss current modes propagating at the dielectric …,True,kSy41dkAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC,214,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1144162/,4792883051410859975,/scholar?cites=4792883051410859975,,,0,0,0

Due to the inherent physical properties of passive terahertz imaging and associated hardware. images have poor contrast and low signal to noise ratio. Standard segmentation algorithms are unable to segment or detect concealed objects. Our approach relies on two stages.

This allows a direct measurement of the anisotropic magnetorestistance as well as an estimate of the spin‐valve contribution to the total MR.

In this work the temperature variation of AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors grown either on silicon or sapphire substrate under bias operation was measured by micro Raman scattering spectroscopy. Temperature measurements up to power dissipation of 16 W for 4 mm development devices were carried out and a peak temperature of 650 K was determined. The difference of thermal resistance for similar devices grown on the two different substrates was assessed. The thermal resistances of different device topologies were compared to optimise the component design.,True,g6uvyLMAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,14,https://www.epjap.org/articles/epjap/abs/2005/05/ap03094/ap03094.html,4358454402221190178,/scholar?cites=4358454402221190178,,,0,0,0

Extensive measurements have demonstrated the impact of trapping effects on the shapes of I(V) characteristics. as well as load cycles. It is shown that accurate modeling of gate-and drain-lag effects dramatically improves the large-signal simulation results. This is particularly true when the output loads deviate from the optimum matching conditions corresponding to real-world simulations. This new model and its modeling approach are presented here.

The characterization of microwave power transistors is an important and emerging field with many interesting engineering challenges. One can basically distinguish two areas: model extraction measurements and model validation measurements. To make things simple. isothermal pulsed-bias pulsed S-parameter measurements are typically used for model extraction purposes and load-pull measurements are typically used for model validation purposes. Both areas are rapidly evolving in order to keep track of new power transistor technology.

However RTALP has been so far limited to devices operating under CW excitations and constant biasing and was therefore mostly applicable to transistors with small memory effects. In TDMA communication or radar systems. amplifiers are excited by pulsed or modulated RF signals and operate under pulsed biasing. For such applications the measurement of modulated/pulsed RF signals under pulsed biasing/RF conditions is required for a more realistic understanding of the behavior of transistors with memory effects.

In general two methods are being used: a first method uses pulsed bias measurements. often combined with small signal S-parameter measurements. This method is typically used by the transistor modeling society. A second method are so-called loadpull measurements. whereby one presents a whole range of output impedances to the transistor terminal. together with a large signal input signal. and one measures several output characteristics of the device like eg output power. adjacentchannel-power ratio (ACPR). power gain.…. Loadpull measurements are typically used by amplifier designers to find the optimal operating conditions of the transistors for meeting specific amplifier requirements. Loadpull measurements are also often used to verify large-signal transistor models. In this paper we present a simple novel loadpull measurement setup with extended capabilities.

1088707,A new satellite repeater amplifier characterization system for large bandwidth NPR and modulated signals measurements,2002,Alain Mallet and Françis Gizard and T Reveyrand and Luc Lapierre and Jacques Sombrin,3,,,2245-2248,IEEE,Power consumption and dissipation of satellite payloads for space telecommunication systems are mainly due to power amplifiers. To increase system capacity with limited bandwidth. multicarrier operations are required. Linearity is specified to limit the signal distortion by the nonlinear power amplifiers. In order to minimize power consumption under those linearity requirements. accurate measurements have to be performed. The NPR is well known as the figure of merit for the intermodulation distortion performance of amplifiers in telecommunications. In this paper. the development of an accurate large bandwidth NPR measurement system is presented. It enables characterizations up to Ka band (17-21 GHz and 27-31 GHz for space telecommunications applications with typically 250 MHz bandwidth).

First of all. a versatile time domain envelope test bench is presented. Then. two applications related to those RF PA measurements are reported. The first application concerns linearity characterization that can be specified in term of Noise Power Ratio (NPR) and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). Those figures of merit are essential to compute the final bit error rate in a system level simulation tool. A relationship between NPR and EVM is presented and validated by measurements. As a result it can be advantageously used to simplify simulation and measurement procedures for the linearity characterisation of devices and subsystems. The second application is regarding enhancement of the trade-off between linearity and energy efficiency.

Furthermore. the possibility of controling the base biasing conditions (voltage. current. self-bias control) compared to a field-effect transistor offers additive degrees of freedom to make a tradeoff between linearity and power-added efficiency. Nevertheless existing devices are limited because of the relatively low breakdown voltage whereas high collector voltage swings are required to achieve high power. This drawback makes them not appropriate for use in the next generation of mobile communication base station or radar systems.

1088833,Modeling envelope-tracking RF amplifiers,2015,Arnaud Soury,,,,1-4,IEEE,In the past years. the design of modern RF transceivers has been widely driven by strict and contrasting design specifications (linearity. efficiency. etc.). This is especially true for the advent of the new 4G (LTE) and of the next 5G standards. In this context. power amplifiers (PAs) have received a particular attention and we have seen the promotion of various pre-distortion techniques (DPD). In parallel. envelope tracking techniques recently allowed significant improvements in terms of power consumption. While some methods capturing the preformatting of the DC bias voltage have been proposed. the majority are based on static observations.

As the rectifiers present an important non-linear behavior with such power levels. specific design guidelines must be respected in order to optimize the structure. Different rectifying circuits have been studied and their performances have been evaluated through the definition of a Figure of Merit.

One end of the winding on the magnetic element is connected to a filament wire within the screw shell base and the other end of the inductive winding is connected to an output terminal of the ECM control module. In this manner. the inductor significantly reduces the di/dt rise time of voltage and current when a triac within the ECM module is driven to conduction on each one half cycle of the applied AC line voltage.

1088950,A MODFET dc model with improved pinchoff and saturation characteristics,1986,Hans Rohdin and Patrick Roblin,33,IEEE transactions on electron devices,5,664-672,IEEE,We present an analytical dc model for the MODFET that offers several improvements over existing models. An enhanced version of the model makes use of a new approximation of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) concentration versus gate-to-channel voltage. which models both the subthreshold region and the gradual saturation of carriers due to the onset of AlGaAs charge modulation. Even in this more accurate model there are no complicated numerical calculations involved; at most what is required is finding a single root of a function of one variable. We propose an electron velocity-field curve that combines the observed field-dependent mobility in the 2DEG. and the sharp velocity saturation in GaAs.

1088964,A full-duplex transceiver with two-stage analog cancellations for multipath self-interference,2017,Ying Liu and Patrick Roblin and Xin Quan and Wensheng Pan and Shihai Shao and Youxi Tang,65,IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques,12,5263-5273,IEEE,In this paper. a full-duplex transceiver with a two-stage analog interference cancellation architecture is proposed for the prevailing wireless full-duplex communication. which enables simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency. This two-stage cancellation architecture jointly combines the structures of two typical analog self-interference (SI) cancellation approaches. i.e.. the radio frequency (RF)-tapping and the baseband-tapping approaches. and mitigates the SI signal in two steps to provide an improved analog cancellation performance with reduced restrictions on the RF components required to build the cancellation architecture.

Space‐charge limited transport is accounted for using a self‐consistent electrostatic potential calculated using the Hartree approximation. Three‐dimensional scattering is simulated using the recently developed multiple sequential scattering theory. Interface roughness scattering is found to be dominant over polar phonon scattering in the devices studied. Of particular interest is interface‐roughness (IR) scattering at the InGaAs/AlAs and InGaAs/InAs interfaces and its impact on the valley current. The existence of a critical terrace size that maximizes IR scattering is identified through simulation. The origin of the asymmetry commonly measured in the RTD I‐V characteristic is discussed with respect to asymmetries in interface scattering.

The Poisson and Schrodinger equations are solved self-consistently for each harmonic using the harmonic balance technique. This ensures that the total current. consisting of the displacement plus conduction currents. is conserved across the device for each harmonic. The RTD exhibits an increased capacitance in the negative differential conductance (NDC) region in agreement with experimental data. As recently proposed this capacitance increase results from the formation of an emitter well capacitor when the well discharges. The derivation of the RTD capacitance from a quasi-static analysis using the differential variation of the de charge in the RTD is shown to be not applicable because the RTD well charges through the cathode but discharges through the anode.

Velocity saturation in the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and hypothetical rectifying effects in the n/sup +/-AlGaAs-i-GaAs interface are accounted for.

1088994,Pulsed RF calibration for NVNA measurements,2012,Patrick Roblin and Youngseo Ko and Haedong Jang and Jean Pierre Teyssier,,,,1-6,IEEE,This paper presents a new calibration theory for pulsed-RF large-signal measurement which relies on a new pulsed HPR and new pulsed power calibration besides the conventional relative linear calibration. The methodology used is based on the multiharmonic characterization of the RF pulser under pulsed-operation. The pulsed-RF calibration technique is facilitated by the fast switching and settling of the pulser which must have reached quasi-steady state when the RF signals are sampled. Experimental results for the new pulsed-RF calibration are presented for an LSNA. A small calibration correction is found to be required due to the dispersion of the buffer stage between the LSNA samplers and ADCs. The technique which is demonstrated for an LSNA operating using the multiple recording technique could be used with other NVNAs.,True,ZQttmYAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,4,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6422437/,2656296372778721661,/scholar?cites=2656296372778721661,,,0,0,0
