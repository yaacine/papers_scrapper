Cherax quadricarinatus was introduced in Thailand more than two decades ago for culture in freshwater areas where marine penaeid shrimp are also frequently farmed. Despite many reports of various diseases that occur in RCC in Australia (both from natural habitats and from farms). there have been no reports of its diseases when farmed in Thailand. Our recent study on RCC cultured in Thailand revealed that it is susceptible to WSSV infection and that it can transmit the virus to native shrimp species such as the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). Thus. we decided to continue by testing whether RCC were also susceptible to endemic yellow head virus (YHV) and also capable of transmitting it to black tiger shrimp (BTS).

In this study with the results from spectrophotometric method induction of Metallothionein (MT) and levels of Zinc of the Java Medaka fish (Oryzias javanicus) were studied after long time (60 days) exposure of juvenile fishes to different concentrations of zinc. Statistically significant differences in Zn and MT’s content in different organs of fish groups exposed to this metal was found between control group and other groups with diverse concentrations of metal (p< 0.05). Correlation between Zn content and MTs in all body sections of Java Medaka fish (Oryzias javanicus) were statistically significant and the correlation was positive; increasing the Zn content in body sections. the MTs levels increased also (p< 0.01). Also the Metallothioneins (MTs) content in the tissues of Java Medaka fish (Oryzias javanicus) showed a significant difference between the different tissues of this fish.

Disks were placed in bags constructed mesh fabric with 1000 Âµm diameter. Sampling was done at various intervals to determine early and late colonizers within bacterial communities on microplastics in freshwater. Microplastics (diameters< 5mm) are a global concern in environmental sciences and are readily colonized by bacteria in the environment. The term"" plastisphere"" has been used to describe bacterial communities residing on microplastics. The composition of the communities inside the plastisphere has been affected by the physicochemical properties of different microplastic types. Plastics have variations in physicochemical properties based on their intended applications. For example. polyethylene (PE) has a net negative charge while polypropylene (PP) has a net neutral charge at the pH of seawater. Subsequently. DNA was extracted from microbes adhering to disks and the plastisphere community composition will be determined from the V6 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA using 16S MiSeq 250 sequencing.

Its electrocatalytic activity is mainly dependent on composition. structure. and nanoscale geometry. These characteristics rise to high density of active sites [1]. There is a large variety of electrocatalysts used in fuel cells. each of them being appropriate with the specific working condition and the couple fuel-oxidant. In this respect Nickel-Raney large used in chemical industry was less exploited in fuel cells. Ni-Raney catalysts were first introduced in 1924 and since then they have attracted much attention for hydrogenation of organic compounds due to their inexpensive high-surface area substrates and high catalytic activity. Ni-Raney by its geometry and porous structure play a double role: as electrode and as electrocartalyst being suitable for anode in fuel cells (Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell-PEMFC. Alkaline Fuel cell-AFC etc). Ni-Raney catalyst is usually obtained from binary Ni-Al alloy or Ni-Zn alloy with 40 to 60wt% nickel. in which the Al or Zn are removed with NaOH or KOH by alkaline dissolution. leaving behind a high surface area known as nickel ‘‘skeleton’’or nickel “sponge”[2. 3]. This type of alloy is often prepared by pyro-metallurgical methods at high reaction temperatures. It presents several nickel–aluminium phases (Al3Ni. Al3Ni2. AlNi and Al-Al3Ni eutectic)[4] or nickel-zinc. phases which are changing with the chemical composition and the preparation method of the alloy [2].

A synthetic compound of carbon. graphite oxide was first synthesized in 1859. Since then. its synthesis top-down method has been refined to obtain high yields of the material with increasing efficiencies. reaching up to 97% in the case of the Marcano-Tour method that succeeded the Hummers method in popularity amongst the research community. Due to the strong oxidizers involved in the material’s synthesis. extensive processing is paramount to yielding a final product with the least amount of impurities and contaminants. Processing methods encountered in the literature generally involve successive washings with deionized water and hydrochloric acid. centrifugation. and filtration. However. due to graphite oxide gelation during washing. processing can be tedious and time-consuming. To remedy this. we introduce sedimentation and drying steps prior to washing that markedly expedite the overall process. Finally. we compare the results of our method to the standard washing method and its various permutations encountered in the literature: the sedimentation method clearly succeeds in removing most of the synthesis residues. thus augmenting and expediting the standard washing procedure without significant additional costs.,True,CVcEhA4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thanos_Tiliakos/publication/297918263_Graphite_Oxide_Post-Synthesis_Processing_Protocols/links/56e467f908ae98445c1ef597/Graphite-Oxide-Post-Synthesis-Processing-Protocols.pdf,2651102267785879508,/scholar?cites=2651102267785879508,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thanos_Tiliakos/publication/297918263_Graphite_Oxide_Post-Synthesis_Processing_Protocols/links/56e467f908ae98445c1ef597/Graphite-Oxide-Post-Synthesis-Processing-Protocols.pdf,0,0,0

Each type of electrocatalyst depends on the nature of the fuel (the oxidant) and on the working conditions. Thus. at high temperatures. low activity catalysts are accepted since the already high thermal energy reduces the activation barrier. Other properties should be considered as well: solubility. self recovering of the active site and resistance to oxidation or poisoning. Usually in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). the electrocatalyst nanoparticles are spread at membrane-gas diffusion layer interface aiming for a high specific surface area [1]. The fuel splitting into electrons and protons requires a double interface in order to transfer the electrons to the collector electrode and the protons through the electrolyte.

Females. by contrast. rarely produce ornaments. The glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca) is an exception where wingless females glow to attract males that fly in search of females. However. little is known about the factors that promote the evolution of female ornaments in a sexual selection context. Here. we investigated if the female ornament of the glow-worm is a signal of fecundity used in male mate choice. In support of this. we found brightness to correlate with female fecundity. and males to prefer brighter dummy females. Thus. the glow emitted by females is a reliable sexual signal of female fecundity.

1078905,Reproduction under light pollution: maladaptive response to spatial variation in artificial light in a glow-worm,2020,Christina Elgert and Juhani Hopkins and Arja Kaitala and Ulrika Candolin,287,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,1931,20200806,The Royal Society,The amount of artificial light at night is growing worldwide. impacting the behaviour of nocturnal organisms. Yet. we know little about the consequences of these behavioural responses for individual fitness and population viability. We investigated if females of the common glow-worm Lampyris noctiluca—which glow in the night to attract males—mitigate negative effects of artificial light on mate attraction by adjusting the timing and location of glowing to spatial variation in light conditions. We found females do not move away from light when exposed to a gradient of artificial light. but delay or even refrain from glowing. Further. we demonstrate that this response is maladaptive. as our field study showed that staying still when exposed to artificial light from a simulated streetlight decreases mate attraction success. while moving only a short distance from the light source can markedly improve mate attraction.

Exploiting attractiveness of others to get mates is a common tactic in many taxa. although examples of this behavior in females are scarce. In glow-worms (Lampyris noctiluca L.. Coleoptera: Lampyridae). females attract males by glowing and males prefer the brightest female. How unattractive females succeed in competition for mates is largely understudied. We hypothesize that less attractive female glow-worms may succeed in competition over mates by parasitizing glow of more attractive competitors. We tested our hypothesis with a combination of field and laboratory experiments. Contrary to our expectations. we found that females move away from brighter competitors. This behavior may explain our field observation that females are often more than 1 m apart from each other …,True,GBSfK44AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,7,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/30/1/20/5230134,5847691328515691453,/scholar?cites=5847691328515691453,,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/30/1/20/5230134,0,0,0

This pattern of signaling is expected to result from females balancing the costs associated with a higher than optimal signaling effort and those costs associated with a low signaling effort that increase the likelihood of delayed mating. We tested whether this prediction applies in the common glow-worm Lampyris noctiluca (Coleoptera. Lampyridae). a capital breeding species in which females glow at night to attract males. Contrary to predictions. we found that the duration of female sexual signaling significantly decreased with time. Moreover. when females experienced multiple light/dark cycles within 24 h. both signaling duration and intensity significantly decreased.

Personal technology use was high. and the previous survey demonstrated that participants held a positive outlook for technology use in their future classrooms. However. these pre-service teachers had difficulty in articulating an educational vision for this technology. This study draws upon data from 120. second year Masters of Teaching pre-service teachers. Our focus. as academic staff. was to provide opportunities for all pre-service teachers to meaningfully experience the possibilities for learning spaces offered by new technologies.

1078946,A risky defence by a spider using conspicuous decoys resembling itself in appearance,2009,Ling Tseng and I-Min Tso,78,Animal Behaviour,Issue 2,Pages 425–431,Tunghai University,One Darwinian puzzle is that many prey are morphologically or behaviourally conspicuous. Being conspicuous seems detrimental to prey with limited antipredator ability. because conspicuousness is likely to increase detection by predators. Theory predicts that if conspicuousness effectively redirects predator attacks and decreases hunting success. the benefits of enhanced survival can outweigh the cost of conspicuousness. We investigated a conspicuous antipredator behaviour in the orb spider. Cyclosa mulmeinensis. which adds decorations composed of prey pellets and eggsacs to its web. We calculated colour contrasts of spiders against prey pellets and eggsacs and recorded predators' responses to spiders on webs in the field. Webs with more decorations suffered increased numbers of wasp attacks. However because these decorations resembled spiders in size and colour. they functioned as decoys to …,True,PLD-Tj8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,36,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347209002310,12594066124891354638,/scholar?cites=12594066124891354638,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.424.5120&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This response was assessed in the cardiac. pulmonary. and gastric tissues of envenomed mice. The results reveal an increase of permeability in cardiac. pulmonary. and gastric vessels accompanied by an edema-forming. inflammatory cell infiltration. and imbalanced redox status. These effects are correlated with severe tissue alterations and concomitant increase of metabolic enzymes in sera. Pretreatment of mice with antagonists of H1. H2. or H4 receptors markedly alleviated these alterations in the heart and lungs. Nevertheless. the blockade of the H3 receptor slightly reduced these disorders.

Giardiasis is traditionally considered an epidemic and zoonosis disease between human and animals (farm animals. dogs. cats. birds and rodents)(Thompson et al.. 2008). Giardia infection in humans is usually asymptomatic or mild enough to escape diagnosis. most cases are self–limited. yet significant acute and chronic infection can occur (Wicki etal. 2009). Acute infection can produce bloating. crampy abdominal pain and explosive diarrhea. with pale. frothy. steatorrheic stool (foul smelling. greasy stool often mixed with mucus but not blood)(Nyamngee. et al. 2009). Human giardiasis is considered a zoonotic infection because of these sub genotypes of Giardia. namely A1. A2. A3. A4 and B3. were found to be associated with infections of humans. dogs and calves. which supported the role of these animals as a source of infection for humans although the Giardia isolates are morphologically identical. they vary significantly in their biology. virulence and genetics (Lalle and Pozio. 2005). These genotypes can infect different hosts. the analysis of human isolates from different geographical locations. examined by PCR amplification of DNA extracted from stool samples. proved that in almost all cases only Giardia lamblia genotype A and B are associated with human infections (Caccio and Ryan. 2008).

Ancient subcortical circuitry provides a neuroanatomical foundation. extending from dorsal periaqueductal grey to subgenual anterior cingulate. the latter of which is now a treatment target in disorders of sadness. Electrophysiological studies further emphasize a role for reduced left relative to right frontal asymmetry in sadness. underpinning interest in the transcranial stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as an antidepressant target. Neuroimaging studies – including meta-analyses – indicate that sadness is associated with reduced cortical activation. which may contribute to reduced parasympathetic inhibitory control over medullary cardioacceleratory circuits.

1078965,Simultaneous Confidence Corridors for neuroimaging data analysis: applications to Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis,2021,Juan A Arias and Carmen Cadarso-Suárez and Pablo Aguiar-Fernández,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.02908,,,,Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative condition responsible for most cases of dementia and considered as one of the greatest challenges for neuroscience in this century. Early Ad signs are usually mistaken for normal age-related cognitive dysfunctions. thus patients usually start their treatment in advanced AD stages. when its benefits are severely limited. AD has no known cure. as such. hope lies on early diagnosis which usually depends on neuroimaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET). PET data is then analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software. which uses mass univariate statistical analysis. inevitably incurring in errors derived from this multiple testing approach. Recently. Wang et al.(2020) formulated an alternative: applying functional data analysis (FDA). a relatively new branch of statistics. to calculate mean function and simultaneous confidence corridors (SCCs) for the difference between two groups' PET values. Here we test this approach with a practical application for AD diagnosis. estimating mean functions and SCCs for the difference between AD and control group's PET activity and locating regions where this difference galls outside estimated SCCs. indicating differences in brain activity attributable to AD-derived neural loss. Our results are consistent with previous literature on AD pathology and suggest that this FDA approach is more resilient to reductions in sample size and less dependent on ad hoc selection of an {\alpha} level than its counterpart. suggesting that this novel technique is a promising venue for research in the field of medical imaging.,True,lMV7XcQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02908,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02908,0,0,0

Fish sampling was conducted by single pass electrofishing. Fifteen sectors were established in order to cover an important surface area of the river. The cumulative length of the sectors was 4.3 km. resulting in a mean length of the sectors of 286.66 m. The lowest sampling point was 451 m (N47 48.628'-E024 18.858') while the highest sampling point was 610 m (N47 50.891'-E024 30.020'). A total number of 1366 of fish specimens grouped into 6 families and 17 species were captured. photographed. measured and weighted. Fish diversity decreases as altitude grows. Five Danube salmon specimens were captured at different altitudes as follows: sector 1-408 m (1 specimen). sector 3-423 m (2 specimens). sector 4-442 m (1 specimen) and sector 12-584 m (1 specimen). The largest specimen caught was in sector 1 (near to the Vişeu River confluence) measuring 47.3 cm and weighted 1150 g. The other four specimens ranged between 17.37 cm (39 g) to 23.58 cm (92 g) and were captured at higher altitudes.

Cross-breeding with Asian breeds was recently used for genetic improvement in milk production. In the last 25 years the species has dramatically decreased. Over 90% of livestock has been sold and never replaced. The population is now mainly maintained in subsistence farms. This study aims to assess the genetic diversity within the remaining population and to verify links with improved breeds supposedly introgressed in RBB. To assess the genetic diversity of RBB and ascertain possible phylogenetic relations with other buffalo breeds. we sequenced the entire cytochrome B gene (MTCYB) in a sample population. Blood samples were collected from randomly selected 52 unrelated individuals from various locations in Transylvania. A DNA fragment containing the entire MTCYB gene (1140bp) was amplified by PCR directly from whole blood (1μl). The amplicons were sequenced using two pairs of primers.

Nitrate-nitric-NO pathway plays a role in prevention of insulin resistance and progression of diabetes mellitus. Because of salivary nitrite is also generated from NO metabolism therefore. salivary nitrite may reflect the endogenous NO production and endothelial function in various diseases thus; the aim of present study was evaluation of salivary nitrite in controlled and complicated T2DM regarding the current diabetic pharmacotherapy. In this study a total number of 50 patients with T2DM were selected randomly compared with 27 healthy subjects. 10ml of venous blood from all patients and healthy subjects after an overnight fasting was drawn. lipid profile. fasting blood glucose. plasma nitrate. plasma nitrite. nitric oxide NO and salivary nitrite were determined in patients with T2DM regarding specific diabetic pharmacotherapy and complications compared to healthy control. Salivary nitrite was high in patient with complications p= 0.04 compared with control and near normal in diabetic patient without complications. Metformin increases salivary nitrite more than glimepiride but combination of metformin plus glimepiride produced significant amelioration in salivary nitrite levels.Conclusion: Salivary nitrite levels were high in complicated T2DM and low in controlled T2DM compared to the control.

The effect of pectin and chitosan on the Pickering emulsion was investigated by direct visualization of the oil droplets and by the thermodynamic characterization at the interface. Pectin enhances the Pickering emulsion stability. while a phase separation and nonhomogeneous gel was observed in the presence of chitosan. We have demonstrated that the Pickering emulsion in a pectin based gel phase is suitable for wax layer removal from a marble surface. A controlled cleaning is achieved by tuning the contact time between the gel and the marble surface. Due to its nonhomogeneous structure. chitosan-based gel does not show proper wax removal ability.

Here we have performed a systematic investigation of fabrication of halloysite nanotubes complexes with nucleotides and genomic DNA. The binding of DNA and various nucleotide species (polyAU. UMP Na 2. ADP Na 3. dATP Na. AMP. uridine. ATP Mg) by halloysite nanotubes was tested using UV-spectroscopy. The study revealed that binding of different nucleotides to the nanoclay varied but was low both in the presence and absence of MgCl 2. while MgCl 2 facilitated significantly the binding of longer molecules such as DNA and polyAU. Modification of the nanotubes with DNA and nucleotide species was further confirmed by measurements of ζ-potentials. DNA-Mg-modified nanotubes were characterized using transmission electron (TEM). atomic force (AFM) and hyperspectral microscopies. Thermogravimetric analysis corroborated the sorption of DNA by the nanotubes. and the presence of DNA on the nanotube surface was indicated by changes in the surface adhesion force measured by AFM. DNA bound by halloysite in the presence of MgCl 2 could be partially released after addition of phosphate buffered saline. DNA binding and release from halloysite nanotubes was tested in the range of MgCl 2 concentrations (10–100 mM). Even low MgCl 2 concentrations significantly increased DNA sorption to halloysite. and the binding was leveled off at about 60 mM.

Several Bacillus bacteriophages have been isolated. but very few Bacillus megaterium bacteriophages have been characterized. In this study. we describe the biological characteristics. whole genome sequences. and annotations for two new isolates of the B. megaterium bacteriophages (BM5 and BM10). which were isolated from Egyptian soil samples. Growth analyses indicated that the phages BM5 and BM10 have a shorter latent period (25 and 30 min. respectively) and a smaller burst size (103 and 117 PFU. respectively). in comparison to what is typical for Bacillus phages. The genome sizes of the phages BM5 and BM10 were 165.031 bp and 165.213 bp. respectively. with modular organization. Bioinformatic analyses of these genomes enabled the assignment of putative functions to 97 and 65 putative ORFs. respectively. Comparative analysis of the BM5 and BM10 genome structures. in conjunction with other B. megaterium bacteriophages. revealed relatively high levels of sequence and organizational identity. Both genomic comparisons and phylogenetic analyses support the conclusion that the sequenced phages (BM5 and BM10) belong to different sub-clusters (L5 and L7. respectively). within the L-cluster. and display different lifestyles (lysogenic and lytic. respectively). Moreover. sequenced phages encode proteins associated with Bacillus pathogenesis. In addition.

Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). is the most severe pest of major cultivated palms. including coconut palm and oil palm. In the present study. a 58-d experiment of pheromone-based mass trapping system was conducted in a coconut plantation in Kuala Terengganu. Malaysia to examine the effects of selected food baits (pineapple fruit. sago palm stem and sugarcane stem) and synthetic pheromone (ferrugineol; 4-methyl-5-nonanol) in attracting RPW adults. Results showed that the treatments that used ferrugineol and food baits caught significantly more RPW adults compared with other treatments. Pineapple with ferrugineol captured the highest number of adult RPW compared with the other food baits (n= 76 individuals; p< 0.05). There were no significant differences in the number of females and males captured (n= 108 females. 59%; n= 76 males. 41%). with a sex ratio of 1 male: 1.42 female. Daily rainfall significantly reduced the daily trapping efficacy (r=− 0.767. p< 0.05). but no differences were detected for other ecological parameters (temperature and humidity). These results have led in part to the pheromone trapping of RPW in selected coconut plantations of Terengganu. Malaysia where the weevil is a serious introduced pest of coconut palms.

The challenge of managing this pest is due to a lack of physical symptoms during the early stages of infestation. Investigating the physiological changes that occur within RPW-infested palm trees may be useful in establishing a new approach in RPW detection. In this study. the effects of RPW infestation were investigated in Elaeis guineensis by observing changes in physical and physiological parameters during the progress of infestation by visual inspection and the comparison of growth. gas exchange. stomatal conductance. and chlorophyll content between the non-infested control. physically wounded. and RPW-infested E. guineensis groups. During the study period. four distinct levels of physical infestation were observed and recorded. The RPW-infested group displayed significantly lower maximum photosynthesis activity (A max) starting from the third week post-infestation. However. growth in terms of change in plant height and stem circumference. leaves’ stomatal conductance. and chlorophyll content were not significantly different between the three groups during the duration of the study. The significant drop in photosynthesis was observed one week before physical changes appeared. This suggests the promising utilisation of photosynthesis activity as a signal for detecting RPW infestation at the early stage of attacks. which could be useful for integration in integrated pest management (IPM).

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) can suppress tumor cell proliferation. Here. we discovered that HIF1α acts as a direct repressor of aspartate biosynthesis involving the suppression of several key aspartate-producing proteins. including cytosolic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase-1 (GOT1) and mitochondrial GOT2. Accordingly. HIF1α suppresses aspartate production from both glutamine oxidation as well as the glutamine reductive pathway. Strikingly. the addition of aspartate to the culture medium is sufficient to relieve HIF1α-dependent repression of tumor cell proliferation.

We found that EC-specific loss of the glycolytic regulator pfkfb3 reduced ischemic hindlimb revascularization and impaired muscle regeneration. This was caused by the reduced ability of macrophages to adopt a proangiogenic and proregenerative M2-like phenotype. Mechanistically. loss of pfkfb3 reduced lactate secretion by ECs and lowered lactate levels in the ischemic muscle. Addition of lactate to pfkfb3-deficient ECs restored M2-like polarization in an MCT1-dependent fashion. Lactate shuttling by ECs enabled macrophages to promote proliferation and fusion of muscle progenitors. Moreover. VEGF production by lactate-polarized macrophages was increased. resulting in a positive feedback loop that further stimulated angiogenesis.

A central action executed by the HIFs is a profound repression of mitochondrial cellular respiration. As a consequence. oxygen is salvaged in hypoxic/ischemic tissues. and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species is attenuated. which limits ischemia-reperfusion damage.

Many studies have confirmed that herbs and herbal extracts can help to repel the several types of ticks (as can non-chemical means such as wearing long pants and tucking them into socks) that spread these diseases [1-3-14-34]. There are an estimated 300.000 new cases of Lyme disease each year in the United States [35]. Standard treatment with doxycycline or an alternative antibiotic for a few weeks usually clears the infection and resolves symptoms [2-32-37]. The cause of this lingering syndrome isn't known. But it is known that cultures of Lyme disease [29] bacteria. Borrelia burgdorferi. can enter a so-called stationary phase in which many of the cells divide slowly or not at all. The slow-dividing or dormant cells are"" persister"" cells. which can form naturally under nutrient starvation or stress conditions. and are more resistant to antibiotics [1. 4. 28].

Consequently. improved plant cultivars for use in these areas should show adaptation capacities to confer drought and salt resistance and allow the cultivation under limited water availabiltiy. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of deficit irrigation with saline water on two local barley landraces.“Karkeni” and “Bengardeni”. Plants were saline-irrigated with three watering regimes during tillering. heading. and grain filling stages. Biochemical traits. carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C). mineral composition. grain yield (GY) and water use efficiency based on grain yield (WUEgy) were evaluated as performance indicators. Almost all of the studied traits (eg soluble carbohydrates. proline.∆ 13C. Na concentration. and GY) were significantly affected by deficient saline-irrigation regimes at different growth stages. The hierarchical clustering analysis clearly showed that Δ13C placed very close to GY averaging two barley landraces. which was in accordance with the scatter plot result. Multiple linear regression performed between GY as the dependent variable and other traits studied as the independent variables indicated that WUEgy. Δ13C. and soluble carbohydrates significantly explained the variability in GY (R2= 95.64%). A significant positive correlation that observed between∆ 13C and GY at three growth stages. indicated that∆ 13C may be an important proxy component for indirect selection of yield potential in barley under deficient irrigation regimes with saline water.

The unexpected discovery of a physical relief valve in the ear emphasizes the need for further study into how organs control fluid pressure. volume. flow. and ion homeostasis in development and disease.,True,dMJdMegAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/143826v1.abstract,16901272207386464716,/scholar?cites=16901272207386464716,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/05/30/143826.full.pdf,0,0,0

While their teeth are known back to the early Paleocene. postcrania are only rarely found. Here we describe the forelimb of two taxa with dentally associated skeletons that were recovered from freshwater limestone of the late Paleocene Willwood Formation. Bighorn Basin. Wyoming: Leptacodon rosei (Soricomorpha?. Nyctitheriidae) and Adunator n. sp.(Erinaceomorpha. incertae sedis). Their morphology is very similar. likely reflecting shared ancestry and similar forelimb capabilities. The proximal humerus has a rounded head. low tuberosities and distinct muscle attachment sites for rotators of the shoulder that suggest considerable mobility at the glenohumeral joint. The elbow joint appears to have been habitually flexed. based on the shallow olecranon and deep radial fossae on the distal humerus. and on the short. cranially curving olecranon process of the ulna. Considerable supination was possible at the elbow joint between the nearly spherical humeral capitulum. the deeply concave. rounded central fossa of the proximal radius. and the flat. craniolaterally facing radial notch on the ulna. These characteristics of the forelimb indicate arboreal capabilities and suggest that early members of Soricomorpha and Erinaceomorpha were scansorial. unlike the terrestrial Macrocranion or Pholidocercus.

This cell must use the genetic information encoded in its DNA to multiply in number and build itself into a complex multicellular organism. How this process occurs is the focus of developmental biology. a field that seeks to understand how a combination of genetic information and environmental conditions shape a cell from its beginnings as a zygote all the way to maturity. A fundamental part of this process is the ability of cells to work together in order to build complex tissues and organs. Cells achieve this coordination by using signaling: The process of sending information from one cell to another. These signals are essential in providing cells with their identity and position within the tissue. and are not only used throughout development. but also during the maintenance of the tissue long after it is built.,True,e9XZ8VcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/thesesdissertations/3660/,,,,https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/thesesdissertations/3660/,0,0,0

This journal issue has been encouraging some researchers to find an environmentally friendly insecticide by a cheaper wood preservative method. The International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures 15 (ISPM 15)[1] that is adopted in wood packaging protection in Europe is not suitable for tropical countries like Indonesia. Therefore. the treatment by Organo-Complex-based wood preservation. which consists of copper chromium combined with natural organic compounds. is proposed for effective treatment at a lower cost. The bioassay test was subjected to dry wood termite Cryptotermes cynocephalus Light. The result showed that wood materials treated by 10 ppm Organo-Complex formula gave good results which were indicated by the low consumption and the fast termination of the termites.

Thirty adult male rats were divided to five groups (control. CP. C60. CP + C60. and CP + VOO). CP was i.p. injected with a single dose of 200 mg/kg; C60 and VOO were given orally (4 mg/kg dissolved in VOO and 1 ml. resp.) in alternative days for 20 days. The ISSR analysis revealed an increased in the DNA fragmentation level for liver and heart tissues represented by 21.2% and 32.6%. respectively. in the CP group. The DNA polymorphism levels were modulated and improved in CP + C60 (8.9% and 12%) and CP + VOO (9.8% and 12.7%) for hepatic and cardiac tissues. respectively. The bone marrow cytogenetic analysis revealed that C60 and VOO had significantly decreased the frequency of CP-induced chromosomal aberrations (chromosomal ring. deletion. dicentric chromosome. fragmentation. and polyploidy).

Siganus rivulatus and Mulloidichthys flavolineatus) were determined to evaluate the effect of petroleum oil component pollutions on the fishes using Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrlamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) markers. According to ISSR analysis of DNA. nineteen (19) ISSR primers generated a total of 465 bands with an average 24.5 bands per primer. Analyses of SDS-PAGE protein. 137 bands were identified variant bands from 44. 43 and 50 in sample Lethrinus borbonicus. Siganus rivulatus and Mulloidichthys flavolineatus respectively. Analysis of SDS-PAGE protein provided more precise information concerning of the effect of petroleum oil components on protein subunits and genetic variation in Siganus rivulatus species than ISSR-PCR of DNA. Whereas ISSR technique showed more polymorphism or relatively a close to the percentage of SDS-PAGE result among the tow species Lethrinus borbonicus and Mulloidichthys flavolineatus compared to there controls. A remarkable result from this study was identifying that petroleum oil components pollution have distinct effect in genetic structure of fishes and lead to disappear of some protein subunits or appear new some protein subunits in fish muscle tissues.,True,q2L8XvkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/36521362/D09621622.pdf,16562802551333975055,/scholar?cites=16562802551333975055,,https://www.academia.edu/download/36521362/D09621622.pdf,0,0,0

1079178,Numerical simulation of gravitational waves from a black hole. using curvature tensors,2020,Yoshio Matsuki and Petro I Bidyuk,,System research and information technologies,1,54-67,,In this research we formulated the curvature tensors with the system of spherical polar coordinates. which describe the gravitational field and gravitational waves of a black hole; and then we calculated eigenvalues of the curvature tensors to estimate the relative strengths of their components to the stress-energy tensor in Einstein’s field equation. For this simulation. we assumed that the time and the distance interact with each other if we travel from Earth to the inside of the black hole. and then the result of the simulation showed that the gravitational waves carry the same components of the gravitational field of the black hole. On the other hand. when we assumed that the time and the distance are independent. which resembles the situation outside of the boundary of the black hole toward Earth. the curvature tensors are different between those of the gravitational field and the gravitational waves. Upon the results of the simulation we conclude that the gravitational waves that come from the inside of the black hole carry the information of the gravitational field inside of the black hole. if we assume that time and space are dependent each other.,True,M7AsT20AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,2,http://journal.iasa.kpi.ua/article/view/209134,15515760366756788876,/scholar?cites=15515760366756788876,,http://journal.iasa.kpi.ua/article/download/209134/209531,0,0,0

We made the regression analysis of the global temperature over the factors of Moon’s gravitational field taken from the General Theory of Relativity and from the Newton’s gravity theory. with the data of the carbon-dioxide. The result shows that Newton’s gravitational field is related to Earth’s global temperature. while the influence of Moon’s gravitational wave is negligible.

However. limited data are available for these parameters in triathletes. Hence. the aim of this study was to characterize and examine the gender differences of lung function and anthropometry parameters in competitive triathletes from Malaysia. Body composition assessment and lung function tests were performed on sixteen competitive triathletes (nine male and seven female). The subject's body composition profile including muscle mass (kg). fat free mass (kg). and percent body fat was measured using a bio-impedance segmental body composition analyzer. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were measured by Quark PFT2 spirometer. The anthropometric measurements revealed that male triathletes were significantly taller than female triathletes and had significantly more protein and skeletal muscle mass. The female triathletes. however. had significantly higher percent body fat. Male triathletes had statistically significant higher FVC and FEV1 than female triathletes. Both the male and female triathletes showed a positive correlation between height. fat free mass and the lung function markers FVC and FEV1.

Despite the morphology of several Oithona species is well known. knowledge of its internal anatomy and chitin distribution is still limited. To answer this problem. Oithona nana and O. similis individuals were stained by Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Fluorescein IsoThioCyanate (WGA-FITC) and DiAmidino-2-PhenylIndole (DAPI) for fluorescence microscopy observations. The image analyses allowed a new description of the organization and chitin content of the digestive and reproductive systems of Oithona male and female. Chitin microfibrils were found all along the digestive system from the stomach to the hindgut with a higher concentration at the peritrophic membrane of the anterior midgut. Several midgut shrinkages were observed and proposed to be involved in faecal pellet shaping and motion. Amorphous chitin structures were also found to be a major component of the ducts and seminal vesicles and receptacles. The rapid staining protocol we proposed allowed a new insight into the Oithona internal anatomy and highlighted the role of chitin in the digestion and reproduction.

The genus Oithona is described as having the highest numerical density. as the most cosmopolite copepod and iteroparous. The Oithona male paradox obliges it to alternate feeding (immobile) and mating (mobile) phases. As the molecular basis of this trade-off is unknown. we investigated this sexual dimorphism at the molecular level by integrating genomic. transcriptomic and protein-protein interaction analyses.While a ZW sex-determination system was predicted in O. nana. a fifteen-year time-series in the Toulon Little Bay showed a biased sex ratio toward females (male / female ratio < 0.15±0.11) highlighting a higher mortality in male. Here. the transcriptomic analysis of the five different developmental stages showed enrichment of Lin12-Notch Repeat (LNR) domains-containing proteins coding genes (LDPGs) in male transcripts. The male also showed enrichment in transcripts involved in proteolysis. nervous system development. synapse assembly and functioning and also amino acid conversion to glutamate. Moreover. several male down-regulated genes were involved in the increase of food uptake and digestion. The formation of LDP complexes was detected by yeast two-hybrid. with interactions involving proteases. extracellular matrix proteins and neurogenesis related proteins.Together. these results suggest that the O. nana male hypermotility is sustained by LDP-modulated proteolysis allowing the releases and conversions of amino acid into the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.

A multitude of studies have documented the effects of thermal manipulation (TM) on broiler thermotolerance during periods of post-hatch heat stress. but very few have focused on the effect of TM on a broiler’s ability to withstand cold stress. Therefore. the primary objective of the current study is to determine the effects of TM on the acquisition of thermotolerance in broilers via their expression of the stress-associated 70 kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70) gene and heat shock factor 3 (HSF3) gene. Briefly. Hubbard broiler embryos were subject to TM by increasing the incubation temperature to 39 C and 65% relative humidity (RH) for 18 h daily. from embryonic days (ED) 10 to 18. Broilers were then exposed to cold stress by decreasing the room temperature to 16 C during post-hatch days 32 to 37. After thermal challenge. broilers were euthanized and hepatic and splenic tissues were collected. Our results showed that TM decreased the hatchability rate and body temperature but improved the body weight gain. TM generally decreased the hepatic expression but did not change the splenic expression of HSF3 during cold stress. In contrast. both hepatic and splenic Hsp70 expression decreased during cold stress. The results of the present study may suggest that TM significantly affects a broiler’s genetic response to cold stress.

1079217,Expression of digestive enzyme and intestinal transporter genes during chronic heat stress in the thermally manipulated broiler chicken,,Ziad Waheed Jaradat,,,,,,Heat stress has a serious impact on nutrient digestion and absorption in broiler chickens. This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic heat stress (CHS) on the mRNA expression of digestive enzymes and nutrient transporter genes in thermally manipulated (TM) broiler chickens. The evaluated genes encompassed pancreatic lipase. trypsin. amylase. maltase. and alkaline phosphatase as well as certain glucose transporter (GLUT2. SGLT1). amino acid transporter (y+LAT1. CAT1). and fatty acid transporter (FABP1. CD36) genes in the jejunal mucosa. Thermal manipulation was carried out at 39◦ C and 65% relative humidity for 18 h daily from embryonic days (ED) 10–18. while CHS was induced by raising the temperature to 35◦ C for 7 D throughout post-hatch days 28 to 35. After 0. 1. 3. 5. and 7 D of CHS. the pancreas and jejunal mucosa were collected from the control and TM groups to evaluate the mRNA expression by relative-quantitative realtime qRT-qPCR. Thermal manipulation significantly decreased the cloacal temperature (Tc) and the hatchling weight. and improved weight gain in broilers during post-hatch life and CHS. In addition. TM decreased the mortality rate during CHS. During CHS. the mRNA expression levels of SGLT1. GLUT2. FABP1. and trypsin were significantly decreased after 1 D in control chickens. and this lower expression persisted until day 7. after which it further decreased. In contrast. in TM chickens. SGLT1.

R. Grisham. Phys. Plasmas 16. 043111 (2009)] proposed that a magnetic field which enveloped each of the electrodes in an electrostatic accelerator. along with their support structures. might suppress field emission of electrons and thus allows a higher electric field gradient to be applied between accelerator stages without the onset of vacuum electrical breakdown. Such a magnetic field configuration might be produced by flowing a substantial electric current through each accelerator grid and its support from high current low voltage supplies floated at each accelerator grid potential. This experimental note reports a preliminary exploratory test of whether this magnetic insulation approach might be of benefit at a modest magnetic field strength which could be suitable for practical accelerator applications.

However. the vertebrate neuropeptide Y (NPY) system has emerged as the best described one regarding this biological process. The protostomian ortholog of NPY is neuropeptide F. characterized by an RXRF(Y)amide carboxyterminal motif. A second neuropeptide system is short NPF. characterized by an M/T/L/FRF(W)amide carboxyterminal motif. Although both short and long NPF neuropeptide systems display carboxyterminal sequence similarities. they are evolutionary distant and likely already arose as separate signalling systems in the common ancestor of deuterostomes and protostomes. indicating the functional importance of both. Both NPF and short-NPF systems seem to have roles in the coordination of feeding across bilaterian species. but during chordate evolution. the short NPF system appears to have been lost or evolved into the prolactin releasing peptide signalling system. which regulates feeding and has been suggested to be orthologous to sNPF.

Impaired flexibility also results from altered serotonin transmission in the OFC. The Y1 (Y1R) and Y5 (Y5R) receptors for neuropeptide Y (NPY) colocalize in several brain regions and have overlapping functions in regulating cognition and emotional behaviour. The targeted disruption of gene encoding Y1R (Npy1r gene) in Y5R containing neurons (Npy1rY5R−/− mice) increases anxiety-like behaviour and spatial reference memory.

In addition to classical neurotransmitters. neuropeptides have emerged to modulate such complex behaviors. Among them. neuropeptide Y (NPY) is well known to promote aversive memory acquisition in mammals. Here we identify an NPY/neuropeptide F (NPF)-related neuropeptide system in Caenorhabditis elegans and show that this FLP-34/NPR-11 system is required for learning negative associations. a process that is reminiscent of NPY signaling in mammals. The Caenorhabditis elegans NPY/NPF ortholog FLP-34 displays conserved structural hallmarks of bilaterian-wide NPY/NPF neuropeptides.

Growing evidence suggests that. besides classical neurotransmitters. neuropeptides play central roles in cognitive functions. In particular. the neuropeptide F (NPF)/neuropeptide Y (NPY) system has been identified as fundamental modulator of certain types of associative memory in Drosophila and mice. although the specific regulatory mechanism is poorly explored. Since the ability to learn from prior experiences evolved early in evolution. the “mini-brain” of the small roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be ideally suited to address this fundamental neurobiological question on a cellular level. This organism exhibits several types of complex behaviours among which the ability to associate feeding state with odorant sensation. leading to a long-term modification of chemotaxis towards that odorant. Among all de novo synthesised proteins that play a crucial role in establishing long-term memory. the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is one of the best known. I have recently demonstrated that the activation of CREB specifically occurs after olfactory long-term associative memory (LTAM) formation in wild-type worms. Next in my project. I will use a pCRE:: GFP reporter to in vivo monitor CREB activation pattern during an olfactory assay in wild-type and NPF/NPY mutants. adding valuable information about the LTAM formation process to the canonical behavioural assay evaluation.

1079244,C. elegans as a model to unravel neuropeptidergic control of learning and memory,2016,Luca Fancsalszky and Melissa Fadda and Geert Depuydt and Sven Zels and Isabel Beets and Liliane Schoofs,,,,,,Learning and memory are essential biological functions with evolutionary conserved molecular mechanisms. As studying the effects of genes in the human brain is extremely challenging. we need to turn to model organisms. In contrast to the anatomic complexity of mammalian brains. the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a ‘mini-brain’consisting of 302 neurons with a complete connectome. Worms and humans share many similarities in their repertoire of neurotransmitters and neuronal modulators and in their genes required for neuronal development. Additionally. the worm has a lot of other advantages such as a transparent body. invariant cell lineage and fast life cycle. Despite the anatomic simplicity of its nervous system. C. elegans is capable to identify a broad range of environmental cues including food and chemicals via neuron-specific detection and shows aversive or attractive behavioral responses. It can associate nutrients with odours. tastes. or even food pathogenicity. Neuropeptides represent one of the largest groups of intercellular signaling factors in the nervous system. In C. elegans. they are derived from more than 120 precursor genes encoding over 250 bioactive peptides. Presumably. all C. elegans neurons produce and secrete neuropeptides with possible signaling activity. These neuropeptides can act as ligands for evolutionary conserved G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). regulating a variety of physiological and disease-related signaling pathways. Accumulating evidence implicates neuropeptides in the regulation of learning and memory processes. but little is known on mechanisms underlying this …,True,lv0WkPcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1704476?limo=0,,,,,0,0,0

By comparing the developmental pathways of B. schlosseri with other chordates. we identify hundreds of putative transcription factors with conserved temporal expression.

However. a study holistically linking aging and circadian gene expression is missing.  Using the colonial chordate Botryllus schlosseri. we combined transcriptome sequencing and stem cell-mediated aging phenomena to test how circadian gene expression changes with age. This revealed that B. schlosseri clock and clock-controlled genes oscillate organism-wide. with daily. age-specific amplitudes and frequencies. These age-related. circadian patterns persist at the tissue level. where dramatic variations in cyclic gene expression of tissue profiles link to morphological and cellular aging phenotypes. Similar cyclical expression differences were found in hundreds of pathways associated with known hallmarks of aging. as well as pathways that were not previously linked to aging.

1079261,Cyclical neurogenesis and neurodegeneration in the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri,2018,Chiara Anselmi,,,,,,In this work. we studied the nervous and sensory system of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri during the development of embryos. buds. and in adult individuals belonging to young and old colonies. B. schlosseri is a colonial ascidian in which individuals (blastozooids) are organized in star-shaped systems. In a colony. sexual and asexual reproductions are coordinated and cyclical. Moreover. three generations of zooids coexist: adults (filter-feeding individuals). their buds (primary buds). and the budlets (secondary buds) produced by buds. Cyclically. during a phase called takeover. adult zooids are reabsorbed by the colony and are replaced in physiological activities by their buds that become adults. Cuncurrently. budlets mature into buds and produce a new generation of budlets.  We first reviewed historical studies concerning B. schlosseri with the intent of characterizing the colony life cycle and bud development. We then compared nervous system formation in two different developmental pathways. embryogenesis and blastogenesis. Since B. schlosseri has internal fertilization and development. we developed a method for culturing embryos in vitro. Using a combination of in vivo. confocal. histological observations. and 3D reconstructions based on serial sections. we described the embryonic development and drafted a timetable. Next. we sequenced transcriptomes of embryos and buds at several stages and illuminated the strict temporal relationship between morphogenetic events and the expression pattern of genes associated with the nervous system during the formation of the larval brain. its degeneration at metamorphosis. the …,True,5p56oo0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/11463/,,,,http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/11463/,0,0,0

Eutima japonica Uchida and Eugymnanthea japonica Kubota. attached to artificial hard substrata (polystyrene and glass) in the laboratory. Time-lapse video recordings furthermore showed that the non-transparent half of the flat. ellipsoidal pedal disc always faces forward during this motion. with no lateral or backward creeping during either day or night. Because an ordinary zooid generally crept in a circle of small radius. the zooid's body rotated as the creeping proceeded. One full rotation of a zooid of either species took about 5–6 hours on average at 21–25°C. The direction of rotation of an individual zooid was nearly constant irrespective of developmental state. this being true for zooids with or without a medusa bud on the hydrocaulus or a daughter zooid on the pedal disc. those with a normal or a double hydranth. or those consisting of a bare hydrocaulus. Asexually produced tiny daughter zooids quickly became well separated from their mother zooids. The attachment site of the latter did not shift much as they rotated. but daughter zooids and other tiny free zooids creep along a nearly straight line. thereby markedly shifting their position.

They can be used as biofermenters for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites. In the commercial development of sponge-derived drug leads. the production of primmorphs is one of the methods proposed to solve the supply problem. In addition. using primmorphs for the production of drugs can preserve the sponge population from extinction by producing enough quantities of the extracts and compounds that present in wild sponges.Objectives The presented work aimed to produce primmorphs of Red Sea sponges Hemimycale aff arabica.

This study investigated the extent of morphological and genetic similarity or dissimilarity between Melia volkensii in vitro plants (somatic seedlings) obtained via somatic embryogenesis and normal seedlings. Comparisons were made between in vitro plants regenerated directly from cotyledon explants. indirectly from zygotic embryos and normal seedlings of the same parent trees. Regeneration was achieved using half MS medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/l thidiazuron. Shoots were elongated in half MS with 0.1 mg/l BAP plus 0.01 mg/l IAA then rooted in half MS with 0.1 mg/l IBA and 0.1 mg/l NAA. Six morphometric and five meristic characters were used for the morphological characterization. PCR-RAPD markers were used for assessment of genetic similarity or distance. Multivariate analysis using principal coordinates. cluster analysis. analysis of similarities (Anosim) and similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER) revealed significant dissimilarities (p< 0.0001) in morphometric and meristic characters between the in vitro plants and normal seedlings. However. significant similarity (p< 0.01) was observed in the RAPD-genic characters of the in vitro plants and normal seedlings.

1079281,Phylogeny and antibiotic activity of Xenorhabdus spp. isolated from nematode symbionts in kenya,2015,Ryan M Awori,,,,,,Xenorhabdus is a bacteria genus of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Bacteria of this genus form a  mutualistic relationship with Steinernema entomopathogenic nematodes. More so. their  antimicrobial production serves as a potential source of novel antibiotics in the wake of growing  antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to establish the phylogenetic relationship of three  Xenorhabdus isolates to the 24 described species of the genus based on the 16s rRNA gene.  Secondly. it aimed to determine the antibiotic activity of the three Xenorhabdus isolates from  Kenya. Six 16s rRNA sequences were isolated in this study while 184 sequences were obtained  from public databases compiling a data-set of 190 sequences. Phylogenetic reconstruction was  done using maximum likelihood method with a bootstrap test of phylogeny of 500 replicates.  The phylogenetic reconstruction identified the isolates as Xenorhabdus griffiniae L67.  Xenorhabdus griffiniae XN45 and a novel Xenorhabdus species. This is the first record of  Xenorhabdus griffiniae in Kenya. The antibiotic activities of the isolates were assessed by  analysis of the inhibitory effect of the whole broth extracts. organic fractions and aqueous  fractions. Xenorhabdus griffiniae L67.

We measured δ15N values around 10‰ in environments where the major terrestrial water inputs are sewage. The highest average total nitrogen contents and δ15N values were found in the Auckland city region (Manukau Harbour) at 2.2%N and 9.9‰. respectively. The lowest values were found in Mangawhai Harbour. situated about 80 km north of Auckland city. at 2.0%N and 5.2‰. respectively. In the Waitemata Harbour. also located in Auckland city but with less exposure to human derived sewage inputs. both parameters were intermediate. at 2.1%N and 6.4‰.Total phosphorus contents did not vary significantly. Additionally. analysis of historical mangrove leaf herbarium samples obtained from the Auckland War Memorial Museum indicated that a reduction in both leaf total nitrogen and δ15N content has occurred over the past 100 years in Auckland’s harbours. Collectively. these results suggest that anthropogenically derived nitrogen has had a significant impact on mangrove nutrient status in Auckland harbours over the last 100 years. The observed decrease in nitrogenous nutrients probably occurred due to sewage system improvements. We suggest that mangrove plant physiological response to nutrient excess could be used as an indicator of long-term eutrophication trends.

Between 2005 and 2010 neonicotinoid use in the USA and UK more than doubled. Anecdotal evidence suggests similar trends exist in New Zealand. where neonicotinoid seed coatings are now often applied prophylactically in contravention of the principles of Integrated Pest Management. This widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides is controversial due to a lack of understanding about their persistence in the environment and the long-term consequences of their use. We present a novel. simple. low-cost method for the extraction and quantification of five neonicotinoids from soil with a detection limit <1 ng g-1. We have applied this method to soil collected from maize paddocks in New Zealand and found clothianidin and imidacloprid in 48 out of 50 samples.

1079290,Effect of Nutrients and Salinity on Growth of Temperate Mangroves (Avicennia marina var australasica) in Northern New Zealand,2019,Iana Gritcan,,,,,,Estuarine environmental conditions in New Zealand have changed greatly due to human catchment activity (e.g.. deforestation. intensive agricultural activity. and urbanisation). These factors have led to additional accretion of sediment (sedimentation) and nutrients (eutrophication) throughout New Zealand waterways and coast waters. In recent years. New Zealand mangroves (Avicennia marina var australasica) have shifted their distribution within estuaries and rapidly spread into areas where they have never been found before. Many local communities and councils are worried that mangroves have replaced sandy bare tidal flats and other estuarine habitats (i.e.. seagrass beds. marshlands) and will turn them into muddy sites. Researchers have proposed several reasons for the spread of temperate mangroves. including estuary infilling. increased nutrient inputs. climate warming. changes in sea level and a combination of some of these factors. Indeed. it has been shown that increased sedimentation correlates well with rapid mangrove accretion in New Zealand through the emergence of additional mangrove habitat space. but the effect of the nutrient uploads has received less attention. Additionally. there is almost no information on the salinity levels that are characteristic for temperate New Zealand mangrove ecosystems. Indeed. it is well documented that salinity is an important controlling factor for mangrove growth in tropical mangrove ecosystems. but there is almost no such studies in temperate mangrove areas.

LDH specific activity changes were studied after 24. 48 and 72 hours of copper acute intoxication.

Significant increase in LDH activity were observed in the intestine and kidney after 24 and 48 hours at 100 µgCu2+/l and after 24 hours of treatment at 250 µgCu2+/l in kidney. The inhibition of LDH activity may reflect an important stress. while a stimulation of this enzyme may indicate an increased dependence on anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism.

UV radiations and a new method based on plasma operating at atmospheric pressure. namely the PlasBeam method. The physical-chemical modifications induced onto the enamel surface by the above pretreatments were analyzed using Contact Angle Measurements and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. The changes in the enamel surface morphology show that the acid-etching pretreatment is mostly efficient in increasing roughness. but this method stimulates the degradation processes that are well-known and turns down the brillianceof the treated surface.

1079316,POLYMERIC SURFACE MODIFICATIONS BY NONCONVENTIONAL METHODS,,Teodora TESLARU and Crenguta BACAOANU,,,,,,Polymer materials are widely used in various industrial and medical applications and each application requires specific properties. In order to improve wettability properties and remove contaminants from contact lens are used various chemical and physical methods based on incorporation of surfactants. UV radiations. ion beams and plasma treatments. The poly (methylmethacrylate)(PMMA) films are used in various biological applications. especially in ophthalmology. due to their particular physico-chemical and biological properties. In this work we present a comparative study on surface modifications of PMMA film induced by UV radiations and plasma treatment. The plasma is generated in a dielectric barrier discharge with asymmetrical electrode configuration. working at atmospheric pressure in argon with a flow rate of 3 L/min. The investigations of PMMA films before and after UV exposure and plasma treatment were performed by water contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy.,True,jaxG0Z4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.agir.ro/buletine/2405.pdf,,,,https://www.agir.ro/buletine/2405.pdf,0,0,0

The release of contaminants into the aquatic environment and the subsequent accumulation in sediment is a specific area of concern due to the potential re-release of the contaminants into solution. The responses of two microbiotests designed to evaluate sediment toxicity (the Ostracodtoxkit F and Phytotoxkit test) were compared once exposed to three samples collected in the vicinity of a power station in Mpumalanga. South Africa. Sediment characterisation and chemical analyses were conducted in order to determine possible correlations with the expressed results. Where possible. the concentration of chemicals in the sediment was compared to available sediment guidelines. The study showed that whilst the Phytotoxkit test results did not indicate any acute toxicity (< 50% inhibition). the Ostracodtoxkit F test indicated 100% mortality at the upstream site. with increased growth inhibition at the remaining two sites. The concentration of chrome at all three sites exceeded the interim sediment quality guidelines (37 mg/kg). with the sample collected at the upstream site exceeding the probable effect level (90 mg/kg).

Daphnia pulex and Hydra vulgaris are commonly used test organisms belonging to different trophic levels. The current study focused on comparing the sensitivity of H. vulgaris to D. pulex when exposed to geometric dilutions of two different water sources. the first (Site 1) from a source containing agricultural run-off and the second (Site 2). acid mine drainage. These sources were selected based on the contribution that the agricultural and mining sectors make to water pollution in South Africa. The bioassay method followed in this study was a modified version of the method described by the USEPA and additional peer-reviewed methods. The mortalities as well as morphological changes (H. vulgaris) were analysed using Microsoft Excel. The LC 50-values were statistically determined using the EPA Probit Analysis Model and the Spearman-Karber analysis methods.

1079437,The use of bioassays to assess the toxicity of sediment in an acid mine drainage impacted river in Gauteng (South Africa),2017,P Singh and A Nel and JF Durand,43,Water SA,4,673-683,,Sediment contamination may occur from various anthropogenic activities. such as mining-. agricultural-and industrial practices. Many of the contaminants arising from these activities enter the aquatic system and precipitate from the surrounding water. becoming bound to sediment particles. These bound contaminants may reach concentrations higher than in the overlying water. Although water quality may be acceptable. an aquatic system may still be at risk if the contaminated sediment were to be disturbed through flooding. bioturbation or changes in the water chemistry. These contaminants may then desorb into the water column and prove detrimental to life forms in contact and dependent on that water source. Sediment quality monitoring has been a widespread international initiative and has led to the development of sediment toxicity assessment methods. This study focused on sediment bioassays. namely. Phytotoxkit. Ostracodtoxkit F and the Diptera bioassay. in assessing sediment quality of the Tweelopiespruit-Rietspruit-Bloubankspruit river system in Gauteng. South Africa. This river is known to have been impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD) since late August. 2002. Exposure of river sediment from 7 sampling sites to these bioassays provided an eco-toxicological estimation of the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity emanating from the contaminated sediments.

1079440,Evaluating the effects of effluent from an acid mine drainage treatment plant on the aquatic health of the Elsburgspruit,2019,Amina Nel,,,,,,Worldwide acid mine drainage (AMD) is regarded as a very costly and a significant environmental impact emanating from the mining industries (Coetzee et al.. 2010). The effects of mining activities are a global problem emerging from abandoned mine shafts (Naidoo. 2017). These effects are seen long after the mining operations have ceased and are mostly noticeable in the surface and ground water (Naidoo. 2017). Naidoo (2017). defined abandoned mines as “sites where advanced exploration. mining or mine production ceased without rehabilitation being implemented at all or completed”. The IIED (2002). stated that abandoned mine sites are found in all regions with a history of mining. Naidoo (2017); further stated that it has become a norm to abandon the mine sites once the minerals have been depleted. During construction. operation and decommissioning phases; the mining companies must ensure that water resources are protected even at times of reduced mineral production (Naidoo. 2017). Before the late twentieth century. environmental impacts arising from the abandoned mine site were not given attention. therefore environmental regulations pertaining to mining were not effectively implemented (Naidoo. 2017). As a result. it could not be predicted that these impacts will result in serious effects such as AMD in the future.South Africa (SA) is well known for its richness in various minerals. These minerals are the largest contributors to the economy of SA and the international market (Akcil and Koldas. 2006). However.

The Anthropocene is characterised by various looming environmental catastrophes such as biodiversity loss. climate change. loss of clean water resources and exponential population growth (Wilhelm. 2009; WWF. 2018). In the constant war between capitalism and the environment. the environment has lost every battle due to the misconception reiterated by parliaments and corporations that the environment is not essential but rather something that is “nice to have”(Juniper. 2014; WWF. 2018).Healthy ecosystems with high biodiversity have intrinsic as well as extrinsic value (Norris and Barbour. 2009). Humans rely on freshwater systems for consumption. recreation. agricultural practices. and hygiene in all social standings. but the poor are more directly affected by the deteriorating health of these ecosystems (Guppy and Anderson. 2017). Anthropogenic activities cause harm in a ripple effect in freshwater ecosystems by disrupting the natural balance in the ecosystem in terms of growth. reproduction. predator-prey interactions and feeding of the biota therein (Wilhelm. 2009). Due to these effects. the health of freshwater ecosystems is no longer assessed by means of chemical and physicochemical analysis only. but also include the assessment of biological indicators or bioindicators (Norris and Barbour. 2009).,True,ffzUOaoAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://ujcontent.uj.ac.za/vital/access/services/Download/uj:35306/SOURCE1,,,,https://ujcontent.uj.ac.za/vital/access/services/Download/uj:35306/SOURCE1,0,0,0

The first representatives of this group were small. gracile. bipedal forms that did not reach more than 1 m long. conversely by the Jurassic this group became mostly quadrupedal and started showing a trend towards gigantism [1].The basal members of the group are often known as “Prosauropods”. although recent phylogenetic analyses have challenged the existence of such a clade. Although the monophyly of the clade Sauropoda. the more derived one. has long been established. the relationships within the “prosauropods” are still unclear. Previous analyses have suggested that most of the prosauropods are clustered within a paraphyletic group named Plateosauria. with a few basal taxa at the base of this and Sauropoda nested within it [2]. The existence of another clade. Massospondylidae. has been proposed. containing more late and derived forms and often placed as the sister taxa of Anchisauria and Sauropoda [3].

To do so. we studied the forelimb muscles in 17 species of carnivorans with different locomotor modes (arboreal and terrestrial).

In this study. we specifically investigated whether habitat use impacts the morphology of the forelimb flexor muscles in lizards. To do so. we performed dissections and quantified the physiological cross sectional area (PCSA). the fiber length. and the mass of four flexor muscles in 21 different species of lizards. Our results show that only the PCSA of the m. flexor carpi radialis is different among lizards with different ecologies (arboreal versus non‐arboreal).

Their oral jaw system has been hypothesized to be forceful. but variation in bite performance and morphology with respect to diet has not previously been investigated. We tested whether herbivorous species have higher bite forces. larger jaw muscles and more robust jaws than carnivorous species. We measured in vivo and theoretical bite forces in 27 serrasalmid species. We compared the size of the adductor mandibulae muscle. the jaw mechanical advantages. the type of jaw occlusion. and the size and shape of the lower jaw. We also examined the association between bite performance and functional morphological traits of the oral jaw system.

The cranial system plays a vital role in many functions including defensive. territorial. predatory and feeding behaviours in addition to housing the brain and sensory systems. Consequently. the morphology of the cranial system is affected by a combination of selective pressures that may induce functional trade-offs. Limbless. head-first burrowers are thought to be constrained in their cranial morphology as narrow heads may provide a functional advantage for burrowing. However. having a wide and large head is likely beneficial in terms of bite performance.

Whether the selective pressures that drove the evolution of dexterous hand grasping involved the collection of fruit or predation on mobile insects remains an area of debate. One way to explore this question is to examine preferences for manual versus oral grasping of a moving object. Previous studies on strepsirrhines have shown a preference for oral grasping when grasping static food items and a preference for manual grasping when grasping mobile prey such as insects. but little is known about the factors at play. Using a controlled experiment with a simple and predictable motion of a food item. we tested and compared the grasping behaviours of 53 captive individuals belonging to 17 species of strepsirrhines while grasping swinging food items and static food items.

Il a en effet été avancé que les piranhas noirs (Serrasalmus rhombeus) peuvent exercer une force de morsure très importante puisque. à taille égale. elle serait trois fois plus puissante que celle des grands requins blancs. Cette force ne serait pas le seul apanage des piranhas mangeurs de chair. car une force importante semble aussi requise chez les espèces-sœurs herbivores pour pouvoir casser les coquilles des graines et des fruits dont elles se nourrissent.

A total of eighteen samples were collected from rhizosphere about 30 cm deep in soil and 50 cm away from the trunk of a Pine tree showing decline and brown needles as one sample per month starting in November 2014 until April 2016. Cobb sieving and gravity methods were used for the nematode isolation from rhizosoil. The soil type is clay with 51% porosity. The monthly air temperature. precipitation. and relative humidity were monitored and tabulated. The results showed that the number of recovered nematodes ranged from 2 individuals/100 cm3 to 88 individuals/100cm3 of rhizosoil. The lowest number was recovered on October whereas the highest numbers were recovered in December. The reason of decline in numbers may be due to a raise in temperature.

The invasion of cane toads (Rhinella marina) through tropical Australia has accelerated over recent decades because of the accumulation of dispersal‐enhancing traits at the invasion front. driven by spatial sorting. One such trait is the length of the forelimbs: invasion‐front toads have longer arms (relative to body length) in comparison with populations 10–20 years after invasion. Such a shift likely has fitness consequences: an increase of forearm length would decrease the strength with which a male could cling to a female during amplexus and so render such a male less competitive in competition for mates. compared to short‐armed conspecifics.

1079479,The evolution of competitive ability across a biological invasion: a study of cane toads in tropical Australia,2019,Gregory Stephen Clarke,,,,,University of Sydney,Invasive species must adapt to a suite of novel selective pressures as they colonise new territory. For example. theory predicts that selective forces at an invasion front will favour traits that enhance rates of dispersal and population growth. whereas selective forces in the range-core will favour traits that enhance competitive ability. To explore this idea. I conducted competition trials on three life stages of the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) from invasion-front and range-core populations in tropical Australia. For larval and early terrestrial-stage animals. I conducted experiments whereby the offspring of invasion-front and range-core adults were placed into mesocosms to compete for limited resources. To enable such experiments. I developed a simple method to mark each cohort of tadpoles. with minimal observed effects on growth or survival. Range-core larvae proved to be better competitors than invasion-front larvae. as predicted by evolutionary theory. Contrary to expectations. invasion-front metamorphs outcompeted range-core metamorphs. growing larger and winning more food. For adults. I focused on the trade-off between rapid dispersal versus success in male-male rivalry. Longer arms reduced the force required to displace an amplecting male from a female. When competing for a female. males with longer arms had lower likelihoods of retaining amplexus. I also explored how visual and acoustic cues influence the behaviour of sexually active males. Male toads used the presence of a chorus to increase their activity levels and as a cue to initiate amplexus. Males also used movement to identify potential mates. with increased rates of …,True,g4jwKI8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/21083,,,,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/21083/Clarke_GC_thesis.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

Thus. phenotypes on invasion fronts may evolve towards higher dispersal and reproductive rates. but at a cost to competitive ability. We test this idea by comparing populations of an invasive species from long-colonised areas (high densities. intense competition. weak selection on rates of dispersal and growth) with conspecifics from an invasion front (low densities. low competition. strong selection on rates of dispersal and growth). Our experiments with captive-raised larvae of cane toads (Rhinella marina) support this idea. Tadpoles from range-core populations were more effective competitors (based on rates of growth and development). especially against tadpoles from invasion-front populations. and especially when food was limited (intensifying competition for resources). Chemical cues from predators had equivalent effects on tadpoles from both populations (reducing larval period). as did food limitation (reducing survival rate and size at metamorphosis). The 84-year spread of cane toads across tropical Australia thus has been accompanied by a significant reduction in competitive ability of tadpoles on the invasion front. as predicted under the hypothesis that competitive ability may be traded off against dispersal and growth at an expanding range edge.,True,g4jwKI8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/21083/Clarke_GC_thesis.pdf?sequence=2#page=53,,,,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/21083/Clarke_GC_thesis.pdf?sequence=2#page=53,0,0,0

The effects of exposure to the vapors of two kinds of motor gasoline (vehicle fuel in Egypt). one leaded (G1) and the other unleaded (G2). on rat lungs were investigated. The studies involved the ultrastructural alterations as well as the oxidative stress burden. Long term inhalation of 1/5 LC50 of either G1 or G2 for 30 minutes daily along six consecutive weeks caused intensive histological alterations in the lining epithelial cells of the bronchioles. These changes included detachment and necrosis of the epithelial cells. Some bronchioles were even clogged with neoplastic cells. The electron micrographs of the bronchioles epithelial cells revealed dilatation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. loss of the secretory granules in the Clara cells and loss of cilia in the ciliated cells that exhibited bleb formation. In addition. prominent nuclear alterations were also seen in both types of cells. Necrotic type II pneumocytes. exhibited vacuolation and fragmentation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and degeneration of mitochondria. Nuclear alterations and degeneration of lamellar bodies. along with microvillar atrophy were also observed in type II pneumocytes. A significant increase in the lung total (TGSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione content as well as in the level of lipid peroxidation (LP) were found. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione-S-transferase (GST). glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) were also elevated.

Canine echinococcosis is an asymptomatic disease caused by adult tapeworms of E. granulosus sensu lato (s.l.). Information on the population structure and genetic variation of adult E. granulosus is limited. Using sequenced data of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) we examined the genetic diversity and population structure of adult tapeworms of  E. granulosus (G1 genotype) from canid definitive hosts originating from various  geographical regions and compared it to that reported for the larval metacestode  stage from sheep and human hosts. Echinococcus granulosus (s.s) was identified from adult tapeworm isolates from Kenya. Libya. Tunisia. Australia. China. Kazakhstan. United Kingdom and Peru. including the first known molecular confirmation from Gaza and the Falkland Islands. Haplotype analysis showed a star-shaped network with a centrally positioned common haplotype previously described for the metacestode stage from sheep and humans. and the neutrality indices indicated population expansion. Low Fst values suggested that populations of adult E. granulosus were not genetically differentiated. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities for E. granulosus isolates from sheep and human origin were twice as high as those reported from canid hosts. This may be related to self-fertilization of E. granulosus and/or to the longevity of the parasite in the respective intermediate and definitive hosts.

The results showed that 350 and 300 Gy doses significantly reduced the longevity of the 0–24 h old females and the 48–72 h old females. The younger females were more tolerant at lower dose rates than the older females. There was a quadratic relationship between dose rates and young females. while it was linear in older females. The total number of eggs laid by females of both ages was significantly reduced with a linear trend by 250 Gy irradiation.

Numerous studies in Drosophila have elucidated the mechanism of this repression in the adult germline. However. when and how transposable element repression is established during germline development has not been addressed.

In humans. the prostate. stimulated by environmentally regulated endocrine and local androgens. grows throughout adult life. We previously showed that in fly accessory glands. secondary cells (SCs) and their nuclei also grow in adults. a process enhanced by mating and controlled by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. Here. we demonstrate that BMP-mediated SC growth is dependent on the receptor for the developmental steroid ecdysone. whose concentration is reported to reflect sociosexual experience in adults. BMP signalling appears to regulate ecdysone receptor (EcR) levels via one or more mechanisms involving the EcR’s N terminus or the RNA sequence that encodes it. Nuclear growth in virgin males is dependent on ecdysone. some of which is synthesised in SCs. However. mating induces additional BMP-mediated nuclear growth via a cell type–specific form of hormone-independent EcR signalling. which drives genome endoreplication in a subset of adult SCs. Switching to hormone-independent endoreplication after mating allows growth and secretion to be hyperactivated independently of ecdysone levels in SCs. permitting more rapid replenishment of the accessory gland luminal contents. Our data suggest mechanistic parallels between this physiological. behaviour-induced signalling switch and altered pathological signalling associated with prostate cancer progression.,True,ccixiaQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000145,1647489497035511357,/scholar?cites=1647489497035511357,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000145,0,0,0

These ILVs are made in both late endosomes and recycling endosomes. the latter marked by the small GTPase Rab11 and generating exosomes with different cargos and functions. Core proteins within four Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) assemblies (0-III) play key sequential roles in late endosomal exosome biogenesis and ILV-mediated destruction of ubiquitinylated cargos through the endolysosomal system. They also control additional cellular processes. such as cytokinesis and other vesicle budding. By contrast. the functions of several accessory ESCRTs are not well defined. Here we assess the ESCRT-dependency of Rab11-exosomes. using RNA knockdown in Drosophila secondary cells (SCs) of the male accessory gland. which have unusually enlarged Rab11-positive compartments. Unexpectedly. not only are core proteins in all four ESCRT complexes required for Rab11-exosome formation. but also accessory ESCRT-III proteins. CHMP1. CHMP5 and IST1. Suppressing expression of these accessory proteins does not affect other aspects of cell morphology. unlike most core ESCRT knockdowns. and does not lead to accumulation of ubiquitinylated cargos. We conclude that accessory ESCRT-III components have a specific and potentially ubiquitin-independent role in Rab11-exosome generation. which might provide a target for blocking the pro-tumorigenic activities of these vesicles in cancer.,True,ccixiaQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.158725v1.abstract,9066460075577301873,/scholar?cites=9066460075577301873,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/18/2020.06.18.158725.full.pdf,0,0,0

Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a rich source of autogenous cytokines and growth factors; it has been proven to effectively improve soft tissue healing and hard tissue regeneration. This study sought to compare the clinical application of freeze-dried bone allografts (FDBA) and PRF for alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction.Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 32 patients presenting for the extraction of hopeless non-molar teeth. The teeth were extracted with minimal trauma. and the samples were randomly divided into two groups (n= 16). Tooth sockets were filled with either FDBA or PRF (prepared using 10cc of the patient’s blood). Bone regeneration was assessed by evaluating changes in horizontal and vertical bone dimensions after 12 weeks (the time of implant placement) using an acrylic stent fabricated before tooth extraction and a periodontal probe. The results were compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA; P< 0.05).Results: Ridge width showed a significant reduction compared to the baseline in both groups (P= 0.001); ridge height changes were not significant (P> 0.05). The evaluated groups did not show any significant difference in height/width changes (P> 0.05).Conclusion: The results showed an acceptable efficacy for PRF without graft materials in alveolar ridge preservation. This material is cost-effective and could be easily prepared.

1079557,-What drives fish community structure on Posidonia oceanica meadows? A review of available data across the Mediterranean basin,2015,Ivana Zubak and Stewart Tyre Schultz and Claudia Kruschel,,,,47,,The importance of seagrass meadows as a habitat for fish assemblages has been documented in numerous studies worldwide. Posidonia oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean provide valuable habitat for fish species. including food sources and refuge from predators for juveniles and adults. We assembled all published research on fish assemblages associated with P. oceanica meadows. and performed a meta-analysis that tests hypotheses regarding the drivers of community structure across all of these studies. We found a total of 14 published research articles containing fish species abundance data at P. oceanica meadows between 1982 and 2010. with an average of just under two sampled fish communities per study. The results show the presence of 112 taxa (fish richness ranging from 27 to 53 per paper. 41 on average). in P. oceanica meadows within a depth range from 1.0 to 40.0 meters. Studies varied in sampling method (skid trawl. visual census. beam trawl). time of day (day/night). and protection level (MPA/non-MPA). The geographical location of the sampling sites ranged from 38.15 to 44.38 N and from 0.50 W to 18.48 E. Of the physical predictor variables. the survey method had the most significant effect on the community abundance matrix. but latitude. as expected. was also a significant influence in PERMANOVA analyses. In addition. we found that total predator abundance. total resident predator abundance. and total transient predator abundance each individually had a significant effect on the remaining fish community.

The implementation of management practices relies on data collected through monitoring activities. The monitoring of fish assemblages using the standard non-destructive methods requires significant financial resources and time. A new approach to monitoring fish assemblages in the coastal waters was recently implemented in the Mediterranean – Fish Assemblage Survey Technique (FAST). It is based on Citizen Science where trained volunteer divers collect the data following a pre-established protocol. Considering the differences in species presence/absence and their sizes between the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea. a modification of the method was necessary.

The Influence of Non-Formal Marine Science Education,2020,Melita Mokos and Giulia Realdon and Ivana Zubak Čižmek,12,Sustainability,24,10647,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Even though the ocean is a defining feature on Earth that regulates climate and provides oxygen. food. and jobs. students still have low to moderate marine and ocean literacy knowledge. Ocean literacy is an understanding of the ocean’s influence on people and people’s influence on the ocean. It is an emerging need necessary for ensuring the sustainability of the ocean and its resources. The UN has declared a Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. and one of the priority research and development areas is ocean literacy. Unfortunately. marine science and ocean literacy topics are poorly represented in school curricula across the world. This study presents the level of marine knowledge in a sample of primary school students before and after different themed non-formal educational interventions and the effect of non-formal educational activities on students’ knowledge. These activities led to significant increase in the knowledge level three weeks after they were performed. indicating the retention of gained information. Performed educational activities and knowledge transfer from graduate level to primary school level significantly increased the level of students’ knowledge. and consequently ocean literacy. and revealed some of the learning misconceptions. Results of this study show that there is a need for an integrated approach to the teaching of Ocean Literacy starting from the early grades by combining teacher’s professional development. strengthening ocean-related topics in school curricula. and promoting non-formal educational activities.

Mitochondrial malfunction or defects in any of the many pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis can lead to degenerative diseases and possibly play an important part in aging. Materials and Methods Because of the mitochondrial relationship with some factors such as matrix proteins. cell cycle and evolution. in this review article we examined the mitochondrial relationship with these factors and mechanisms. The data were extracted from NCBI and SID databases. Results Changes and mutations in mitochondria are common in most of the molecular processes and important diseases including cancer. but these mutations do not result in mitochondria deactivation. Investigating these pathways helps us to identify and treat diseases such as cancer. Conclusions   The mitochondria is the most important source of cellular energy supply. and mitochondrial damage can interfere with cellular activity and reduce the amount of energy produced and increase the production of free radicals. Mitochondria biogenesis is one of the protective methods of the cell against oxidative stress. which has a cell protective role. Keywords: Mitochondria . Organelle Biogenesis .

Dhaka. during the period from March 2007 to June 2007 to study the influence of different leaf clipping and fertilizer doses on growth and seed yield of mungbean. The trial comprised four treatments on leaf clipping (No removal. removal of new leaves developed after first flowering. removal of subtending leaves beneath the inflorescences and removal of empty leaves). and three treatments on fertilizer doses per hector (10 kg N+ 20 kg P2O5+ 15 kg K2O. 20 kg N+ 40 kg P2O5+ 30 kg K2O and 30 kg N+ 60 kg P2O5+ 45 kg K2O). Results showed that the leaf clipping treatments had significant effect on growth and yield parameters. Removal of empty leaves resulted in the highest dry matters from root. inflorescences with yield and all the yield attributes as well. The fertilizer doses also affected the studied parameter significantly. The highest values on most of the growth and yield parameters were obtained with 20 kg N+ 40 kg P2O5+ 30 kg K2O/ha.

1079584,ADOPTION OF SELECTED WHEAT VARIETIES BY THE FARMERS IN SAINTARA UNION UNDER DINAJPUR DISTRICT,2006,BULBUL AHMED,,,,,,Bangladesh is an agricultural country. The country’s population is 137 million with high density of 928/sqkm (Bangladesh Economic Survey. 2005). About 79.9 percent of its population lives in rural areas and 62 percent of the country's total labour force are engaged in agriculture (BBS. 2005). The total land area of Bangladesh is 14.84 million hectare of which 8.29 million hectare are cultivable land and total cropped area is 14.109 million hectare of which 8.022 million hectare are net cropped area (BBS. 2005). In 2003-04 fiscal year production of food crop was 27.6 million metric tons whereas Aus 1.83 million metric tons. Aman 11.52 million metric tons. Boro 12.83 metric tons. wheat 1.25 million metric tons and maize 2.41 lakh metric tons (Bangladesh Economic Survey. 2005). Different natural calamities or disasters such as flood. drought. cyclone. tidal bore etc. affect the rice production. As a result rice production becomes uncertain. In this situation the cultivation of wheat can be given priority for solution of food crisis.Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops and main staple food crops in the world. About two-third of the world’s population use wheat as staple food (Majumder. 1991). Dubin and Grinkel (1991) reported that in the recent years the largest area of wheat cultivation in the warmer climates exists in the South-East Asia including Bangladesh. India and Nepal. In 2004-2005. the wheat production. seeds required 79000 metric tones. current supply rate 17.98% and present production 14208 metric tons (BBS. 2005).

1079585,International Journal of Applied Research,,AHM Motiur Rahman Talukder and Bulbul Ahmed and Lutfun Nahar and KM Fahid and Jubaidur Rahman Hossain and Santosh Kumar Paul,,,,,,Bangladesh is the world’s eighth largest country in terms of population. About 65% of the population depends on the farming sector for their livelihood. Cultivable land is declining by one percent of cultivable land area in every year due to establishment of new road and highways. buildings. industries. markets etc.(BBS. 2011). On the other hand. due to geographical location Bangladesh is very much vulnerable and is in the risky position to climate change of the world. These will cause a serious shortage of cultivable land for crop production and a severe food shortage to feed her people in near future. Under this situation. there is a vast scope of growing more crops in unutilized char lands. The inventory of main river char lands estimated their total area at 8.444 km2 or almost 6% of Bangladesh (FAP 16/19. 1993a). In 1992-93. this comprised 33% unprotected main land and 67% char land. So introduction of suitable high yielding varieties of rabi crops such as wheat. pulse. oil seed and vegetable enabling to grow in the drought and less soil moisture condition eventually would increase farm productivity and ensure food security as a whole which will reduce the poverty level of the poor farmers in char land areas. Farmers cultivate wheat as a sole crop in all over the country but it is a low yielded crop compare to boro rice. As a result the farmers discourage themselves to cultivate wheat. Under this situation short duration rabi vegetables. leguminous and oil seed crops can be easily accommodated as intercrop between the wheat rows.Intercropping is a system of management of crop which involves growing of two or more dissimilar crop species or …,True,r5Jk-qAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bulbul_Ahmed2/publication/309310968_Enhancement_of_farm_productivity_through_intercropping_of_vegetables_pulse_and_oilseed_crops_with_wheat_at_Jamuna_Char_area_of_Islampur_in_Jamalpur_District/links/5808dd7a08aeef21df0e7594/Enhancement-of-farm-productivity-through-intercropping-of-vegetables-pulse-and-oilseed-crops-with-wheat-at-Jamuna-Char-area-of-Islampur-in-Jamalpur-District.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bulbul_Ahmed2/publication/309310968_Enhancement_of_farm_productivity_through_intercropping_of_vegetables_pulse_and_oilseed_crops_with_wheat_at_Jamuna_Char_area_of_Islampur_in_Jamalpur_District/links/5808dd7a08aeef21df0e7594/Enhancement-of-farm-productivity-through-intercropping-of-vegetables-pulse-and-oilseed-crops-with-wheat-at-Jamuna-Char-area-of-Islampur-in-Jamalpur-District.pdf,0,0,0
1079586,International Journal of Applied Research,,Bulbul Ahmed and Obaydur Rahman and Md Mushfiqul Islam and Ruby Akter and Mousumi Sultana,2411,Journal homepage: http://intjar. com; ISSN,,6610,,Sodium and chloride are typically viewed as waste ions that plants do not need. This can be true if their levels are high in a water source; however. research has shown that plants do use these elements in small quantities. Now before anyone raids the spice rack for the table salt and add it to your fertilizer stock tank. most water sources contain sufficient levels of both elements so their deficiencies are rare. Sodium is not an essential element for plants but can be used in small quantities. similar to micronutrients. to aid in metabolism and synthesis of chlorophyll. In some plants. it can be used as a partial replacement for potassium and aids in the opening and closing of stomata. which helps regulate internal water balance. Chloride is needed in small quantities and aids in plant metabolism. photosynthesis. osmosis (movement of water in and out of plant cells) and ionic balance within the cell. Sodium deficiency does not appear to exhibit any symptoms since it is not an essential element. Chloride deficiency can occur if there is consistently less than 2 ppm chloride in the growing medium and the symptoms appear as chlorotic blotches with necrotic spots located between the veins or on the margins of the younger leaves.In advanced cases. chloride deficiency could cause plant wilting. Both deficiencies rarely occur since most water sources provide them and fertilizers often have them as impurities.

It increases an important constraint to crop productivity and yield stability worldwide. It is by far the leading environmental stress in agriculture and cause worldwide loss in crop yield (Shahram et al. 2009). The vast majority of the poor in dry lands depend on agriculture. And drought is the principal constraint of crop production in these areas. It may be defined as periods in the natural cycle of stress and renewal during which the amount of moisture in the soil no longer meets the needs of a particular crop. Drought occurs frequently in dry lands. partly because average rainfall is low. ranging across locations and years from an average of about 300 to 800 millimeters per annum. but also because it may be highly erratic. with torrential storms during the cropping season. followed by long dry spells. One of the most crucial functions of plant cells is their ability to respond to alterations in their environment. Understanding the connections between initial responses and the downstream events that constitute successful adjustment to its fluctuating environment is one of the challenges of plant biology research. Investigations on transcript level are the most common studies so far. Besides transcript analyses. new technologies based on mass spectrometry allow for the comprehensive study on metabolite and protein level.

Sustainable intensification and diversification in small farms can achieve these outcomes and often take the form of integration among farm resources to achieve sustainable livelihood. However. such integration is promoted in the form of integrated farming system (IFS) models as a single farm innovation for the smallholder systems of developing countries without considering the heterogeneity and priorities of farm families. Using the sustainable livelihoods (SL) framework. we propose a modified model for IFS promotion. particularly applicable for developing nations. The model modifies the standard SL model and illustrates how. based on the resources and vulnerabilities of small farms. IFS needs to be customised to achieve multifunctional benefits for smallholder farmers depending on the locations. It should first integrate the available assets of a farm. and then consider the micro-intervention that are strategically designed in a conscious livelihood based on their socioeconomic. bio-physical. political. and cultural situations.

1079608,Identifying Sustainability Assessment Indicators for Assessing the Sustainability of Smallholder Integrated Farms in Coastal West Bengal. India,2017,Purnabha Dasgupta and Rupak Goswami and Md Nasim Ali and Somsubhra Chakraborty and Subhrajit Saha,,"Asian Journal of Agricultural Extension, Economics & Sociology",,1-14,,Smallholder integrated farming system (IFS) is debated as an alternative to conventional external input driven commercial farming in developing nations. The sustainability of IFS is the key to secure sustainable livelihoods of millions of small and marginal farmers and they need to be monitored and assessed precisely. This asks for a valid set of sustainability assessment indicators that envisage the social. economic and ecological dimensions of sustainability and are validated by the agri-experts working in a specific agroclimatic zone. The present study was conducted to screen sustainability assessment indicators for IFS. in the context of coastal agroclimatic zone of West Bengal. India. Guided by an indicator framework. a pool of 87 indicators were scouted and given to the local agri-experts for rating their relevance against a 4-point scale. Based on the weighted mean score of the indicators. ease of access to them. cost of their measurement. clarity of the indicators to the experts and their redundancy. local agri-experts screened 52 indicators covering the social. economic and ecological dimensions of sustainability. The important selected Ecological indicators were Biomass availability. Soil organic Carbon. Depth of ground water table. Soil macronutrient etc. Similarly. important Economic indicators were Cost of cultivation. Ownership of land. Input sources. Off-farm income etc. and Social indicators were Gender equity. Adherence to local culture.

1079609,Resource Interaction in Smallholder Farms is Linked to Farm Sustainability: Evidence from Indian Sundarbans,2020,Rupak Goswami and Sonja Brodt and Sangita Patra and Purnabha Dasgupta and Biswanath Mukherjee and Somen Nandi,,,,,Preprints,Shrinking farm size and fragile farm resources pose a significant challenge to the sustainability of small-scale farms. Efficient resource utilization in small-scale farms is crucial to achieving farm sustainability through endogenous mechanisms. However. the precise mechanisms to integrate physical resources to achieve farm sustainability are not very clear yet. By capturing the interaction among farm resources as a network phenomenon. we identify the discrete resource interactions (RIs) in different types of small-scale farms of Indian Sundarbans. which are associated with higher farm sustainability. Thirty-two linkages. 11 reciprocal linkages. 22 triads. and three ‘core elements’ that occurred and cooccurred on highly sustainable farms are found to be critical in achieving farm sustainability. Using the properties of resource interaction networks as explanators of farm sustainability. we anticipate that sustainability in small-scale farms can be achieved by strategically creating new RIs on the farm. However. there may be limitations to such achievement depending on the nature of RI and type of farm. The analytical approach helps to understand the structural basis of sustainability in small-scale farms. and this approach can be used to achieve farm sustainability through the strategic integration of existing farm resources in the smallholder systems.,True,_KbEz18AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202012.0311,,,,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202012.0311/download/final_file,0,0,0

Conyza dioscoridis (L.) Desf. and Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist. It comprises a genetic and chemical characterization of the plants. as well as an evaluation of their biological activities. The DNA fingerprints of the two species were established based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure using ten decamer primers. Further characterization of the plants was performed via determination of pharmacopœial constants. phytochemical screening and estimation of phenolic content (total phenolics. tannins and flavonoids). The ethanol (70%) extracts of C. dioscoridis (EECD) and C. bonariensis (EECB) were subjected to acute toxicity study to determine their LD50; the anti-inflammatory. antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities were then evaluated. Screening for potential cytotoxicity was carried out both by Brine Shrimp Lethality Test and Sulphorodamine-B assay on three human cell lines viz.. breast carcinoma (MCF7). colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) and cervical carcinoma (HELA) cell lines. The DNA profiling revealed a similarity index of 88.89% between the investigated species. The variability observed among the pharmacopoeial constants constitute a valuable differential criterion; the total ash. acid insoluble ash. water soluble ash and crude fiber values obtained for C. bonariensis exceeded (17. 5. 10 and 3.5%. respectively) those for C. dioscoridis; meanwhile. the moisture content was higher (10%) in the latter.

Random samplings were made from two greenhouses of Biskra. in the Southeast of Algeria. About 750 to 800 plants of the Sahara variety of tomatoes were planted in both greenhouses. In the laboratory. conditions with temperature. relative humidity (RH) and the photoperiod were 25 to 30 C. from 50% to 60% and 16L: 8D. respectively. A breeding of our species in the laboratory was made during six months of the study. For the toxicological assessments. three concentrations were chosen; 50 mg/L. 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L of the extracts. The results revealed that the extracts of C. annuum were very effective against the larvae of T. absoluta. After 24 h post-treatment. the mortality was less than 25% compared to that after 48h and 72h post-treatment which exceeded 50%. There was a non-significant difference in mortality rates between the four larval stages (F 3. 140= 1.12; P= 0.344).

Res.,,1-8,,Metabolic profiles were detected in healthy and flacherie (inoculated with Bacillus sp.) and grasserie (inoculated with polyhedral bodies)-diseased Bombyx mori larvae. Free amino acids were separated and quantitatively determined by using hydrolysis method. Further. nitrogen (N) percentage was estimated with micro-Kieldahl method. Whereas. phosphor-molybdate method was applied for phosphorus (P) analysis. Results revealed that distinct differences in the amounts of eighteen individual amino acids in healthy and diseased silkworm 5th larval instar were found. The highest amino acids concentration was recorded in healthy larvae (224.05 mg/g tissue). while the lowest concentration was found in Gr-diseased larvae (177.77 mg/g tissue). Fl-diseased larvae inoculated with Bacillus sp. showed elevation in certain amino acids comparing with Gr-diseased larvae inoculated with of Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV) occluded bodies.

1079664,Graduate Teaching Assistants Can Affect Undergraduate STEM Retention Rates: A Need For Graduate Teaching Professional Development,2015,Stephanie A Lockwood,36,Proceedings of the Association for Biology Laboratory Education,,64,,The first two years of college are the most crucial for undergraduate retention. and less than 40% of entering students actually completes a science. technology. engineering. and mathematics (STEM) degree (PCAST. 2012). Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) play a vital role in biology departments across most universities by teaching the majority of introductory laboratories and discussion sections (Travers. 1989; Luft et al.. 2004; O’Neal et al.. 2007). Though GTAs are not directly attributed to attrition rates of undergraduate STEM majors. attrition rates can be linked with lab climate which is influenced by GTAs (O’Neal et al.. 2007; Brown et al.. 2009). However. most GTA teaching at universities and colleges is done without any formal training and this could have a serious effect on STEM retention rates (DeHaan. 2005; Tanner and Allen. 2006). This research examines the effects of a biology pedagogy course on GTA teaching confidence and teaching concept awareness. Biological pedagogy is a three credit course which is required to be taken the first semester a GTA is teaching. The course focuses on reflective teaching. mentorship by experienced GTAs. and professional development. Based on pre-assessment surveys. GTAs walk into their first day being confident in their teaching abilities; however. they had minimal knowledge of basic teaching concepts. Across all teaching concepts.

However. it is unclear how the functions of SNIP1 in the TGF-β signaling pathway are controlled. Our present studies show that SNIP1 is covalently modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) in vitro and in vivo at three lysine sites: Lys5. Lys30. and Lys108. with Lys30 being the major SUMO modification site. SUMOylation of SNIP1 is enhanced by SUMO E3 ligase PIAS proteins and inhibited by SUMO proteases SENP1/2. Furthermore. we find that SUMOylation of SNIP1 attenuates its inhibitory effect in TGF-β signaling because the SUMO-conjugated form of SNIP1 exhibits impaired ability to disrupt the formation of Smad complex and the interaction between p300 and Smads.

Cytokine-mediated inflammation has been thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of ICNV. The purpose of this study was to investigate serum cytokine profiles in patients with ICNV and to explore the relationship between serum cytokine levels and ICNV severity. This case-control study was conducted in 32 ICNV patients and 30 healthy volunteers. Clinical and demographic information was obtained from the medical data platform and the serum was analysed with a multiplex assay to determine the levels of seven cytokines: interleukin (IL)-2. IL-10. IL-15. IL-17. basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF). granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Serum levels of IL-2. IL-10. IL-17. basic FGF. and VEGF were elevated in ICNV patients compared to controls. Serum GM-CSF levels were positively related to central retinal thickness. and serum IL-17 levels were positively related to CNV lesion area.

Adult mammalian hearts have poor regenerative capacity and are not capable of self-repair after injury. Recent studies of cell-free therapeutics such as those designed to stimulate endogenous cardiac regeneration have uncovered new feasible therapeutic avenues for cardiac repair. The Hippo pathway. a fundamental pathway with pivotal roles in cell proliferation. survival and differentiation. has tremendous potential for therapeutic manipulation in cardiac regeneration. In this review. we summarize the most recent studies that have revealed the function of the Hippo pathway in heart regeneration and homeostasis. In particular. we discuss the molecular mechanisms of how the Hippo pathway maintains cardiac homeostasis by directing cardiomyocyte chromatin remodeling and regulating the cell-cell communication between cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes in the heart.

Via heterophilic Crb2a-Crb2b interactions. the apicobasal polarity protein Crb2b restricts the asymmetric planar distribution of Crb2a in photoreceptors. The planar polarized Crumbs proteins thus balance intercellular adhesions and tension between photoreceptors. thereby stabilizing the geometric organization of cone mosaics. Notably. loss of Crb2b in zebrafish induces a nearsightedness-like phenotype in zebrafish accompanied by an elongated eye axis and impairs zebrafish visual perception for predation.

However. they also have various activities in animals. For example. kinetin and trans-zeatin can reduce levels of several aging markers in human fibroblasts. Kinetin can also protect mice against oxidative and glyoxidative stress. and prolong fruit flies’ lifespan. Additionally. several cytokinins are currently used in cosmetics. To extend knowledge of the breadth of cytokinins’ activities. we examined effects of natural cytokinin bases on the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that kinetin. para-topolin and meta-topolin prolonged the lifespan of C. elegans. Kinetin also protected the organism against oxidative and heat stress.

Cham,Cytokinins are phytohormones that regulate plant growth. development and senescence. Experiments both in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that they can also have diverse effects on animal cells and tissues. Particularly interesting is their ability to protect cells against various forms of stress and prevent some detrimental effects of cell aging. For example. human skin fibroblasts cultured in the presence of kinetin or trans-zeatin retain some characteristics of cells of lower passage. Kinetin is even able to increase the lifespan of invertebrates. In this chapter. we review protective effects of cytokinins in animals at molecular. cellular. tissue and organismal levels. We also discuss potential application of cytokinins for the treatment of age-related diseases. including neurodegenerations. inflammatory diseases and disorders caused by aberrant cell proliferation.,True,bkMhMD8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,8,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-63001-4_14,17694796845936473658,/scholar?cites=17694796845936473658,,,0,0,0

The realignment of Miro2 is tightly regulated by PINK1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser325/Ser430 and by Ca2+ binding to EF2 domain. which are both essential for the subsequent Parkin translocation. Interestingly. ablation of Miro2 in mouse causes delayed reticulocyte maturation. lactic acidosis and cardiac disorders.

Plant extracts are a cocktail of compounds which act synergically and can improve treatment effectiveness. reduce therapeutic duration and resistance. The ethanolic extracts of leaves and seeds of Cucurbita pepo ovifera var ovifera from Sudano-Guinean and Sudano-Sahelian zones of Cameroon were evaluated on the cattle parasite nematode Onchocerca ochengi. Worms were incubated with different concentrations of the plant extracts in RPMI-1640 supplemented with streptomycin and gentamicin. Mortality at 37 C was monitored after 24. 48 and 72 h. Ivermectin was used as positive control and DMSO as negative. Plant extracts from the two ecological zones showed anthelminthic activities on O. ochengi after 72 h with LC 50 varying from 20 to 1090 µg/mL. The highest antifilarial activity in Sudano-Guinean zone was obtained with leave extract of C. pepo ovifera (LC 50 of 20 µg/mL). while highest antifilarial activity in Sudano-Sahelian zone was obtained with seed extracts of the plant with LC 50 value of 17 µg/mL after 72 h. These results show that anthelmintic activity depends on the part of the plant and the ecological zones. Additionally. the plant is not toxic. These results on the ethanolic extracts of leaves and seeds of C. pepo ovifera var ovifera confirmed the use of this plant in traditional medicine in Cameroon to treat disease due to nematodes.

A 1.5-fold down-regulation of hTERT mRNA expression and decreases in CD3. CD4. CD8. and CD95 presentation and IL-4 and TNFα secretion were observed. Jurkat T cell inactivation was not correlated with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and was not mediated by TiO 2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 14±8 nm at doses of 1 mg/L or 10 mg/L. The inhibitory effect of the rTOC (R a= 2.2–3.7 μm) on the survival of Jurkat T cells (Spearman’s coefficient r s=− 0.95; n= 9; p< 0.0001) was demonstrated by an increase in the necrotic cell count among the cell population. In turn. an elevation of the Ra index of the rTOC was accompanied by a linear increase (r= 0.6; p< 0.000001. n= 60) in the magnitude of the negative electrostatic potential of the titanium oxide surface. Thus. the roughness of the rTOC induces an electrostatic potential and decreases the viability of the immortalized Jurkat T cells through mechanisms unrelated to ROS generation. This may be useful for replacement surgery applications of rough TiO 2 implants in cancer patients.

Here we found that TORC1 is selectively activated in the second mitotic wave (SMW). the terminal synchronous cell division. of the developing Drosophila eye. We demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates TORC1 through E2F1 and the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in the SMW. and this regulation is independent from insulin and amino acid signaling pathways. TORC1 is necessary for the proper G1/S transition of the cells. and the activation of TORC1 rescues the cell-cycle defect of Hh signaling-deficient cells in the SMW. Based on this evolutionarily conserved regulation of TORC1 by Hh signaling. we propose that Hh-dependent developmental …,True,MgoANhIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,18,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580717305968,1283707158512659256,/scholar?cites=1283707158512659256,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1534580717305968,0,0,0

The precise mechanism of how mTORC1 moves in and out of the lysosome is yet to be elucidated in detail. Here we report that microtubules and the motor protein KIF11 are required for the proper dissociation of mTORC1 from the lysosome upon amino acid scarcity. When microtubules are disrupted or KIF11 is knocked down. we observe that mTORC1 localizes to the lysosome even in the amino acid-starved situation where it should be dispersed in the cytosol. causing an elevated mTORC1 activity. Moreover. in the mechanistic perspective. we discover that mTORC1 interacts with KIF11 on the motor domain of KIF11. enabling the complex to move out of the lysosome along …,True,MgoANhIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468583/,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7468583/,0,0,0

With a rising incidence due to the global ageing of the world population. it is estimated that over 322 million patients will be affected in 2025. While not being a lifethreatening disease. ED has a strong detrimental impact on the patientâ s quality of life. commonly leading to a reduction of work productivity. anxiety. chronic stress. depression or loss of self-esteem. Despite all the recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology of ED. and the discovery of effective oral treatments that are the PDE5 inhibitors (such as ViagraÂ®). there is still an important portion of the population that does not respond to this therapy. Therefore. they unfortunately resort on problematic. uncomfortable. and invasive last-resort solutions due to the lack of better alternatives. In addition. current treatments are inducing assisted erection rather than handling the root cause of the disease. Considering the limited number of strategies currently existing for the treatment of ED and their drawbacks. there is an urgent need for alternative therapies. Due to the fact that both vascular and neural components are required to induce and maintain a satisfactory erectile response. as well as the multifactorial origins of ED. new therapies able to combine multidisciplinary approaches would increase the chances of new treatment success.

The effect of this probiotic on lifespan. however. is unknown. In the present study. we investigated the effect of CBM 588 on lifespan and multiple-stress resistance using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. When adult C. elegans were fed a standard diet of Escherichia coli OP50 or CBM 588. the lifespan of the animals fed CBM 588 was significantly longer than that of animals fed OP50. In addition. the animals fed CBM588 exhibited higher locomotion at every age tested. Moreover. the worms fed CBM 588 were more resistant to certain stressors. including infections with pathogenic bacteria. UV irradiation. and the metal stressor Cu 2+. CBM 588 failed to extend the lifespan of the daf-2/insulin-like receptor. daf-16/FOXO and skn-1/Nrf2 mutants. In conclusion. CBM 588 extends the lifespan of C. elegans probably through regulation of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway and the Nrf2 transcription factor. and CBM 588 improves resistance to several stressors in C. elegans.

They are hard to isolate from their intermediate hosts. and their early life stages are difficult to identify morphologically. Therefore. primers were developed for trematodes to create a species barcoding system and allow selective PCR amplification in mixed samples. The specific oligonucleotide primer was universal for trematodes that infected several freshwater snail species in Israel. The diagnostic tool is based on the 18S rDNA gene. In contrast to morphological identification. trematode barcoding is rapid as it is based on a sequence of only 800 bp. and it classifies species accurately due to high polymorphism between conserved areas.,True,5u1JgekAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,24,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00436-014-3903-z,13291844356408894452,/scholar?cites=13291844356408894452,,,0,0,0

However. there is growing awareness that hybridisation between different species may play a constructive role in animal evolution as a means to create variability. Thus. hybridisation and introgression may contribute to adaptive evolution. for example with regards to natural antagonists (parasites. predators. competitors) and adaptation to local environmental conditions. Here we investigated whether parasite intensity contributes to the continuous recreation of hybrids in 74 natural populations of Melanopsis. a complex of freshwater snails with three species. We also examined. under laboratory conditions. whether hybrids and their parental taxa differ in their tolerance of low and high temperatures and salinity levels. Infections were consistently less prevalent in males than in females. and lower in snails from deeper …,True,5u1JgekAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751914001957,12850880962011425101,/scholar?cites=12850880962011425101,,,0,0,0
