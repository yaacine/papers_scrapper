Researchers acknowledge the possibilities of distinguishing between measurement and structural models and explicitly taking measurement error into account. As Gefen. Straub. and Boudreau (2000. p. 6) point out.‘‘SEM has become de rigueur in validating instruments and testing linkages between constructs.’’They furthermore distinguish between two families of SEM techniques: covariance-based techniques. as represented by LISREL. and variance-based techniques. of which partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is the most prominent representative. PLS has been used by a growing number of researchers from various disciplines such as strategic management (eg. Hulland. 1999). management information systems (eg. Dibbern. Goles.

For variance-based structural equation modeling. such as partial least squares. the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the examination of cross-loadings are the dominant approaches for evaluating discriminant validity. By means of a simulation study. we show that these approaches do not reliably detect the lack of discriminant validity in common research situations. We therefore propose an alternative approach. based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix. to assess discriminant validity: the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations. We demonstrate its superior performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study. in which we compare the new approach to the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the assessment of (partial) cross-loadings.

We contend that the alleged shortcomings           of PLS are not due to problems with the technique. but instead to three problems with           Rönkkö and Evermann’s study: (a) the adherence to the common factor model. (b) a very           limited simulation designs. and (c) overstretched generalizations of their findings.           Whereas Rönkkö and Evermann claim to be dispelling myths about PLS. they have in reality           created new myths that we. in turn. debunk. By examining their claims. our article           contributes to reestablishing a constructive discussion of the PLS method and its           properties.

The journal received 41 articles for its special issue on PLS-SEM. twelve of which completed a thorough review process successfully. Based on the number of high quality manuscripts. a decision was made to split the special issue. In the first Long Range Planning special issue on PLS-SEM in strategic management (Hair et al.. 2012a; Robins. 2012). the focus was on methodological developments and their application (Becker et al.. 2012; Furrer et al.. 2012; Gudergan et al.. 2012; Hair et al.. 2012a. b. c; Money et al.. 2012; Rigdon. 2012). This second special issue provides a forum for topical issues that demonstrate the usefulness of PLS-SEM by piloting applications of this method in the field of strategic management with strong implications for strategic research and practice. As such. the special issue targets two audiences: academics involved in the fields of strategy and management. and practitioners such as consultants.

1274687,The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling,1998,Wynne W Chin,295,Modern methods for business research,2,295-336,,Among structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. by far the most well known are covariance—based methods as exemplified by software such as LISREL. EQS. AMOS. SEPATH. and RAMONA. In fact. to many social science researchers. the covariance-based procedure is tautologically synonymous with the term SEM. Yet. an alternative and less widespread technique known as partial least squares (PLS) is also available for researchers interested in doing SEM-based analysis. Depending on the researcher’s Objectives and epistemic view of data to theory. properties of the data at hand. or level of theoretical knowledge and measurement development. the PLS approach can be argued to be more suitable.PLS can be a powerful method of analysis because of the minimal demands on measurement scales (ie. do measures need to be at an interval or ratio level?). sample size. and residual distributions (Wold. 1985). Although PLS can be used for theory confirmation. it can also be used to suggest where relationships might or might not exist and to suggest propositions for testing later. Compared to the better known factor-based covariance—fit—ting approach for latent structural modeling. the component-based PLS avoids two serious problems: inadmissible solutions and factor indetermi-nacy (Fornell 8r Bookstein. 1982). Because the iterative algorithm performed in a PLS analysis generally consists of a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) analyses. identification is not a problem for recursive models nor does it presume any distributional form for measured variables. The utility Of the PLS method has been documented elsewhere (Falk & …,True,SykbscsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,20651,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EDZ5AgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA295&dq=info:Aw8igoiRolQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=49qJ7su4jj&sig=WtCTgUVUDisD6kAkOTLx81LZMcY,6098596860897922819,/scholar?cites=6098596860897922819,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Witold_Orlik/post/I_need_a_step_by_step_methodology_of_generalized_least_squares_estimation_in_structural_equation_modelling_as_popularly_seen_for_ML/attachment/59d620d379197b807797f44a/AS%3A292763124944898%401446811576464/download/1998+The+Partial+Least+Squares+Approach+to+SEM+chapter.pdf,0,0,0

Part of the reason may be the increase in software packages to perform such covariance-based (eg. LISREL. EQS. AMOS. SEPA-TH. RAMONA. MX. and CALIS) and component-based (eg. PLS-PC. PLS-Graph) analysis. Viewed as a coupling of two traditions-an econometric perspective focusing on prediction and a psychometric emphasis that models concepts as latent (unobserved) variables that are indirectly inferred from multi-ple observed measures (alternately termed as indicators or manifest variables)-SEM has allowed social scientists to perform path analytic modeling with latent variables (LVs). which in turn has led some to describe this approach as an example of"" a second generation of multivariate analysis""(Fornell 1987. p. 408).When …",True,SykbscsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,8917,https://www.jstor.org/stable/249674,12027980706089964734,/scholar?cites=12027980706089964734,,,https://www.misq.org/misq/downloads/download/editorial/314/,0,0,0

Within the IS discipline. a significant percentage of research has been devoted to examining the conditions and contexts under which relationships may vary. often under the general umbrella of contingency theory (cf. McKeen et al. 1994. Weill and Olson 1989). In our survey of such studies. the majority failed to either detect or provide an estimate of the effect size. In cases where effect sizes are estimated. the numbers are generally small.

The technology acceptance model (TAM) has a base in psychological research. is parsimonious. explains usage behavior quite well. and can be operationalized with valid and reliable instruments.

Heidelberg,Along with the development of scientific disciplines. namely social sciences. hypothesized relationships become increasingly more complex. Besides the examination of direct effects. researchers are more and more interested in moderating effects. Moderating effects are evoked by variables whose variation influences the strength or the direction of a relationship between an exogenous and an endogenous variable. Investigators using partial least squares path modeling need appropriate means to test their models for such moderating effects. We illustrate the identification and quantification of moderating effects in complex causal structures by means of Partial Least Squares Path Modeling. We also show that group comparisons. i.e. comparisons of model estimates for different groups of observations. represent a special case of moderating effects by having the grouping variable as a categorical moderator …,True,ZaVrhs8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1312,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-32827-8_31,18127217576202784946,/scholar?cites=18127217576202784946,,,https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=55d9702360614b08768b45c7&assetKey=AS%3A273837281742855%401442299303270#page=728,0,0,0

It can be obtained as a series of simple and multiple regressions. By taking advantage from the statistical tests associated with linear regression. it is feasible to select the significant explanatory variables to include in PLS regression and to choose the number of PLS components to retain. The principle of the presented algorithm may be similarly used in order to yield an extension of PLS regression to PLS generalised linear regression. The modifications to classical PLS regression. the case of PLS logistic regression and the application of PLS generalised linear regression to survival data are studied in detail.

We use structural equation modeling for testing our research hypotheses on a large sample of Italian firms. and estimate the structural paths between constructs by means of both covariance- and component-based approaches.

IX) has recognised that.“a common and serious mistake often committed by research is used to inadvertently apply formative indicators in a (covariance-based) SEM analysis.” This measurement model specification concern has also been empirically proven by Jarvis. Mackenzie and Podsakoff (2003) who highlighted the magnitude of the problem. They found that 29% of constructs were modeled incorrectly. In the majority of cases items should have been treated in a formative fashion but were analyzed as if they were reflective in nature. The objective of this paper is to revisit the relatively simple path analysis procedure to help explore issues of causal direction between variables of interest.

Nevertheless. prior literature still lacks a practical guidance on how to properly test for differences between parameter estimates. Whereas existing techniques such as parametric and non-parametric approaches in PLS multi-group analysis solely allow to assess differences between parameters that are estimated for different subpopulations. the study at hand introduces a technique that allows to also assess whether two parameter estimates that are derived from the same sample are statistically different.

In doing so. it overcomes a current weakness of structural equation modeling. i.e.. the operationalization and assessment of design concepts. so-called artifacts. CCA entails the same steps as confirmatory factor analysis: model specification. model identification. model estimation. and model assessment. Composite models are specified such that they consist of a set of interrelated composites. all of which emerge as linear combinations of observable variables. Researchers must ensure theoretical identification of their specified model. For the estimation of the model. several estimators are available; in particular Kettenring's extensions of canonical correlation analysis provide consistent estimates. Model assessment mainly relies on the Bollen-Stine bootstrap to assess the discrepancy between the empirical and the estimated model-implied indicator covariance matrix.

Researchers can investigate such heterogeneity through multigroup analysis (MGA). In the context of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM). MGA is currently applied to perform multiple comparisons of parameters across groups. However. this approach has significant drawbacks: first. the whole model is not considered when comparing groups. and second. the family-wise error rate is higher than the predefined significance level when the groups are indeed homogenous. leading to incorrect conclusions.

The authors conclude that PLS-SEM path modeling. if appropriately applied. is indeed a ""silver bullet"" for estimating causal models in many theoretical models and empirical data situations.",True,jMVuQpsAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC,12312,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/MTP1069-6679190202,16893796055227252360,/scholar?cites=16893796055227252360,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Ringle/publication/236033273_PLS-sem_Indeed_a_silver_bullet/links/00b7d52ecb004615ed000000.pdf,0,0,0

Interestingly. relatively little attention has been paid to assessing the use of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in marketing research—despite its increasing popularity in recent years. To fill this gap. we conducted an extensive search in the 30 top ranked marketing journals that allowed us to identify 204 PLS-SEM applications published in a 30-year period (1981 to 2010). A critical analysis of these articles addresses. amongst others. the following key methodological issues: reasons for using PLS-SEM. data and model characteristics. outer and inner model evaluations. and reporting.

The findings suggest that customer and competitor orientations have different influences upon performance when leveraged through the capabilities. Competitor orientation. while having a detrimental direct effect on logistics performance. appears to be the better strategic approach. when supported with operational flexibility since it results in enhanced logistics (efficiency) and market (effectiveness) performance.

They will thank you for it. With increasingly user-friendly versions of LISREL being released and guide books such as this published. LISREL really should be accessible to all'-European Journal of MarketingEmphasizing substantive issues rather than intricate statistical details. this book provides a comprehensive introduction to LISREL for structural equation modeling (SEM) using a non-technical. user-oriented approach that. The emphasis is on:-exposing the reader to the major steps associated with the formulation and testing of a model under the LISREL framework-describing the key decisions associated with each step-highlighting potential problems and limitations associated with LISREL modeling-assisting the interpretation of LISREL input and output files. The overall aim is to provide a critical understanding of what is really involved in LISREL modeling and sensitize the reader againstmechanically'fitting or modifying models. The entire range of decisions associated with the practical application of the LISREL program is covered in a user-friendly fashion.

This article offers an operating paradigm for renewal along dimensions previously unstressed.

University of Minnesota,While researchers go to great lengths to justify and prove theoretical links between constructs. the relationship between measurement items and constructs is often ignored. By default. the relationship between construct and item is assumed to be reflective. meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the construct. Many times. though. the nature of the construct is not reflective. but rather formative. Formative constructs occur when the items describe and define the construct rather than vice versa. In this research. we examine whether formative constructs are indeed being mistaken for reflective constructs by information systems researchers.

According to TAM. IT adoption is influenced by two perceptions: usefulness and ease-of-use. Research has shown that perceived usefulness (PU) affects intended adoption of IT. but has mostly failed to do so regarding perceived ease of use (PEOU).

When rules and customs are not sufficient. people rely on trust and familiarity as primary mechanisms to reduce social uncertainty. The relative paucity of regulations and customs on the Internet makes consumer familiarity and trust especially important in the case of e-Commerce. Yet the lack of an interpersonal exchange and the one-time nature of the typical business transaction on the Internet make this kind of consumer trust unique. because trust relates to other people and is nourished through interactions with them.This study validates a four-dimensional scale of trust in the context of e-Products and revalidates it in the context of e-Services.

Over the past few years. the methods for testing mediation have become more sophisticated. However. many researchers continue to use outdated methods to test mediating effects in PLS. which can lead to erroneous results. One reason for the use of outdated methods or even the lack of their use altogether is that no systematic tutorials on PLS exist that draw on the newest statistical findings.

This increasing deployment of SEM suggests that a comparison should be made of the different SEM approaches. This would help researchers choose the SEM approach that is most appropriate for their studies. After a brief review of the SEM theoretical background. this study analyzes two models with different sample sizes by applying two different SEM techniques to the same set of data. The two SEM techniques compared are: Covariance-based SEM (CBSEM) – specifically. maximum likelihood (ML) estimation – and Partial Least Squares (PLS). After presenting the study findings. the paper provides insights regarding when researchers should analyze models with CBSEM and when with PLS.

Whereas some studies conceptualize customer value in a unidimensional manner. more recent approaches take a multidimensional approach. generally conceptualizing value as composed of various benefits and sacrifices. However. nearly all of these studies consider value components in a reflective manner. which is not only problematic but in many cases conceptually incorrect. In addition. recent customer value research includes service components to define and operationalize the construct.

We also examine the relationship between absorptive capacity and the existence and enhancement of innovativeness. These relationships are examined through an empirical investigation of 286 large Spanish companies. Our results show that absorptive capacity is an important dynamic determinant for developing a company's innovativeness. Moreover. this relationship is best explained by two related constructs. First. the company's unlearning context is a crucial determinant for both potential capacity and realized absorptive capacity.

PLS-SEM is still new to many researchers who want to know: What exactly is PLS-SEM?Most explanations limit themselves to the algorithm’s statistical elucidations (eg. Rigdon. 2013; Tenenhaus. Esposito Vinzi. Chatelin. & Lauro. 2005; HOA Wold. 1982). while a few others include additional descriptions. such as PLS-SEM’s historical background (eg. Chin. 1998; Dijkstra. 2010. 2014; Lohmöller. 1989; Rigdon. 2012. 2014). Herman OAHO A. Wold (2006). the originator of the method. characterizes PLS-SEM as an “epoch-making 1960s innovation” that combines econometric prediction with the psychometric modeling of latent variables (also referred to as constructs). which multiple indicators (also referred to as manifest variables) determine. To provide a better understanding of the approach. Figure 1 shows a simple PLS path model with four latent variables. Y1 to Y4 (represented by circles). determined as the weighted sum of their assigned indicators x (represented by the rectangles).

During the last 25 years. more than 30 articles have been published in leading marketing journals that have applied this approach instead of the more traditional alternative of covariance-based SEM (CBSEM). However. although an analysis of these previous publications shows that there seems to be at least an implicit agreement about the factors that should drive the choice between PLS analysis and CBSEM. no research has until now empirically compared the performance of these approaches given a set of different conditions.

1274810,On the profitability of long-life customers in a noncontractual setting: An empirical investigation and implications for marketing,2000,Werner J Reinartz and Vijay Kumar,64,Journal of marketing,4,17-35,SAGE Publications,Relationship marketing emphasizes the need for maintaining long-term customer relationships. It is beneficial. in general. to serve customers over a longer time. especially in a contractual relationship. However. it is not clear whether some of the findings observed in a contractual setting hold good in noncontractual scenarios: relationships between a seller and a buyer that are not governed by a contract or membership. The authors offer four different propositions in this study and subsequently test each one in a noncontractual context.

Furthermore. the authors identify factors under a manager's control that explain the variation in the profitable lifetime duration. They also compare other frameworks with the traditional methods such as the recency. frequency. and monetary value framework and past customer value and illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework.

1274812,The mismanagement of customer loyalty.,2002,Werner Reinartz and VISWANATHAN Kumar,80,Harvard business review,7,"86-94, 125",,"Who wouldn't want loyal customers? Surely they should cost less to serve. they'd be willing to pay more than other customers. and they'd actively market your company by word of mouth. right? Maybe not. Careful study of the relationship between customer loyalty and profits plumbed from 16.000 customers in four companies' databases tells a different story. The authors found no evidence to support any of these claims. What they did find was that the link between customers and profitability was more complicated because customers fall into four groups. not two. Simply put: Not all loyal customers are profitable. and not all profitable customers are loyal. Traditional tools for segmenting customers do a poor job of identifying that latter group. causing companies to chase expensively after initially profitable customers who hold little promise of future profits. The authors suggest an alternative approach. based on well-established"" event-history modeling"" techniques. that more accurately predicts future buying probabilities. Armed with such a tool. marketers can correctly identify which customers belong in which category and market accordingly. The challenge in managing customers who are profitable but disloyal--the"" butterflies""--is to milk them for as much as you can while they're buying from you. A softly-softly approach is more appropriate for the profitable customers who are likely to stay loyal--your"" true friends.""

Ltd,Customer relationship management (CRM) refers to building one‐to‐one relationships with customers that can drive value for the firm. This manuscript discusses proven CRM strategies that companies can use as means of effective customer management (CM). The continuing evolution of CM is made possible by understanding the interactive relationships that develop between firms and customers and among customers themselves. Firms will increasingly be able to customize marketing messages to larger target audiences on the basis of the customer's expected response and the customer's value to the firm. By following the CRM strategies discussed here. firms can reduce overall marketing costs. increase overall customer response rates. and. most importantly. increase overall customer and firm profitability.,True,QANMWK4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1121,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781444316568.wiem01015,149724765599363316,/scholar?cites=149724765599363316,,,http://digilib2.unisayogya.ac.id/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/2539/9.%202018_Book_CustomerRelationshipManagement.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

In an increasingly networked society where customers can interact easily with other customers and firms through social networks and other new media. the authors propose that customer engagement is an important new development in CM.

Goods manufacturers. unlike pure service providers. find themselves in a unique position to grow revenues through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies. the authors develop a resource–capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods. (2) product development and manufacturing assets. (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network. and (4) a field service organization.

In this study. the authors assume that customer value is a dual concept. First. in order to be successful. firms (and the marketing function) have to create perceived value for customers. Toward that end. marketers have to measure customer perceived value and have to provide customer perceptions of value through marketing-mix elements. Second. customers in return give value through multiple forms of engagement (customer lifetime value. in the widest sense) for the organization. Therefore. marketers need to measure and manage this value of the customer(s) to the firm and have to incorporate this aspect into real-time marketing decisions.

1274829,The influence of external variables on information technology usage behavior,1996,Geoffrey S Hubona and Elizabeth Kennick,4,,,166-175,IEEE,The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) predicts the user acceptance of end-user applications by specifying causal relationships among external variables. belief and attitudinal constructs. and actual usage behavior. Although the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use constructs have received much recent attention in the MIS literature. few studies have attempted to validate the full TAM model with all of the original constructs. Furthermore. the many published TAM studies are characterized by the use of different measurement factors to assess the belief constructs. The study validates TAM using the original constructs and assesses the effects of TAM variables on two measures of usage behavior. Results are largely consistent with previous TAM studies.

Despite a growing body of research. it is still not clear how value interacts with related marketing constructs. Researchers have called for an investigation of the interrelationship between customer satisfaction and customer value to reduce the ambiguities surrounding both concepts. Investigates whether customer value and satisfaction represent two theoretically and empirically distinct concepts. Also addresses whether value is a better predictor of behavioral outcomes than satisfaction in a business marketing context. Two alternative models are developed and empirically tested in a cross‐sectional survey with purchasing managers in Germany. The first model suggests a direct impact of perceived value on the purchasing managers’ intentions.

1274831,Value-based differentiation in business relationships: Gaining and sustaining key supplier status,2006,Wolfgang Ulaga and Andreas Eggert,70,Journal of marketing,1,119-136,SAGE Publications,Many business customers today consolidate their supply bases and implement preferred supplier programs. Consequently. vendors increasingly face the alternative of either gaining a key supplier status with their customers or being pushed into the role of a backup supplier. As product and price become less important differentiators. suppliers of routinely purchased products search for new ways to differentiate themselves in a buyer–seller relationship. This research investigates avenues for differentiation through value creation in business-to-business relationships. The results suggest that relationship benefits display a stronger potential for differentiation in key supplier relationships than cost considerations. The authors identify service support and personal interaction as core differentiators. followed by a supplier's know-how and its ability to improve a customer's time to market.

To shed light on the dynamic nature of value in B2B relationships. we present the results of a survey among purchasing managers using a quasi-longitudinal research design. Our findings confirm the moderating role of the relationship life cycle in value creation. More precisely. our results indicate that a key supplier's potential for value creation in customer's operations increases in relative importance as relationships move through the life cycle.

Despite a growing body of literature in this area. no generally accepted conceptualization of relationship value has emerged from the marketing literature. The present paper investigates the theoretical foundations of relationship value and identifies seven underlying dimensions. It is suggested that relationship value should be conceptualized as a formative. multi-dimensional. higher-order construct.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Reputation is one of the most important intangible assets of a firm. For the most part. recent articles have investigated its impact on firm profitability whereas its effects on individual customers have been neglected. Using data from consumers of an international consumer goods producer. this paper (1) focuses on measuring and discussing the relationships between corporate reputation. consumer satisfaction. and consumer loyalty and (2) examines possible moderating and mediating effects among the constructs. We find that reputation is an antecedent of satisfaction and loyalty that has hitherto been neglected by management. Furthermore. we find that more than half of the effect of reputation onto loyalty is mediated by satisfaction. This means that reputation can only partially be considered a substitute for a consumer’s own experiences with a firm.

As the sales force plays a pivotal role in implementing marketing strategies. this study adopts a discovery oriented approach and conceptualizes value-based selling as an effective sales approach in business markets. Based on in-depth interviews with sales managers in a variety of industries. we identify and portray three salient dimensions of value-based selling. namely (1) understanding the customer's business model. (2) crafting the value proposition. and (3) communicating customer value.

Brand orientation is an inside-out. identity-driven approach that sees brands as a hub for an organization and its strategy. Similarly. market orientation is an outside-in. image-driven approach.

1274850,Brand orientation of museums: Model and empirical results,2009,Carsten Baumgarth,,International Journal of Arts Management,,30-45,École des Hautes Études Commerciales,Introduction museums today are fighting for their cultural and economic survival because of financial bottlenecks in the public sector. increasing competition with other cultural institutions. such as opera houses or leisure facilities. and falling visitor numbers. Consequently museum directors need to be open to the idea of adopting man-agement techniques imported from commerce. despite the widespread misgivings of many arts administrators (Gilmore and Rentschler. 2002). One such technique is brand management. There are success stories of the application of brand management to single museums or exhibitions (eg. the Guggenheim. the British Museum. the Museum of Modern Art's tour-ing exhibitions). However. most museums reach only a low level of professionalism in their brand management.

Loyalty is generally attributed to satisfaction with the quality of service. Since online transactions involve many uncertainties for the customer. trust is a condition for exchange. Trust in the electronic medium – here called “e‐trust” – is believed to increase online customer loyalty. but empirical confirmations are scarce. The present study empirically investigates the roles of service quality. satisfaction and trust in an e‐commerce context. In the study. e‐trust is found to directly affect loyalty. The e‐service quality dimension of assurance. i.e. trusting the merchant. influences loyalty via e‐trust and e‐satisfaction. Other e‐quality dimensions. such as ease of use. e‐scape. responsiveness. and customization influence e‐loyalty mainly indirectly. via satisfaction.

1274865,The application of cluster analysis in strategic management research: an analysis and critique,1996,David J Ketchen and Christopher L Shook,17,,6,441-458,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Cluster analysis is a statistical technique that sorts observations into similar sets or groups. The use of cluster analysis presents a complex challenge because it requires several methodological choices that determine the quality of a cluster solution. This paper chronicles the application of cluster analysis in strategic management research. where the technique has been used since the late 1970s to investigate issues of central importance. Analysis of 45 published strategy studies reveals that the implementation of cluster analysis has been often less than ideal. perhaps detracting from the ability of studies to generate knowledge. Given these findings. suggestions are offered for improving the application of cluster analysis in future inquiry.,True,iTNxaBkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2420,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199606)17:6%3C441::AID-SMJ819%3E3.0.CO;2-G,5479063358256007550,/scholar?cites=5479063358256007550,,,,0,0,0

1274866,The future of resource-based theory: revitalization or decline?,2011,Jay B Barney and David J Ketchen Jr and Mike Wright,37,Journal of management,5,1299-1315,Sage Publications,Since the 1991 publication of the first Journal of Management special issue devoted to resource-based inquiry. resource-based theory (RBT) has evolved from a nascent. upstart perspective to one of the most prominent and powerful theories for understanding organizations. Indeed. 20 years after that landmark issue. RBT appears to have reached maturity as a theory. One implication of this maturity is that RBT lies at a critical juncture. one that will be followed either by revitalization of the theory or by its decline. In this introductory article. the authors provide a brief overview of the contributions provided by the commentaries and articles contained in this third Journal of Management special issue on RBT. These contributions center on five themes: interlinkages with other perspectives. processes of resource acquisition and development. the micro-foundations of RBT.

However. human capital takes time and money to develop or acquire. which potentially offsets its positive benefits. Indeed. extant tests appear equivocal regarding its impact. To clarify what is known. we meta-analyzed effects drawn from 66 studies of the human capital–firm performance relationship and investigated 3 moderators suggested by resource-based theory. We found that human capital relates strongly to performance. especially when the human capital in question is not readily tradable in labor markets and when researchers use operational performance measures that are not subject to profit appropriation. Our results suggest that managers should invest in programs that increase and retain firm-specific human capital.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA. all rights …,True,iTNxaBkAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,1212,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-00496-001,13754144389112388290,/scholar?cites=13754144389112388290,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47692161/Does_Human_Capital_Matter_A_Meta-Analysi20160801-5820-17sdfs7.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,Interfirm cooperation and its performance implications are examined in the context of two widely cited theoretical approaches to organizations. Broadly speaking. the resource‐based view suggests that firms seek to capitalize on and increase their capabilities and endowments. whereas organizational economics asserts that firms focus on minimizing the costs of organizing. Although these perspectives agree on managers’ likely actions in many areas. their predictions diverge when interfirm cooperation is considered. We take a step toward reconciling these differences by positing that firms place resource‐based concerns in front of considerations from organizational economics when deciding whether or not to engage in interfirm cooperation. We examined this prediction using data from 94 publicly held restaurant chains.

Ltd.,Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a powerful. yet complex. analytical technique. The use of SEM to examine strategic management phenomena has increased dramatically in recent years. suggesting that a critical evaluation of the technique's implementation is needed. We compared the use of SEM in 92 strategic management studies published in nine prominent journals from 1984 to 2002 to guidelines culled from methodological research. We found that the use and reporting of SEM often have been less than ideal. indicating that authors may be drawing erroneous conclusions about relationships among variables.

Ltd.,Resource‐based theory (RBT) has emerged as a key perspective guiding inquiry into the determinants of organizational performance. Since the early 1990s. numerous studies have examined RBT's assertion that the extent to which organizations possess strategic resources is positively related to performance. Although many studies appear to support this assertion. there is no consensus regarding how strongly strategic resources relate to performance. To help resolve this issue. we meta‐analyze 125 studies of RBT that collectively encompass over 29.000 organizations. Our conservative estimate is that the effect size of the strategic resources–performance relationship is r̄c = 0.22. Moderator tests suggest that the resources‐performance link is stronger (1) when resources meet the criteria laid out in RBT and (2) for those performance measures that are not affected by potential value appropriation.

Rather than competing “firm versus firm.” today's organizations are battling “supply chain versus supply chain.” Within this context. best value supply chains are emerging as a means to create competitive advantages and superior performance. While traditional supply chains often focus primarily on one key outcome such as speed or cost. best value supply chains excel along an array of uniquely integrated priorities—cost. quality. speed. and flexibility. We describe how key organizational theories help to distinguish traditional supply chains from best value supply chains.

A significant void exists in current models of market orientation because none of the frameworks incorporates constructs related to innovation.

Some of the critical relationships in this conceptual framework are tested among a sample of 9648 employees from 56 organizations in a large agency of the U.S. federal government.

Although researchers have suggested that logistics competencies complement marketing efforts. empirical evidence is lacking on what logistics service quality means to customers and whether it has different meanings for separate customer segments. The authors present empirical support for nine related logistics service quality constructs; demonstrate their unidimensionality. validity. and reliability across four customer segments of a large logistics organization; and provide empirical support for a logistics service quality process.

It extends previous work on optimization for inviscid flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow. with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Fréchet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation. and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations. leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions.

Spatial discretization of the governing equations is achieved using a finite-element Galerkin approximation. which can be shown to be equivalent to a finite-volume approximation for regular equilateral triangular meshes. Integration to steady state is performed using a multistage time-stepping scheme. and convergence is accelerated by means of implicit residual smoothing and an unstructured multigrid algorithm. Directional scaling of the artificial dissipation and the implicit residual smoothing operator is achieved for unstructured meshes by considering local mesh stretching vectors at each point.

The flowfield and the a priori unknown free surface location are calculated by coupling the free surface kinematic and dynamic equations with the equations of motion for the bulk flow. The evolution of the free surface boundary condition is linked to the evolution of the bulk flow via a novel iteration strategy that allows temporary leakage through the surface before the solution is converged. The method of artificial compressibility is used to enforce the incompressibility constraint for the bulk flow. A multigrid algorithm is used to accelerate convergence to a steady state.

Langley Research Center,The ability to simulate aerodynamic flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has progressed rapidly during the last several decades and has fundamentally changed the aerospace design process. Advanced simulation capabilities not only enable reductions in ground-based and in-flight testing requirements. but also provide added physical insight. enable superior designs at reduced cost and risk. and open new frontiers in aerospace vehicle design and performance. Throughout the evolution of physics-based simulation technologies in general. and computational fluid dynamics methods in particular. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has played a leading role in the development and deployment of these technologies. However. today the aerospace CFD community finds itself at a crossroads due to the convergence of several factors. In spite of considerable successes. reliable use of CFD has remained confined to a small but important region of the operating design space due to the inability of current methods to reliably predict turbulent-separated flows. At the same time. High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware is progressing rapidly and is on the cusp of a paradigm shift in technology that may require a rethinking of current CFD algorithms and software. Finally. during the last decade. government investment in simulation-based technology for aerospace applications has been significantly reduced and access to leading-edge HPC hardware has been constrained both in government and industry.

The basis of this procedure is to assume the time period of the solution's oscillation and to transform both the solution and residual using a discrete Fourier transform. However. this paper also presents a method which iteratively solves for the time period during the process of calculating a solution. These methods are amenable to parallel processing and convergence acceleration techniques such as multigrid and implicit residual averaging. The accuracy and efficiency of the technique is verified by Euler and Navier-Stokes calculations for a pitching airfoil whose period of oscillation is forced.

The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to performing affordable. and hence industrially relevant. scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the vicinity of real-world engineering geometries.

1274921,On the non-linear stability of flux reconstruction schemes,2011,A Jameson and PE Vincent and P Castonguay,50,Journal of Scientific Computing,2,434-445,Springer Netherlands,The flux reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes. including collocation based nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. and all spectral difference methods (at least for a linear flux function). within a single framework. Recently a new range of linearly stable FR schemes have been identified. henceforth referred to as Vincent-Castonguay-Jameson-Huynh (VCJH) schemes. In this short note non-linear stability properties of FR schemes are elucidated via analysis of linearly stable VCJH schemes (so as to focus attention solely on issues of non-linear stability). It is shown that linearly stable VCJH schemes (at least in their standard form) may be unstable if the flux function is non-linear. This instability is due to aliasing errors. which manifest since FR schemes (in their standard form) utilize a collocation projection at the solution points to construct a polynomial approximation of the flux …,True,hL3mEmYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,116,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-011-9490-6,7634053818654962313,/scholar?cites=7634053818654962313,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.300.1214&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1274923,A new class of high-order energy stable flux reconstruction schemes for triangular elements,2011,P Castonguay and PE Vincent and A Jameson,,Journal of Scientific Computing,,,Springer Netherlands,The flux reconstruction (FR) approach allows various well-known high-order schemes. such as collocation based nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods and spectral difference (SD) methods. to be cast within a single unifying framework. Recently. the authors identified a new class of FR schemes for 1D conservation laws. which are simple to implement. efficient and guaranteed to be linearly stable for all orders of accuracy. The new schemes can easily be extended to quadrilateral elements via the construction of tensor product bases. However. for triangular elements. such a construction is not possible. Since numerical simulations over complicated geometries often require the computational domain to be tessellated with simplex elements. the development of stable FR schemes on simplex elements is highly desirable.

However. before they can be more widely adopted. issues such as lack of robustness in terms of numerical stability need to be addressed. particularly when treating industrial-type problems where challenging geometries and a wide range of physical scales. typically due to high Reynolds numbers. need to be taken into account. One source of instability is aliasing effects which arise from the nonlinearity of the underlying problem. In this work we detail two dealiasing strategies based on the concept of consistent integration. The first uses a localised approach. which is useful when the nonlinearities only arise in parts of the problem. The second is based on the more traditional approach of using a higher quadrature. The main goal of both dealiasing techniques is to …,True,hL3mEmYAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC,84,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115004301,16691246598193478085,/scholar?cites=16691246598193478085,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115004301,0,0,0

However. it remains the case that existing high-order schemes are generally less robust and more complex to implement than their low-order counterparts. These issues. in conjunction with difficulties generating high-order meshes. have limited the adoption of high-order techniques in both academia (where the use of low-order schemes remains widespread) and industry (where the use of low-order schemes is ubiquitous).

The optimization of airfoils in two-dimensional flow for inverse design and drag minimization is illustrated.

First. in terms of certification. although simulation (taken to mean all methods other than natural flight testing) is an acceptable means of compliance. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is at the low end of the totem pole compared to using icing tunnels or flying behind icing tankers. Although CFD-based three-dimensional icing simulation codes can now handle increasingly complex icing physics and aircraft geometries. only a limited number of such runs may be afforded because of the length of time they take. Because only simplified or truncated geometries can be placed in a tunnel. and not all icing conditions can be reproduced in a tunnel or behind a tanker. there is no possibility of exploring the entire combined icing and aircraft …,True,t5sjjcMAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,53,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.44077,9035939294144879778,/scholar?cites=9035939294144879778,,,,0,0,0

Jirka,,,,227-234,http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/97814398,Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are performed for an open channel flow through submerged vegetation with a water depth (h) to plant height (hp) ratio of h/hp= 1. 5 according to the experimental configuration of Fairbanks and Diplas (1998). Fairbanks and Diplas measured longitudinal and vertical velocities as well as turbulence intensities along several verticals in the flow and the data are used for the validation of the simulations. The code MGLET is used to solve the filtered Navier Stokes equations on a Cartesian non-uniform grid. In order to represent solid objects in the flow. the immersed boundary method is employed. The computational domain is idealized with a box containing four submerged circular cylinders and periodic boundary conditions are applied in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The predicted streamwise as well as vertical mean velocities are in good agreement with the LDA measurements. Furthermore. good agreement is found between calculated and measured streamwise rms velocities. Large-scale flow structures of different shape are present in the form of vortex rolls above the vegetation tops as well as von Karman type vortices generated by flow separation at the cylinders.

It is demonstrated that it is possible to suppress unsteady vortex shedding for gap sizes from one to five cylinder diameters. at Reynolds numbers from 100 to 200. expanding on the more limited work by Chan & Jameson (Intl J.

The degree of unsteady wake suppression is proportional to the speed and the direction of rotation. and there is a critical rotation rate where a complete suppression of flow unsteadiness can be achieved. In the doublet-like configuration at higher rotational speeds. a virtual elliptic body that resembles a potential doublet is formed. and the drag is reduced to zero. The shape of the elliptic body primarily depends on the gap between the two cylinders and the speed of rotation.

Boundary movements are achieved. firstly. through rigid displacement of the entire flow domain. In order to account for the dynamic rigid mesh motion. the Navier-Stokes equations are modified through an unsteady coordinate transformation. Airfoils in pitching and plunging motions are studied. In both cases. computation results are compared with existing experimental data. and favorable results have been obtained. Secondly. spectral difference method is extended to include capability for handling dynamic deforming grids. The physical boundary movement is achieved through a time dependent unsteady transformation that allows part of the flow domain to be rigidly displacing. part of it fixed. and the rest deforming smoothly in between.

In contrast is the flow past rotating cylinders in a side-by-side arrangement. which has only very limited numerical and experimental data available. despite the pioneering theoretical study by Jefferyi as early as 1922. In this paper. we discuss a numerical investigation of the steady laminar viscous flow past two infinite rotating cylinders in a side-by-side configuration.

In particular. we are interested in the formulation of the unsteady adjoint method based on the high-order spectral difference method. For the linear equation. we consider the simple 1D advection equation. For the non-linear equation. we consider the 1D viscous Burger’s equation. In both cases. the inverse design of the target solution is achieved through control of the initial condition. The focus of the study is the formulation of the unsteady adjoint method using the high-order spectral difference method.

Langley Research Center,The ability to simulate aerodynamic flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has progressed rapidly during the last several decades and has fundamentally changed the aerospace design process. Advanced simulation capabilities not only enable reductions in ground-based and in-flight testing requirements. but also provide added physical insight. enable superior designs at reduced cost and risk. and open new frontiers in aerospace vehicle design and performance. Throughout the evolution of physics-based simulation technologies in general. and computational fluid dynamics methods in particular. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate has played a leading role in the development and deployment of these technologies. However. today the aerospace CFD community finds itself at a crossroads due to the convergence of several factors. In spite of considerable successes. reliable use of CFD has remained confined to a small but important region of the operating design space due to the inability of current methods to reliably predict turbulent-separated flows. At the same time. High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware is progressing rapidly and is on the cusp of a paradigm shift in technology that may require a rethinking of current CFD algorithms and software. Finally. during the last decade. government investment in simulation-based technology for aerospace applications has been significantly reduced and access to leading-edge HPC hardware has been constrained both in government and industry.

However. recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have enabled the simulation of complex fluid flows with high accuracy. opening the possibility of using learning-based approaches to facilitate controller design. We present a method for learning the forced and unforced dynamics of airflow over a cylinder directly from CFD data. The proposed approach. grounded in Koopman theory. is shown to produce stable dynamical models that can predict the time evolution of the cylinder system over extended time horizons.

Usually BCs are imposed in two different ways: by directly modifying the boundary solution at each iteration/time-step (strong BCs) or by modifying the state from which the numerical flux is calculateda (weak BCs). Published studies to date suggest that weak BCs tend to improve convergence and can improve accuracy over strong BCs. 1. 7. 8 These studies are based upon steady simulations using predominantly loworder numerical methods. with successful application to high-order methods reported by Liu9 and Bassi. 3 In this paper we focus on a weak treatment of the BCs applied to the Euler and compressible Navier-Stokes equations within …,True,Vc5U6cgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,34,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2014-2923,10236211272608617418,/scholar?cites=10236211272608617418,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40068127/2.pdf,0,0,0

The location of the solution points plays an important role in determining the stability and accuracy of FR schemes on triangular elements. In particular. it is desirable that a solution point set (i) defines a well conditioned nodal basis for representing the solution. (ii) is symmetric. (iii) has a triangular number of points and. (iv) minimises aliasing errors when constructing a polynomial representation of the flux. In this paper we propose a methodology for generating solution points for triangular elements.

Extensions to the Navier-Stokes equations are also considered. These preconditioners are necessary for many algorithms in order to have the correct behavior at low speeds and to converge to the solution of the incompressible equations as the Mach number goes to zero. In addition. the preconditioning accelerates the convergence to a steady state for problems in which a significant portion of the flow is low speed. This low speed preconditioner can be combined with Jacobi and line preconditioners to damp high frequencies at all speeds. This is necessary for use with multigrid methods. Such combined methods are also better at accelerating problems with high aspect ratios.

However. high-order methods are less robust than lower-order methods. as they are less dissipative. making them more susceptible to spurious oscillations and aliasing driven instabilities that arise during simulations of nonlinear phenomena. An effective approach for addressing this issue comes from noting that. for nonlinear problems. the stability of high-order nodal methods is significantly effected by the locations of the nodal points. In fact. in 1D and 2D. it has been shown that placing the nodal points at the locations of quadrature points reduces aliasing errors and improves the robustness of high-order schemes.

1275010,A unifying lifting collocation penalty formulation including the discontinuous Galerkin. spectral volume/difference methods for conservation laws on mixed grids,2009,Zhi Jian Wang and Haiyang Gao,228,Journal of Computational Physics,21,8161-8186,Academic Press,Recently a new high-order formulation for 1D conservation laws was developed by Huynh using the idea of “flux reconstruction”. The formulation was capable of unifying several popular methods including the discontinuous Galerkin. staggered-grid multi-domain method. or the spectral difference/spectral volume methods into a single family. The extension of the method to quadrilateral and hexahedral elements is straightforward. In an attempt to extend the method to other element types such as triangular. tetrahedral or prismatic elements. the idea of “flux reconstruction” is generalized into a “lifting collocation penalty” approach. With a judicious selection of solution points and flux points. the approach can be made simple and efficient to implement for mixed grids. In addition. the formulation includes the discontinuous Galerkin. spectral volume and spectral difference methods as special cases.

Each triangular grid cell forms a spectral volume (SV). and the SV is further subdivided into polygonal control volumes (CVs) to supported high-order data reconstructions. Cell-averaged solutions from these CVs are used to reconstruct a high-order polynomial approximation in the SV. Each CV is then updated independently with a Godunov-type finite volume method and a high-order Runge–Kutta time integration scheme. A universal reconstruction is obtained by partitioning all SVs in a geometrically similar manner. The convergence of the SV method is shown to depend on how a SV is partitioned.

To simulate flows over complex configurations. a hybrid grid method is adopted in this paper. Body-fitted quadrilateral (quad) grids are generated first near solid bodies. An adaptive Cartesian mesh is then generated to cover the entire computational domain. Cartesian cells which overlap the quad grids are removed from the computational domain. and a gap is produced between the quad grids and the adaptive Cartesian grid. Finally triangular grids are used to fill this gap. With the motion of moving bodies. the quad grids move with the bodies. while the adaptive Cartesian grid remains stationary. Meanwhile. the triangular grids are deformed according to the motion of solid bodies with a ‘spring’ analogy approach.

In comparison with many existing kinetic schemes for the Boltzmann equation. the current method has no difficulty to get accurate Navier–Stokes (NS) solutions in the continuum flow regime with a time step being much larger than the particle collision time. At the same time. the rarefied flow solution. even in the free molecule limit. can be captured accurately.

1275025,Microchannel flow in the slip regime: gas-kinetic BGK-Burnett solutions,2004,Kun Xu and Zhihui Li,513,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,87,Cambridge University Press,In the first part of this paper presents a gas-kinetic scheme based on the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model for the microflow simulations in the near continuum flow regime. The current method improves the previous gas-kinetic BGK Navier–Stokes (BGK–NS) solver by (i) implementing a general non-equilibrium state based on the Chapman–Enskog expansion of the BGK model up to the Knudsen number squared (Kn) 2 in the gas distribution function.(ii) using the compatibility condition to evaluate all high-order time derivative terms in the Chapman–Enskog expansion. and (iii) implementing the kinetic boundary condition for the gas distribution function to obtain ‘slip’boundary automatically. As a result. the gas-kinetic BGK–Burnett scheme improves the validity of the BGK–NS solver for the microchannel flow simulations even in the slip flow regime. where the Navier–Stokes equations with the slip boundary conditions are considered to be legitimately valid. Owing to the correction to the heat transport in the energy flux. the Prandtl number in the gas-kinetic BGK–Burnett method can take any value to capture both viscous and heat conduction effects. Since the current method is based on the direct evaluation of the gas distribution function and captures its time evolution. it is different from those methods that are based on the macroscopic Burnett or extended hydrodynamic equations. The second part of this paper is about the application of the newly developed gas-kinetic BGK–Burnett method in the microchannel flows.

Ltd,An innovative method of analysis was developed to simulate the non‐linear seismic finite‐amplitude liquid sloshing in two‐dimensional containers. In view of the irregular and time‐varying liquid surface. the method employed a curvilinear mesh system to transform the non‐linear sloshing problem from the physical domain with an irregular free‐surface boundary into a computational domain in which rectangular grids can be analysed by the finite difference method. Non‐linearities associated with both the unknown location of the free surface and the high‐order differential terms were considered. The Crank–Nicolson time marching scheme was employed and the resulting finite difference algorithm is unconditionally stable and very lightly damped with respect to the temporal co‐ordinate.

We use a differential filter. namely the inverse Helmholtz operator. which is readily applied to unstructured meshes. The filter is invertible. which allows the sub-filter scale (SFS) stresses to be exactly reconstructed in terms of the filtered solution. Unlike eddy viscosity models. the method of filtering and reconstruction avoids making any physical assumptions and is therefore valid in any flow regime. The sub-grid scale (SGS) stresses are not recoverable by reconstruction. but the second-order finite element method used here is an adequate source of numerical dissipation in lieu of an SGS model.

We analyze the effect of different smoothers based on pseudo time iterations. such as explicit and additive Runge–Kutta (AERK) methods. Furthermore. by deriving them from Rosenbrock smoothers. we identify some existing schemes as a class of additive W (AW) methods. This gives rise to two classes of preconditioned smoothers. preconditioned AERK and AW. which are implemented the exact same way. but have different parameters and properties. This derivation allows to choose some of these based on results for time integration methods.

Combining the dynamic LES procedure with unstructured mesh adaptivity offers a robust and efficient way of capturing the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of complex turbulent flows. However. this may result in a non-vanishing commutation error due to the filter employed. The inverse Helmholtz filter is used here with a tensor definition of filter width related to the local element size and shape. The formulation. verification and validation of a finite element methodology. designed to yield maximal accuracy from moderate mesh resolution with minimal ad hoc procedures. is described.

1275061,High-order flux reconstruction schemes with minimal dispersion and dissipation,2015,Kartikey Asthana and Antony Jameson,62,Journal of Scientific Computing,3,913-944,Springer US,Modal analysis of the flux reconstruction (FR) formulation is performed to obtain the semi-discrete and fully-discrete dispersion relations. using which. the wave properties of physical as well as spurious modes are characterized. The effect of polynomial order. correction function and solution points on the dispersion. dissipation and relative energies of the modes are investigated. Using this framework. a new set of linearly stable high-order FR schemes is proposed that minimizes wave propagation errors for the range of resolvable wavenumbers.

1275062,A simplified formulation of the flux reconstruction method,2016,Joshua Romero and Kartikey Asthana and Antony Jameson,67,Journal of Scientific Computing,1,351-374,Springer US,The flux reconstruction (FR) methodology has proved to be an attractive approach to obtaining high-order solutions to hyperbolic partial differential equations. However. the utilization of somewhat arbitrarily defined correction polynomials in the application of these schemes. while adding some flexibility. detracts from their ease of implementation and computational efficiency. This paper describes a simplified formuation of the flux reconstruction method that replaces the application of correction polynomials with a single Lagrange interpolation operation. A proof of the algebraic equivalence of this scheme to the FR formulation of the nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method provided that the interior solution points are placed at the zeros of a corresponding Legendre polynomial is presented.

We show that the maximum stable time step for advection-diffusion is stricter than that for pure-advection or pure-diffusion individually. However. the simple harmonic sum of the maximum stable time steps for advection and diffusion provides a suitable estimate for the linear advection-diffusion and Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured. tensor product elements. The estimates are accurate within 50% error on all test cases and are conservative on tests with Cartesian grids but not always on unstructured grids.

These instabilities arise from aliasing errors associated with the collocation projection of the flux corresponding to the numerical solution onto the polynomial basis of the numerical flux. In this paper. we obtain energy bounds on the numerical solution via FR to prove that stability can be ensured for any polynomial order by the addition of adequate artificial dissipation such that the solution is energy-stable beyond a critical grid resolution. This artificial viscosity is then approximately posed as a Fourier filtering operation which is implemented in the physical space via a strictly local convolution integral.

The numerical solution for a scheme of polynomial order P is composed of P+ 1 eigenmodes. of which. one and exactly one is ‘physical’such that it exhibits the analytical dispersion behavior in the limit of asymptotic grid resolution.

The method is dependent on the governing differential equation and attains higher order through consistent discretization and accurate evaluation of the transformation metrics. Extensive comparison of accuracy. convergence rate and computation time is made with standard explicit and implicit schemes to highlight the relatively high efficiency of using the proposed scheme.

The mean behavior of buy/sell initiated shocks is to increase/decrease the macroscopic mid-price of the security. Linear as well as non-linear models are trained to incorporate pre-shock information for predicting post-shock behavior. However. the features tend to add very little predictive power beyond the statistical mean behavior. We show that this is largely on account of high volatility associated with high priced securities. Defining a measure of error which is normalized by volatility indicates that features do have some intrinsic predictive capability. In this new measure. linear regression. weighted to account for heteroskedasticity. outperforms SVR yielding an efficient prediction algorithm for high frequency data.,True,9SXCQmQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/206_report.pdf,,,,,http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/206_report.pdf,0,0,0

In the simplest version of this process. two stable species of DNA hairpins coexist in solution until the introduction of initiator strands triggers a cascade of hybridization events that yields nicked double helices analogous to alternating copolymers. The average molecular weight of the HCR products varies inversely with initiator concentration. Amplification of more diverse recognition events can be achieved by coupling HCR to aptamer triggers.

This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached.

This is achieved through error analysis that uses an adjoint PDE to relate the local errors in approximating the flow solution to the corresponding global errors in the functional of interest. Numerical evaluation of the local residual error together with an approximate solution to the adjoint equations may thus be combined to produce a correction for the computed functional value that yields the desired improvement in accuracy. Numerical results are presented for the Poisson equation in one and two dimensions and for the nonlinear quasi-one-dimensional Euler equations.

1275081,Vortex suppression and drag reduction in the wake of counter-rotating cylinders,2011,Andre S Chan and Peter A Dewey and Antony Jameson and Chunlei Liang and Alexander J Smits,679,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,343-382,Cambridge University Press,The flow over a pair of counter-rotating cylinders is investigated numerically and experimentally. It is demonstrated that it is possible to suppress unsteady vortex shedding for gap sizes from one to five cylinder diameters. at Reynolds numbers from 100 to 200. expanding on the more limited work by Chan & Jameson (Intl J. Numer. Meth. Fluids. vol. 63. 2010. p. 22). The degree of unsteady wake suppression is proportional to the speed and the direction of rotation. and there is a critical rotation rate where a complete suppression of flow unsteadiness can be achieved. In the doublet-like configuration at higher rotational speeds. a virtual elliptic body that resembles a potential doublet is formed. and the drag is reduced to zero. The shape of the elliptic body primarily depends on the gap between the two cylinders and the speed of rotation. Prior to the formation of the elliptic body. a second instability region is observed …,True,y4uA5TIAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,80,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/vortex-suppression-and-drag-reduction-in-the-wake-of-counterrotating-cylinders/D68EA98129B8C4A8F80F5F69584FE35C,17478436417804872735,/scholar?cites=17478436417804872735,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D68EA98129B8C4A8F80F5F69584FE35C/S0022112011001340a.pdf/div-class-title-vortex-suppression-and-drag-reduction-in-the-wake-of-counter-rotating-cylinders-div.pdf,0,0,0

1275083,System. method. and apparatus for aerodynamic diverter integrated with a diffuser in a bypass channel for applications in a disk storage device,2007,Andre Sirilutporn Chan and Ferdinand Hendriks and Michael Robert Hatchett and Jr-Yi Shen,,,,,,A device streamlines air flow inside a hard disk drive with a stationary afterbody that is located adjacent to each of the disks. A diverter portion of the device enhances the volumetric flow of air through the diffuser. The overall function of the device effectively expands the air flow so that the speed of the air flow gradually decreases while pressure increases. This design reduces losses in system momentum due to sudden expansion of the air in the drive. In addition. air flow moving toward the disk pack may be contracted to allow efficient energy conversion from pressure energy to kinetic energy prior to merging of the bypass air flow with the air flow among the disks.,True,y4uA5TIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,21,https://patents.google.com/patent/US7203030B2/en,13375195738488424668,/scholar?cites=13375195738488424668,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/46/e3/b1/b9bb517a20f55d/US7203030.pdf,0,0,0

This solver is designed for unstructured quadrilateral elements. Time-marching methods cannot be applied directly to incompressible flows because the governing equations are not hyperbolic. An artificial compressibility method (ACM) is employed in order to treat the inviscid fluxes using the traditional characteristics-based schemes. The viscous fluxes are computed using the averaging approach (Sun et al.. 2007; Kopriva. 1998) [29]. [12]. A dual time stepping scheme is implemented to deal with physical time marching.

1275096,An analysis of stability of the flux reconstruction formulation with applications to shock capturing,2016,Abhishek Sheshadri,,,,,,High-order methods in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have been growing in popularity due to their promise of increased computational efficiency and fidelity to flow physics. Amongst a plethora of methods proposed over the last few decades. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) type (Finite Element Methods (FEM)) have drawn great attention due to their attractive accuracy and stability properties. facility for performing arbitrarily high order computations and the capability to handle complex unstructured geometries. among other features. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach to high-order methods is a flexible. robust and simple to implement framework that has proven to be a promising alternative to the traditional DG schemes on parallel architectures like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) since it pairs exceptionally well with explicit time-stepping methods.While high order methods have already successfully displayed significant improvements over low order methods on certain fronts. one of the major reasons limiting their industry-wide adoption is their inferior robustness relative to low order methods. These high order schemes are prone to developing instabilities while solving nonlinear problems and the issue compounds with increasing order. thereby requiring a compromise between accuracy and stability. Instabilities due to discontinuous solutions or shocks that develop in compressible flows and aliasing instabilties are two of the most important ones.,True,aUFCBfsAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,11,http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/Abhishek_thesis_hc_Aug26.pdf,6674955554848851583,/scholar?cites=6674955554848851583,,,http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/Abhishek_thesis_hc_Aug26.pdf,0,0,0

The FR formulation was originally proposed by Huynh (AIAA Pap 2007-4079:1–42. 2007). Vincent et al. (J Sci Comput 47(1):50–72. 2011) later developed a single parameter family of correction functions which provide energy stable schemes under this formulation in 1D. These schemes. known as Vincent–Castonguay–Jameson–Huynh (VCJH) schemes. offer control over properties like stability. dispersion and dissipation through the variation of the VCJH parameter. Classical schemes like nodal-DG and Spectral Difference (SD) can also be recovered under this formulation …,True,aUFCBfsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,5,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-017-0513-9,3403350208433262053,/scholar?cites=3403350208433262053,,,http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/sheshadri_jsc_2017.pdf,0,0,0

In the paper cited as citation number 12. ie. Castonguay et al.[1]. the summation over the elements is performed after transforming Θadv to the physical domain. When this transformation is carried out in [1]. there is a Jk term that appears in Θadv which cancels out with the Jk in the LHS. This cancellation happens in our case as well through all the extra terms. which was missed. This can be seen by looking at (3.34). where Jk appears in all the terms of Θextra. In the cited paper. the cancellation is important to obtain the result Θadv≤ 0 which is used by us. Thus. the correct approach would be to transform the quantities to physical domain. perform the cancellation and then sum over all the elements.

1275100,Mesh deformation and shock capturing techniques for high-order simulation of unsteady compressible flows on dynamic meshes,2015,Abhishek Sheshadri and Jacob A Crabill,,,,1741,,The ability to handle deforming meshes is imperative in order to simulate many flows of practical interest. Many aerodynamics applications also require the ability to handle compressible flows effectively. One important motivating case for the use of high order CFD is the computation of the highly unsteady and vortex-dominated flow field around a helicopter. Such a simulation would require both these capabilities. Other examples would be the simulation of turbine blades. wing flutter in transonic flows. or even birds and insects for bio-inspired flight concepts. Mesh deformation could also complement shock capturing by allowing us to elastically deform the mesh to have more elements near the shock so as to capture it in a finer fashion.Currently we have developed shock capturing capability in 2D on both quads and triangles in HiFiLES. 21 We use the method of concentration2 in quads and use the method proposed …,True,aUFCBfsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,3,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2015-1741,15491593404805629960,/scholar?cites=15491593404805629960,,,http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/Papers/Sheshadri_Crabill_2015.pdf,0,0,0

This course is intended to prepare these undergraduate students as future teachers—helping them to make effective and creative uses of technology in learning settings. This course emphasizes learning to learn with and about technology. in the ever-changing context of educational technology. Generally speaking. we outline and describe three key goals of teaching young teachers to thoughtfully integrate technology into a real-world classroom. First. the course emphasizes learning to explore and learn proactively by engaging in learning by design activities. Second. students are given an opportunity to try a wide variety of innovative technologies through explorations of their own choosing.

At the same time new digital. networked technologies offer unparalleled opportunities for creative and independent learning (Pink. 2009). Just a few examples of the kinds of rich. immediate. and varied knowledge resources that are widely available today include instructional videos on You-Tube. free access to rigorous university courses. and the development of complex personal learning environments. This blend of need and opportunity makes for an exciting time in history for educators. These technologies allow both novices and experts alike to participate in the creation and cultivation of their own learning.

And we are not speaking of the 47% vilified by one group. or the 1% by the other. Though these particular numbers got a lot of the media attention. our focus is on a special kind of approach towards working with numbers. what we call computational thinking. Computational thinking. as exemplified by the data-driven election forecasting from people like Nate Silver (the statistician whose FiveThirtyEight. com blog became an online phenomenon of the election). and Sam Wang (a Princeton neuroscientist and a “spare time” election forecaster). up-ended the “seat-of-the-pants”. gut-feeling driven predictions made by most established political prognosticators and pundits. After a long history of relying on polls or talking heads to predict election results. was undermined by a group of self-described “geeks” and number crunchers. Armed with computational simulations. data sets. and algorithms. these data crunchers were unfailingly accurate in their predictions. Political winners aside. many journalists and cultural observers noted afterwards. that the biggest winner might have been mathematics! Computational thinking was unquestionably influential in the campaign strategies themselves. particularly the manner in which the Obama campaign used data to micro-target voters.

They also provide insight into the reasons for the housing crisis that initiated the current financial malaise. We find that homebuyers were generally well informed. and that their short-run expectations if anything underreacted to the year-to-year change in actual home prices. More of the root causes of the housing bubble can be seen in their long-term (10-year) home price expectations. which reached abnormally high levels relative to mortgage rates at the peak of the boom and have declined sharply since.

Office of Educational Technology. 2017). This study facilitated the co-creation of the Teacher Educator Technology Competencies (TETCs). The TETCs define the competencies (knowledge. skills. and attitudes) all teacher educators need in order to support teacher candidates as they prepare to become technology-using teachers. The TETCs shed light on the roles and responsibilities of teacher educators who address technology within their courses. A highly collaborative research approach was used to develop the TETCs which involved the crowdsourcing of technology-related literature. a Delphi method for expert feedback. and an open call for public comment.

The terminology used. at times confusing due to rapid technology change. has continuously evolved. We are in transition to an information society. and the term computer technology has been replaced by information technology (IT) or information and communication technology (ICT). New demands from the information society require education to focus on information management and communication skills. for which IT can be an essential resource. IT offers promising environments and tools to support new approaches to teaching and learning. Despite major investments. the implementation of IT in education has been a persistent problem. And. although it is generally assumed that IT has high potential for improving education. major research findings have only recently confirmed positive results of IT on students’ performance. While there is a vast amount of research on information technology (IT) in K-12 education. most of it is scattered. Until now. a unified presentation of the research from a broad international perspective has not been accomplished.

This framework builds on Lee Shulman's (1986. 1987) construct of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) to include technology knowledge. The development of TPACK by teachers is critical to effective teaching with technology. The paper begins with a brief introduction to the complex. ill-structured nature of teaching. The nature of technologies (both analog and digital) is considered. as well as how the inclusion of technology in pedagogy further complicates teaching. The TPACK framework for teacher knowledge is described in detail as a complex interaction among three bodies of knowledge: content. pedagogy. and technology.

Given the need for a change in pedagogies. investigating how exemplary teachers transfer their thinking. pedagogical knowledge. and beliefs to successful online teaching is critical to understanding new online learning and teaching practices. The research on online teacher roles and practices. however. has been limited in terms of bringing teachers’ voices into the research process and empowering them as autonomous professionals who constantly engage in a dialogue about solving complex problems and making decisions about online teaching. Purpose and Research Questions: The purpose of this research was to look at exemplary online teachers’ transition to online teaching with a focus on their successful practices. The research investigated two central questions:(1) What are the successful practices that exemplary online teachers employ in their online teaching?(2) How do exemplary online teachers make a transition to online teaching in such a way that they create successful practices?

1275192,Factors affecting technology uses in schools: An ecological perspective,2003,Yong Zhao and Kenneth A Frank,40,American educational research journal,4,807-840,Sage Publications,Why is technology not used more in schools? Many researchers have tried to solve this                persistent puzzle. The authors of this article report on their study of technology                uses in 19 schools. They suggest an ecological metaphor. using the example of the                introduction of the zebra mussel into the Great Lakes. to integrate and organize sets                of factors that affect implementation of computer uses. Their findings suggest that                an ecological perspective can provide a powerful analytical framework for                understanding technology uses in schools.

1275194,What makes the difference? A practical analysis of research on the effectiveness of distance education,2005,Yong Zhao and Jing Lei and Bo Yan and Chun Lai and Hueyshan Sophia Tan,107,Teachers College Record,8,1836,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,This article reports findings of a meta-analytical study of research on distance education. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that affect the effectiveness of distance education. The results show that although the aggregated data of all available studies show no significant difference in outcomes between distance education and face-to-face education as previous research reviews suggest. there is remarkable difference across the studies. Further examination of the difference reveals a number of factors that led to the differences in outcomes across programs. This study led to some important data-driven suggestions for and about distance education: interaction is key to effective distance education; live human instructors are needed in distance education; the right mixture of human and technology seems most beneficial; distance education may be more appropriate for certain content; some learners may be more able to take advantage of distance education; and distance education seems to get better. The findings highlight an important and often neglected fact about the distance education literature: distance education programs. just like traditional education programs. vary a great deal in its outcomes. The study also suggests that existing conceptual frameworks for understanding face-to-face education are also applicable and should be applied to investigation efforts of distance education.,True,p0S6fZEAAAAJ:0tsVym51Ka4C,835,https://www.academia.edu/download/33341310/effectiveness.pdf,9399901665869173478,/scholar?cites=9399901665869173478,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33341310/effectiveness.pdf,0,0,0

While evidence of the educational benefits of technology abounds and investment in hardware and software has dramatically increased. rela-tively few teachers use technology regularly in their teaching and the impact of computers on existing curricula is still very limited. What lies behind this contradiction? Why don't teachers make wider use of instructional technologies? In this article we introduce a novel model of goal-oriented behavior. Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). as a framework for understanding teacher adoption of technology. Unlike other approaches that examine this issue by studying the ex-ternal environment. this new framework attempts to under-stand teacher adoption of technology from the inside.

The standard model of diffusion suggests that people change perceptions about the value of an innovation through communication. and these perceptions then drive implementation. But implementation can be affected by more instrumental forces. In particular. members of a school share the common fate of the organization and affiliate with the common social system of the organization. Thus. they are more able to gain access to each others' expertise informally and are more likely to respond to social pressure to implement an innovation. regardless of their own perceptions of the value of the innovation.

Specifically. a multiple case study was conducted to examine the ways in which the development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) was promoted in the existing curriculum of three TEI in Flanders. In the three cases. data were drawn from semi-structured interviews with the heads of the department and the ICT coordinators. Focus group discussions collected the perspectives of pre-service teachers and teacher educators. The results indicate that (1) the three institutions are moving from ICT as a ‘stand-alone’ course towards embedding ICT across the curriculum and (2) three approaches were adopted for developing pre-service teachers’ TPACK. each representing different ways of …,True,JRIfna0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,110,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2012.713548,946527637562593613,/scholar?cites=946527637562593613,,,,0,0,0

Making a tool an educational technology requires creative input from the teacher to re-design. or maybe even subvert the original intentions of the designer. The learning technology by design (LT/D) framework has been proposed as being an effective instructional technique to develop deeper understanding of technological pedagogical content knowledge. In this paper we expand our description of the LT/D technique to develop what we call a deep-play model for teacher professional development. The deep-play model integrates:  apedagogy for key 21st century learning skills bcontent that cuts across disciplines with trans-disciplinary cognitive tools ctechnology by the creative repurposing of tools for pedagogical purposes. ,True,6MJ2HJEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,198,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJLT.2011.042646,336333439959179409,/scholar?cites=336333439959179409,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50973133/Deep-play_developing_TPACK_for_21st_cent20161219-7048-1ykyys7.pdf,0,0,0

In fact. this variety suggests that Twitter has the potential to serve as a foundational technology: one capable of supporting teachers’ learning across multiple formal and informal contexts. To explore this possibility. we examined the purposes that Twitter serves in one educational technology graduate program. We collected over 9000 tweets containing any of 12 program-related hashtags and coded a sample of them to describe the purposes they served. This resulted in six themes: contribute to disciplinary conversation. engage with disciplinary conversation. build community. make connections with other communities. ask for and provide support. and unclear or irrelevant purpose.

K-12 teachers should be exposed to computing principles. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a computational thinking module in a required course for elementary and secondary education majors. We summarize the results from open-ended and multiple-choice questionnaires given both before and after the module to assess the students' attitudes toward and understanding of computational thinking. The results suggest that given relevant information about computational thinking. education students' attitudes toward computer science becomes more favorable and they will be more likely to integrate computing principles in their future teaching.,True,E_kmtUQAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,243,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1953163.1953297,15560239575868712590,/scholar?cites=15560239575868712590,,,http://cs4edu.cs.purdue.edu/_media/sigcse11-final.pdf,0,0,0

The results provided evidence that. overall. faculty think cases have a positive impact on student learning. critical thinking. and participation. n recent years. a number of National Science Foundation and National Research Council reports have advocated the need to improve undergraduate science instruction and enhance science literacy for all students (eg. NRC 1996; 2002). Many undergraduates. especially women and traditionally underrepresented groups. avoid higher-level science and mathematics courses. Students who have switched from science and mathematics majors in college report"" poor teaching by faculty"" as a significant reason for switching (Seymour and Hewitt 1997). Examples of poor teaching in science at the undergraduate level include an emphasis on memorizing facts. lack of application of concepts. dullness. and failure to encourage connections among concepts (Kardash and Wallace 2001). Aikenhead (2006) argues that one of the failures of traditional science curricula is that"" students tend not to learn science content meaningfully (ie. they do not integrate it into their everyday thinking).""

Specifically. we examined if teacher preparation students' epistemological beliefs influenced what cases they selected. and how it further served as a lens in their reflective writing about their clip selections. The quantitative and qualitative analyses (case studies) focused on two epistemological beliefs-Fixed Ability and Simple Knowledge. The results illustrate that preservice teachers select video cases consistent with their prior epistemological beliefs. and their descriptions of what they find salient about those cases confirm their prior held beliefs.

By the DJ’s own admission. the project was intended as an underground hip-hop experiment. primarily for local club use. However. word of the compilation spread quickly via the Internet. as did downloads of the music. It became a phenomenon unto itself. This. in turn. spurred legal backlash from EMI for the unauthorized remixing of Beatles samples. At the time. many national news outlets reporting on this incident made reference to mixing (Danger Mouse’s ‘Grey Album’spurs dispute. 2004). remixing (Pareles. 2004). and melding (DJ Mixes Beatles. Jay-Z into “Grey.” 2004). while others used a more colloquial term long known in the music world. Danger Mouse had created the quintessential mash-up. And the term began its journey toward the mainstream. Today. mash-ups describe everything from video editing to culinary fusion. The rise of computer networks that allow for easy sharing. as well as the evolution of creative software tools have resulted in a fertile and unprecedented environment for mashing-up just about anything.

1275269,Beyond TPACK: Expanding technology and teacher education to systems and culture,2019,Melissa Warr and Punya Mishra and Ben Scragg,,,,2558-2562,Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE),Despite copious amounts of research on technology in education. many teachers still struggle to use technology effectively. Much research on technology integration focuses on teacher education and design. For example. the TPACK framework describes the type of knowledge teachers need to design effective uses of technologies in their classrooms. However. despite its prevalence. TPACK has not led to wide-spread change in educational technology use. We argue this is because we have not paid enough attention to how educational technology works at a systems and culture level. In this article. we present a new framework. the Five Discourses of Design. that can help us consider how educational technology impacts and is impacted by systems and culture. We provide examples of how the framework applies to teacher education,True,t0Z9XTEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,8,https://www.learntechlib.org/p/208009/,17756662909121616166,/scholar?cites=17756662909121616166,,,,0,0,0

1275270,Designing theory,2020,Melissa Warr and Punya Mishra and Ben Scragg,,Educational Technology Research and Development,,1-32,Springer US,Theoretical work is essential to the progress of any discipline. Theories. models. and frameworks are underdetermined representations of a phenomenon that help us understand and take action in a domain. However. the field of learning design and technology (LDT) has traditionally struggled with developing a solid theoretical foundation that is useful for both research and practice. We propose viewing theory building as an act of design might address these challenges. After defining key constructs and describing two approaches to theory development. we describe three design perspectives that might be useful for theory development: Lawson and Dorst’s (Design expertise.

This is our third interview with a neuroscientist. following from interviews about creativity with Arne Dietrich (Mehta et al. 2017) and Rex Jung (Mehta et al. 2016). These previous interviews presented somewhat contrasting views on current research on creativity and the brain. For instance. Dr. Dietrich was critical of current approaches of using neuroscience to study compound constructs like creativity. He suggested that scholars must work on reducing creativity into components amenable to neuroscience research. and suggested they must resist experimenting with what he considered are theoretically incoherent constructs.

We suggest that one reason our field has not been successful at changing education is because we have not understood the complex role design plays over different discourse contexts. We offer a framework that looks at design discourse as it plays out across different levels of the educational process. We argue design of e-learning occurs in somewhat non-overlapping discourses focusing on artifacts. processes. experiences. systems and culture. Each of these discourses has different practices. elements and tools and differ in their inherent complexity or wickedness. It is only by working across these discourses that we can develop productive ways of creating impactful e-learning environments.

Design is changing an existing situation to a desired one; it is the process of creating something new. The literature on teachers and design is broad and describes many ways of how teachers design. In particular. the push for integrating technology into classrooms has led many to consider how teachers design curriculum and learning experiences. This paper describes a literature review of teachers and design. The authors identified the 40 most-cited publications on teachers and design published from 2007 to 2017. Further analysis revealed ten primary strands of work around teachers and design.

Technology. pedagogy and content knowledge (TPACK)–one form of highly practical professional educational knowledge–is comprised of teachers’ concurrent and interdependent curriculum content. general pedagogy. and technological understanding. Teachers’ planning–which expresses teachers’ knowledge-in-action in pragmatic ways--is situated. contextually sensitive. routinized. and activity-based. To assist with the development of teachers’ TPACK. therefore. we suggest using what is understood from research about teachers’ knowledge and instructional planning to form an approach to curriculum-based technology integration that is predicated upon the combining of technologically supported learning activity types within and across content-keyed activity type taxonomies.

Like jazz music. much of good teaching is context-dependent. serendipitous improvisation. yet it still follows predetermined. somewhat predictable structures sequenced in virtually infinite permutations. 1 Functional and effective learning activity designs and implementation strategies for teachers’ use must build upon such educational improvisation. so that students’ needs. preferences. and reactions can be accommodated. Yet they must also be carefully planned. so that curriculum standards are addressed in appropriate ways within the time constraints of the school day and year. For even the experienced teacher. assisting students’ learning “is a matter of thoughtful creation. not mere unaided instinct.” as Mr. Ellington reminds us. What happens when experienced teachers seek to integrate educational technologies into curriculum-based learning and teaching. and how can teacher educators assist this professional development process? This chapter will suggest answers to this question in both conceptual and practical forms. framed within the notion of technological pedagogical content knowledge development (Mishra & Koehler. 2006; Koehler & Mishra.

Champagne and Klopfer (1977) reviewed 60 years of Science Education and suggested that every theory or practice that emphasizes reflective thinking and problem solving owes a debt of gratitude to Dewey. Although their review was conducted over 20 years ago. its claims about Dewey's legacy remain persuasive. In their summary. Champagne and Klopfer point to the general failure to realize Dewey's vision in actual classroom practice. They offer several possible explanations:(a) It is generally difficult to translate abstract philosophy into specific pedagogy;(b) the kind of rare. sophisticated thinking advocated by Dewey is difficult to attain; and (c) the goal of having students reason like a scientist may not be valued by all. Although Champagne and Klopfer's analysis is to be taken seriously. we arrive at a slightly different conclusion. With regard to their concern that the translation from philosophy to practice and the Deweyan vision of the educated person are not easily attained. we agree that the challenge is difficult. but worth attempting. With regard to their concern that not everyone needs or wants to think like a scientist. we assert that this belief depends on one's notion of what Dewey means by``thinking like a scientist.''In this article. we will discuss how Dewey's vision of the scientific mind is rich in thought. emotion. and drama: in short. it is much more fully human than the aloof. strictly analytical …,True,MUbbifMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,194,https://www.academia.edu/download/54431414/learning_science.PDF,9114735807542729537,/scholar?cites=9114735807542729537,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54431414/learning_science.PDF,0,0,0

Inc.,RD Pea (1985) wrote that we can think of technology in two ways: as a set of tools that amplify or extend what we currently do (make it better. faster and stronger). or as something with the potential to radically change what we do and how we do it. For example. the technology of a better saddle allowed riders to travel further and longer. but the technology of a car completely revolutionized the way we even conceive of travel. Perhaps the argument is one of quality and not quantity. A similar argument exists in describing educational technology. Extending what we currently do as teachers only amplifies our current practices. while using technology qualitatively affords radical change in the work of teachers and the learning of students. The fact remains that many educators use technology to amplify what is currently done.

1275302,Implications of new interactive technologies for conceptualizing communication,1989,Carrie Heeter,,Media use in the information age: Emerging patterns of adoption and consumer use,,217-235,,Communication scholars widely recognize a need to reconceptualize communication. in part because of changes brought about by new telecomuni-cation technologies. Rogers and Chaffee (1983) argue that “scholars are going to have to shift toward models that accommodate the interactivity of most of the new communication technologies. New paradigms are needed. based on new intellectual terminology”(p. 25). Rice and Williams (1984) concur. adding that “new media may. in fact. necessitate a considerable reassessment of communication research. Intellectual changes must occur to match the growing changes in communication behavior”(p. 80). Developments in telecommunication technologies continue to alter the ways in which we can communicate. Broadband cable. fiber optics. and various other transmission media provide wider bandwidth to carry more (and more complex) signals simultaneously. Systems that combine telecom-munication and computer technologies allow diverse configurations for user involvement and services. What has traditionally been considered mass com-munication is complicated with many new “media” and different kinds of “masses” than before. The ability to engage in mediated interpersonal communication becomes increasingly available in a variety of manners.

For individuals with a growth mind-set. who believe intelligence develops through effort. mistakes are seen as opportunities to learn and improve. For individuals with a fixed mind-set. who believe intelligence is a stable characteristic. mistakes indicate lack of ability. We examined performance-monitoring event-related potentials (ERPs) to probe the neural mechanisms underlying these different reactions to mistakes. Findings revealed that a growth mind-set was associated with enhancement of the error positivity component (Pe). which reflects awareness of and allocation of attention to mistakes.

This study investigated the influence of presentation mode afforded by different media on willingness to help in the context of humanitarian aid. Two online experiments were conducted. The first experiment demonstrated that playing the Darfur is Dying game elicited greater role-taking and resulted in greater willingness to help the Darfurian people than reading a text conveying the same information. The second experiment deconstructed the variable presentation mode in more detail by adding a game watching condition.

College students with less free time were less likely to spend time playing games. The findings suggest one reason women play fewer games than men is because they are required to fulfill more obligatory activities. leaving them less available leisure time. which in turn makes them less likely to “make” time for games. It was found that not only do women report having less free time than men. but their free time is available in smaller chunks. and they play digital games for shorter periods of time than men.,True,J2cm5CQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,157,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11199-009-9595-7.pdf,12056352881887163125,/scholar?cites=12056352881887163125,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.619.735&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Each day dawned with news highlighting the number of cases (and deaths). the contagiousness of the disease. the lack of a cure or vaccine. and the scarcity of personal protective equipment for our healthcare and other frontline workers. One of the few positives was the speed at which many global partners joined to battle the disease. Academic researchers and even academic journals joined in the fight. For instance. in addition to giving open access to articles. many medical journals switched to a speedier review to be able to quickly publish promising results. So. as researchers were making early discoveries. they had a way to bypass a traditionally longer review and publication process to give hope. share building blocks. and encourage collaboration. At the beginning of April (2020) we began a conversation with editors of journals including TechTrends (Chuck Hodges) and the Journal of Computing in Higher Education (Stephanie Moore). We knew three things. First. we knew that many education and technology journals would probably invite and publish special issues of articles in 9-24 months. These articles would be retrospectives detailing what happened. what was implemented. and what worked (or did not work). Second. we knew that COVID-19 would probably last a while. and that although future journal articles would be tremendously helpful. we needed to publish work that would immediately impact people.

However. research has also suggested that these benefits are not inherent just by adopting online discussions into classroom work. In this paper. we draw from a larger literature review to discuss both the positive and negative aspects of electronic conversations.

Tendon actuation leads to compression of the manipulator. extension of the actuators. and is limited by the practical constraint that tendons cannot support compression. In light of these observations. we present a new linear model for transforming desired beam configuration to tendon displacements and  vice versa . We begin from first principles in solid mechanics by analyzing the effects of geometrically nonlinear tendon loads. These loads act both distally at the termination point and proximally along the conduit contact interface. The resulting model simplifies to a linear system including only the bending and axial modes of the manipulator as well as the actuator compliance. The model is then manipulated to form a concise mapping from beam configuration-space parameters to  n  redundant tendon displacements via the internal loads …,True,jNkKWXEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,533,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4660316/,4262779156543091109,/scholar?cites=4262779156543091109,,,,0,0,0

We present a method for controlling a tendon-driven continuum manipulator by means of specifying the shape configuration. The basis for control is a linear beam configuration model that transforms beam configuration to tendon displacement by modeling internal loads of the compliant system. An essential aspect of this model is the inclusion of both the mechanical and geometrical coupling among serial articulating sections. Important capabilities of this model are the general forward kinematics and the decoupled inverse kinematics that allow for independent control of multiple sections.

Participants are guided along a trajectory and are asked to learn a sequence of one-dimensional forces via three paradigms: haptic training. visual training. or combined visuohaptic training. The extent of learning is measured by accuracy of force recall. We find that recall following visuohaptic training is significantly more accurate than recall following visual or haptic training alone. although haptic training alone is inferior to visual training alone. This suggests that in conjunction with visual feedback. haptic training may be an effective tool for teaching sensorimotor skills that have a force-sensitive component to them. such as surgery.

An elastic band is a deformable collision-free path. The initial shape of the elastic is the free path generated by a planner. Subjected to artificial forces. the elastic band deforms in real time to a short and smooth path that maintains clearance from the obstacles. The elastic continues to deform as changes in the environment are detected by sensors. enabling the robot to accommodate uncertainties and react to unexpected and moving obstacles. While providing a tight connection between the robot and its environment. the elastic band preserves the global nature of the planned path.

1275360,Master/slave speculative parallelization,2002,Craig Zilles and Gurindar Sohi,,,,85-96,IEEE,Master/Slave Speculative Parallelization (MSSP) is an execution paradigm for improving the execution rate of sequential programs by parallelizing them speculatively for execution on a multiprocessor. In MSSP one processor - the master - executes an approximate version of the program to compute selected values that the full program's execution is expected to compute. The master's results are checked by slave processors that execute the original program. This validation is parallelized by cutting the program's execution into tasks. Each slave uses its predicted inputs (as computed by the master) to validate the input predictions of the next task. inductively validating the entire execution. The performance of MSSP is largely determined by the execution rate of the approximate program. Since approximate code has no correctness requirements (in essence it is a software value predictor). it can be optimized more …,True,V22Gj30AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,217,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1176241/,2163938347087398691,/scholar?cites=2163938347087398691,,,ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/sohi/papers/2002/mssp.micro.pdf,0,0,0

1275361,Understanding the backward slices of performance degrading instructions,2000,Craig B Zilles and Gurindar S Sohi,28,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,2,172-181,ACM,For many applications. branch mispredictions and cache misses limit a processor's performance to a level well below its peak instruction throughput. A small fraction of static instructions. whose behavior cannot be anticipated using current branch predictors and caches. contribute a large fraction of such performance degrading events. This paper analyzes the dynamic instruction stream leading up to these performance degrading instructions to identify the operations necessary to execute them early. The backward slice (the subset of the program that relates to the instruction) of these performance degrading instructions. if small compared to the whole dynamic instruction stream. can be pre-executed to hide the instruction's latency. To overcome conservative dependance assumptions that result in large slices. speculation can be used. resulting in speculative slices.This paper provides an initial characterization of the …,True,V22Gj30AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,144,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/342001.339676,5771449721081309915,/scholar?cites=5771449721081309915,,,https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/9462/file_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

However. such timing speculation (TS) proposals are limited in that they assume traditional design methodologies that are suboptimal under TS.

1275379,Hybrid position/force control of manipulators,1981,Marc H Raibert and John J Craig,103,,2,126-133,,A new conceptually simple approach to controlling compliant motions of a robot manipulator is presented. The “hybrid” technique described combines force and torque information with positional data to satisfy simultaneous position and force trajectory constraints specified in a convenient task related coordinate system. Analysis. simulation. and experiments are used to evaluate the controller’s ability to execute trajectories using feedback from a force sensing wrist and from position sensors found in the manipulator joints. The results show that the method achieves stable. accurate control of force and position trajectories for a variety of test conditions.,True,_3rYEzQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3717,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/dynamicsystems/article-abstract/103/2/126/400298,6330733849753503222,/scholar?cites=6330733849753503222,,,http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.15/classes/measurement/hybrid-position-force.pdf,0,0,0

Use of a poor dynamic model with this kind of model-based decoupling and linearizing scheme. however. may result in performance that is inferior to a much simpler. fixed-gain scheme.In this paper. we develop a parameter-adaptive control scheme in a set of adaptive laws that can be added to the nonlinear. model-based controller.

1275383,Adaptive control of manipulators through repeated trials,1984,John J Craig,,American Control Conference,21,1566-1573,,Virtually all manipulators at work in factories today repeat their motions in cycles. Unfortunatly. whatever errors may exist in repeating a trajectory are also repeated from cycle to cycle. This paper presents an adaptive scheme for robot manipulators for the case of repeated trials of a path. The primary benefit of the approach is that it allows compensation for effects such as friction which are otherwise difficult to model. A secondary advantage of the scheme is that it can also adapt to torques due to velocity and gravity effects in order to reduce the computations needed in the control computer. After sufficient learning. arbitrary paths which are within the torque and velocity limits of the arm can be executed with errors lower bounded only by the nonrepeatability of the manipulator.

We demonstrate that precise cell cycle parameter timing is observed in all euploid embryos to the four-cell stage. whereas only 30% of aneuploid embryos exhibit parameter values within normal timing windows. Further. we observe that the generation of human embryonic aneuploidy is complex with contribution from chromosome-containing fragments/micronuclei that frequently emerge and may persist or become reabsorbed during interphase.

Compliant motion may be produced either by a passive mechanical compliance built in to the manipulator. or by an active compliance implemented in the control servo loop. The second method. called force control. is the subject of this paper. In particular a theory of force control based on formal models of the manipulator and the task geometry is presented. The ideal effector is used to model the manipulator. the ideal surface is used to model the task geometry. and the goal trajectory is used to model the desired behavior of the manipulator. Models are also defined for position control and force control. providing a precise semantics for compliant motion primitives in manipulation programming languages.

Compliant motions are quite difficult for humans to specify. however. Furthermore. robot programs are quite sensitive to details of geometry and to error characteristics and must. therefore. be constructed anew for each task. These factors motivate the search for automatic synthesis tools for robot program ming. especially for compliant motion.

This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However. these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time. various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks. this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task.

The approach is demonstrated within the context of a simple method to orient planar objects. A randomly oriented object is dropped into a tray. When the tray is tilted. the object can slide into walls. along walls. and into corners. sometimes with the effect of reducing the number of possible orientations. For some objects a sequence of tilting operations exists that leaves the object's orientation completely determined. An automatic planner is described that constructs such a tilting program. using a simple model of the mechanics of sliding. The planner has been implemented. the resulting programs have been executed using a tray attached to an industrial manipulator. and sometimes the programs work.

1275409,Stable pushing: Mechanics. controllability. and planning,1996,Kevin M Lynch and Matthew T Mason,15,The international journal of robotics research,6,533-556,Sage Publications,We would like to give robots the ability to position and orient parts in the plane by pushing. particularly when the parts are too large or heavy to be grasped and lifted. Unfortunately. the motion of a pushed object is generally unpredictable due to unknown support friction forces. With multiple pushing contact points. however. it is possible to find pushing directions that cause the object to remain fixed to the manipulator. These are called stable pushing directions. In this article we consider the problem of planning pushing paths using stable pushes. Pushing imposes a set of nonholonomic velocity constraints on the motion of the object. and we study the issues of local and global controllability during pushing with point contact or stable line contact. We describe a planner for finding stable pushing paths among obstacles. and the planner is demon strated on several manipulation tasks.,True,D_JpQnAAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,522,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/027836499601500602,17663302818752260456,/scholar?cites=17663302818752260456,,,http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/lynch/www/research/ijrr-toappear.ps,0,0,0

We classify the possible modes of impact. and derive analytical expressions for impulse. using both Poisson’s and Newton’s models of restitution. We also address a new class of impacts. tangential impact. with zero initial approach velocity. Some methods for rigid-body impact violate energy conservation principles. yielding solutions that increase system energy during an impact.

1275417,Teleoperation of a mobile robot through haptic feedback,2002,Nicola Diolaiti and Claudio Melchiorri,,,,67-72,IEEE,Teleoperation systems have been developed in order to allow a human operator to perform complex tasks in remote environments. Mobile robots can be considered as a particular example of telemanipulation systems. since they can be operated remotely to perform particular tasks. As an example. the inspection of underwater structures and the removal of mines are performed by mobile platforms controlled by a remote operator. which generally takes advantage only of the visual feedback provided by vision systems. In this sense. the nature and completeness of the data provided to the operator about the state of the remote system are of crucial importance for proper task execution. and it is generally accepted that a more efficient achievement of the task can be obtained by increasing the amount of data feedback and using proper MMI.

1275420,Method and system for moving a plurality of articulated instruments in tandem back towards an entry guide,2015,Nicola Diolaiti,,,,,,A medical robotic system includes articulated instruments extending out of a distal end of an entry guide. Prior to pivoting the entry guide to re-orient it and the instruments. the instruments are moved in tandem back towards the entry guide. Haptic cues and velocity limits are provided to assist the operator in the retraction of the instruments. After retraction. the entry guide may then be pivoted without concern that the instruments will harm patient anatomy.

Participants performed an attention-demanding rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) monitoring task. Meanwhile. whenever they felt a vibrotactile stimulus presented on either their front or back. they had to check the front and the rearview mirror for the rapid approach of a car. and brake or accelerate accordingly. We investigated whether speeded responses to potential emergency driving situations could be facilitated by the presentation of spatially-predictive (80% valid; Experiment 1) or spatially-nonpredictive (50% valid; Experiment 2) vibrotactile cues. Participants responded significantly more rapidly following both spatially-predictive and spatially-nonpredictive vibrotactile cues from the same rather than the opposite direction as the critical driving events.

1275424,A haptic back display for attentional and directional cueing,2003,Hong Tan and Robert Gray and J Jay Young and Ryan Taylor,,,,,Haptics-e. The electronic journal of haptics research,We have been developing a haptic back display using a 3-by-3 tactor array. This paper reports two studies that investigated the use of such a display for delivering attention- and direction-related information to its user. The first study measured the effectiveness of haptic cues in redirecting an observer's visual spatial attention. The observer was first tapped on the back. and then asked to detect a change between two similar visual scenes. We found that reaction time decreased by an average of 41% when the location of the tactor coincided with the quadrant of the visual scene where a change occurred. We also found that reaction time increased by an average of 19% when the locations of the tapping and visual change did not coincide. Such a haptic attentional cueing system can be beneficial to a user who must attend to information in small areas within a large and complex visual display (e.g. an aircraft cockpit). In the second study. sequenced pulses were employed to impart directional information. We found that native and minimally-trained observers were able to discern the directions of a set of horizontal. vertical and diagonal directional lines with an overall accuracy of 81%. Means of improving the overall accuracy were suggested and tested. These directional lines can be applied to a haptic navigation guidance or situation awareness system.,True,OiVOAHMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,328,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/34886,10400980849286467655,/scholar?cites=10400980849286467655,,,https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/34886/he-v3n1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

This measurement method has a high impact in human performance assessment and human-robot interaction. IMU motion tracking systems are indeed self-contained and wearable. allowing for long-lasting tracking of the user motion in situated environments. After a survey on IMU-based human tracking. five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion. IMU based estimation was matched against motion tracking based on the Vicon marker-based motion tracking system considered as ground truth. Results show that all but one of the selected models perform similarly (about 35 mm average position estimation error).

Firstly. the haptic information channel is fundamentally bidirectional. so the output of a haptic environment is fundamentally dependent on user input. which is difficult to reliably reproduce. Additionally. it is difficult to compare haptic results to real-world. “gold standard” results. since such a comparison requires applying identical inputs to real and virtual objects and measuring the resulting forces. which requires hardware that is not widely available. We have addressed these challenges by building and releasing several sets of position and force information. collected by physically scanning a set of real-world objects. along with virtual models of those objects.

The capacity to perceive the vitality form of others’ actions is a fundamental element of social interactions and a basic way of relating to and understanding others’ behaviors. Although vitality forms characterize all human interactions. few studies have addressed their role in social and communicative disorders such as autism. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability to recognize different vitality forms during the observation of different motor actions in a group of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) compared to typically developing controls (TD). Results show a significant difference between children with ASD and TD in vitality forms recognition.

Among all the approaches. those based on inertial sensors have been widely explored. Since inertial sensors are affected by measurements drift. they need to be aided by other sensors. thus requiring sensor measurements to be fused. The most used sensor fusion techniques are based on Kalman filter. In particular. the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are used because of the non linearity characterizing most of the models. They often aim at reconstructing human motion by estimating limbs orientation. involving human's kinematics to constrain relative motion of the limbs.

This strategy is probably the best to manage energy resources during the race and maximise performance. This study investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) with novice rowers as a means to learn about energy management. Participants from an avatar group (n = 7) were instructed to track a virtual boat on a screen. whose speed was set individually to follow the appropriate to-be-learned speed profile. A control group (n = 8) followed an indoor training programme. In spite of similar physiological characteristics in the groups. the avatar group learned and maintained the required profile. resulting in an improved performance (i.e. a decrease in race duration). whereas the control group did not.

India to find out the extent of chemical pollution in surface water due to industrial waste. Jajmau and Unnao are prominent centers for leather processing clusters of tannery industries (about 450) along the banks of river Ganga. besides other industries. Geologically the study area is beset with alluvium of Quaternary age consisting of older alluvium of middle to upper Pleistocene and newer alluvium of Holocene. Sixty-three water samples were collected from Jajmau and Unnao industrial areas and were analyzed for trace metals by using ICP-MS (Model-ELAN DRC II. Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instrument. USA). The data reveals that the surface water in the area is significantly contaminated with heavy metals such as Ba varies from 57.9 to 197.2 µg/L (average of 112.9 µg/L). Cr varies from 9.3 to 541.2 µg/L (average of 125.7 µg/L). Cu varies from 6.6 to 52.9 µg/L (average of 28.7 µg/L). Ni varies from 9.0 to 47.8 µg/L (average of 22.5 µg/L).

1275565,Enhanced ant algorithm based load balanced task scheduling in Grid computing,2008,Kuppani sathish and Prof.A Rama Mohan Reddy,8,IJCSNS,10,219,,Load balanced task scheduling is very important problem in complex grid environment. Finding optimal schedules for such an environment is an NP-hard problem. and so heuristic approaches must be used. Antalgorithm is a heuristic task scheduling algorithm which is distributable. scalable and fault tolerant. It uses the state prediction of the resources for scheduling which is necessary for effective utilization of resources. In this paper. we propose an enhanced ant-algorithm for task scheduling in grid which gives better throughput with a controlled cost. The simulation results of various scheduling algorithms are also compared. The results also show that the enhanced version works better than the ant-algorithm. The inclusion of price factor into the ant-algorithm makes this new scheduling algorithm more suitable for wide use.,True,f52BELkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,19,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kuppani_Sathish/publication/253954452_ENHANCED_ANT_ALGORITHM_BASED_LOAD_BALANCED_TASK_SCHEDULING_IN_GRID_COMPUTING/links/0deec51fb50a17b1e7000000/ENHANCED-ANT-ALGORITHM-BASED-LOAD-BALANCED-TASK-SCHEDULING-IN-GRID-COMPUTING.pdf,7867697616459591919,/scholar?cites=7867697616459591919,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kuppani_Sathish/publication/253954452_ENHANCED_ANT_ALGORITHM_BASED_LOAD_BALANCED_TASK_SCHEDULING_IN_GRID_COMPUTING/links/0deec51fb50a17b1e7000000/ENHANCED-ANT-ALGORITHM-BASED-LOAD-BALANCED-TASK-SCHEDULING-IN-GRID-COMPUTING.pdf,0,0,0

This type of the grid environment appends the complicated nature to the scheduler. Genetic algorithm (GA) is a generally used approach by researchers to figure out this type of NP-complete problems. Yet. the conventional GA is also sluggish to figure out the scheduling issues in the realistic environment due to its time consuming iterations. In this composition. we adopt the independent batch scheduling by considering the objective as energy expenditure as the scheduling criteria. Here. we proposed an optimised energy aware genetic algorithm (OGA). which is suitable for grid scheduling. and it can improve the search performance by limited iterations and increase the computing capability of finding the reasonable solution.,True,f52BELkAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,0,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJSGGC.2016.078941,,,,,,0,0,0

1275582,Trends in mobile application development,2009,Adrian Holzer and Jan Ondrus,,,,55-64,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Major software companies. such as Apple and Google. are disturbing the relatively safe and established actors of the mobile application business. These newcomers have caused significant structural changes by imposing and enforcing their own rules for the future of mobile application development. The implications of these changes do not only concern the mobile network operators and mobile phone manufacturers. This changed environment also brings additional opportunities and constraints for current mobile application developers. Therefore. developers need to assess what their options are and how they can take advantages of these current trends. In this paper. we take a developer’s perspective in order to explore how the structural changes will influence the mobile application development markets.

However. this promising application has not been as successful as anticipated. This can be partially explained by the infancy of the market and a lack of standards. Moreover. technological and business issues create a market uncertainty that mobile network operators and financial institutions have difficulties managing.

During these past years. we have been witnessing a number of mobile payment trials based on NFC. Early experiences are already quite encouraging and many expect NFC to become a highly efficient and effective technology for mobile payments. The objective of our research is to evaluate in a systematic manner the potential of NFC as an upcoming technology for mobile payments. In order to ensure the rigor of our research. we used a formal and structured approach based on multi-actor multi-criteria methods. Our research provides one of the first assessment of NFC and a realistic picture of the current Swiss situation as we involved numerous mobile payment experts.

Towards a dynamic and multi-perspective explanation,2009,Jan Ondrus and Kalle Lyytinen and Yves Pigneur,,,,,IEEE,Despite optimistic expectations fast diffusion of mobile payments has not taken place after a decade of trials. Several explanations to this situation have been put forward using several theories and levels of analysis. Due to the complexity and dynamism of the diffusion we need multiple perspectives to account for diffusion challenge. We juxtapose three frameworks into a dynamic analysis framework. We apply the proposed framework to explain three failed introductions of mobile payments in the Swiss market. In particular. a recent ambitious trial is confronted with the proposed framework to detect roots of its failure. Our analysis suggests that market-level and behavioral facets need more attention in future in explaining mobile payment diffusion.

Among these services. personalized mobile marketing and advertisement services are predicted to be particularly important. However. besides the excitement about the potential innovative one-to-one marketing strategies enabled by the mobile medium. growing concerns are been raised about the protection of the users’ privacy from what can become extremely intrusive practices in an intimate personal space. There is indeed a thin line between providing useful services and bombarding the user with mobile spam. Conscious of the importance of solving this sensible issue. the mobile marketing association itself has issued privacy guidelines to its members.

We report the results of an exploratory field experiment in Switzerland that assessed the factors driving the net payoff to users of mobile businesses. We found that (1) the personal data disclosed by users has a negative effect on user payoff;(2) the amount of personalization available has a direct and positive effect. as well as a moderating effect. on user payoff; and (3) the amount of control over a user’s personal data has a direct and positive effect. as well as a moderating effect. on user payoff. The results suggest that privacy protection could be the main value proposition in the B2C mobile market. From our theoretical model. we derive a set of guidelines to design a privacy-friendly business model pattern for thirdparty services. We discuss four examples to show how the mobile platform can play a key role in the implementation of these new business models.,True,jXfbX30AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,32,https://www.mdpi.com/0718-1876/6/2/19,10193626429499865726,/scholar?cites=10193626429499865726,,,https://www.mdpi.com/0718-1876/6/2/19/pdf,0,0,0

Business Model Canvas design has evolved from being a paper-based activity to one that involves the use of dedicated computer-aided business model design tools.  We propose a set of guidelines to help design more coherent business models. When combined with functionalities offered by CAD tools. they show great potential to improve business model design as an ongoing activity. However. in order to create complex solutions. it is necessary to compare basic business model design tasks. using a CAD system over its paper-based counterpart. To this end. we carried out an experiment to measure user perceptions of both solutions. Performance was evaluated by applying our guidelines to both solutions and then carrying out a comparison of business model designs. Although CAD did not outperform paper-based design. the results are very encouraging for the future of computer-aided business model design.,True,jXfbX30AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,19,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_E86D752E65C2.P001/REF.pdf,7925015965063667072,/scholar?cites=7925015965063667072,,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_E86D752E65C2.P001/REF.pdf,0,0,0

We draw lessons from usage and define three maturity level. We propose new concepts to help design the dynamic aspect of a business model. On the first level. the BMC supports novice users as they elicit their models; it also helps novices to build coherent models. On the second level. the BMC allows expert users to evaluate the interaction of business model elements by outlining the key threads in the business models’ story. On the third level. master users are empowered to create multiple versions of their business models. allowing them to evaluate alternatives and retain the history of the business model’s evolution.

To survive. firms must respond to these new markets. How do firms develop the capabilities necessary to succeed in such changing conditions? Some suggest that experience with previous entry builds such capabilities. Others suggest that capabilities arise from experience producing and selling to existing markets. The role of managers is also debated. Some argue that experience with existing markets causes managers to miss entry opportunities. Others argue that managers enter new markets when their firm possesses the experience needed to compete effectively.In this paper. we explore these issues by investigating entry patterns in the disk-drive industry.

Within this field. a consensus is emerging that the role of the BM in fostering innovation is twofold. First. by allowing managers and entrepreneurs to connect innovative products and technologies to a realized output in a market. the BM represents an important vehicle for innovation. Second. the BM may be also a source of innovation in and of itself. It represents a new dimension of innovation. distinct. albeit complementary. to traditional dimensions of innovation. such as product. process or organizational.This chapter serves to introduce the notion of Business Model Innovation (BMI) and has four main objectives. to:(1) clarify the origins and notion of the BM;(2) organize the literature on BMI around emerging literature streams;(3) offer an overview of the various tools that have been proposed in supporting managers and entrepreneurs in dealing with BMI; and (4) offer a discussion of the principal managerial challenges related to managing BMs and BMI.,True,RFzKNrYAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,542,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZBJwAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA420&dq=info:9MQtRf5OiowJ:scholar.google.com&ots=DuukeM3ove&sig=93N_kHqrplCLJPARRVhB5QeW1rk,10126993566085268724,/scholar?cites=10126993566085268724,,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/201604/files/massa_tucci_FINAL_FINAL_reduced.pdf,0,0,0

The validity of the notion that competitive advantages are sustainable began to be questioned toward the end of the 20th century as the dual forces of technological change and globalization heightened competition and eroded bases—sometimes long-established bases—for competitive superiority (Bettis and Hitt. 1995). Innovation began to be regarded as inherent to effective management practice. and the premise that competitive advantage must be renewed replaced the premise that competitive advantage is sustainable. The recognized need for renewal led managers and management scholars to consider how entrepreneurial processes might be enacted within established organizations for the purposes of achieving and perpetuating competitive superiority (Covin and Slevin. 2002). Thus. an interest in corporate entrepreneurship (CE) was born. CE seeks to renew established organizations. thereby facilitating their viability and competitiveness through the utilization of various innovation-based initiatives. The recognized scope of the CE domain has expanded significantly over the past few decades. Early CE scholars (eg. Hill and Hlavacek. 1972; Peterson and Berger. 1971) often adopted somewhat ambiguous views of the domain of CE in the sense that what was considered entrepreneurial about the phenomenon under investigation was either not explicitly defined or was not differentiated from other phenomena commonly associated with …,True,RFzKNrYAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,202,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/189699/files/corbett_et_al_JPIM_2013_FINAL.pdf,2498919410813454032,/scholar?cites=2498919410813454032,,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/189699/files/corbett_et_al_JPIM_2013_FINAL.pdf,0,0,0

One prediction is that internetworking could narrow organizational scope and deepen specialization. reduce hierarchy. and increase external partnering. A second contends that internetworking might increase scope. expand hierarchy. and decrease external partnering. Analysis of a multinational sample of 469 firms reveals that deeply internetworked firms are more focused and specialized. less hierarchical. and more engaged in external partnering than less intensively internetworked organizations are.

We present a four-year study. based on design science research. to develop and instantiate a conceptual model—called Coopilot—to improve real-time coordination in IS projects. Coopilot is a simple conversational guide to help IS project managers minimize the number of coordination surprises that arise for teams during their project meetings. Drawing on coordination literature outside the IS research field. we have adapted and instantiated the theory of joint activity developed by psycholinguist Herbert Clark. The results illustrate the value Clark's theory can add to the IS field and both the importance of conversation intended as a new theoretical construct in IS team project coordination as well as the importance of reaching a sufficient level of understanding.

We found that (1) the personal data disclosed by users has a negative effect on user payoff;(2) the amount of personalization available has a direct and positive effect. as well as a moderating effect. on user payoff; and (3) the amount of control over a user’s personal data has a direct and positive effect. as well as a moderating effect. on user payoff. The results suggest that privacy protection could be the main value proposition in the B2C mobile market.

Such widespread use brings with it concerns over the protection of privacy. Building upon existing privacy concern literature. this study has developed a theoretical framework that combines a privacy calculus model with a technology acceptance model (TAM) in the mobile application context.

Such tools build on design thinking techniques to allow management practitioners to jointly inquire into specific strategic management problems. As the interest in and the emergence of visual inquiry tools gain momentum. it is important to formalize the design knowledge that future designers can build on to develop such tools. Thus. we propose a design theory for visual inquiry tools based on the design knowledge accumulated within and across three projects: the Business Model Canvas. the Value Proposition Canvas. and the Team Alignment Map. We outline the design principles (among others) that should be followed for developing visual inquiry tools for other strategic management problems. Our study addresses the lack of guidance in the development of visual inquiry tools and the lack of methodological guidance in design science research on how to theorize and formalize knowledge across multiple projects.

Also. having a well-defined brand allows the people involved in an ecosystem to communicate consistently to all stakeholders.

1275649,Designing a Visual Inquiry Tool for Identity Communication,2019,Dina Elikan,,,,,,In this doctoral dissertation. I relate three studies performed to address the challenge of a visual inquiry tool for identity communication in the context of startups and SMEs. The challenge being: how to develop a visual inquiry tool (a tool on which a team of stakeholders with different backgrounds could try and solve their challenge in a designerly way) especially tailored to help them tackle the issue of communicating a coherent brand identity to all their different stakeholders. These three chapters (or studies) have been developed within a design science paradigm of research. which allows to develop knowledge through both theoretical and in the form of artefacts to tackle a practical problem. The main contributions of this dissertation are: 1) a brand identity ontology based on an extensive literature review. which addresses the semantic issues found in the brand identity literature and gives us the opportunity to explore and redefine the concept in terms of a conceptual model and 2) an identity communication map. this is derived from the ontology but is this time directly aimed at practitioners. It addresses the challenge of creating a coherent and structured identity communication especially in the context of startup and SMEs. And lastly. 3) by analyzing existing visual inquiry tools. we derived a design theory for managing any business challenge in a designerly way. This last contribution aims at supporting future designers and researchers when developing such artefacts. The view proposed in this thesis is highly interdisciplinary. but focuses mainly on design and proposes to adopt a new approach when solving management problems.,True,47x_2rkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_33C796025F84.P002/REF.pdf,,,,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_33C796025F84.P002/REF.pdf,0,0,0

When can these claims be made? We answer this question by first discussing design and estimation conditions under which model estimates can be interpreted. using the randomized experiment as the gold standard. We show how endogeneity – which includes omitted variables. omitted selection. simultaneity. common-method variance. and measurement error – renders estimates causally uninterpretable.

Here. we evaluate economic risk preferences on the gain domain (i.e.. risk aversion) at three time points following exposure to psychosocial stress (immediately after. and 20 and 45 min from onset). Using lottery games. we examine decisions at both the individual and social levels. We find that risk aversion shows a time‐dependent change across the first post‐stress hour. evolving from less risk aversion shortly after stress to more risk averse behaviour …,True,hyFUYPIAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC,36,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejn.13395,2442295222084549378,/scholar?cites=2442295222084549378,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ejn.13395,0,0,0

Here. we investigated these apparently contradictory findings in the post-weaning social isolation paradigm (PWSI). an established laboratory model of abnormal aggression. When studied in the resident-intruder test as adults. rats submitted to PWSI showed increased attack counts. increased share of bites directed towards vulnerable body parts of opponents (head. throat. and belly) and reduced social signaling of attacks.

1275667,Co-oP: A group decision support system for cooperative multiple criteria group decision making,1987,Tung X Bui and X Tung Bui,290,,,,Springer Verlag,This book proposes an approach to analyzing. designing and implementing Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS). The experience gained in developing a concrete system. Co-oP. suggests that GDSS should be distributed. loosely-coupled and process-driven. A distributed and loosely-coupled GDSS architecture provides autonomy and flexibility for individual decision-making. and homogeneity and simplicity for group problem solving. Also. process-driven GDSS are able to deal with the unpredictable nature of group problems since collective decision processes have been shown to be the only elements in a GDSS that are (i) stable enough to fit into most collective problems.(ii) reasonably structurable to be implementable. and (iii) sufficiently controllable to guarantee appropriate use. From a Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) viewpoint. this book supports the integrated use of various MCDM methods to help a GDSS (i) support a wide range of decision situations.(ii) attenuate the difficulty of information search.(iii) allow division of decision-making tasks. and (iv) permit consensus seeking analysis. Co-oP runs on a network of individual workstations. It contains a set of MCDM methods. techniques of aggregation of preferences. and a consensus seeking algorithm to support negotiation. Electronic communication among group members is monitored by a group norm filter which is adaptable to a large number of collective decision situations.

1275673,Designing and evaluating e-business models,2001,Jaap Gordijn and Hans Akkermans,16,IEEE intelligent Systems,4,11-17,IEEE Computer Society,Business models are usually represented by a mixture of informal textual. verbal. and ad-hoc graphical representations. However. these representations typically limit a clear understanding of the e-business issues that confront the stakeholders. and often perpetuate the existing gap between business executives and the IT developers who must create the e-business information systems. This article presents a conceptual modeling approach to e-business—called e3-value—that is designed to help define how economic value is created and exchanged within a network of actors. Doing e-business well requires the formulation of an e-business model that will serve as the first step in requirements analysis for e-business information systems. The industry currently lacks adequate methods for formulating these kinds of requirements. Methods from the IT systems analysis domain generally have a strong technology bias and typically do not reflect business considerations very well. Meanwhile. approaches from the business sciences often lack the rigor needed for information systems development. A tighter integration of business and IT modeling would most certainly benefit the industry. because the integration of business and IT systems is already a distinct feature of e-business. This article shows some ways to achieve this kind of modeling integration. Our e3-value method is based on an economic valueoriented ontology that specifies what an e-business model is made of. In particular. it entails defining. deriving. and analyzing multi-enterprise relationships. e-business scenarios. and operations requirements in both qualitative and quantitative ways …,True,s-gUfQsAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,1084,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/861d/6d5a93509a1ef7f449234230ac5c08f9118d.pdf,1427171055081606651,/scholar?cites=1427171055081606651,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/861d/6d5a93509a1ef7f449234230ac5c08f9118d.pdf,0,0,0

1275674,Business modelling is not process modelling,2000,Jaap Gordijn and Hans Akkermans and Hans Van Vliet,,,,40-51,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Innovative e-business projects start with a design of the e-business model. We often encounter the view. in research as well as industry practice. that an e-business model is similar to a business process model. and so can be specified using UML activity diagrams or Petri nets. In this paper. we explain why this is a misunderstanding. The root cause is that a business model is not about process but about value exchanged between actors.

Yet. little research has tempted to compare and integrate the different business model approaches. This paper compares two business model ontologies. the Business Model Ontology BMO and the e3value ontology. for the design of business models and value constellations. For that purpose it introduces a framework that allows the comparison of different conceptual approaches to business models. The two ontologies are illustrated through a case study in the domain of rights music management. The outcome of the analysis is twofold. Firstly. it permits a better understanding of business model research.

The basic concepts in the reference ontology concern actors. resources. and the transfer of resources between actors. Most of the concepts in the reference ontology are taken from one of the original ontologies. but we have also introduced a number of additional concepts. primarily related to resource transfers between business actors.

Heidelberg,An electronic business model is an important baseline for the development of e-commerce system applications. Essentially. it provides the design rationale for e-commerce systems from the business point of view. However. how an e-business model must be defined and specified is a largely open issue. Business decision makers tend to use the notion in a highly informal way. and usually there is a big gap between the business view and that of IT developers. Nevertheless. we show that conceptual modelling techniques from IT provide very useful tools for precisely pinning down what e-business models actually are. as well as for their structured specification. We therefore present a (lightweight) ontology of what should be in an e-business model.

1275684,Prediction Markets as Web 2.0 Tools for Enterprise 2.0.,2011,Cedric Gaspoz,,,,,,In today’s fast-changing business environment. companies and stakeholders are confronted with a new range of business decisions. These decisions are constrained by events that are out of the scope of competencies of the decision makers. In this context. prediction markets. which have demonstrated their efficiency in predicting the outcome of major elections. could support companies in leveraging the knowledge and competencies of their collaborators. Using the power of Web 2.0 and the participative collaboration of the crowd. prediction markets are well designed to assess this new range of decisions. The simple buy and sell mechanism use the crowd as proxy toward various information sources. Moreover. the decision task is distributed between the traders. leaving them the tasks of framing the problem. setting the evaluation criteria and collecting the supporting information. aggregating their results with the current market price. This paper presents the capabilities of prediction markets in an Enterprise 2.0 context and makes propositions regarding their deployment.

Despite various attempts to inform users of these privacy issues. they continue to adopt risky behaviors. In order to better protect users of these devices. we need to understand the antecedents of the decision to install potentially privacy-threatening applications on them. We ran a large experiment in order to determine the influence of privacy risks literacy on the intent to install a potentially privacy threatening application on a smartphone.

1275686,Prediction Markets Supporting Technology Assessment,2010,Cédric Gaspoz,,,,,,In this thesis. we study the use of prediction markets for technology assessment. We particularly focus on their ability to assess complex issues. the design constraints required for such applications and their efficacy compared to traditional techniques. To achieve this. we followed a design science research paradigm. iteratively developing. instantiating. evaluating and refining the design of our artifacts. This allowed us to make multiple contributions. both practical and theoretical. We first showed that prediction markets are adequate for properly assessing complex issues. We also developed a typology of design factors and design propositions for using these markets in a technology assessment context. Then. we showed that they are able to solve some issues related to the R&D portfolio management process and we proposed a roadmap for their implementation. Finally. by comparing the instantiation and the results of a multi-criteria decision method and a prediction market. we showed that the latter are more efficient. while offering similar results. We also proposed a framework for comparing forecasting methods. to identify the constraints based on contingency factors. In conclusion. our research opens a new field of application of prediction markets and should help hasten their adoption by enterprises.

Moreover. due to the uniqueness and the historic value of these artifacts. invasive analysis are not always possible. Therefore. without sampling options. conservators are required to use non-invasive diagnostic methods in order to identify the metal characteristics of the artifact. When confronted with an unknown artifact. conservators generate conceptual models of the corrosion forms. These models are based on formal representations of corrosion forms. but are not directly exploitable for drawing hypotheses regarding the underlying metal.

1275693,Ontology driven feedforward risk management,2019,Cédric Gaspoz and Ulysse Rosselet and Mathias Rossi and Mélanie Thomet,,,,253-261,Springer. Cham,Organizations are increasingly relying on projects to support their activities. With this increase. the management of these projects is becoming critical. New methods. tools and frameworks appear in order to improve the success rate of these projects. However. being complex endeavours. projects face numerous challenges that have to be addressed with proper risk management. Various risk management frameworks have been developed in order to support project managers in their task of identifying and controlling risk.

In order to more productively address these risks. we have developed an ontology to support feedforward risk management.

The layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices. networks. services. and contents created by digital technology. We posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. We develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.,True,yX-R0QwAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,1940,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.1100.0322,15285230649391060682,/scholar?cites=15285230649391060682,,,https://eclass.aegean.gr/modules/document/file.php/TNEY202/yoo-et-al--2010_1-%20copy.pdf,0,0,0

The first step in the risk management process is to identify the risk itself. so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. One problem in this task. however. is that no validated lists are available to help the project manager understand the nature and types of risks typically faced in a software project. This paper represents a first step toward alleviating this problem by developing an authoritative list of common risk factors. We deploy a rigorous data collection method called a ""ranking-type"" Delphi survey to produce a rank-order list of risk factors. This data collection method is designed to elicit and organize opinions of a panel of experts through iterative. controlled feedback.

Millions of users log onto Facebook. download iPhone applications. and use mobile services to create decentralized work organizations. Understanding these new dynamics will necessitate the field paying attention to digital infrastructures as a category of IT artifacts. A state-of-the-art review of the literature reveals a growing interest in digital infrastructures but also confirms that the field has yet to put infrastructure at the centre of its research endeavor.

No. 12 COMMUNICATIONSOF THE ACM capability to physically move computing services with us. As a result. the computer becomes a takenfor-granted. ever-present device that expands our capabilities to inscribe. remember. communicate. and reason independently of the device’s location. This can happen either by reducing the size of the computing devices and/or providing access to computing capacity over a broadband network through lightweight devices. In principle. this evolution has been marked by the movement of computers from insulated and sealed rooms to our offices. to our laps. and finally to our pockets. clothing. and body. Combined with access capability. this has transformed computing into an activity that can be carried to a beach. a jungle. or an airport to support a wide array of human activities. In mobile computing. however. an important limitation is that the computing model does not considerably change while we move. This is because the computing device cannot seamlessly and flexibly obtain information about the context in which the computing takes place and adjust it accordingly. The only way to accommodate the needs and possibilities of changing environments is to have users manually control and configure the applications while they move—a task most users do not want to perform. Another dimension in making the computer invisible is the idea of pervasive computing. This concept implies the computer has the capability to obtain the information from the environment in which it is embedded and utilize it to dynamically build models of computing.

1275712,Cloud basics–an introduction to cloud computing,2010,Katarina Stanoevska-Slabeva and Thomas Wozniak,,,,47-61,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Cloud Computing has attracted a lot of attention in recent times. The media as well as analysts are generally very positive about the opportunities Cloud Computing is offering. In May 2008. Merrill Lynch (2008) estimated the cost advantages of Cloud Computing to be three to five times for business applications and more than five times for consumer applications. According to a Gartner press release from June 2008. Cloud Computing will be “no less influential than e-business” (Gartner 2008a). The positive attitude towards the importance and influence of Cloud Computing resulted in optimistic Cloud-related market forecasts. In October 2008. IDC (2008b) forecasted an almost threefold growth of spending on Cloud services until 2012. reaching $42 billion. Same analyst firm reported that the cost advantage associated with the Cloud model becomes even more attractive in the economic downturn (IDC 2008b …,True,XnJBkMgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,81,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05193-7_4,4300255025718816834,/scholar?cites=4300255025718816834,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/35804975/cloud_basics.pdf,0,0,0

1275713,Platform as a Service–A conjoint study on consumers’ preferences,2012,Andrea Giessmann and Katarina Stanoevska,,,,,,Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions are changing the way that software is produced. distributed. consumed. and priced. PaaS. also known as cloud platform. offer an execution environment based on software platforms. To be competitive on the market. PaaS providers have to be aware of drivers of successful platforms and design or adjust their business models accordingly. Surprisingly. prior research has made little attempt to investigate consumers’ preferences on PaaS that influence developers’ choice on PaaS solutions. This paper examines this understudied issue through a conjoint study. First a comprehensive literature analysis on PaaS has been conducted in order to build the study design on a rigorous foundation. The conducted conjoint survey contained ten attributes together with 26 corresponding attribute levels and has been completed by 103 participants. Based on the results. a prioritized list of customers’ preferences for PaaS has been created.,True,XnJBkMgAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC,57,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.840.7361&rep=rep1&type=pdf,7180070122242840277,/scholar?cites=7180070122242840277,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.840.7361&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Software as a Service (SaaS). Platform as a Service (PaaS). and Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) are terms that denote new developments in the software industry that are completely changing the way software is produced. consumed. and distributed. In particular new PaaS business models have a disruptive effect on existing business models and require thorough business model innovation in the software industry. Despite their impact. PaaS business models have not been considered in a sufficient manner in literature yet. The paper at hand contributes to this gap by providing an overview of typical characteristics of PaaS based on a systematic literature review. a classification model of existing PaaS business models based on case studies. and an overview of the current state and future development directions of PaaS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],True,XnJBkMgAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC,55,https://search.proquest.com/openview/beb21a86d14ac60dbf94b335defd142b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=25721,17961699069204578278,/scholar?cites=17961699069204578278,,,,0,0,0

Another impediment for further spread of e-commerce is the lack of trust in the security of the electronic communication in general.Our modern society relies on an economic system that is mainly based on the mechanism of contracts. Right now our industrial and service society is changing to an even more modern information society. One of the most important indicators that shows this change is the growing digital economy. But without any trust of the economic community in electronic contracts the new economy will not be able to unfold its full potential and the benefit for our society will stay behind the possibilities the new technology is able to offer. Either we can build up the trust in technical solutions for electronic contracts or we have to find a new concept for the exchange of goods in the digital age.,True,XnJBkMgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,55,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.37.6036&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1106012868901516376,/scholar?cites=1106012868901516376,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.37.6036&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

To this end. the MobiHealth project has developed and trialed a highly customisable vital signs monitoring system based on a body area network (BAN) and a mobile-health (m-health) service platform utilising next generation public wireless networks. The developed system allows the incorporation of diverse medical sensors via wireless connections. and the live transmission of the measured vital signs over public wireless networks to healthcare providers. Nine trials with different healthcare scenarios and patient groups in four different European countries have been conducted.

There are both good and bad reasons for adopting the technology. and even the success stories suggest that it is not so easy to introduce object-oriented techniques where they were not practised before. Some of the questionable reasons for “going OO” are:•“Object-oriented programming is a better kind of structured programming”—perhaps. but structured programming methods won’t help you very much in developing object-oriented applications. Object-oriented programming is not just structured programming wearing a new hat.•“We’ll be able to build applications more quickly because objects are reusable”—there can be a huge gap between software written in an object-oriented language and a truly reusable framework of object classes.

A generic understanding of IoT is that it offers numerous services in many domains. utilizing conventional internet infrastructure by enabling different communication patterns such as human-to-object. object-to-objects. and object-to-object. Integrating IoT objects into the standard Internet. however. has unlocked several security challenges. as most internet technologies and connectivity protocols have been specifically designed for unconstrained objects. Moreover. IoT objects have their own limitations in terms of computation power. memory and bandwidth.

The sooner treatment begins. the better the ultimate outcome for the patient. Generally the initial treatment is handled by paramedical personnel arriving at the site of the accident with an ambulance. There is evidence to show that if the expertise of the on-site paramedic team can be supported by immediate and continuous access to and communication with the expert medical team at the hospital. patient outcomes can be improved. After care also influences the ultimate recovery of the patient. After-treatment follow up often occurs in-hospital in spite of the fact that care at home can offer more advantages and can accelerate recovery. Based on emerging and future wireless communication technologies. in a previous paper [1] we presented an initial vision of two future healthcare settings. supported by applications which we call Virtual Trauma Team and Virtual Homecare Team. The Virtual Trauma Team application involves high quality wireless multimedia communications between ambulance paramedics and the hospital facilitated by paramedic Body Area Networks (BANs) [2] and an ambulance-based Vehicle Area Network (VAN).

1275728,Bridging practice and theory: A design science approach,2009,Jan Holmström and Mikko Ketokivi and Ari‐Pekka Hameri,40,Decision Sciences,1,65-87,Blackwell Publishing Inc,Despite ambitious efforts in various fields of research over multiple decades. the goal of making academic research relevant to the practitioner remains elusive: theoretical and academic research interests do not seem to coincide with the interests of managerial practice. This challenge is more fundamental than knowledge transfer. it is one of diverging knowledge interests and means of knowledge production. In this article. we look at this fundamental challenge through the lens of design science. which is an approach aimed primarily at discovery and problem solving as opposed to accumulation of theoretical knowledge. We explore in particular the ways in which problem‐solving research and theory‐oriented academic research can complement one another. In operations management (OM) research. recognizing and building on this complementarity is especially crucial. because problem‐solving–oriented …,True,v7qEv8YAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,533,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5915.2008.00221.x,2488996002061890604,/scholar?cites=2488996002061890604,,,,0,0,0

The approach taken stems from the production planning paradigm. with emphasis on the product. rather than on the process. It is argued that a complete part list or product breakdown structure (PBS) is the absolute prerequisite for the design of a successful work breakdown structure (WBS) for a project. This process requires the definition of the design and configuration disciplines during the engineering phase. These critical issues of concurrent engineering and product development are also emphasized in the paper. The WBS is. in turn. needed to establish a suitable organizational breakdown structure (OBS or organigram) for the project. Finally. the assembly sequence and the related assembly breakdown structure (ABS) of the end product is required before commencing the project planning phase. which …,True,v7qEv8YAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,89,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786396000701,2681532684030035939,/scholar?cites=2681532684030035939,,,https://cds.cern.ch/record/280704/files/mt-95-002.pdf,0,0,0

Security modelling languages exist to reason on security in the early phases of IS development. when the most crucial design decisions are made. Reasoning on security involves analysing risk. and effectively communicating risk-related information. However. we think that current languages can be improved in this respect.

Although autonomy brings flexibility and realism in the animation. these objects needs to be controlled. In this paper we present an organizational model MoiseInst aiming at specifying the rights and duties of agents in society according to four points of view: structural. functional. contextual and normative. We show how this model is used within an application of interactive TV game show where avatars are represented as agents.

1275747,Towards a risk-based security requirements engineering framework,2005,Nicolas Mayer and André Rifaut and Eric Dubois,5,Proc. of REFSQ,,,,Information Systems (IS). particularly e-business systems. are required to be more secure in order to resist to the increasing number of attacks. Security is no longer just a desirable quality of IT systems. but is required for compliance to international regulations. The Requirements Engineering (RE) community has started to make successful contributions in the domain of security engineering. This concerns the integration of RE techniques at the early stages of security engineering. as well as the iterative management of security requirements. due to the intertwining between requirements and software architecture design. This paper proposes to complement these results by adapting and integrating another key activity of security. namely risk analysis. The aim of this paper is to show. that using and adapting an appropriate set of existing tools and techniques of risk analysis methods. improves the effectiveness of an iterative security engineering method starting at the earliest stage of IS development.,True,9Lk6-s8AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,78,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rifaut_Andre/publication/228338885_Towards_a_risk-based_security_requirements_engineering_framework/links/0fcfd5142ea243863a000000/Towards-a-risk-based-security-requirements-engineering-framework.pdf,14414669068238348113,/scholar?cites=14414669068238348113,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rifaut_Andre/publication/228338885_Towards_a_risk-based_security_requirements_engineering_framework/links/0fcfd5142ea243863a000000/Towards-a-risk-based-security-requirements-engineering-framework.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,In this paper. we present a formal object-oriented specification language designed for capturing requirements expressed on composite real-time systems. The specification describes the system as a society of ‘agents’. each of them being characterised (i) by its responsibility with respect to actions happening in the system and (ii) by its time-varying perception of the behaviour of the other agents.

1275749,Theoretical foundations for conceptual modelling in information systems development,1995,Yair Wand and David E Monarchi and Jeffrey Parsons and Carson C Woo,15,Decision Support Systems,4,285-304,North-Holland,Conceptual modelling in information systems development is the creation of an enterprise model for the purpose of designing the information system. It is an important aspect of systems analysis. The value of a conceptual modelling language (CML) lies in its ability to capture the relevant knowledge about a domain. To determine which constructs should be included in a CML it would be beneficial to use some theoretical guidelines. However. this is usually not done. The purpose of this paper is to promote the idea that theories related to human knowledge can be used as foundations for conceptual modelling in systems development. We suggest the use of ontology. concept theory. and speech act theory. These approaches were chosen because: (1) they deal with important and different aspects relevant to conceptual modelling and (2) they have already been used in the context of systems analysis.

Cooperative information systems is a relatively young research area which tries to systematically investigate the synergies between these research fields. driven by the observation that change management is the central issue facing all three areas today and that all three fields have indeed developed rather similar strategies to cope with change.In this paper. we therefore propose a framework which views cooperative information systems as composed from three interrelated facets. viz. the system facet. the group collaboration facet. and the organizational facet. We present an overview of these facets. emphasizing strategies they have developed over the past few years to accommodate change.

We propose a negotiation protocol. SANP (Speech-Act-based Negotiation Protocol). which is based on Ballmer and Brennenstuhl's speech act classification and on negotiation analysis literature. The protocol is implemented as a domain-independent system using Strudel. which is an electronic mail toolkit. A small study tested the potential use of the protocol.

The interesting thing about the system Is that everything expressed by the user--commands. scope. arguments. and sketch data--is articulated using the same sketching techniques. To extend this point to the extreme by way of example. a sketched circle may invoke the command to delete all of the sketches of circles within the scope of an enclosing sketched circle.

Empirical evidence reveals that effective strategic alignment leads to superior financial performance for organizations. This observation has spurred extensive research into business-IT alignment. Yet. the issue of alignment remains a top concern for CIOs. We argue that the parochial view undertaken by past research into business-IT alignment is a probable cause for continuing system failures.

We propose that Habermas' theory of communicative action is useful for investigating the CBIS developmental process. To support this we analyze our experiences in constructing two different DSSs. Communicative action theory is used to uncover and explain the unexpected failure of one and the unanticipated success of another. The two case studies show how appropriate communicative action can be used to respond to design uncertainty and user resistance. The cases also suggest that a lack of appropriate communicative action during the developmental process can cause premature system failure. We perceive the problems in constructing these DSSs to be representative of the difficulties experienced in developing different CBISs.

It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking-through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task. CMS must be prepared to search for new particles. such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles. from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb-1 or less. The analysis tools that have been developed are applied to study in great detail and with all the methodology of performing an analysis on CMS data specific benchmark processes upon which to gauge the performance of CMS. These processes cover several Higgs boson decay channels. the production and decay of new particles such as Z′ and supersymmetric particles. B s production and processes in heavy ion collisions. The simulation of these benchmark processes includes subtle effects such as possible detector miscalibration and misalignment.

The main features of the model are: an accessibility maximization objective; several levels of demand and of facilities; a nested hierarchy of facilities (i.e. a facility of a given level can serve demand of equal and lower levels); maximum and minimum capacity constraints; and user-to-facility assignment constraints. The latter include single-assignment and closest-assignment constraints. as well as a new type of constraints called path-assignment constraints. Their purpose is to enforce some desirable properties for the spatial pattern of assignments. If they are not included. model solutions are difficult to interpret and to explain in a public facility planning context. therefore being less likely to be accepted by the users.

However. since product development activities may be coupled in complex ways. overlapping interrelated activities can present many difficulties. Without careful management of the overlapped product development process. the development effort and cost may increase. and product quality may worsen.

1275779,Modeling impacts of process architecture on cost and schedule risk in product development,2002,Tyson R Browning and Steven D Eppinger,49,IEEE transactions on engineering management,4,428-442,IEEE,To gain competitive leverage. firms that design and develop complex products seek to increase the efficiency and predictability of their development processes. Process improvement is facilitated by the development and use of models that account for and illuminate important characteristics of the process. Iteration is a fundamental but often unaddressed feature of product development (PD) processes. Its impact is mediated by the architecture of a process. i.e.. its constituent activities and their interactions. This paper integrates several important characteristics of PD processes into a single model. highlighting the effects of varying process architecture. The PD process is modeled as a network of activities that exchange deliverables. Each activity has an uncertain duration and cost. an improvement curve. and risks of rework based on changes in its inputs. A work policy governs the timing of activity execution and …,True,ewwakRYAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,648,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1176870/,8534317901507403267,/scholar?cites=8534317901507403267,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2739/SWP-4050-45322218.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

1275780,A predictive model of sequential iteration in engineering design,1997,Robert P Smith and Steven D Eppinger,43,Management Science,8,1104-1120,INFORMS,This paper presents a model describing sequential iteration. one of the fundamental solution processes experienced in complex engineering design projects. The model is based upon the design structure matrix representation and assumes that each individual design activity is of deterministic duration with probabilistic repetition. where the repeat probabilities are defined by the strength of the task coupling. Using the model. we are able to compute the expected duration of the iterative solution process. and to suggest an initial ordering of the coupled design tasks to minimize the expected duration. We conclude the paper with a discussion of limitations and several extensions to the sequential iteration model.,True,ewwakRYAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,567,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.43.8.1104,12726300967612404738,/scholar?cites=12726300967612404738,,,http://web.mit.edu/~eppinger/www/pdf/Smith_MS_Aug1997.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver. which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast. we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions. which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award …,True,IO6vsAoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1012,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1080.0884,1503073615353130032,/scholar?cites=1503073615353130032,,,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&context=oid_papers,0,0,0

1275785,Innovation tournaments: Creating and selecting exceptional opportunities,2009,Christian Terwiesch and Karl T Ulrich,,,,,Harvard Business School Pr,Managers. entrepreneurs. and venture capitalists all seek to maximize the financial returns from innovation. and profits are driven largely by the quality of the opportunities they pursue. Based on a structured and process-driven approach this book demonstrates how to systematically identify exceptional opportunities for innovation. An innovation tournament. just like its counterpart in sports. starts with a large number of candidates. with opportunities as the players. These opportunities are pitted against each other until only the exceptional survive. This book provides a principled approach for the effective management of innovation tournaments-identifying a wealth of promising opportunities and then evaluating and filtering them intelligently for greatest profitability. With a set of practical tools for creating and identifying new opportunities. it guides the reader in evaluating and screening opportunities. The book demonstrates how to construct an innovation portfolio and how to align the innovation process with an organization's competitive strategy.

1275786,Communication and uncertainty in concurrent engineering,1998,Christoph H Loch and Christian Terwiesch,44,Management Science,8,1032-1048,INFORMS,We present an analytical model of concurrent engineering. where an upstream and a down-stream task are overlapped to minimize time-to-market. The gain from overlapping activities must be weighed against the delay from rework that results from proceeding in parallel based on preliminary information. Communication reduces the negative effect of rework at the expense of communication time. We derive the optimal levels of concurrency combined with communication. and we analyze how these two decisions interact in the presence of uncertainty and dependence. Uncertainty is modeled via the average rate of engineering changes. and its reduction via the change of the modification rate over time. In addition. we model dependence by the impact the modifications impose on the downstream task. The model yields three main results.

To speed development. tasks often proceed in parallel by relying on preliminary information from other tasks. information that has not yet been finalized. This frequently causes substantial rework using as much as 50% of total engineering capacity. Previous studies have either described coordination as a complex social process. or have focused on the frequency. but not the content. of information exchanges. Through extensive fieldwork in a high-end German automotive manufacturer. we develop a framework of preliminary information that distinguishes information precision and information stability.

1275788,Learning and process improvement during production ramp-up,2001,Christian Terwiesch and Roger E Bohn,70,International journal of production economics,1,1-19,Elsevier,Rapid product lifecycles and high development costs pressure manufacturing firms to cut not only their development times (time-to-market). but also the time to reach full capacity utilization (time-to-volume). The period between completion of development and full capacity utilization is known as production ramp-up. During that time. the new production process is ill understood. which causes low yields and low production rates. This paper analyzes the interactions among capacity utilization. yields. and process improvement (learning). We model learning in the form of deliberate experiments. which reduce capacity in the short run. This creates a trade-off between experiments and production. High selling prices during ramp-up raise the opportunity cost of experiments. yet early learning is more valuable than later learning.

Using operational data from patient transport services and cardiothoracic surgery—two vastly different health-care delivery services—we show that the processing speed of service workers is influenced by the system load. We find that workers accelerate the service rate as load increases. In particular. a 10% increase in load reduces length of stay by two days for cardiothoracic surgery patients. whereas a 20% increase in the load for patient transporters reduces the transport time by 30 seconds. Moreover. we show that such acceleration may not be sustainable. Long periods of increased load (overwork) have the effect of decreasing the service rate. In cardiothoracic surgery. an increase in overwork by 1% increases length of stay by six hours.

However. research on the applicability of the concept in different technological environments remains scarce. So far. very few industry-specific studies have statistically confirmed an accelerating effect of overlap. In the present article we statistically measure the effectiveness of overlapping development activities in reducing project completion time. Building on analytical research in operations management. we argue that this effectiveness differs with the organization's capability to resolve uncertainty early in the process. Projects benefit more from overlap if they are able to resolve uncertainty early.

There are two fundamental approaches that can be taken to user design: parameter-based systems and needs-based systems.

With needs-based systems. users specify the relative importance of their needs. and an optimization algorithm recommends the combination of design parameters that is likely to maximize user utility.

A distinctive feature of this retailer is that it allows consumers to repeatedly submit offers on one and the same product. While consumers could identify the threshold price (the minimum price for which the retailer is willing to sell) by incrementing their offer in small steps in each consecutive round. such a strategy would require them to go through many additional online transactions. We define frictional cost as the disutility that the consumer experiences when conducting an online transaction. such as submitting an offer. Thus. in our setting. consumers trade off a direct financial value (lower price) for frictional costs. Based on a consumer choice model capturing this trade-off. we use the observed consumer behavior to reconstruct the frictional cost parameters for the consumers in our sample.

The value of a project to a firm depends not only on its properties but also on the other projects being developed by the firm. This is due to interactions with the other projects that address the same consumer need and require the same development resources. In this study. we empirically investigate the structure and significance of these portfolio-level project interactions. Using a self-developed pharmaceutical industry data set. we conduct an event study around the failure of phase III clinical trials and their effect on the market valuation of the firm.

Use of all-electric drive trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to address these concerns. However. motorist anxiety induced by an electric vehicle's limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer adoption. A novel switching-station-based solution is touted as a promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that. when depleted. can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations. and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching-station operation; we embed …,True,UTudPl4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,187,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1916,17635170434929258867,/scholar?cites=17635170434929258867,,,https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5602&context=lkcsb_research,0,0,0

1275797,The strategic perils of delayed differentiation,2007,Krishnan S Anand and Karan Girotra,53,Management science,5,697,INFORMS,The value of delayed differentiation (also known as postponement) for a monopolist has been extensively studied in the operations literature. We analyze the case of (imperfectly) competitive markets with demand uncertainty. wherein the choice of supply chain configuration (i.e.. early or delayed differentiation) is endogenous to the competing firms. We characterize firms’ choices in equilibrium and analyze the effects of these choices on quantities sold. profits. consumer surplus. and welfare. We demonstrate that purely strategic considerations not previously identified in the literature play a pivotal role in determining the value of delayed differentiation. In the face of either entry threats or competition. these strategic effects can significantly diminish the value of delayed differentiation. In fact. under plausible conditions. these effects dominate the traditional risk-pooling benefits associated with delayed differentiation. in …,True,UTudPl4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,155,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0655,9916189531508699720,/scholar?cites=9916189531508699720,,,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1099&context=oid_papers,0,0,0

When should you make your key decisions? Who are your best decision makers? and Why do key decision makers choose as they do? In this article they present a framework to help managers take business model innovation to the level of a reliable and improvable discipline.

Chicago. and New York (among many others) have set up bike-share systems to facilitate the use of bicycles for urban commuting. This paper estimates the impact of two facets of system performance on bike-share ridership: accessibility (how far the user must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the likelihood of finding a bicycle). We obtain these estimates from a structural demand model for ridership estimated using data from the Vélib’ system in Paris. We find that every additional meter of walking to a station decreases a user’s likelihood of using a bike from that station by 0.194% (±0.0693%). and an even more significant reduction at higher distances (>300 m). These estimates imply that almost 80% of bike-share usage comes from areas within 300 m of stations. highlighting the need for dense station networks.

1275800,The risk-driven business model: Four questions that will define your company,2014,Karan Girotra and Serguei Netessine,,,,,Harvard Business Press,How to outsmart risk Risk has been defined as the potential for losing something of value. In business. that value could be your original investment or your expected future returns. The Risk-Driven Business Model will help you manage risk better by showing how the key choices you make in designing your business models either increase or reduce two characteristic types of risk--information risk. when you make decisions without enough information. and incentive-alignment risk. when decision makers' incentives are at odds with the broader goals of the company. Leaders who understand how the structure of their business model affects risk have the power to create wealth. revolutionize industries. and shape a better world. INSEAD's Karan Girotra and Serguei Netessine. noted operations and innovation professors who have consulted with dozens of companies. walk you through a business model audit to determine what key decisions get made in a business. when they get made. who makes them. and why we make the decisions we do. By changing your company's key decisions within this framework. you can fundamentally alter the risks that will impact your business. This book is for entrepreneurs and executives in companies involved in dynamic industries where the locus of risk is shifting. and includes lessons from Zipcar. Blockbuster. Apple. Benetton. Kickstarter. Walmart. and dozens of other global companies.

Operations management theory establishes that global sourcing requires more units of inventory. but since these units are often procured at a lower cost from global suppliers the capital invested in inventory and the consequent financial burden may increase or decrease with global sourcing. This study provides rigorous firm-level empirical evidence that links the global sourcing practices of public U.S. firms and their inventory investments. We process bill of lading manifests (customs forms) to extract information on over half a million sea shipments from global suppliers to U.S. public firms and link this information with quarterly financial data from the Compustat database.

We find that even in the absence of the well-known transactional and informational advantages of mediation. intermediaries improve supply chain performance. In particular. intermediaries facilitate responsive adaptation of the buyers' supplier base to their changing needs while simultaneously ensuring that suppliers behave as if they had long-term sourcing commitments from buying firms. In the face of changing buyer needs. an intermediary that sources on behalf of multiple buyers can responsively change the composition of future business committed to a supplier such that a sufficient level of business comes from the buyer(s) that most prefer this supplier.

Desired system inputs are altered so that the system completes the requested move without residual vibration. A short move time penalty is incurred (on the order of one period of the first mode of vibration). The preshaping technique is robust under system parameter uncertainty and may be applied to both open and closed loop systems.

The resulting shaped input is then used to drive the system. The impulse sequence has traditionally contained only positively valued impulses.

That is. any vibration caused by a portion of the command is canceled by a later portion of the command. A command with this special property is formed by convolving a sequence of impulses with the original. unmodified system command. Due to modeling errors and disturbances. the residual vibration will never be exactly zero on real systems. Robustness constraints must be enforced to ensure effective input shaping when the system frequencies are not known precisely or are expected to vary with time. Traditionally. the degree of robustness has not been specified. rather robustness was obtained by enforcing a reasonable robustness constraint.

Unlike less detailed representations. this model was able to replicate many of the features observed in actual harmonic-drive dynamic response.

We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier. N identical retailers. and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy. and the maximum difference is 12.1%.

A Wiley Company,We consider a common variant of the vehicle routing problem in which a vehicle fleet delivers products stored at a central depot to satisfy customer orders. Each vehicle has a fixed capacity. and each order uses a fixed portion of vehicle capacity. The routing decision involves determining which of the demands will be satisfied by each vehicle and what route each vehicle will follow in servicing its assigned demand in order to minimize total delivery cost. We present a heuristic for this problem in which an assignment of customers to vehicles is obtained by solving a generalized assignment problem with an objective function that approximates delivery cost. This heuristic has many attractive features. It has outperformed the best existing heuristics on a sample of standard test problems. It will always find a feasible solution if one exists. something no other existing heuristic can guarantee.

Under a Quick Response system. lead times are shortened sufficiently to allow a greater portion of production to be scheduled in response to initial demand. We model and analyze the decisions required under Quick Response and give a method for estimating the demand probability distributions needed in our model. We applied these procedures with a major fashion skiwear firm and found that cost relative to the current informal response system was reduced by enough to increase profits by 60%.

Harvard University,Thanks to global competition. faster product development. and increasingly flexible manufacturing systems. an unprecedented number and variety of products are competing in markets ranging from apparel and toys to power tools and computers. Despite the benefits to consumers. this phenomenon is making it more difficult for manufacturers and retailers to predict which of their goods will sell and to plan production and orders accordingly. As a result. inaccurate forecasts are increasing. and along with them the costs of those errors. Manufacturers and retailers alike are ending up with more unwanted goods that must be marked down–perhaps even sold at a loss–even as they lose potential sales because other articles are no longer in stock. In industries with highly volatile demand. like fashion apparel. the costs of such “stockouts” and markdowns can actually exceed the total cost of manufacturing. 1,True,oyJEvvYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1029,http://prof.usb.ve/nbaquero/03%20-%20Making%20Supply%20meet%20Demand%20-%20HBR.PDF,11943913073622590087,/scholar?cites=11943913073622590087,,,http://prof.usb.ve/nbaquero/03%20-%20Making%20Supply%20meet%20Demand%20-%20HBR.PDF,0,0,0

1275833,Ending inventory valuation in multiperiod production scheduling,2001,Marshall Fisher and Kamalini Ramdas and Yu-Sheng Zheng,47,Management Science,5,679-692,INFORMS,When making lot-sizing decisions. managers often use a model horizon T that is much smaller than any reasonable estimate of the firm's future horizon. This is done because forecast accuracy deteriorates rapidly for longer horizons. while computational burden increases. However. what is optimal over the short horizon may be suboptimal over the long run. resulting in errors known as end-effects. A common end-effect in lot-sizing models is to set end-of-horizon inventory to zero.

1275834,Does component sharing help or hurt reliability? An empirical study in the automotive industry,2008,Kamalini Ramdas and Taylor Randall,54,Management Science,5,922-938,INFORMS,Component sharing—the use of a component on multiple products within a firm's product line—is widely practiced as a means of offering high variety at low cost. Although many researchers have examined trade-offs involved in component sharing. little research has focused on the impact of component sharing on quality. In this paper. we examine how component sharing impacts one dimension of quality—reliability—defined as mean time to failure. Design considerations suggest that a component designed uniquely for a product will result in higher reliability due to the better fit of the component within the architecture of the product. On the other hand. the learning curve literature suggests that greater experience with a component can improve conformance quality. and can increase reliability via learning from end-user feedback. The engineering literature suggests that improved conformance in turn increases …,True,XKCvnmgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,78,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.1070.0791,2766712336528391018,/scholar?cites=2766712336528391018,,,,0,0,0

We examine how effectively three common practices—flexibility to swap aircraft. flexibility to reassign gates. and scheduled aircraft downtime—accomplish this goal. We first estimate a multiple-input. multiple-outcome production frontier. which defines the attainable set of outcomes from given inputs. We then recover unobserved input costs and calculate how expenditure on inputs affects outcomes and revenues. We find that the per-dollar return from expenditure on gates. or more effective management of existing gate capacity. is three times larger than the per-dollar returns from other inputs. Next. we use the estimated trade-offs faced by carriers along the frontier to measure the value to carriers of reducing delays.

In this article. we use design contests allowing repeated entry to examine the effect of in‐process feedback on idea generation. We report on a set of field experiments using two online contest websites to compare the performance of three different feedback treatments—no feedback. random feedback. and directed feedback (i.e.. in‐process feedback highly correlated with the final quality rating of the entry).

1275838,The impact of visibility in innovation tournaments: Evidence from field experiments,2015,Joel O Wooten and Karl T Ulrich,,Available at SSRN 2214952,,,,Contests have a long history of driving innovation. and web-based information technology has opened up new possibilities for managing tournaments. One such possibility is the visibility of entries–some web-based platforms now allow participants to observe others’ submissions while the contest is live. Seeing other entries could broaden or limit idea exploration. redirect or anchor searches. or inspire or stifle creativity. Using a unique data set from a series of field experiments. we examine whether entry visibility helps or hurts innovation contest outcomes and (in the process) also address the common problem of how to deal with opt-in participation. Our eight contests resulted in 665 contest entries for which we have 11.380 quality ratings. Based on analysis of this data set and additional observational data. we provide evidence that entry visibility influences the outcome of tournaments via two pathways:(1) changing the likelihood of entry from an agent and (2) shifting the quality characteristics of entries. For the first. we show that entry visibility generates more entries by increasing the number of participants. For the second. we find the effect of entry visibility depends on the setting. Seeing other entries results in more similar submissions early in a contest. For single-entry participants. entry quality “ratchets up” with the best entry previously submitted by other contestants if that entry is visible. while moving in the opposite direction if it’s not. However. for participants who submit more than once. those with better prior submissions improve more when they cannot see the work of others. The variance in quality of entries also increases when entries are …,True,GMGQBosAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,40,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2214952,16041451866421070448,/scholar?cites=16041451866421070448,,,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&context=mgmt_papers,0,0,0

We discuss how these behavioral tendencies have been studied and how they have been shown to influence decision‐making throughout the processes of creativity. design. innovation. and. by implication. the performance in new product development and projects.

1275843,Leaps in innovation: the Bolt versus Bannister effect in algorithmic tournaments,2018,Joel O Wooten,,Available at SSRN 2376350,,,,This paper explores whether innovation breakthroughs stimulate or impede future progress in individual innovation. On the one hand. one could argue that substantial improvements to the status quo might inspire advances through competition. On the other hand. one could claim such improvements might have the opposite effect. stifling motivation or creativity in rivals. Using a unique data set of predictive modeling contests from Kaggle we analyze 25.898 distinct attempts at innovation. We address two related questions to frame our central theme:(1) What effect do discontinuous leaps (as opposed to incremental steps) in innovation contests have on future progress?(2) What predicts such discontinuous leaps in innovation contests? The answers to these questions are as follows. Behavior after discontinuous leaps differs from behavior after continuous steps in innovation tournaments. We find that leaps result in increased rates of entry submission early in contests and improved scores going forward. For the second question. the characteristics that predict leaps turn out to be somewhat different than those that predict steps. Leaps are more likely with lower prior scores. while incremental steps are more likely with bigger teams and bigger prizes.

Stripped to its essence. an innovation tournament is a process that uncovers exceptionally good opportunities by considering many raw opportunities at the outset and selecting the best to survive. Both the host of the tournament (the administrator) and the participants (the agents) face many decisions throughout this process. In the following papers. we answer a series of questions about innovation tournaments. addressing the specific managerial challenges of how to provide in-process feedback. how to moderate entry visibility. and how to understand and affect leaps in innovation.

Such asymmetric setups. although generally believed to be more realistic. are also more complex. We investigate one such setting where one bidder has a cost advantage. Our central question is whether bidders who are cost disadvantaged can overcome their inferior cost position. In a design that mirrors real construction procurement auctions. our laboratory experiment tests whether two information asymmetries (more precise cost estimates and knowledge about the cost estimating abilities of a competitor) allow cost‐disadvantaged sellers to better compete.

Research has shown there is an economic benefit of such policies thanks to lower costs for procurement auction buyers as incentives are offered to disadvantaged sellers. In this paper. we study one type of preferential procurement auction: the subsidy. Rothkopf et al.(2003) present a model for this type of preferential auction and derive the optimal subsidy levels. bidder strategies. and buyer procurement costs for various levels of cost disadvantage. To date. no research has tested those theoretical predictions. Using a set of controlled experiments. we compare actual bidder behavior to what is predicted in equilibrium. We find that sellers suffer from overly aggressive bidding (but do learn over time). More importantly. we explore the behaviors that may explain any deviations from theory–focusing on best response bidding and what directional learning theory would predict based on prior round outcomes. One intriguing take-away is that cost-advantaged bidders may be more responsive to opponents’ bids.

1275852,On the Design of Compliant Mechanisms Using Topology Optimization*,1997,Ole Sigmund,25,Journal of Structural Mechanics,4,493-524,Taylor & Francis Group,This paper presents a method for optimal design of compliant mechanism topologies. The method is based on continuum-type topology optimization techniques and finds the optimal compliant mechanism topology within a given design domain and a given position and direction of input and output forces.

1275854,Morphology-based black and white filters for topology optimization,2007,Ole Sigmund,33,Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization,4-5,401-424,Springer-Verlag,To ensure manufacturability and mesh independence in density-based topology optimization schemes. it is imperative to use restriction methods. This paper introduces a new class of morphology-based restriction schemes that work as density filters; that is. the physical stiffness of an element is based on a function of the design variables of the neighboring elements. The new filters have the advantage that they eliminate grey scale transitions between solid and void regions. Using different test examples. it is shown that the schemes. in general. provide black and white designs with minimum length-scale constraints on either or both minimum hole sizes and minimum structural feature sizes.

The composites are made of two different material phases and a void phase. The topology optimization method consists in finding the distribution of material phases that optimizes an objective function (e.g. thermoelastic properties) subject to certain constraints. such as elastic symmetry or volume fractions of the constituent phases. within a periodic base cell. The effective properties of the material structures are found using the numerical homogenization method based on a finite-element discretization of the base cell. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming.To benchmark the design method we first consider two-phase designs.

The construction problem can be called an inverse problem of finding a material with given homogenized coefficients. The inverse problem is formulated as a topology optimization problem i.e. finding the interior topology of a base cell such that cost is minimized and the constraints are defined by the prescribed constitutive parameters. Numerical values of the constitutive parameters of a given material are found using a numerical homogenization method expressed in terms of element mutual energies. Numerical results show that arbitrary materials. including materials with Poisson's ratio −1.0 and other extreme materials. can be obtained by modelling the base cell as a truss structure.

It has been developed using the 99 line code presented by Sigmund (Struct Multidisc Optim 21(2):120–127. 2001) as a starting point. The original code has been extended by a density filter. and a considerable improvement in efficiency has been achieved. mainly by preallocating arrays and vectorizing loops. A speed improvement with a factor of 100 is obtained for a benchmark example with 7.500 elements. Moreover. the length of the code has been reduced to a mere 88 lines. These improvements have been accomplished without sacrificing the readability of the code. The 88 line code can therefore be considered as a valuable successor to the 99 line code. providing a practical instrument that may help to ease the learning curve for those entering the field of topology optimization.

An upper-bound constraint on the perimeter of the solid part of the structure ensures a well-posed design problem. The perimeter constraint allows the designer to control the number of holes in the optimal design and to establish their characteristic length scale. Finite element implementations generate practical designs that are convergent with respect to grid refinement. Thus. an arbitrary level of geometric resolution can be achieved. so single-step procedures for topology design and detailed shape design are possible. The perimeter method eliminates the need for relaxation. thereby circumventing many of the complexities and restrictions of other approaches to topology design.,True,07sbkLsAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C,621,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01279647,17904028414556012148,/scholar?cites=17904028414556012148,,,,0,0,0

We show that the cause of this problem is numerical rather than physical in nature. We consider a two-field. distributed-parameter optimization problem involving a design field and a response field. and show that the optimization problem corresponds to a mixed variational problem. An improper selection of the discrete function spaces for these two fields leads to grid-scale anomalies in the numerical solutions to optimization problems. similar to those that are sometimes encountered in mixed formulations of the Stokes problem.

Specifically. we determine optimal layouts of channel flows that extremize a cost function which measures either some local aspect of the velocity field or a global quantity. such as the rate of energy dissipation.

Ltd,An extension of recent work1 on the simultaneous optimization of material and structure to address the design of structures under multiple loading conditions is presented. Material properties are represented in the most general form possible. namely. as elements of the unrestricted set of positive‐semi‐definite constitutive tensors of a linearly elastic continuum. Existence of solutions can be shown when the objective is a weighted average of compliances and a resource constraint measured as the 2‐norm or the trace of the constitutive tensors is included. The optimized material properties can be derived analytically. The optimization of the layout of the material leads to a sizing problem of structural optimization involving a non‐linear. non‐smooth elasticity analysis.

The methodology uses complementary split-ring resonators placed horizontally between the patch and the ground plane. By optimizing the geometry of the split rings. sub-wavelength resonance of the patch antenna can be achieved with a good impedance match and radiation characteristics comparable to those of a traditional patch antenna on a finite ground plane. Construction of the optimized antenna is straightforward. requiring only the sandwiching of two etched circuit boards. High levels of miniaturization are demonstrated through simulations and experiments. with reductions of a factor of more than four in transverse dimension achieved for a circular patch resonant at 2.45 GHz.

The formulation is based on the design of a thin layer of copper printed on a dielectric. rectangular plate of fixed dimensions. An effective media theory is used to estimate the effective permeability. obtained after solving Maxwell’s equations on a representative cell of a periodic arrangement using a full 3D finite element model. The effective permeability depends on the layout of copper. and the subject of the topology optimization problem is to find layouts that result in negative (real) permeability at a prescribed frequency.

Physical insight is presented into the optimal choice of locations where masses should be added and the results of several numerical examples are provided to highlight this and other features of how band-gaps can be created and located at desired frequency ranges.

The design variables are the cross-sections of the truss bars together with the joint coordinates. and are considered to be continuous variables. Using these design variables we simultaneously carry out size optimization (areas) and shape optimization (joint positions). Topology optimization (removal and introduction of bars) is only considered in the sense that bars of minimum cross-sectional area will have a negligible influence on the performance of the structure. The structures are subjected to multiple load cases and the objective of the optimizations is minimum mass with constraints on (possibly multiple) eigenfrequencies. displacements. and stresses.

Bending and transverse shear stiffness properties of plates with an arbitrary but finite number of local rib directions and widths are computed using standard homogenization techniques. These properties are then expressed in terms of only four variables that fully describe the anisotropy of the plate. The optimization problem is solved in two stages consisting of a local. four-dimensional maximization problem. where a given amount of material is optimally allocated into an arbitrary number of fine scale stiffeners of different widths and orientations. and a global one-dimensional optimization problem. where the optimum spatial layout of material is determined.

After giving a brief theory of the homogenization method. a finite element approximation is introduced with convergence study and corresponding error estimate. Applying these. computer programs PREMAT and POSTMAT are developed for preprocessing and postprocessing of material characterization of composite materials. Using these programs. the homogenized elastic constants for macroscopic stress analysis are obtained for typical composite materials to show their capability. Finally. the adaptive finite element method is introduced to improve the accuracy of the finite element approximation.,True,AKrKVMEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1576,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004578259090148F,795871091594667359,/scholar?cites=795871091594667359,,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/28363/0000128.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

Material properties are represented in the most general form possible for a (locally) linear elastic continuum. namely the unrestricted set of elements of positive semi-definite constitutive tensors and cost measures based on certain invariants of the tensors. Analytical forms are derived for the optimized material properties. These results. which apply in general. indicate that the optimized material is orthotropic with the directions of orthotropy following the directions of principal strains. The analysis for optimization of the material leads to a reduced structural optimization problem. for which the existence of solutions can be shown and for which effective methods for computational solution can be devised.,True,AKrKVMEAAAAJ:TeJ9juy8vcMC,292,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/appliedmechanics/article-abstract/61/4/930/396149,3281412861149696342,/scholar?cites=3281412861149696342,,,,0,0,0

The bone scaffold should have a set of properties to provide mechanical support and simultaneously promote tissue regeneration. Among these properties. scaffold permeability is a determinant factor as it plays a major role in the ability for cells to penetrate the porous media and for nutrients to diffuse. Thus. the aim of this work is to characterize the permeability of the scaffold microstructure. using both computational and experimental methods.

The model uses a material distribution approach and the optimization criterion is the structural compliance. subjected to an isoperimetric constraint on volume. Usually the obtained topologies using this approach do not characterize a well-defined structure. i.e. it has regions with porous material and/or with checkerboard patterns. To overcome these problems an additional constraint on perimeter and a penalty on intermediate volume fraction are considered.

The model uses a material distribution approach and the optimization criterion is the structural compliance. subjected to an isoperimetric constraint on volume. Usually the obtained topologies using this approach do not characterize a well-defined structure. i.e. it has regions with porous material and/or with checkerboard patterns. To overcome these problems an additional constraint on perimeter and a penalty on intermediate volume fraction are considered. The necessary conditions for optimum are derived analytically. approximated numerically through a suitable finite element discretization and solved by a first-order method based on the optimization problem augmented Lagrangian. The computational model is tested in several numerical applications.,True,tVhoXsYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,78,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045794998003125,6210045195120659970,/scholar?cites=6210045195120659970,,,,0,0,0

1275913,Shape optimal structural design using boundary elements and minimum compliance techniques,1984,CA Mota Soares and HC Rodrigues and KK Choi,106,,4,518-523,,Shape optimal design of two-dimensional elastic components is formulated using boundary elements. The design objective is to minimize compliance of the structure. subject to an area constraint. All degrees of freedom of the model are at the boundary and there is no need for calculating displacements and stresses in the domain. Formulations based on linear and quadratic boundary elements are developed. The corresponding nonlinear programing problem is solved by Pshenichny’s linearization method. The model is applied to shape optimal design of several elastic structural components. The advantages and disadvantages of the boundary element method over the finite element technique for shape optimal design of structures are discussed. with reference to applications.,True,tVhoXsYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,76,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-abstract/106/4/518/433973,2326886218714463326,/scholar?cites=2326886218714463326,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kyung_Choi2/publication/245514368_Shape_Optimal_Structural_Design_Using_Boundary_Elements_and_Minimum_Compliance_Techniques/links/5ff20af4299bf140886b49c5/Shape-Optimal-Structural-Design-Using-Boundary-Elements-and-Minimum-Compliance-Techniques.pdf,0,0,0

1275914,Robust optimization,2009,Aharon Ben-Tal and Laurent El Ghaoui and Arkadi Nemirovski,,,,,Princeton university press,Robust optimization is still a relatively new approach to optimization problems affected by uncertainty. but it has already proved so useful in real applications that it is difficult to tackle such problems today without considering this powerful methodology. Written by the principal developers of robust optimization. and describing the main achievements of a decade of research. this is the first book to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date account of the subject. Robust optimization is designed to meet some major challenges associated with uncertainty-affected optimization problems: to operate under lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty; to model the problem in a form that can be solved efficiently; and to provide guarantees about the performance of the solution. The book starts with a relatively simple treatment of uncertain linear programming. proceeding with a deep analysis of the interconnections between the construction of appropriate uncertainty sets and the classical chance constraints (probabilistic) approach. It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems. The theory is supported by numerous examples and computational illustrations. An essential book for anyone working on optimization and decision making under uncertainty. Robust Optimization also makes an ideal graduate textbook on the subject.,True,5exbYaoAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC,4037,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DttjR7IpjUEC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:5ibjPZoZkrkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=W738oENjQ-&sig=0KkbnsdOKnhd6BWPyqTSO83-cco,13371778393870378726,/scholar?cites=13371778393870378726,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.587.8223&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The ensuing optimization problem is called robust optimization. In this paper we lay the foundation of robust convex optimization. In the main part of the paper we show that if U is an ellipsoidal uncertainty set. then for some of the most important generic convex optimization problems (linear programming. quadratically constrained programming. semidefinite programming and others) the corresponding robust convex program is either exactly. or approximately. a tractable problem which lends itself to efficient algorithms such as polynomial time interior point methods.,True,5exbYaoAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC,2825,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.23.4.769,13761534743442098044,/scholar?cites=13761534743442098044,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.298.9312&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The focus is on uncertainty associated with hard constraints: those which must be satisfied. whatever is the actual realization of the data (within a prescribed uncertainty set). We suggest a modeling methodology whereas an uncertain LP is replaced by its robust counterpart (RC).

We extend the Robust Optimization methodology ([1. 3-6. 9. 13. 14]) to this situation by introducing the Adjustable Robust Counterpart (ARC) associated with an LP of the above structure. Often the ARC is significantly less conservative than the usual Robust Counterpart (RC). however. in most cases the ARC is computationally intractable (NP-hard).

Three-dimensional nonlinear analysis was performed for repair failure prediction and good baseline comparison for open hole scarfed panels and panels repaired by using standard ply-by-ply replacement patch composition was achieved.

Bending and transverse shear stiffness properties of plates with an arbitrary but finite number of local rib directions and widths are computed using standard homogenization techniques. These properties are then expressed in terms of only four variables that fully describe the anisotropy of the plate. The optimization problem is solved in two stages consisting of a local. four-dimensional maximization problem. where a given amount of material is optimally allocated into an arbitrary number of fine scale stiffeners of different widths and orientations. and a global one-dimensional optimization problem. where the optimum spatial layout of material is determined.

1275932,Multiscale dynamics of heterogeneous media in the peridynamic formulation,2012,Bacim Alali and Robert Lipton,106,Journal of Elasticity,1,71-103,Springer Netherlands,A methodology is presented for investigating the dynamics of heterogeneous media using the nonlocal continuum model given by the peridynamic formulation. The approach presented here provides the ability to model the macroscopic dynamics while at the same time resolving the dynamics at the length scales of the microstructure. Central to the methodology is a novel two-scale evolution equation. The rescaled solution of this equation is shown to provide a strong approximation to the actual deformation inside the peridynamic material. The two scale evolution can be split into a microscopic component tracking the dynamics at the length scale of the heterogeneities and a macroscopic component tracking the volume averaged (homogenized) dynamics. The interplay between the microscopic and macroscopic dynamics is given by a coupled system of evolution equations. The equations show that the …,True,KLgjch8AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,92,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10659-010-9291-4.pdf,337195316264784999,/scholar?cites=337195316264784999,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.4621,0,0,0

We provide a link between peridynamic evolution and brittle fracture evolution for a broad class of peridynamic potentials associated with unstable peridynamic constitutive laws. Distinguished limits of peridynamic evolutions are identified that correspond to vanishing peridynamic horizon. The limit evolution has both bounded linear elastic energy and Griffith surface energy. The limit evolution corresponds to the simultaneous evolution of elastic displacement and fracture. For points in spacetime not on the crack set the displacement field evolves according to the linear elastic wave equation.

Ltd.,A method is developed to systematically remove and reintroduce low density elements from and into the finite element mesh on which the structural topology optimization problem is defined. The material density field which defines the topology and the local ‘stiffness’ of the structure is optimally distributed via non‐linear programming techniques. To prevent elements from having zero stiffness. an arbitrarily small lower bound on the material density is typically imposed to ensure that the global stiffness matrix does not become singular. While this approach works well for most minimum compliance problems. the presence of low density elements can cause computational problems. particularly in structures that exhibit geometric non‐linearities. e.g. in compliant mechanisms.

Moreover. the projection supports the reintroduction of solid material in void regions. a critical requirement for robust topology optimization.

Ltd.,We present a new method for shape optimization that uses an analytical description of the varying design geometry as the control in the optimization problem. A straightforward filtering technique projects the design geometry onto a fictitious analysis domain to support simplified response and sensitivity analysis. However. the analytical geometry model is referenced directly for all purely geometric calculations. The method thus combines the advantages of direct geometry representations with the simplified analysis procedures that are possible with fictitious domain analysis methods. such as the material distribution methods commonly used in topology optimization. The projected geometry measure converges to the indicator function of the analytical geometry model in the limit of numerical mesh refinement. Consequently. optimal designs obtained with the new method converge to solutions of well‐defined …,True,V0EWu8kAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,123,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.1044,7887438569362374054,/scholar?cites=7887438569362374054,,,,0,0,0

The method solves a sub-optimization problem every iteration to obtain optimal boundary velocities. A p-norm stress functional is used to aggregate stresses in a single constraint. The shape sensitivity function is derived and a computational procedure based on a least squares interpolation approach is devised in order to compute sensitivities at the boundaries. Adaptive constraint scaling is used to enforce exact control of stress limits. Numerical results show that the method is able to solve the problem efficiently for single and multiple load cases obtaining solutions with smooth boundaries.,True,V0EWu8kAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C,102,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782517304395,8521784157677852212,/scholar?cites=8521784157677852212,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782517304395,0,0,0

Both component reliability and system reliability are considered. In component reliability. we satisfy numerous probabilistic constraints which quantify the failure of different events. In system reliability. we satisfy a single probabilistic constraint which encompasses the component events. We adopt the first-order reliability method to approximate the component reliabilities and the inclusion-exclusion rule to approximate the system reliability.

This was achieved by introducing a unique node design for connecting planar materials to enable constructing a three-dimensional architecture. This node design is based on linking the circular elements of the anti-chiral topology using oblique load-bearing ligaments. As the planar structure is subjected to loading. the circular elements rotate and the ligaments undergo bending. resulting in out-of-plane deformation of the three-dimensional cellular metamaterials. The node design. and specifically the ligaments' revolution angle govern the behavior of cellular metamaterials.

Ltd.,The problem of determining highly localized buckling modes in perfectly periodic cellular microstructures of infinite extent is addressed. A double scale asymptotic technique is applied to the linearized stability problem for a periodic structure built from linearly elastic microstructures. The obtained stability condition for the microscale level is then used to establish a comparative analysis between different material distributions in the base cell subjected to the same strain field at the macroscale level. The idea is illustrated by some two‐dimensional finite element examples and used to design materials with optimal elastic properties that are less prone to localized instability in the form of local buckling modes at the scale of the microstructure.

The objective and novelty are to use the force transmissibility to calculate reactions given the applied loads (and vice versa). This method. relating two sets of forces. proves to be an alternative to the common inverse problem based on the measurement of FRFs and operational accelerations to determine operational forces. as it can be advantageous in some cases. This implies the a priori knowledge of the transmissibility of the structure. either experimentally or numerically. In this study a finite element model is built. describing with enough accuracy the dynamic behavior of the structure. The numerical model will play a key role in the construction of the transmissibility matrix; this will be used to evaluate either the reaction or the applied forces. using experimental data. This constitutes a hybrid methodology. which is validated experimentally. The authors present several comparisons between reconstructed and experimentally measured sets of forces.

In addition to the musculoskeletal system. a model can comprise external objects. loads. and motion specifications. thereby providing a complete set of the boundary conditions for a given task.

1275970,Muscle recruitment by the min/max criterion—a comparative numerical study,2001,John Rasmussen and Michael Damsgaard and Michael Voigt,34,Journal of biomechanics,3,409-415,Elsevier,This paper introduces the min/max criterion for simulation of muscle recruitment in multiple muscle systems. The criterion is introduced and justified by comparison to two known criterion types: the polynomial criterion and the soft saturation criterion. The comparison is performed on a planar three-muscle elbow model performing a dumbbell curl. A generalized form of the soft saturation criterion is introduced. and it is shown that the min/max criterion can be interpreted as the limit of the classical criteria when the exponents in their mathematical expressions approach infinity. We finally show how the min/max criterion can be cast into a form that allows for efficient and robust numerical solution by linear programming. It is concluded that the min/max criterion possesses a number of attractive physiological as well as algorithmic advantages.,True,BXNEOscAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,479,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021929000001913,13692955565209881888,/scholar?cites=13692955565209881888,,,,0,0,0

The constraint equations that were considered for the knee were spherical and revolute joints. which have been frequently used in musculoskeletal modelling. In the models. the joint centres and joint axes of rotations were optimised from the skin marker trajectories over the trial. It was found that the introduction of kinematic constraints did not reduce the error associated with soft tissue artefacts.

We define two global stress constraints based on the p-norm and p-mean of the e-relaxed overall stress criteria in the finite elements.

It is based on approximations of the MMA family (MMA and GCMMA). but it utilizes the gradients and/or the function values at two successive design points to improve the quality of the approximation. In addition. this scheme can consider simultaneously monotonous and nonmonotonous structural behaviour. According to the characteristics of the treated problem. one of the approximations or a mix of them is automatically selected. Based on this approach. the accuracy of the approximated subproblems is improved and the solution process can be sped up.

Surprisingly the solution of such problems cannot be based on a direct extension of the solution procedure used for minimum-compliance topology optimization with fixed external loads. At first the particular difficulties arising in the considered topology problems are pointed out: non-monotonous behaviour of the compliance. possible unconstrained character of the optimum and the parasitic effect for low densities when using the power model (SIMP). To get rid of the last problem requires the modification of the power law model for low densities.

The method benefits from the fixed mesh work using X-FEM and from the curves smoothness of the level set description. Design variables are shape parameters of basic geometric features that are described with a level set representation. The number of design variables of this formulation remains small. whereas global (i.e. compliance) and local constraints (i.e. stresses) can be considered. To illustrate the capability of the method to handle stress constraints. numerical applications revisit the minimization of stress concentration in a 2D filet in tension. which has been previously studied in Pedersen (2003).

Ltd,The discrete optimal orientation design of the composite laminate can be treated as a material selection problem dealt with by using the concept of continuous topology optimization method. In this work. a new bi‐value coding parameterization (BCP) scheme of closed form is proposed to this aim. The basic idea of the BCP scheme is to ‘code’ each material phase using integer values of +1 and –1 so that each available material phase has one unique ‘code’ consisting of +1 and/or –1 assigned to design variables. Theoretical and numerical comparisons between the proposed BCP scheme and existing schemes show that the BCP has the advantage of an evident reduction of the number of design variables in logarithmic form.

1275987,The global modal parameterization for non‐linear model‐order reduction in flexible multibody dynamics,2007,Olivier Brüls and Pierre Duysinx and Jean‐Claude Golinval,69,International journal for numerical methods in engineering,5,948-977,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,In flexible multibody dynamics. advanced modelling methods lead to high‐order non‐linear differential‐algebraic equations (DAEs). The development of model reduction techniques is motivated by control design problems. for which compact ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in closed‐form are desirable. In a linear framework. reduction techniques classically rely on a projection of the dynamics onto a linear subspace. In flexible multibody dynamics. we propose to project the dynamics onto a submanifold of the configuration space. which allows to eliminate the non‐linear holonomic constraints and to preserve the Lagrangian structure. The construction of this submanifold follows from the definition of a global modal parameterization (GMP): the motion of the assembled mechanism is described in terms of rigid and flexible modes. which are configuration‐dependent.

1275988,Dual approach using a variant perimeter constraint and efficient sub-iteration scheme for topology optimization,2003,WH Zhang and Pierre Duysinx,81,Computers & structures,22-23,2173-2181,Pergamon,To prevent numerical instabilities associated with the mesh-dependence. checkerboards and grey regions in topology optimization. a variant perimeter-constrained version of the SIMP algorithm is proposed using a smooth and quadratic function. In order to have an efficient implementation and to make sure the strict satisfaction of such an upper-bound perimeter constraint. a diagonal quadratic approximation of the perimeter constraint is used in the construction of each explicit optimization subproblem. The latter is then solved by a dual sub-iteration scheme. Numerical results show that the incorporation of such a sub-iteration scheme leads to a convergent solution without needs of move-limits or artificial control parameters. In addition to this. it is found that successive relaxations of the perimeter constraint by increasing the upper-bound tend to regularize the topology solution and result in a checkerboard free and …,True,ffJDhi8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045794903002943,8201466852336677667,/scholar?cites=8201466852336677667,,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/18131/2/Perimeter.pdf,0,0,0

Dordrecht,This paper presents an intermediate approach between parametric shape optimization and topology optimization. It is based on using the recent Level Set description of the geometry and the novel eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The method takes benefit of the fixed mesh work using X-FEM and of the curves smoothness of the Level Set description. Design variables are shape parameters of basic geometric features. The number of design variables of this formulation is small whereas various global and local constraints can be considered. The Level Set description allows to modify the connectivity of the structure as geometric features can merge or separate from each other. However no new entity can be introduced. A central problem that is investigated here is the sensitivity analysis and the way it can be carried out efficiently.

Revisiting some of their last developments in this field. the authors point out the importance of considering stress constraints as soon as the preliminary design phase. that is. to include stress constraints in the topology optimization problem in order to get the most appropriate structural layout. Numerical applications that can be solved using these new developments make possible to exhibit interesting results related to the specific nature of strength based structural layout for maximum strength compared to maximum stiffness.

The material flow and heat generation are characterized by the contact conditions at the interface. and are described as sliding. sticking or partial sliding/sticking. Different mechanisms of heat generation are behind each contact condition. making this study important for further understanding of the real FSW process. The analytical expression for the heat generation is a modification of previous analytical models known from the literature and accounts for both conical surfaces and different contact conditions. Experimental results on plunge force and torque are used to determine the contact condition. The sliding condition yields a proportional relationship between the plunge force and heat generation …,True,udxLHZEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,810,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0965-0393/12/1/013/meta,11630110860558088260,/scholar?cites=11630110860558088260,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/JH_Hattel/publication/231054655_An_analytical_model_for_the_heat_generation_in_friction_stir_welding/links/0046351e57c6eb9b53000000/An-analytical-model-for-the-heat-generation-in-friction-stir-welding.pdf,0,0,0

However. it is known that only under specific thermomechanical conditions does a weld formation occur. If these conditions are not present. void formation will occur leading to a faulty weld.

In the present work. the material flow is investigated by traditional metallography as well as X-ray and computer tomography (CT).

The two- and three-dimensional CT images are used in parallel with micrographs for visualization of the flow field. Two procedures for estimating the average velocities for material flowing through the shear layer are presented.

The heat flow close to the probe/matrix interface is investigated. In the models presented. the heat is forced to flow around the 'probe hole'. In this manner. the material flow through the probe region. which often characterises other thermal models of FSW. is avoided. This necessitates controlling the convective heat flow by prescribing the velocity field in the narrow shear layer at the tool/matrix interface.

Ltd.,In this paper. we propose a level set‐based topology optimization method targeting metallic waveguide design problems. where the skin effect must be taken into account since the metallic waveguides are generally used in the high‐frequency range where this effect critically affects performance. One of the most reasonable approaches to represent the skin effect is to impose an electric field constraint condition on the surface of the metal. To implement this approach. we develop a boundary‐tracking scheme for the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) mesh pertaining to the zero iso‐contour of the level set function that is given in an Eulerian mesh. and impose Dirichlet boundary conditions at the nodes on the zero iso‐contour in the ALE mesh to compute the electric field. Since the ALE mesh accurately tracks the zero iso‐contour at every optimization iteration. the electric field is always appropriately computed …,True,M9IOdeAAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,86,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.3135,12301369581624935263,/scholar?cites=12301369581624935263,,,,0,0,0

In this work. the Cartesian components of the orientation vector are utilized as the orientation design variables. The proposed method supports continuous orientation design. which is out of the scope of discrete material optimization approaches. as well as design using discrete angle sets. The advantage of this approach is that vector element representation is less likely to fail into local optima because it depends less on designs of former steps. especially compared with using the angle as a design variable (Continuous Fiber Angle Optimization) by providing a flexible path from one angle to another with relaxation of orientation design space. An additional advantage is that it is compatible …,True,M9IOdeAAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,73,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.4799,10602467978975920427,/scholar?cites=10602467978975920427,,,,0,0,0

One of the motivating factors was the concept of the Stackelberg solution in game theory. together with its economic applications. Other problems have been encountered in the seventies in natural sciences and engineering. Many of them are of practical importance and have been extensively studied. mainly from the theoretical point of view. Later. applications to mechanics and network design have lead to an extension of the problem formulation: Constraints in form of variation al inequalities and complementarity problems were also admitted. The term"" generalized bi level programming problems"" was used at first but later. probably in Harker and Pang. 1988. a different terminology was introduced: Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints. or simply. MPECs. In this book we adhere to MPEC terminology. A large number of papers deals with MPECs but. to our knowledge. there is only one monograph (Luo et al.. 1997). This monograph concentrates on optimality conditions and numerical methods.

Ltd.,In this article a novel method for structural optimization of laminated composite shell structures such as wind turbine blades is presented. The outer shape of a wind turbine blade is typically determined by aerodynamic considerations and therefore not subject to change. Furthermore. the thicknesses of the shell structures are also considered fixed. The design objective is chosen to be a global quantity such as maximum stiffness or lowest eigenfrequency with a constraint on the total mass. such that the cost of material can be considered. The design optimization method is based on ideas from multiphase topology optimization where the material stiffness (or density) is computed as a weighted sum of candidate materials. and the method is easy to implement in existing finite element codes.

The work is concerned with the actual testing and the adoption of a phenomenological approach. and a discussion is conducted to assess and evaluate the wind turbine blade response during loading and after collapse by correlating experimental findings with numerical model predictions.

The vibration of the laminated plate is excited by time-harmonic external mechanical loading with prescribed frequency and amplitude. and the design objective is to minimize the total sound power radiated from the surface of the laminated plate to the surrounding acoustic medium. Instead of solving the Helmholtz equation for evaluation of the sound power. advantage is taken of the fact that the surface of the laminated plate is flat. which implies that Rayleigh’s integral approximation can be used to evaluate the sound power radiated from the surface of the plate.

Computing time associated with solving the nested analysis problem is reduced significantly in comparison to other existing approaches. The cost reduction is obtained by exploiting specific characteristics of a multigrid preconditioned conjugate gradients (MGCG) solver. In particular. the number of MGCG iterations is reduced by relating it to the geometric parameters of the problem. At the same time. accurate outcome of the optimization process is ensured by linking the required accuracy of the design sensitivities to the progress of optimization.

Ltd,Design of reinforced concrete structures is governed by the nonlinear behavior of concrete and by its different strengths in tension and compression. The purpose of this article is to present a computational procedure for optimal conceptual design of reinforced concrete structures on the basis of topology optimization with elastoplastic material modeling. Concrete and steel are both considered as elastoplastic materials. including the appropriate yield criteria and post‐yielding response. The same approach can be applied also for topology optimization of other material compositions where nonlinear response must be considered. Optimized distribution of materials is achieved by introducing interpolation rules for both elastic and plastic material properties.

In this study. the integration of an approximate reanalysis procedure into the framework of topology optimization of continuum structures is investigated. The nested optimization problem is reformulated to accommodate the use of an approximate displacement vector and the design sensitivities are derived accordingly. It is shown that relatively rough approximations are acceptable since the errors are taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.

Robust formulations of the optimization problem were shown to yield optimized designs that are tolerant with respect to such manufacturing uncertainties. The main drawback of such procedures is the added computational cost associated with the need to evaluate a set of designs by performing multiple finite element analyses. In this article. we propose efficient robust topology optimization procedures based on reanalysis techniques. The approach is demonstrated on two compliant mechanism design problems where robust design is achieved by employing either a worst case formulation or a stochastic formulation. It is shown that the time spent on finite element analysis …,True,kC34CxQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,52,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782512002289,798029046303819645,/scholar?cites=798029046303819645,,,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/225975,0,0,0

1276044,Topology optimization for additive manufacturing: Accounting for overhang limitations using a virtual skeleton,2017,Yoram Mass and Oded Amir,18,Additive Manufacturing,,58-73,Elsevier,This article proposes a new method for reducing the amount of support material required for 3-D printing of complex designs generated by topology optimization. This procedure relies on solving sequentially two structural optimization problems – the first on a discrete truss-based model and the second on a continuum-based model. In the optimization of the discrete model. the maximum overhang limitation is imposed based on geometrical parameters. The optimized discrete pattern is then projected on to the continuum so that it influences the material distribution in the continuum optimization. The method is explained and investigated on a set of test cases in 2-D and subsequently demonstrated on examples in 3-D. Numerical results indicate that the designs obtained by this approach exhibit improved printability as they have fewer overhanging features. In some cases. practically no supporting material will be …,True,kC34CxQAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214860417301045,865582855168401824,/scholar?cites=865582855168401824,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Oded_Amir/publication/319709455_Topology_optimization_for_additive_manufacturing_Accounting_for_overhang_limitations_using_a_virtual_skeleton/links/59c3f5ca45851590b13c924e/Topology-optimization-for-additive-manufacturing-Accounting-for-overhang-limitations-using-a-virtual-skeleton.pdf,0,0,0

We bring together two emerging technologies that show great potential for realizing highly-efficient concrete structures: topology optimization for simulation-driven design and 3D concrete printing (3DCP) for manufacturing of optimized shapes. While this is not the first-ever 3D-printed concrete structure. it is the first demonstration of how topological design in combination with 3D concrete extrusion printing allows for creating efficient structures with reduced use of materials. As the implementation of a specific optimization procedure for post-tensioned concrete structures is so far available in 2D only. some design post-processing was necessary. and a 3D finite element analysis was performed.

Series A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences",1806,1001-1019,The Royal Society,Phononic band–gap materials prevent elastic waves in certain frequency ranges from propagating. and they may therefore be used to generate frequency filters. as beam splitters. as sound or vibration protection devices. or as waveguides. In this work we show how topology optimization can be used to design and optimize periodic materials and structures exhibiting phononic band gaps. Firstly. we optimize infinitely periodic band–gap materials by maximizing the relative size of the band gaps. Then. finite structures subjected to periodic loading are optimized in order to either minimize the structural response along boundaries (wave damping) or maximize the response at certain boundary locations (waveguiding).,True,eSq9TLEAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,648,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2003.1177,8700064902829494446,/scholar?cites=8700064902829494446,,,,0,0,0

Special attention is devoted to the response in frequency ranges with gaps in the band structure for the corresponding infinite periodic lattice. The effects of boundaries. viscous damping. and imperfections are studied by analyzing two examples; a 1-D filter and a 2-D wave guide. In 1-D the structural response in the band gap is shown to be insensitive to damping and small imperfections. In 2-D the similar effect of damping is noted for one type of periodic structure. whereas for another type the band gap effect is nearly eliminated by damping. In both 1-D and 2-D it is demonstrated how the free structural boundaries affect the response in the band gap due to local resonances. Finally. 2-D wave guides are considered by replacing the periodic structure with a homogeneous structure in a straight and a 90° bent path …,True,eSq9TLEAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,471,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X02016292,8164151101487705989,/scholar?cites=8164151101487705989,,,,0,0,0

The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable. hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel‐like fashion.

By contrast. an emerging approach (Figure 1 b). described in detail in a recent study [26] by Sigmund and co-workers. uses a geometrically non-linear model and includes a requirement of a constant prescribed Poisson’s ratio when straining the material. While both examples are designed to have a Poisson’s ratio of− 0.8. the performance of the linearly designed material rapidly deteriorates when the material is strained more than a few percent (Figure 1 c). Mathematically. the optimization goal is defined as minimizing the error between the actual and the pre-defined value of Poisson’s ratio over a range of discrete. nominal strain values up to 20%.[26] To ensure scalable fabrication of these architectures. several geometric constraints are imposed on the topology optimization design problem. A requirement of uniform structural features is implemented as a combination of imposing a minimum [27. 28] and a maximum length scale. The topology optimization step leads to a beam-like layout. which may be converted into a simplified design composed of a set of parameterized superellipses. Uniform feature size is guaranteed by specifying a constant width for all the superellipses. while the length of each superellipse is controlled by design points (Figure S1. Supporting Information). Using shape optimization to fine-tune the superellipse designs. we obtain architectures with uniform features having the desired response.

1276061,Primary cilia mediate mechanosensing in bone cells by a calcium-independent mechanism,2007,Amanda MD Malone and Charles T Anderson and Padmaja Tummala and Ronald Y Kwon and Tyler R Johnston and Tim Stearns and Christopher R Jacobs,104,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,33,13325-13330,National Acad Sciences,Primary cilia are sensory organelles that translate extracellular chemical and mechanical cues into cellular responses. Bone is an exquisitely mechanosensitive organ. and its homeostasis depends on the ability of bone cells to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. One such stimulus is dynamic fluid flow. which triggers biochemical and transcriptional changes in bone cells by an unknown mechanism. Here we report that bone cells possess primary cilia that project from the cell surface and deflect during fluid flow and that these primary cilia are required for osteogenic and bone resorptive responses to dynamic fluid flow. We also show that. unlike in kidney cells. primary cilia in bone translate fluid flow into cellular responses in bone cells independently of Ca2+ flux and stretch-activated ion channels. These results suggest that primary cilia might regulate homeostasis in diverse tissues by allowing mechanical …,True,4YmqmjoAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC,460,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/33/13325.short,17683938008029404231,/scholar?cites=17683938008029404231,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/33/13325.full.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,The success of tissue engineering applications can potentially be dramatically improved with the addition of adjuncts that increase the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor or stem cells. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has recently emerged as a potential biologic tool to treat acute and chronic tendon disorders. The regenerative potential of PRP is based on the release of growth factors that occurs with platelet rupture. Its autologous nature gives it a significant advantage in tissue engineering applications. To test whether PRP may be useful specifically for cartilage regeneration. a cell culture experiment was devised in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were grown in control media or media enhanced with inactivated. buffered PRP. Proliferation 7 days after PRP treatment was increased: 1.041 versus 0.199 for the control media cells (p < 0.001).

Wolff hypothesized that cancellous bone altered both its apparent density and trabecular orientation in response to mechanical loads. A mathematical counterpart of this principle is derived by adding a remodeling rule for the rate-of-change of the full anisotropic stiffness tensor (all 21 independent terms) to the density rate-of-change rule adapted from an existing isotropic theory. As a result. anisotropy and density patterns develop such that the local stiffness tensor is optimal for the given series of applied loadings. The method does not rely on additional morphological measures of trabecular orientation. Furthermore. assumptions of material symmetry are not required. and any observed regions of orthotropy. transverse isotropy. or isotropy are a result entirely of the functional adaptation of the bone and not the consequence of a modeling assumption.

At the same time. the boundaries of municipal organizational units. such as neighborhoods and districts. are largely statically defined by the city government and do not always reflect the character of life in these ar-eas. To address both difficulties. we introduce a clustering model and research methodology for studying the structure and composition of a city based on the social media its res-idents generate. We use data from approximately 18 million check-ins collected from users of a location-based online so-cial network.

We take an interdisciplinary approach to validating these clusters. interviewing 27 residents of Pittsburgh. PA. to see how their perceptions of the city project onto our findings there.

We describe the advantages that a service infrastructure for context awareness has over other approaches. outline some of the core technical challenges that must be addressed before such an infrastructure can be built. and point out promising research directions for overcoming these challenges.,True,MoFbcc0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,565,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327051HCI16234_11,17448262312787808156,/scholar?cites=17448262312787808156,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/journal_contribution/An_Infrastructure_Approach_to_Context-Aware_Computing/6469811/files/11898365.pdf,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,Location awareness is an important capability for mobile computing. Yet inexpensive. pervasive positioning—a requirement for wide-scale adoption of location-aware computing—has been elusive. We demonstrate a radio beacon-based approach to location. called Place Lab. that can overcome the lack of ubiquity and high-cost found in existing location sensing approaches. Using Place Lab. commodity laptops. PDAs and cell phones estimate their position by listening for the cell IDs of fixed radio beacons. such as wireless access points. and referencing the beacons’ positions in a cached database. We present experimental results showing that 802.11 and GSM beacons are sufficiently pervasive in the greater Seattle area to achieve 20-30 meter median accuracy with nearly 100% coverage measured by availability in people’s daily lives.,True,wTCe1mUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1569,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11428572_8,8283342780439663539,/scholar?cites=8283342780439663539,,,http://www.kevinli.net/courses/mobilehci_w2013/papers/placelab.pdf,0,0,0

Obesity is linked to several serious health problems and medical conditions. Medical experts agree that physical activity is critical to maintaining fitness. reducing weight. and improving health. yet many people have difficulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. Clinical studies have shown that health benefits can occur from simply increasing the number of steps one takes each day and that social support can motivate people to stay active.

These new technologies present a difficult privacy tradeoff. as disclosing one's location to another person or service could be risky. yet valuable. To explore whether and what users are willing to disclose about their location to social relations. we conducted a three-phased formative study. Our results show that the most important factors were who was requesting. why the requester wanted the participant's location. and what level of detail would be most useful to the requester. After determining these. participants were typically willing to disclose either the most useful detail or nothing about their location.

The history of eco-feedback extends back more than 40 years to the origins of environmental psychology.

Perhaps because of this goal. they may also share a tendency to centralize disability rather than ability. We present a refinement to these approaches called ability-based design that consists of focusing on ability throughout the design process in an effort to create systems that leverage the full range of human potential. Just as user-centered design shifted the focus of interactive system design from systems to users. ability-based design attempts to shift the focus of accessible design from disability to ability. Although prior approaches to accessible computing may consider users’ abilities to some extent. ability-based design makes ability its central focus. We offer seven ability-based design principles and describe the projects that inspired their formulation.

We show that a large portion a typical driver's trips are repeated. Our algorithms exploit this fact for prediction by matching the first part of a driver's current trip with one of the set of previously observed trips. Rather than predicting upcoming road segments. our focus is on making long term predictions of the route. We evaluate our algorithms using a large corpus of real world GPS driving data acquired from observing over 250 drivers for an average of 15.1 days per subject.

Inc.,Through a study of Web site design practice. we observed that designers employ multiple representations of Web sites as they progress through the design process and that these representations allow them to focus on different aspects of the design. In particular. we observed that Web site designers focus their design efforts at 3 different levels of granularity-site map. storyboard. and individual page-and that designers sketch at all levels during the early stages of design. Sketching on paper is especially important during the early phases of a project. when designers wish to explore many design possibilities quickly without focusing on low-level details. Existing Web design tools do not support such exploration tasks well. nor do they adequately integrate multiple site representations.

1276120,Cha-Cha: A System For Organizing Intranet Search Results,1999,Michael Chen and Marti Hearst and Jason Hong and James Lin,,,,,,Although search over World Wide Web pages has recently received much academic and commercial attention. surprisingly little research has been done on how to search the web pages within large. diverse intranets. Intranets contain the information associated with the internal workings of an organization. A standard search engine retrieves web pages that fall within a widely diverse range of information contexts. but presents these results uniformly. in a ranked list. As an alternative. the Cha-Cha system organizes web search results in such a way as to reflect the underlying structure of the intranet. In our approach. an “outline” or “table of contents” is created by first recording the shortest paths in hyperlinks from root pages to every page within the web intranet. After the user issues a query. these shortest paths are dynamically combined to form a hierarchical outline of the context in which the search results occur. The system is designed to be helpful for users with a wide range of computer skills. Preliminary user study and survey results suggest that some users find the resulting structure more helpful than the standard retrieval results display for intranet search.,True,Qt40tM4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,107,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usits99/full_papers/chen/chen.pdf,6891994296903488433,/scholar?cites=6891994296903488433,,,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usits99/full_papers/chen/chen.pdf,0,0,0

Current tools. however. are limited in the size and complexity of interaction that can be specified. We have created an advanced sketch-based visual language that allows for easy prototyping of large. complex interactive designs. In its current embodiment in the denim web design tool. the visual language allows designers to sketch reusable components for recurring page elements. such as navigation bars. as well as conditionals to illustrate and test transitions that depend on a user's input. Designers can also specify sites that accept richer user input than simple clicking.

PDAs. and cell phones. to access the same information. The user interface to this information needs to be different for each device. due to the different input and output constraints of each device. Currently designers designing such multi-device user interfaces either have to design a UI separately for each device. which is time consuming. or use a program to automatically generate interfaces. which often result in interfaces that are awkward. Each method also discourages iterative design. considered critical for creating good user interfaces.We are creating a system called Damask to support the early-stage design of user interfaces targeted at multiple devices. With Damask. the designer will design a user interface for one device. by sketching the design and by specifying which design patterns the interface uses. The patterns will help Damask generate user interfaces optimized for the other devices targeted by the designer. The generated interfaces will be of sufficient quality so that it will be more convenient to use Damask than to design each of the other interfaces separately. and the ease with which designers will be able to create designs will encourage them to engage in iterative design. Damask will also allow designers to create their own design patterns for use in their own projects and to share with other designers.,True,Qt40tM4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,70,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.201.2913&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2078521549754262482,/scholar?cites=2078521549754262482,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.201.2913&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

To explore this idea further. we carried out three related case studies of how members of a large research group shared meeting notes. The group found value in combining personal notes and presentation slides with a single. unifying document. such as regular meeting minutes. The minutes provided structure when there were too many sources of notes. We used this insight in our design of NotePals. a note-sharing system with a lightweight process. an interface. and hardware that distinguish it from previous systems. We have developed note-taking applications that run on inexpensive personal digital assistants and other ink-based capture devices. such as the paper-based CrossPad™.

1276168,User-defined motion gestures for mobile interaction,2011,Jaime Ruiz and Yang Li and Edward Lank,,,,197-206,ACM,Modern smartphones contain sophisticated sensors to monitor three-dimensional movement of the device. These sensors permit devices to recognize motion gestures-deliberate movements of the device by end-users to invoke commands. However. little is known about best-practices in motion gesture design for the mobile computing paradigm. To address this issue. we present the results of a guessability study that elicits end-user motion gestures to invoke commands on a smartphone device. We demonstrate that consensus exists among our participants on parameters of movement and on mappings of motion gestures onto commands. We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set. We highlight the implications of this work to the design of smartphone applications and hardware. Finally. we argue that our results influence best practices in …,True,ZZdB48QAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,448,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1978942.1978971,12535366544073878087,/scholar?cites=12535366544073878087,,,https://research.google/pubs/pub37156.pdf,0,0,0

1276169,Experimental analysis of mode switching techniques in pen-based user interfaces,2005,Yang Li and Ken Hinckley and Zhiwei Guan and James A Landay,,,,461-470,ACM,Inking and gesturing are two central tasks in pen-based user interfaces. Switching between modes for entry of uninterpreted ink and entry of gestures is required by many pen-based user interfaces. Without an appropriate mode switching technique. pen-based interactions in such situations may be inefficient and cumbersome. In this paper. we investigate five techniques for switching between ink and gesture modes in pen interfaces. including a pen-pressure based mode switching technique that allows implicit mode transition. A quantitative experimental study was conducted to evaluate the performance of these techniques. The results suggest that pressing a button with the non-preferred hand offers the fastest performance. while the technique of holding the pen still is significantly slower and more prone to error than the other techniques.

1276170,Protractor: a fast and accurate gesture recognizer,2010,Yang Li,,,,2169-2172,ACM,Protractor is a novel gesture recognizer that can be easily implemented and quickly customized for different users. Protractor uses a nearest neighbor approach. which recognizes an unknown gesture based on its similarity to each of the known gestures. eg. training samples or examples given by a user. In particular. it employs a novel method to measure the similarity between gestures. by calculating a minimum angular distance between them with a closed-form solution. As a result. Protractor is more accurate. naturally covers more gesture variation. runs significantly faster and uses much less memory than its peers. This makes Protractor suitable for mobile computing. which is limited in processing power and memory. An evaluation on both a previously published gesture data set and a newly collected gesture data set indicates that Protractor outperforms its peers in many aspects.,True,ZZdB48QAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,209,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1753326.1753654,12196406175345152870,/scholar?cites=12196406175345152870,,,https://research.google/pubs/pub36269.pdf,0,0,0

However. it has been insufficient in modeling small-target acquisition with finger-touch based input on screens. We propose a dual-distribution hypothesis to interpret the distribution of the endpoints in finger touch input. We hypothesize the movement endpoint distribution as a sum of two independent normal distributions. One distribution reflects the relative precision governed by the speed-accuracy tradeoff rule in the human motor system. and the other captures the absolute precision of finger touch independent of the speed-accuracy tradeoff effect. Based on this hypothesis. we derived the FFitts model-an expansion of Fitts' law for finger touch input.

This paper investigates the impact of these situational impairments on touch-screen interaction. We probe several design factors for touch-screen gestures. under various levels of environmental demands on attention. in comparison to the status-quo approach of soft buttons. We find that in the presence of environmental distractions. gestures can offer significant performance gains and reduced attentional load. while performing as well as soft buttons when the user's attention is focused on the phone.

In this paper. we propose Cluster-GCN. a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step. it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm. and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph.

1276186,Interactive sketching for the early stages of user interface design,1995,James A Landay and Brad A Myers,,,,43-50,,Current interactive user interface construction tools are often more of a hindrance than a benefit during the early stages of user interface design. These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish at this early stage. Most interface designers. especially those who have a background in graphic design. prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper or on a whiteboard. We are developing an interactive tool called SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However. unlike a paper sketch. this electronic sketch is interactive and can easily be modified. In addition. our system allows designers to examine. annotate. and edit a complete history of the design.

UC Berkeley Computer Science,It is time to broaden our performance-dominated research agenda. A four order of magnitude increase in performance since the first ASPLOS in 1982 means that few outside the CS&E research community believe that speed is the only problem of computer hardware and software. Current systems crash and freeze so frequently that people become violent. 1 Fast but flaky should not be our 21st century legacy.Recovery Oriented Computing (ROC) takes the perspective that hardware faults. software bugs. and operator errors are facts to be coped with. not problems to be solved. By concentrating on Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) rather than Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). ROC reduces recovery time and thus offers higher availability. Since a large portion of system administration is dealing with failures. ROC may also reduce total cost of ownership. One to two orders of magnitude reduction in cost mean that the purchase price of hardware and software is now a small part of the total cost of ownership. In addition to giving the motivation and definition of ROC. we introduce failure data for Internet sites that shows that the leading cause of outages is operator error. We also demonstrate five ROC techniques in five case studies. which we hope will influence designers of architectures and operating systems. If we embrace availability and maintainability. systems of the future may compete on recovery performance rather than just SPEC performance. and on total cost of ownership rather than just system price. Such a change may restore our pride in the architectures and operating systems we craft.,True,NnEMWJsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,659,http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/ROC_TR02-1175.pdf,14626507088715957364,/scholar?cites=14626507088715957364,,,http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/ROC_TR02-1175.pdf,0,0,0

We use the paths that requests follow as they move through the system as our core abstraction. and our “macro” approach focuses on component interactions rather than the details of the components themselves. Paths record component performance and interactions. are user-and request-centric. and occur in sufficient volume to enable statistical analysis. all in a way that is easily reusable across applications. Automated statistical analysis of multiple paths allows for the detection and diagnosis of complex failures and the assessment of evolution issues. In particular. our approach enables significantly stronger capabilities in failure detection. failure diagnosis. impact analysis. and understanding system evolution.

Most research on location systems has focused on precise location in indoor environments. However. many location applications (for example. location-aware web search) become interesting only when the underlying location system is available ubiquitously and is not limited to a single office environment.

Heidelberg,Accurate indoor localization has long been an objective of the ubiquitous computing research community. and numerous indoor localization solutions based on 802.11. Bluetooth. ultrasound and infrared technologies have been proposed. This paper presents the first accurate GSM indoor localization system that achieves median accuracy of 5 meters in large multi-floor buildings. The key idea that makes accurate GSM-based indoor localization possible is the use of wide signal-strength fingerprints. In addition to the 6-strongest cells traditionally used in the GSM standard. the wide fingerprint includes readings from additional cells that are strong enough to be detected. but too weak to be used for efficient communication. Experiments conducted on three multi-floor buildings show that our system achieves accuracy comparable to an 802.11-based implementation. and can accurately differentiate between …,True,OtREFPYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,651,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11551201_9,3814614180399977341,/scholar?cites=3814614180399977341,,,https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lamarca/pubs/ubicomp.pdf,0,0,0

To make our system appealing and useful. we require it to have the following properties: (i) data only from a single body location needed. and it is not required to be from the same point for every user; (ii) should work out of the box across individuals. with personalization only enhancing its recognition abilities; and (iii) should be effective even with a cost-sensitive subset of the sensors and data features. In this paper. we present an approach to building a system that exhibits these properties and provide evidence based on data for 8 different activities collected from 12 different subjects.

Recent advances in the development of multi-modal wearable sensors enable us to gather rich datasets of human activities. However. the problem of automatically identifying the most useful features for modeling such activities remains largely unsolved. In this paper we present a hybrid approach to recognizing activities. which combines boosting to discriminatively select useful features and learn an ensemble of static classifiers to recognize different activities. with hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the temporal regularities and smoothness of activities. We tested the activity recognition system using over 12 hours of wearable-sensor data collected by volunteers in natural unconstrained environments.

1276240,A toolkit for managing user attention in peripheral displays,2004,Tara Matthews and Anind K Dey and Jennifer Mankoff and Scott Carter and Tye Rattenbury,,,,247-256,,Traditionally. computer interfaces have been confined to conventional displays and focused activities. However. as displays become embedded throughout our environment and daily lives. increasing numbers of them must operate on the periphery of our attention.Peripheral displays can allow a person to be aware of information while she is attending to some other primary task or activity. We present the Peripheral Displays Toolkit (PTK). a toolkit that provides structured support for managing user attention in the development of peripheral displays. Our goal is to enable designers to explore different approaches to managing user attention. The PTK supports three issues specific to conveying information on the periphery of human attention. These issues areabstraction of raw input. rules for assigningnotification levels to input. andtransitions for updating a display when input arrives.

1276241,Designing mediation for context-aware applications,2005,Anind K Dey and Jennifer Mankoff,12,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI),1,53-80,ACM,Many context-aware services make the assumption that the context they use is completely accurate. However. in reality. both sensed and interpreted context is often ambiguous. A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services. therefore. is the ability to handle ambiguous context. Although some of this ambiguity may be resolved using automatic techniques. we argue that correct handling of ambiguous context will often need to involve the user. We use the term mediation to refer to the dialogue that ensues between the user and the system. In this article. we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments.

Our approach exploits mobile nodes present in the sensor field as forwarding agents. As a mobile node moves in close proximity to sensors. data is transferred to the mobile node for later depositing at the destination. We present an analytical model to understand the key performance metrics such as data transfer. latency to the destination. and power. Parameters for our model include: sensor buffer size. data generation rate. radio characteristics. and mobility patterns of mobile nodes. Through simulation we verify our model and show that our approach can provide substantial savings in energy as compared to the traditional ad-hoc network approach.,True,wUS-iRsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,728,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11036-006-5186-9,11523632323610156437,/scholar?cites=11523632323610156437,,,http://labs.ece.uw.edu/funlab/Publications/2006/2006_p327-jain_exploiting_mobility.pdf,0,0,0

To make our system appealing and useful. we require it to have the following properties: (i) data only from a single body location needed. and it is not required to be from the same point for every user; (ii) should work out of the box across individuals. with personalization only enhancing its recognition abilities; and (iii) should be effective even with a cost-sensitive subset of the sensors and data features. In this paper. we present an approach to building a system that exhibits these properties and provide evidence based on data for 8 different activities collected from 12 different subjects.

With daunting Orwellian visions looming. it is easy to conclude that tamper-proof technical protection mechanisms such as strong anonymization and encryption are the only solutions to such privacy threats.

Recent advances in the development of multi-modal wearable sensors enable us to gather rich datasets of human activities. However. the problem of automatically identifying the most useful features for modeling such activities remains largely unsolved. In this paper we present a hybrid approach to recognizing activities. which combines boosting to discriminatively select useful features and learn an ensemble of static classifiers to recognize different activities. with hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the temporal regularities and smoothness of activities. We tested the activity recognition system using over 12 hours of wearable-sensor data collected by volunteers in natural unconstrained environments.

Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method\emphcanonical correlation analysis (CCA). It is an alternative to the nonparametric method\emphkernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA. DCCA does not require an inner product. and has the advantages of a parametric method: training time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when computing the representations of unseen instances. In experiments on two real-world datasets. we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA.

In an effort to better understand what HMMs can do. this tutorial article analyzes HMMs by exploring a definition of HMMs in terms of random variables and conditional independence assumptions. We prefer this definition as it allows us to reason more throughly about the capabilities of HMMs. In particular. it is possible to deduce that there are. in theory at least. no limitations to the class of probability distributions representable by HMMs. This paper concludes that. in search of a model to supersede the HMM (say for ASR). rather than …,True,L9QufAsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,293,https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e89-d_3_869,8388193984088641207,/scholar?cites=8388193984088641207,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.98.2702&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

As they enter our everyday environments. it becomes critical to ensure their usability through natural Human-Drone Interaction (HDI). Previous work in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) shows that adding an emotional component is part of the key to success in robots' acceptability. We believe the adoption of personal drones would also benefit from adding an emotional component. This work defines a range of personality traits and emotional attributes that can be encoded in drones through their flight paths.

These wearable devices often offer multimodal feedback with embedded visual. audio. and vibrotactile displays. Vibrations are particularly useful when providing discreet feedback. without users having to look at a display or anyone else noticing. thus preserving the flow of the primary activity.

Moreover. it is unclear how much the user--s current physical activity may interfere with their understanding of the vibrations.

Yet. designing map interactions is not straightforward and depends on the device being used. As mobile devices evolve and become independent from users. such as with robots and drones. how will we interact with the maps they provide? We propose FlyMap as a novel user experience for drone-based interactive maps. We designed and developed three interaction techniques for FlyMap's usage scenarios. In a comprehensive indoor study (N= 16). we show the strengths and weaknesses of two techniques on users' cognition. task load. and satisfaction.

They are usually designed with the pico-projector embedded in the top of the device. Despite the potential of personal mobile projection to support new forms of interactivity such as augmented reality techniques. these devices have not yet made significant impact on the ways in which mobile data is experienced.

1276295,The value of using imprecise probabilities in engineering design,2006,Jason Matthew Aughenbaugh and Christiaan JJ Paredis,128,,4,969-979,,Engineering design decisions inherently are made under risk and uncertainty. The characterization of this uncertainty is an essential step in the decision process. In this paper. we consider imprecise probabilities (e.g.. intervals of probabilities) to express explicitly the precision with which something is known. Imprecision can arise from fundamental indeterminacy in the available evidence or from incomplete characterizations of the available evidence and designer’s beliefs. The hypothesis is that. in engineering design decisions. it is valuable to explicitly represent this imprecision by using imprecise probabilities.

Engineers must compare these concepts in order to move towards the more desirable designs. However. comparisons are difficult because a single concept associates with numerous possible final design specifications. and any meaningful comparison of concepts must consider this range of possibilities. Consequently. the performance of a concept can only be characterized imprecisely. While standard multi-attribute utility theory is an accepted framework for making preference-based decisions between precisely characterized alternatives. it does not directly accommodate the analysis of imprecisely characterized alternatives. By extending uncertainty representations to model imprecision explicitly. it is possible to apply the principles of utility theory to such problems. However. this can lead to situations of …,True,6161b6wAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,154,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448508001309,16030055852333732980,/scholar?cites=16030055852333732980,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.7411&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The localization system uses ultrasound to measure the distance from each moving robot to three stationary robots that serve as beacons. From these distance measurements the position of the robots is derived using a trilateration algorithm. The robot team can move over large distances by using a leap-frogging approach in which different robots serve as beacons at different times.

Especially for images and video. providing training data is very expensive in terms of human time and effort. In this paper we propose an active learning approach to tackle the problem. Instead of passively accepting random training examples. the active learning algorithm iteratively selects unlabeled examples for the user to label. so that human effort is focused on labeling the most “useful” examples. Our method relies on the idea of uncertainty sampling. in which the algorithm selects unlabeled examples that it finds hardest to classify. Specifically. we propose an uncertainty measure that generalizes margin-based uncertainty to the multi-class case and is easy to compute. so that active learning can handle a large number of classes and large data sizes efficiently.

This approach assumes that one has available nominal controller parameter settings through some classical tuning technique (Ziegler-Nichols. Kalman. etc.). By using an appropriate fuzzy matrix (similar to Macvicar-Whelan matrix). it is possible to determine small changes on these values during the system operation. and these lead to improved performance of the transient and steady behavior of the closed-loop system.

Transportation assets such as bridges. overpasses. dams and tunnels are vulnerable to attacks. In addition. facilities such as chemical storage. office complexes and laboratories can become targets. Many of these facilities exist in areas of high pedestrian traffic. making them accessible to attack. while making the monitoring of the facilities difficult. In this research. we developed components of an automated.“smart video” system to track pedestrians and detect situations where people may be in peril. as well as suspicious motion or activities at or near critical transportation assets. The software tracks individual pedestrians as they pass through the field of vision of the camera. and uses vision algorithms to classify the motion and activities of each pedestrian. The tracking is accomplished through the development of a position and velocity path characteristic for each pedestrian using a Kalman filter. With this information. the system can bring the incident to the attention of human security personnel. In future applications. this system could alert authorities if a pedestrian displays suspicious behavior such as: entering a “secure area.” running or moving erratically. loitering or moving against traffic. or dropping a bag or other item.,True,wQdo-bMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,236,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.9664&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8725223351159780898,/scholar?cites=8725223351159780898,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.9664&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

While hysteresis is rate-independent. structural vibration increases as the piezoelectric actuator is driven closer to its resonant frequency. Instead of separately modeling the two interacting dynamic effects. this work treats their combined effect phenomenologically and proposes a rate-dependent modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator to account for the hysteretic nonlinearity of a piezoelectric actuator at varying actuation frequency.

Most hysteresis models are based on elementary rate independent operators and are not suitable for modeling actuator behavior across a wide frequency band. This work proposes a rate dependent modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator to account for the hysteresis of a piezoelectric actuator at varying frequency. We have shown experimentally that the relationship between the slope of the hysteretic loading curve and the rate of control input can be modeled by a linear function. The proposed rate-dependent hysteresis model is implemented for open-loop control of a piezoelectric actuator.

We have developed a factorization method that can overcome this difficulty by recovering shape and motion under orthography without computing depth as an intermediate step.An image stream can be represented by the 2F×P measurement matrix of the image coordinates of P points tracked through F frames. We show that under orthographic projection this matrix is of rank 3.Based on this observation. the factorization method uses the singular-value decomposition technique to factor the measurement matrix into two matrices which represent object shape and camera rotation respectively.

1276325,Detection and tracking of point,1991,Carlo Tomasi and Takeo Kanade,,,,,features. Technical Report CMU-CS-91-132. Carnegie. Mellon University,The factorization method described in this series of reports requires an algorithm to track the motion of features in an image stream. Given the small inter-frame displacement made possible by the factorization approach. the best tracking method turns out to be the one proposed by Lucas and Kanade in 1981.The method defines the measure of match between fixed-size feature windows in the past and current frame as the sum of squared intensity di erences over the windows. The displacement is then defined as the one that minimizes this sum. For small motions. a linearization of the image intensities leads to a Newton-Raphson style minimization. In this report. after rederiving the method in a physically intuitive way. we answer the crucial question of how to choose the feature windows that are best suited for tracking. Our selection criterion is based directly on the definition of the tracking algorithm. and expresses how well a feature can be tracked. As a result. the criterion is optimal by construction. We show by experiment that the performance of both the selection and the tracking algorithm are adequate for our factorization method. and we address the issue of how to detect occlusions.

In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages. producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations. without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference.

1276344,Feature selective anchor-free module for single-shot object detection,2019,Chenchen Zhu and Yihui He and Marios Savvides,,,,840-849,,We motivate and present feature selective anchor-free (FSAF) module. a simple and effective building block for single-shot object detectors. It can be plugged into single-shot detectors with feature pyramid structure. The FSAF module addresses two limitations brought up by the conventional anchor-based detection: 1) heuristic-guided feature selection; 2) overlap-based anchor sampling. The general concept of the FSAF module is online feature selection applied to the training of multi-level anchor-free branches. Specifically. an anchor-free branch is attached to each level of the feature pyramid. allowing box encoding and decoding in the anchor-free manner at an arbitrary level. During training. we dynamically assign each instance to the most suitable feature level. At the time of inference. the FSAF module can work independently or jointly with anchor-based branches. We instantiate this concept with simple implementations of anchor-free branches and online feature selection strategy. Experimental results on the COCO detection track show that our FSAF module performs better than anchor-based counterparts while being faster. When working jointly with anchor-based branches. the FSAF module robustly improves the baseline RetinaNet by a large margin under various settings. while introducing nearly free inference overhead.

Given a pair of images. we derive a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate of the parameters of the relative deformation between them. Our estimation process accomplishes two things simultaneously: it normalizes for pattern warping and it returns a distortion-tolerant similarity metric which can be used for matching two nonlinearly deformed image patterns. The prior probability of the deformation parameters is specific to the pattern-type and. therefore. should result in more accurate matching than an arbitrary general distribution.

1276349,Correlation pattern recognition for face recognition,2006,Bhagavatula VK Vijaya Kumar and Marios Savvides and Chunyan Xie,94,Proceedings of the IEEE,11,1963-1976,IEEE,Two-dimensional (2-D) face recognition (FR) is of interest in many verification (1:1 matching) and identification (1:N matching) applications because of its nonintrusive nature and because digital cameras are becoming ubiquitous. However. the performance of 2-D FR systems can be degraded by natural factors such as expressions. illuminations. pose. and aging. Several FR algorithms have been proposed to deal with the resulting appearance variability. However. most of these methods employ features derived in the image or the space domain whereas there are benefits to working in the spatial frequency domain (i.e.. the 2-D Fourier transforms of the images). These benefits include shift-invariance. graceful degradation. and closed-form solutions. We discuss the use of spatial frequency domain methods (also known as correlation filters or correlation pattern recognition) for FR and illustrate the advantages …,True,mWpu_ooAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,169,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4052477/,13591804843763773631,/scholar?cites=13591804843763773631,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47744319/Correlation_Pattern_Recognition_for_face_recognition-IEEE-2006.pdf,0,0,0

We show that Logarithm transformations on images suffering from significant illumination variation. produce face images that are improved substantially for performing face authentication.

To obtain age invariant features. we first perform preprocessing schemes. such as pose correction. illumination and periocular region normalization. And then we apply robust Walsh-Hadamard transform encoded local binary patterns (WLBP) on preprocessed periocular region only. We find the WLBP feature on periocular region maintains consistency of the same individual across ages. Finally. we use unsupervised discriminant projection (UDP) to build subspaces on WLBP featured periocular images and gain 100% rank-1 identification rate and 98% verification rate at 0.1% false accept rate on the entire FG-NET database.

We perform principal component analysis in the frequency domain on the phase spectrum of the face images and we show that this improves the recognition performance in the presence of illumination variations dramatically compared to normal eigenface method and other competing face recognition methods such as the illumination subspace method and fisherfaces. We show that this method is robustly even when presented with partial views of the test faces. without performing any pre-processing and without needing any a-priori knowledge of the type or part of face that is occluded or missing.

1276353,Bounding box regression with uncertainty for accurate object detection,2019,Yihui He and Chenchen Zhu and Jianren Wang and Marios Savvides and Xiangyu Zhang,,,,2888-2897,,Large-scale object detection datasets (eg. MS-COCO) try to define the ground truth bounding boxes as clear as possible. However. we observe that ambiguities are still introduced when labeling the bounding boxes. In this paper. we propose a novel bounding box regression loss for learning bounding box transformation and localization variance together. Our loss greatly improves the localization accuracies of various architectures with nearly no additional computation. The learned localization variance allows us to merge neighboring bounding boxes during non-maximum suppression (NMS). which further improves the localization performance. On MS-COCO. we boost the Average Precision (AP) of VGG-16 Faster R-CNN from 23.6% to 29.1%. More importantly. for ResNet-50-FPN Mask R-CNN. our method improves the AP and AP90 by 1.8% and 6.2% respectively. which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art bounding box refinement methods.

All executable content that is loaded onto the Linux system is measured before execution and these measurements are protected by the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that is part of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) standards. Our system is the first to extend the TCG trust measurement concepts to dynamic executable content from the BIOS all the way up into the application layer. In effect. we show that many of the Microsoft NGSCB guarantees can be obtained on today's hardware and today's software and that these guarantees do not require a new CPU mode or operating system but merely depend on the availability of an independent trusted entity. a TPM for example.

An adversary can compromise our privacy and safety by maliciously modifying the memory contents of these embedded devices. In this paper. we propose a softWare-based attestation technique (SWATT) to verify the memory contents of embedded devices and establish the absence of malicious changes to the memory contents. SWATT does not need physical access to the device's memory. yet provides memory content attestation similar to TCG or NGSCB without requiring secure hardware. SWATT can detect any change in memory contents with high probability. thus detecting viruses. unexpected configuration settings. and Trojan Horses. To circumvent SWATT. we expect that an attacker needs to change the hardware to hide memory content changes.

As a result. the TPM’s secure storage and cryptographic functions are available to operating systems and applications running in virtual machines. Our new facility supports higher-level services for establishing trust in virtualized environments. for example remote attestation of software integrity.We implemented the full TPM specification in software and added functions to create and destroy virtual TPM instances. We integrated our software TPM into a hypervisor environment to make TPM functions available to virtual machines. Our virtual TPM supports suspend and resume operations. as well as migration of a virtual TPM instance with its respective virtual machine across platforms.

Code attestation has recently received considerable attention in trusted computing. However. current code attestation technology is relatively immature. First. due to the great variability in software versions and configurations. verification of the hash is difficult. Second. the time-of-use and time-of-attestation discrepancy remains to be addressed. since the code may be correct at the time of the attestation. but it may be compromised by the time of use. The goal of BIND is to address these issues and make code attestation more usable in securing distributed systems. BIND offers the following properties: (1) BIND performs fine-grained attestation.

The shape features are extracted using the depth information in the frequency domain via spherical harmonics representation. The other features include the motion of the 3D joint positions (i.e. the end points of the distal limb segments) in the human body. Both sets of features are fused using the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) technique at the kernel level for human activity recognition.

The novel aspect of this technique is that it does not require explicit knowledge of the redundant applied load vectors. yet it retains the noise rejection of a highly redundant data set and the rigor of least squares. The result is a much faster. slightly more accurate calibration procedure. A constant-magnitude force (produced by a mass in a gravity field) is randomly moved through the sensing space while raw data is continuously gathered. Using only the raw sensor signals. the motion of the force vector (the “motion”) and the calibration matrix (the “shape”) are simultaneously extracted by singular value decomposition.

This method identifies camera tampering by detecting large differences between older frames of video and more recent frames. A buffer of incoming video frames is kept and three different measures of image dissimilarity are used to compare the frames. After normalization. a set of conditions is tested to decide if camera tampering has occurred. The effects of adjusting the internal parameters of the algorithm are examined.

But this usually implies that one has to sacrifice functionality for security. For example. if a client wishes to retrieve only documents containing certain words. it was not previously known how to let the data storage server perform the search and answer the query. without loss of data confidentiality. We describe our cryptographic schemes for the problem of searching on encrypted data and provide proofs of security for the resulting crypto systems.

Applications include the continuous authentication of radio and TV Internet broadcasts. and authenticated data distribution by satellite. The main challenges are fourfold. First. authenticity must be guaranteed even when only the sender of the data is trusted. Second. the scheme needs to scale to potentially millions of receivers.

1276385,Advanced and authenticated marking schemes for IP traceback,2001,Dawn Xiaodong Song and Adrian Perrig,2,,,878-886,IEEE,Defending against distributed denial-of-service attacks is one of the hardest security problems on the Internet today. One difficulty to thwart these attacks is to trace the source of the attacks because they often use incorrect. or spoofed IP source addresses to disguise the true origin. In this paper. we present two new schemes. the advanced marking scheme and the authenticated marking scheme. which allow the victim to trace-back the approximate origin of spoofed IP packets. Our techniques feature low network and router overhead. and support incremental deployment. In contrast to previous work. our techniques have significantly higher precision (lower false positive rate) and fewer computation overhead for the victim to reconstruct the attack paths under large scale distributed denial-of-service attacks. Furthermore the authenticated marking scheme provides efficient authentication of routers' markings such that …,True,n-Oret4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1274,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/916279/,8738014725121093902,/scholar?cites=8738014725121093902,,,http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~fabian/courses/CS600.424/course_papers/ams.pdf,0,0,0

1276386,Déjà Vu: a user study. Using Images for Authentication.,2000,Rachna Dhamija and Adrian Perrig,,,,45-58,,Current secure systems suffer because they neglect the importance of human factors in security. We address a fundamental weakness of knowledge-based authentication schemes. which is the human limitation to remember secure passwords. Our approach to improve the security of these systems relies on recognition-based. rather than recall-based authentication. We examine the requirements of a recognition-based authentication system and propose Déjà Vu. which authenticates a user through her ability to recognize previously seen images. Déjà Vu is more reliable and easier to use than traditional recall-based schemes. which require the user to precisely recall passwords or PINs. Furthermore. it has the advantage that it prevents users from choosing weak passwords and makes it difficult to write down or share passwords with others.,True,n-Oret4AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,1222,https://www.usenix.org/events/sec00/full_papers/dhamija/dhamija_html/,4161383874202278330,/scholar?cites=4161383874202278330,,,https://www.usenix.org/events/sec00/full_papers/dhamija/dhamija.pdf,0,0,0

The trade-offs resulting between some of these criteria are illustrated with the help of a new family of filters called fractional power filters (FPFs).

A good measure for distortion performance is shown to be a generalization of the minimum average correlation energy criterion. To optimize the filter’s performance. we remove the usual hard constraints on the outputs in the synthetic discriminant function formulation. The resulting filters exhibit superior distortion tolerance while retaining the attractive features of their predecessors such as the minimum average correlation energy filter and the minimum variance synthetic discriminant function filter. The proposed theory also unifies several existing approaches and examines the relationship between different formulations.

We propose a novel scheme that encrypts the training images used to synthesize the single minimum average correlation energy filter for biometric authentication. We show theoretically that convolving the training images with any random convolution kernel prior to building the biometric filter does not change the resulting correlation output peak-to-sidelobe ratios. thus preserving the authentication performance.

Wavelet transform and independent component analysis (ICA) are applied separately to each heartbeat to extract morphological features. In addition.

On top of ST. we also propose a novel class-balanced self-training (CBST) framework to avoid the gradual domi-nance of large classes on pseudo-label generation. and introduce spatialpriors to refine generated labels.

Self-organizing agents can arrange themselves geometrically in two- and three-dimensional space using only local information. The method is a distributed one: each agent uses only information obtained by its own sensors. Algorithms are based on feasible assumptions on sensing capability.

1276404,Intelligent navigation of autonomous vehicles in an automated highway system: Learning methods and interacting vehicles approach,1998,Cem Unsal,,,,,,One of today's most serious social. economical and environmental  problems is traffic congestion. In addition to the financial cost of the problem. the number of traffic related injuries and casualties is very high. A recently considered approach to increase safety while reducing congestion and improving driving conditions is Automated Highway Systems (AHS).  The AHS will evolve from the present highway system to an intelligent vehicle/highway system that will incorporate communication. vehicle control and traffic management techniques to provide safe. fast and more efficient surface transportation. A key factor in AHS deployment is intelligent vehicle control. While the technology to safely maneuver the vehicles exists. the problem of making intelligent decisions to improve a single vehicle's travel time and safety while optimizing the overall traffic flow is still a stumbling block.  We propose an artificial intelligence technique called stochastic learning automata to design an intelligent vehicle path controller. Using the information obtained by on-board sensors and local communication modules. two automata are capable of learning the best possible (lateral and longitudinal) actions to avoid collisions. This learning method is capable of adapting to the automata environment resulting from unmodeled physical environment. Simulations for simultaneous lateral and longitudinal control of an autonomous vehicle provide encouraging results. Although the learning approach taken is capable of providing a safe decision. optimization of the overall traffic flow is also possible by studying the interaction of the vehicles.

This paper considers the problem of secret communication between two nodes. over a fading wireless medium. in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. The assumption used is that the transmitter and its helpers (amplifying relays) have more antennas than the eavesdropper. The transmitter ensures secrecy of communication by utilizing some of the available power to produce 'artificial noise'. such that only the eavesdropper's channel is degraded. Two scenarios are considered. one where the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas. and the other where amplifying relays simulate the effect of multiple antennas.

However. the existing wireless channel models. i.e.. physical-layer channel models. do not explicitly characterize a wireless channel in terms of these QoS metrics. In this paper. we propose and develop a link-layer channel model termed effective capacity (EC). In this approach. we first model a wireless link by two EC functions. namely. the probability of nonempty buffer. and the QoS exponent of a connection. Then. we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to estimate these EC functions. The physical-layer analogs of these two link-layer EC functions are the marginal distribution (e.g..

It is desired that the eavesdropper be unable to decode the message. We show that secrecy can be achieved by adding artificially generated noise to the information bearing signal such that it does not degrade the intended receiver’s channel. We consider two different scenarios; one in which the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas and the other in which the transmitter has a single antenna but ‘helper’nodes are available. In the multiple antenna scenario. the degrees of freedom provided by the multiple antennas is used to generate noise intelligently so that it degrades only the eavesdropper’s channel. In the multiple helper scenario. even though the transmitter does not have multiple antennas. the helper nodes simulate the effect of multiple antennas and allow the transmitter to generate artificial noise as in the previous case.,True,ppVNXUsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,523,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.111.8844&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11447867796353023496,/scholar?cites=11447867796353023496,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.111.8844&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The key consideration is that the channel state information is fed back to the transmitter in a causal manner. A general cost function /spl mu/(x) is considered in solving the delay-constrained transmission problem. under the short-term and the long-term power constraints. A causal power adaptation strategy is needed to maximize the cost function. hence dynamic programming is found to give the optimum solution. The general cost function is then specialized to the cases of expected and outage capacities. In the case of expected capacity. it is observed that optimizing the transmitted power does not give much benefit at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). but provides a substantial gain at low SNR. At low SNR. it is proved that the capacity increases by a factor of approximately log K/m. due to power adaptation …,True,ppVNXUsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,142,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1027778/,2468573192004326673,/scholar?cites=2468573192004326673,,,,0,0,0

Different from the conventional `topological observability' based approaches. this paper advocates a much more refined. information-theoretic criterion. namely the mutual information (MI) between PMU measurements and power system states. The proposed MI criterion not only includes observability as a special case. but also rigorously models the uncertainty reduction on power system states from PMU measurements. Thus. it can generate highly informative PMU configurations. The MI criterion can also facilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU outages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm. and show that it achieves an approximation ratio of (1-1/ e ) for any PMU placement budget.

Both the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to have multiple antennas and the multiple colluding eavesdroppers are modeled by an eavesdropper with multiple antennas. Communication is secret if the eavesdropper is unable to decode the message whereas the receiver can decode the message without making any errors. Thus. we deal with the problem of secrecy in a MIMO scenario. It is shown how the transmitter can use the multiple antennas to add artificially generated noise to the information signal such that the artificial noise only degrades the eavesdropper's channel.

1276422,Power and performance evaluation of globally asynchronous locally synchronous processors,2002,Anoop Iyer and Diana Marculescu,30,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,2,158-168,ACM,Due to shrinking technologies and increasing design sizes. it is becoming more difficult and expensive to distribute a global clock signal with low skew throughout a processor die. Asynchronous processor designs do not suffer from this problem since they do not have a global clock. However. a paradigm shift from synchronous to asynchronous is unlikely to happen in the processor industry in the near future. Hence the study of Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (or GALS) systems is relevant. In this paper we use a cycle-accurate simulation environment to study the impact of asynchrony in a superscalar processor architecture. Our results show that as expected. going from a synchronous to a GALS design causes a drop in performance. but elimination of the global clock does not lead to drastic power reductions. From a power perspective. GALS designs are inherently less efficient when compared to …,True,MRHzTAIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,289,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/545214.545233,6170956642894165242,/scholar?cites=6170956642894165242,,,http://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece743/project/01003573.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. energy consumption and distributing a single global clock signal throughout a chip have become major design bottlenecks. To deal with these issues. a globally asynchronous. locally synchronous (GALS) design is considered for achieving low power consumption and modular design. Such a design style fits nicely with the concept of voltage-frequency islands (VFIs) which has been recently introduced for achieving fine-grain system-level power management. This paper proposes a design methodology for partitioning an NoC architecture into multiple VFIs and assigning supply and threshold voltage levels to each VFI.

Although manufacturing process variations are giving rise to significant core-to-core variations in power and performance. traditional DVFS controllers are unaware of these variations. Exploiting the different power/performance profiles of the cores can significantly improve energy-efficiency. Two hardware DVFS control algorithms are considered and the gains enabled by incorporating variability-awareness are demonstrated on multithreaded commercial workloads. For a design with per-core voltage/frequency islands (VFIs). the mean power per unit throughput for a simple threshold-based controller is reduced by 8.0% when variability-awareness is added.

As a result. the communication architecture plays a major role in the area. performance. and energy consumption of the overall system. This article presents a comprehensive evaluation of three on-chip communication architectures targeting multimedia applications.

Statistical tests performed on relevant traces extracted from common video clips establish unequivocally the existence of self-similarity in video traffic. Using a generic tile-based communication architecture. we discuss the implications of our findings on on-chip buffer space allocation and present quantitative evaluations for typical video streams. We also describe a technique for synthetically generating traces having statistical properties similar to those obtained from real video clips. Our proposed technique speeds up buffer simulations. allows media system designers to explore architectures rapidly and use large media data benchmarks more efficiently.

Self-securing storage addresses client and user account problems by transparently auditing accesses and versioning data within each storage server. Thus.

There have been many topology management schemes proposed. Most of them conserve energy by periodically putting nodes to sleep. One consideration often overlooked is the fact that sensor nodes fail. especially in harsh environments. In this paper. a modification to an existing topology management scheme. Naps. is proposed to ensure very minimal data loss while also handling node failures. The idea is to conserve energy to prolong the lifetime of the nodes and the sensor network while maintaining a constantly connected sensor network.

Traditional routing assumes individuals provide messages to a device connected to a communications network that assumes all responsibility for message delivery. Although each individual may have links to multiple communication devices (office computer.

To improve robustness of communication. especially in dynamic ad hoc military networks. this paper models a novel routing paradigm using an integrated communication and social network.

However. the existing wireless channel models. i.e.. physical-layer channel models. do not explicitly characterize a wireless channel in terms of these QoS metrics.

In this approach. we first model a wireless link by two EC functions. namely. the probability of nonempty buffer. and the QoS exponent of a connection. Then. we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to estimate these EC functions. The physical-layer analogs of these two link-layer EC functions are the marginal distribution (e.g..

However. because wireless mobile nodes are usually constrained by limited power and computation resources. a selfish node may be unwilling to spend its resources in forwarding packets which are not of its direct interest. even though it expects other nodes to forward its packets to the destination. It has been shown that the presence of such selfish nodes degrades the overall performance of a non-cooperative ad hoc network. To address this problem. we propose a secure and objective reputation-based incentive (SORI) scheme to encourage packet forwarding and discipline selfish behavior.

To prolong the operational lifetime of these devices. an embedded video encoding system should be able to adjust its computational complexity and energy consumption as demanded by the situation and its environment. To analyze. control. and optimize the rate-distortion (R-D) behavior of the wireless video communication system under the energy constraint. we develop a power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) analysis framework. which extends the traditional R-D analysis by including another dimension. the power consumption.

Real-time video transmission typically has requirements on quality of service (QoS). However. wireless channels are unreliable and the channel bandwidth varies with time. which may cause severe degradation in video quality. In addition. for video multicast. the heterogeneity of receivers makes it difficult to achieve efficiency and flexibility. To address these issues. three techniques. namely. scalable video coding. network-aware adaptation of end systems. and adaptive QoS support from networks. have been developed.

Naturally. a question that arises is whether we can beat notorious DDoS attacks in a cloud environment. Researchers have demonstrated that the essential issue of DDoS attack and defense is resource competition between defenders and attackers. A cloud usually possesses profound resources and has full control and dynamic allocation capability of its resources. Therefore. cloud offers us the potential to overcome DDoS attacks. However. individual cloud hosted servers are still vulnerable to DDoS attacks if they still run in the traditional way. In this paper. we propose a dynamic resource allocation strategy to counter DDoS attacks against individual cloud customers.

One of the important application areas of UWB is wireless sensor networks. The proper operations of many UWB sensor networks rely on the knowledge of physical sensor locations. However. most existing localization algorithms developed for sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks in hostile environments. As a result. attackers can easily subvert the normal functionalities of location-dependent sensor networks by exploiting the weakness of localization algorithms. In this paper. we first analyze the security of existing localization techniques. We then develop a mobility-assisted secure localization scheme for UWB sensor networks.

1276468,Self adaptive particle filter,2005,Alvaro Soto,,,,1398-1406,,The particle filter has emerged as a useful tool for problems requiring dynamic state estimation. The efficiency and accuracy of the filter depend mostly on the number of particles used in the estimation and on the propagation function used to re-allocate these particles at each iteration. Both features are specified beforehand and are kept fixed in the regular implementation of the filter. In practice this may be highly inappropriate since it ignores errors in the models and the varying dynamics of the processes. This work presents a self adaptive version of the particle filter that uses statistical methods to adapt the number of particles and the propagation function at each iteration. Furthermore. our method presents similar computational load than the standard particle filter.

Therefore extending face recognition to unconstrained face images has become an active area of research. To this end. histograms of Local Binary Patterns (LBP) have proven to be highly discriminative descriptors for face recognition. Nonetheless. most LBP-based algorithms use a rigid descriptor matching strategy that is not robust against pose variation and misalignment.

Our method describes human activities in a hierarchical discriminative model that operates at three semantic levels. At the lower level. body poses are encoded in a representative but discriminative pose dictionary. At the intermediate level. encoded poses span a space where simple human actions are composed. At the highest level. our model captures temporal and spatial compositions of actions into complex human activities. Our human activity classifier simultaneously models which body parts are relevant to the action of interest as well as their appearance and composition using a discriminative approach. By formulating model learning in a max-margin framework. our approach achieves powerful multi-class discrimination while providing useful annotations at the intermediate semantic level. We show how our hierarchical compositional model provides natural handling of occlusions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. we introduce a new dataset of composed human activities.

This paper presents an adaptive multi-robot exploration strategy that is novel in performing both wide-area coverage and hotspot sampling using non-myopic path planning. As a result. the environmental phenomena can be accurately mapped. It is based on a dynamic programming formulation. which we call the Multi-robot Adaptive Sampling Problem (MASP). A key feature of MASP is in covering the entire adaptivity spectrum. thus allowing strategies of varying adaptivity to be formed and theoretically analyzed in their performance; a more adaptive strategy improves mapping accuracy. We apply MASP to sampling the Gaussian and log-Gaussian processes. and analyze if the resulting strategies are adaptive and maximize wide-area coverage and hotspot sampling. Solving MASP is non-trivial as it comprises continuous state components. So. it is reformulated for convex analysis. which allows discrete-state monotone-bounding approximation to be developed. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the policy quality of the approximate MASP (aMASP) for using in MASP. Although aMASP can be solved exactly. its state size grows exponentially with the number of stages. To alleviate this computational difficulty. anytime algorithms are proposed based on aMASP. one of which can guarantee its policy quality for MASP in real time.,True,2P-Q09UAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,123,https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub4/low_kian_hsiang_2008_1/low_kian_hsiang_2008_1.pdf,2478754335481102961,/scholar?cites=2478754335481102961,,,https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub4/low_kian_hsiang_2008_1/low_kian_hsiang_2008_1.pdf,0,0,0

1276476,Multi-robot informative path planning for active sensing of environmental phenomena: A tale of two algorithms,2013,Nannan Cao and Kian Hsiang Low and John M Dolan,,,,7-14,ACM,A key problem of robotic environmental sensing and monitoring is that of active sensing: How can a team of robots plan the most informative observation paths to minimize the uncertainty in modeling and predicting an environmental phenomenon? This paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ active sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analytically that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms with increasing planning horizon length. We provide theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called transect sampling. which. in particular. can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational time. even when the field conditions are less favorable.,True,2P-Q09UAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,95,https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0723,15791619762881052544,/scholar?cites=15791619762881052544,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.0723,0,0,0

1276477,Information-theoretic approach to efficient adaptive path planning for mobile robotic environmental sensing,2009,Kian Hsiang Low and John M Dolan and Pradeep Khosla,,,,233-240,AAAI Press,Recent research in robot exploration and mapping has focused on sampling environmental hotspot fields. This exploration task is formalized by Low. Dolan. and Khosla (2008) in a sequential decision-theoretic planning under uncertainty framework called MASP. The time complexity of solving MASP approximately depends on the map resolution. which limits its use in large-scale. high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this computational difficulty. this paper presents an information-theoretic approach to MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the cost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem. its time complexity becomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot team size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the reward-maximizing dual. we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy sampling. thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also allows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage of optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of approximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and empirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the log-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process in mapping the hotspot field. Lastly. we provide sufficient conditions that. when met. guarantee adaptivity has no benefit under an assumed environment model.,True,2P-Q09UAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,92,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13344,10429393960524820682,/scholar?cites=10429393960524820682,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/download/13344/13192,0,0,0

Two basic approaches have emerged from these research efforts: deliberative vs.\reactive. These two approaches can be distinguished by their different usage of sensed data and global knowledge. speed of response. reasoning capability. and complexity of computation. Their strengths are complementary and their weaknesses can be mitigated by combining the two approaches in a hybrid architecture. This paper describes a method for goal-directed. collision-free navigation in unpredictable environments that employs a behavior-based hybrid architecture with asynchronously operating behavioral modules. It differs from existing hybrid architectures in two important ways:(1) the planning module produces a sequence of checkpoints instead of a conventional complete path. and (2) in addition to obstacle …,True,2P-Q09UAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,91,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/544741.544797,18137726764898235443,/scholar?cites=18137726764898235443,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.57.8808&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents a decentralized data fusion and active sensing (D2FAS) algorithm for mobile sensors to actively explore the road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting the traffic phenomenon. We analyze the time and communication complexity of D2FAS and demonstrate that it can scale well with a large number of observations and sensors. We provide a theoretical guarantee on its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the Gaussian process (GP) model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be parallelized and distributed among the mobile sensors (in a Google-like MapReduce paradigm). thereby achieving efficient and scalable prediction. We also theoretically guarantee its active sensing performance that improves under various practical environmental conditions.

1276485,Decentralized Active Robotic Exploration and Mapping for Probabilistic Field Classification in Environmental Sensing,2012,Kian Hsiang Low and Jie Chen and John M Dolan and Steve Chien and David R Thompson,,,,105-112,IFAAMAS,A central problem in environmental sensing and monitoring is to classify/label the hotspots in a large-scale environmental field. This paper presents a novel decentralized active robotic exploration (DARE) strategy for probabilistic classification/labeling of hotspots in a Gaussian process (GP)-based field. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art exploration strategies for learning environmental field maps. the time needed to solve the DARE strategy is independent of the map resolution and the number of robots. thus making it practical for in situ. real-time active sampling. Its exploration behavior exhibits an interesting formal trade-off between that of boundary tracking until the hotspot region boundary can be accurately predicted and wide-area coverage to find new boundaries in sparsely sampled areas to be tracked. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the active exploration performance of the DARE strategy: under reasonable conditional independence assumption. we prove that it can optimally achieve two formal cost-minimizing exploration objectives based on the misclassification and entropy criteria. Importantly. this result implies that the uncertainty of labeling the hotspots in a GP-based field is greatest at or close to the hotspot region boundaries. Empirical evaluation on real-world plankton density and temperature field data shows that. subject to limited observations. DARE strategy can achieve more superior classification of hotspots and time efficiency than state-of-the-art active exploration strategies.,True,2P-Q09UAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,65,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.7925&rep=rep1&type=pdf,17340896449939848060,/scholar?cites=17340896449939848060,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.7925&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The method avoids image correspondence problems by working in a discretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in a fixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full account of occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apart and widely distributed about the environment. The algorithm identifies a special set of invariant voxels which together form a spatial and photometric reconstruction of the scene. fully consistent with the input images.

1276503,View Morphing,1996,Steven Seitz and Charles Dyer,,,,21-30,ACM,Image morphing techniques can generate compelling 2D transitions between images. However. differences in object pose or viewpoint often cause unnatural distortions in image morphs that are difficult to correct manually. Using basic principles of projective geometry. this paper introduces a simple extension to image morphing that correctly handles 3D projective camera and scene transformations. The technique. called view morphing. works by prewarping two images prior to computing a morph and then postwarping the interpolated images. Because no knowledge of 3D shape is required. the technique may be applied to photographs and drawings. as well as rendered scenes. The ability to synthesize changes both in viewpoint and image structure affords a wide variety of interesting 3D effects via simple image transformations.,True,-6cOYcYAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC,1283,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/237170.237196,1916654164479120488,/scholar?cites=1916654164479120488,,,https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring01/cs598b/papers/seitz96.pdf,0,0,0

The main idea is to decompose the collection into a set of overlapping sets of photos that can be processed in parallel. and to merge the resulting reconstructions. This overlapping clustering problem is formulated as a constrained optimization and solved iteratively. The merging algorithm. designed to be parallel and out-of-core. incorporates robust filtering steps to eliminate low-quality reconstructions and enforce global visibility constraints.

Optimizing for surface normals within a photoconsistency measure significantly improves the matching results.

The technique works by projecting a pattern of stripes of alternating colors and matching the projected color transitions with observed edges in the image. The correspondence problem is solved using a novel. multi-pass dynamic programming algorithm that eliminates global smoothness assumptions and strict ordering constraints present in previous formulations. The resulting approach is suitable for generating both high-speed scans of moving objects when projecting a single stripe pattern and high-resolution scans of static scenes using a short sequence of time-shifted stripe patterns. In the latter case. space-time analysis is used at each sensor pixel to obtain inter-frame depth localization.

1276508,A roadmap for decomposition: activities. theories. and tools for system design,1999,Derrick Tate,,,,,,Many design theories lack scalability to systems with many elements. They provide guidance to designers about specific facets of a design task but are too cumbersome to apply thoroughly from conceptual to detailed design. Thus the opportunity for rational design is missed. Axiomatic design (AD) seems ideal for directing the design of large systems because it proposes general principles and a recursive design process. AD provides a fundamental basis for understanding decision making during design. It contains representations for the design object (a hierarchy of functional requirements. design parameters. and design matrices) and the design process ( decomposition and zigzagging) combined with rules for decision making (the independence and information axioms). Challenges remain. however. in implementing the theory to large system designs. The challenge addressed in this thesis is decomposition. the activity through which details of the design emerge. In decomposition. FRs satisfied by conceptual DPs are reduced into sets of sub-FRs. This activity is repeated until the design is completely embodied as a physical system of hardware and/ or software. A question asked about decomposition concerns consistency: How can decisions about sub-FRs. and the rest of the decomposed design. be made so that they match the design decisions and representations of the design that were made at higher levels of the design hierarchy? To enable designers to do this. this thesis extends AD by providing a model of the decomposition process that identifies the activities performed and provides guidelines and tools to assist the designers.

Currently there are two types of process models: ones that are so broad that they describe the activities of any designer but provide no assistance. and ones that are so restrictive that they cannot be an accurate description of actual design practice. The challenge is to create a general model from which the designer can structure a specific implementation of the design process. The general model must be flexible to cover all instances of the design process. yet it must contain enough specifics to be useful in guiding the designer.This apparent contradiction was solved by segmenting the design process into generic activities. with explicit relationships between them. from which the designer can structure a unique design process. Moreover. the activities are specific enough to support the designer in selecting design tools and methods for each activity. to identify clearly decision points. and to create a good information infrastructure for the process.

Precollege engineering is especially problematic in STEM reform since there is no well-established tradition of engineering in the K-12 curriculum. This discussion aims at identifying some of the issues and problems that serve to impede implementation of engineering education in the K-12 environment.

Shape memory polymer (SMP) snap-fits were designed and manufactured to actively release upon a thermal trigger. Snap-fits were designed with an added feature known here as a release angle that would allow for an uninterrupted movement for disassembly in the presence of an elevated temperature. SMP snap-fits were then manufactured and tested. Testing was performed for demonstration of the active release of the SMP snap-fits and for analysis of active disassembly (AD) process parameters. Taguchi methods were used to analyze the AD process parameters. including heating method and disassembly temperature. The results from this research show the successful demonstration of the SMP snap-fits …,True,ei5ClRIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652611002393,5391337337579056362,/scholar?cites=5391337337579056362,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48210384/Shape_Memory_Polymer_Snap-Fits_for_Activ20160820-5261-g0chnn.pdf,0,0,0

Despite this potential benefit. our analysis of Horst Rittel's and Donald Schon's design theories and of our own experience has shown that there are the following fundamental obstacles to the effective documentation and use of design rationale: (a) A rationale representation scheme must be found that organizes information according to its relevance to the task at hand; (b) computer support is needed to reduce the burden of recording and using rationale; (c) argumentative and constructive design activities must be linked explicitly by integrated design environments; (d) design rationale must be reusable.

1276521,JANUS: Integrating hypertext with a knowledge-based design environment,1989,Gerhard Fischer and Raymond McCall and Anders Morch,,,,105-117,,Hypertext systems and other complex information stores offer little or no guidance in helping users find information useful for activities they are currently engaged in. Most users are not interested in exploring hypertext information spaces per se but rather in obtaining information to solve problems or accomplish tasks. As a step towards this we have developed the JANUS design environment. JANUS allows designers to construct artifacts in the domain of architectural design and at the same time to be informed about principles of design and the reasoning underlying them. This process integrates two design activities: construction and argumentation. Construction is supported by a knowledge-based graphical design environment and argumentation is supported by a hypertext system.

Critiquing—presenting a reasoned opinion about a user’s product or action–is a major activity of a cooperative problem-solving system. Critics make the constructed artifact “talk back” to the user. Conditions under which critics are more appropriate than autonomous expert systems are discussed. Critics should be embedded in integrated design environments along with other components. such as an argumentative hypertext system. a specification component. and a catalog. Critics support learning as a by-product of problem solving. The major subprocesses of critiquing are goal acquisition. product analysis. critiquing strategies. adaptation capability. explanation and argumentation. and advisory capability.

Much human creativity is social. arising from activities that take place in a context in which interaction with other people and the artifacts that embody collective knowledge are essential contributors.This paper examines: (1) how individual and social creativity can be integrated by means of proper collaboration models and tools supporting distributed cognition; (2) how the creation of shareable externalizations (“boundary objects”) and the adoption of evolutionary process models in the construction of meta-design environments can enhance creativity and support spontaneous design activities (“unselfconscious cultures of design”); and (3) how a new design competence is …,True,VMMZAMwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,428,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581905000479,7923082375047372810,/scholar?cites=7923082375047372810,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50755787/Beyond_Binary_Choices_Integrating_Indivi20161206-22431-91o2ml.pdf,0,0,0

1276533,Heritage and social media: Understanding heritage in a participatory culture,2012,Elisa Giaccardi,,,,,Routledge,Heritage and Social Media explores how social media reframes our understanding and experience of heritage. Through the idea of'participatory culture'the book begins to examine how social media can be brought to bear on the encounter with heritage and on the socially produced meanings and values that individuals and communities ascribe to it. To highlight the specific changes produced by social media. the book is structured around three major themes: Social Practice. New ways of understanding and experiencing heritage are emerging as a result of novel social practices of collection. representation. and communication enabled and promoted by social media. Public Formation. In the presence of widely available social technologies. peer-to-peer activities such as information and media sharing are rapidly gaining momentum. as they increasingly promote and legitimate a participatory culture in which individuals aggregate on the basis of common interests and affinities. Sense of Place. As computing becomes more pervasive and digital networks extend our surroundings. social media and technologies support new ways to engage with the people. interpretations and values that pertain to a specific territorial setting. Heritage and Social Media provides readers with a critical framework to understand how the participatory culture fostered by social media changes the way in which we experience and think of heritage. By introducing readers to how social media are theorized and used. particularly outside the institutional domain. the volume reveals through groundbreaking case studies the emerging heritage practices unique to social media.

The challenge of design is not a matter of getting rid of the emergent. but rather of making it an opportunity for more creative and more sustainable solutions. User-centered and participatory design approaches have focused primarily on activities taking place at design time. These approaches have not given enough emphasis and they have provided few mechanisms to support systems as living entities that can evolve over time. Metadesign is a unique design approach concerned with opening up solution spaces rather than complete solutions (hence the prefix meta-). and aimed at creating social and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place.

1276553,Spatial hypertext: designing for change,1995,Catherine C Marshall and Frank M Shipman III,38,Communications of the ACM,8,88-97,ACM,Spatial hypertext has its origins in browser-based approaches in which the emerging hypertext network is portrayed graphically. in an overview. to promote coherence (see Thüring et al. in this issue); authors and readers interact with the hypertext using a map of its structure. In early conceptions of browser-based hypertext. boxes or other icons symbolized nodes. while lines represented the links among them; hypertext browsers were oriented toward presenting a graph representation of a network. NoteCards [9] and gIBIS [5] are examples of hypertext systems that used such a spatial map. But gIBIS differed from NoteCards in one crucial way: in NoteCards. the browser was used mainly as a means of visualizing existing network structure2; in gIBIS. the browser was the primary means of interacting with the emerging network as well as presenting it.

VIKI supports interpretation of a collected body of materials. a task that becomes increasingly important with the availability of on-line information sources.

It is a practice that has become increasingly common with the advent of “at your fingertips” information resources. To explore the characteristics of information triage and its interaction with spatial hypertext. a medium we claim supports the process. we have studied subjects engaged in a time-constrained decision-making task using a large set of relevant documents.

This paper looks at an approach called “incremental formalization”. when users express information informally and the system supports them in formalizing it. Incremental formalization requires a system architecture that can integrate formal and informal representations and enable and support moving information upward in formality. The system should include tools to capture naturally available informal information and knowledge-based techniques to suggest possible formalizations of this informal information. The Hyper-Object Substrate (HOS). a system with these characteristics. has been applied to a variety of domains. including network design. archeological site analysis and neuroscience education.

Users express categories and interrelationships through the visual similarity and co-location of information objects. The ease of changing a visual property or moving an object makes spatial hypertext better suited to tasks where the information continually evolves. But the implicit nature of the structure poses challenges for tasks in which the authors and readers are not the same set of people. The Visual Knowledge Builder (VKB) includes the ease of expression of earlier spatial hypertexts while adding greater support for long-term collaboration and tasks requiring explicit links.

To some it implies argumentation and frameworks for argumentation. To others it implies the documentation of design. like that required for many types of industrial or government work. Still others describe design rationale as the capture and potential reuse of normal communication about design. These perspectives of design rationale use different representations. which influence their ability to capture and to retrieve and use information. We propose an integrated approach to design rationale where design communication is captured and. over time. incrementally structured into argumentation and other formalisms to enable improved retrieval and use of this information.

The Semantic Web is portrayed as:(1) a universal library. to be readily accessed and used by humans in a variety of information use contexts;(2) the backdrop for the work of computational agents completing sophisticated activities on behalf of their human counterparts; and (3) a method for federating particular knowledge bases and databases to perform anticipated tasks for humans and their agents.

Cham,Our contribution will review. analyze. discuss. and synthesize the research work done over the last 10 years exploring meta-design as a major framework for end-user development (EUD). The overriding perspective of our approach is grounded in the basic assumptions that (1) designers can prompt and support change in a community of practice. but they cannot predetermine it and (2) design and use mutually shape one another in iterative. social processes.

1276575,Embedding critics in design environments,1993,GERRY STAHL and TAMARA SUMNER,8,The knowledge engineering review,4,285-307,,Human understanding in design evolves through a process of critiquing existing knowledge and consequently expanding the store of design knowledge. Critiquing is a dialogue in which the interjection of a reasoned opinion about a product or action triggers further reflection on or changes to the artifact being designed. Our work has focused on applying this successful human critiquing paradigm to human-computer interaction. We argue that computer-based critiquing systems are most effective when they are embedded in domain-oriented design environments. which are knowledge-based computer systems that support designers in specifying a problem and constructing a solution. Embedded critics playa number of important roles in such design environments:(1) they increase the designer's understanding of design situations by pointing out problematic situations early in the design process;(2) they support the integration of problem framing and problem solving by providing a linkage between the design specification and the design construction; and (3) they help designers access relevant information in the large information spaces provided by the design environment.

In the past. this fixity (i.e.. the reliability of texts not to change over space and time) has arisen from the interaction between immutable technologies (used to produce text) and social rigidity (in the structure and practices of discourse communities where texts are produced and consumed). These interactions provided stable settings fostering the gradual development of rich communicative genres which. in turn. further contributed to fixity in communicative acts. In the current era of virtual communities and digital documents. this relationship between technology. social context. and fixity has been loosened.

But this is only a starting point in trying to understand the rich and varied set of information visualizations that have been proposed in recent years. This paper offers a task by data type taxonomy with seven data types (one-. two-. three-dimensional data. temporal and multi-dimensional data. and tree and network data) and seven tasks (overview. zoom. filter. details-on-demand. relate. history. and extracts).Everything points to the conclusion that the phrase ‘the language of art’ is more than a loose metaphor. that even to describe the visible world in images we need a developed system of schemata.Everything points to the conclusion that the phrase ‘the language of art’ is more than a loose metaphor. that even to describe the visible world in images we need a developed system of schemata.E.

The traditional approach to representing tree structures is as a rooted. directed graph with the root node at the top of the page and children nodes below the parent node with lines connecting them (Figure 1). Knuth[21 has a long discussion about this standard representation. especially why the root is at the top. and he offers several alternatives including brief mention of a space-filling approach. However. the remainder of his presentation and most other discussions of trees focus on various node and edge representations. By contrast. this paper deals with a two-dimensional(2-d) space-filling approach in which each node is a rectangle whose area is proportional to some attribute such as node size.Research on relationships between 2-d images and their representation in tree structures has focussed on node and link representations of 2-d images.

1276592,Visual information seeking: Tight coupling of dynamic query filters with starfield displays,2003,Christopher Ahlberg and Ben Shneiderman,,,,7-13,Morgan Kaufmann,This paper offers new principles for visual information seeking (VIS). A key concept is to support browsing. which is distinguished from familiar query composition and information retrieval because of its emphasis on rapid filtering to reduce result sets. progressive refinement of search parameters. continuous reformulation of goals. and visual scanning to identify results. VIS principles developed include: dynamic query filters (query parameters are rapidly adjusted with sliders. buttons. maps. etc.). starfield displays (two-dimensional scatterplots to structure result sets and zooming to reduce clutter). and tight coupling (interrelating query components to preserve display invariants and support progressive refinement combined with an emphasis on using search output to foster search input).

1276594,Engagement theory: A framework for technology-based teaching and learning,1998,Greg Kearsley and Ben Shneiderman,38,Educational technology,5,20-23,Educational Technology Publications. Inc.,Engagement theory has emerged from the authors' experiences teaching in electronic and distance education envirQnments (see Kearsley. 1997; Shneiderman. 1994. 1998; Shneiderman et ai. 1995). The fundamental idea underlying engagement theory is that students must be meaningfully engaged in learning activities through interaction with others and worthwhile tasks. While. in principle. such engagement could occur without the use of technology. we believe that technology can facilitate engagement in ways which are difficult to achieve otherwise. So engagement theory is intended to be a conceptual framework for technology-based learning and teaching. Although not directly derived from other theoretical frameworks for learning. it has much in common with many such frameworks. For example. with its emphasis on meaningful learning. it is very consistent with constructivist approaches.

1276597,Group Cognition: Computer Support for Building Collaborative Knowledge,2006,Gerry Stahl,,,,510,MIT Press,Most researchers would agree that traditional artificial intelligence (AI) is seriously flawed. Some would even say that AI is dead. In this book. Stahl attempts to introduce a paradigm shift in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and cooperative work (CLCW). by introducing a new approach. Here. we do not study the individual processes first. and then try to understand the emergent phenomena in a small group. We do the reverse. We study the group. and try to understand the individual. Thus. we are reading a book that takes us far away from the premises of traditional AI. and makes us rethink our stance on issues in multiple post-AI domains.

1276599,Building collaborative knowing,2004,Gerry Stahl,,,,53-85,Springer Netherlands,This chapter discusses a core phenomenon for a theory of CSCL: building collaborative knowing. Rather than reviewing. one after another. various theories that are currently influential in the field of CSCL (and that are described in other chapters). a view of collaboration is outlined here that synthesises important concepts and approaches from these other sources. It takes some of the abstract concepts proposed by these theories and attempts to unwrap what is bundled up in these concepts by illustrating them with a concrete empirical example of building collaborative knowing. It contributes to a social theory of CSCL by unpacking central concepts and by using them to understand the process by which a small group collaboratively builds new knowing.

1276600,Studying Virtual Math Teams,2009,Gerry Stahl,11,,,626,Springer Verlag,Studying Virtual Math Teams centers on detailed empirical studies of how students in small online groups make sense of math issues and how they solve problems by making meaning together. These studies are woven together with materials that describe the online environment and pedagogical orientation. as well as reflections on the theoretical implications of the findings in the studies. The nature of group cognition and shared meaning making in collaborative learning is a foundational research issue in CSCL. More generally. the theme of sense making is a central topic in information science. While many authors allude to these topics. few have provided this kind of detailed analysis of the mechanisms of intersubjective meaning making. This book presents a coherent research agenda that has been pursued by the author and his research group. The book opens with descriptions of the project and its methodology. as well as situating this research in the past and present context of the CSCL research field. The core research team then presents five concrete analyses of group interactions in different phases of the Virtual Math Teams research project. These chapters are followed by several studies by international collaborators. discussing the group discourse. the software affordances and alternative representations of the interaction. all using data from the VMT project.

Socio‐cultural theories have been imported from cognate fields to suggest that cognition and learning take place at the level of groups and communities as well as individuals. Various positions on this issue have been proposed and a number of theoretical perspectives have been recommended. In particular. the concept of common ground has been developed to explain how meanings and understandings can be shared by multiple individuals.

1276602,Contributions to a theoretical framework for CSCL,2002,Gerry Stahl,,,,,International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS),Looking at computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) in terms of (a) collaborative knowledge building.(b) group and individual perspectives.(c) mediation by artifacts and (d) micro-analysis of conversation provides a rich. multidimensional starting point for conceptualizing and studying a specific variant of CSCL.These four contributions to CSCL are inter-related. The notion of collaborative knowledge building defines a useful paradigm for conceptualizing learning as social practice. The social interactions and knowledge management activities in which shared knowledge is constructed can be analyzed as the result of interweaving group and personal conversational perspectives. In general. collaborative interaction is mediated by artifacts: sometimes only by transitory artifacts like spoken words or gestures. but increasingly by physical or digital artifacts and media. Empirical studies of collaborative knowledge building employing micro-ethnographic analysis of speech. gesture. artifacts and media can make the details of these collaboration interactions visible. highlighting the interplay of perspectives and artifacts in the trans-personal construction of knowledge.,True,P3igc9gAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,269,https://repository.isls.org/bitstream/1/3878/1/62-71.pdf,13205660946690216692,/scholar?cites=13205660946690216692,,,https://repository.isls.org/bitstream/1/3878/1/62-71.pdf,0,0,0

1276603,Embedding critics in design environments,1993,GERRY STAHL and TAMARA SUMNER,8,The knowledge engineering review,4,285-307,,Human understanding in design evolves through a process of critiquing existing knowledge and consequently expanding the store of design knowledge. Critiquing is a dialogue in which the interjection of a reasoned opinion about a product or action triggers further reflection on or changes to the artifact being designed. Our work has focused on applying this successful human critiquing paradigm to human-computer interaction. We argue that computer-based critiquing systems are most effective when they are embedded in domain-oriented design environments. which are knowledge-based computer systems that support designers in specifying a problem and constructing a solution. Embedded critics playa number of important roles in such design environments:(1) they increase the designer's understanding of design situations by pointing out problematic situations early in the design process;(2) they support the integration of problem framing and problem solving by providing a linkage between the design specification and the design construction; and (3) they help designers access relevant information in the large information spaces provided by the design environment.

1276606,Rediscovering CSCL,2002,Gerry Stahl,,,,169-181,LEA,In their penultimate sentence. Hakkarainen. Lipponen. and Järvelä (this volume) correctly point out that CSCL researchers have a complex challenge because the educational use of new information/communication technologies is inextricably bound up with new pedagogical and cognitive practices of learning and instruction. The naïve. technology-driven view was that tools such as CSILE would make a significant difference on their own. The subsequent experience has been that the classroom culture bends such tools to its own interests and that this culture must be transformed before new media can mediate learning the way we had hoped they would. So CSCL research has necessarily and properly shifted from the affordances and effects of the technology to concerns with the instructional context. Thus. the central conclusions of Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the teacher’s role and say little that pertains to the presence of CSILE. The two chapters have a similar structure: First they discuss abstract pedagogical issues from the educational or scientific research literature (eg. the learner-as-thinker or the scientist-as-questioner paradigm). Then they present a statistical analysis of the notes in specific CSILE databases. Finally. they conclude that certain kinds of learning took place. However. in both cases. one could imagine that the same learning might have taken place in these particular studied classrooms with their particular teacher guidance. without any computer support and without any collaboration!

In this paper. we argue for an expanded role for this concept of levels in science education. We show confusion of levels (and ""slippage"" between levels) as the source of many of people's deep misunderstandings about patterns and phenomena in the world.

The mean Pareto exponent for a sample of 44 countries is 1.136. somewhat greater than the exponent of one implied by the rank-size rule. We find that value of the Pareto exponent is quite sensitive to the definition of the city and the choice of city sample size. The significance of non-linear terms in variants of the Pareto distribution also indicate that the rank-size rule is only a first approximation to a complete characterization of the size distribution of cities within a country. The relatively low correlation between primacy and Pareto measures confirms the need for a variety of measures of city size distributions. This paper also suggests that large cities are growing faster than small cities in most of the countries in our sample.

This requires the representation of those parts of knowledge which cannot be stated definitely and have to be modelled vaguely. The presented modelling concepts allow the extension of existing graphical and textual modelling methods to model facts without making unnecessary and unwelcome commitments about not already completed knowledge. In the same way. it also allows the modelling of facts which cannot be modelled completely. like aspects of social systems comprising of cooperation and communication. A special modelling notation (SeeMe) is used to present the concepts. A systematic differentiation of vagueness shows the alternative ways for modellers to express vague facts.

We found that SeeMe can help people to become aware of the specific features and requirements of ‘their’ socio-technical system and therefore enables them to take part in processes of learning and improvement.,True,oB2SRwsAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC,111,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290310001644840,14593579837120878344,/scholar?cites=14593579837120878344,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kai-Uwe_Loser/publication/220208782_A_modelling_method_for_the_development_of_groupware_applications_as_socio-technical_systems/links/0912f50a27205b8697000000.pdf,0,0,0

1276621,Semistructured Models are Surprisingly Useful for User-Centered Design.,2000,Thomas Herrmann and Marcel Hoffmann and Kai-Uwe Loser and Klaus Moysich,,,,159-174,,Diagrammatic representations are commonly accepted as valuable tools in requirements engineering and systems design. However. the most prominent techniques. are not sufficient for requirements negotiation with users because they focus on the design of technical systems. In user-centered design of socio-technical systems there is a strong demand for models which integrate different viewpoints. We believe that appropriate semi-formal diagramming techniques can facilitate the negotiation of the design. especially when they are combined with additional representations. Therefore we have designed a notation that supports the generation of integrated models of organizational. social. and technical structures. eg business processes. social relations and dependencies among protagonists. resources. work-objects. and software functionality. SeeMe. the diagramming-technique for modeling semistructured socio-technical systems moreover provides special concepts for the representation of vagueness. incompleteness. and contradictions that are inherent to user requirements. In this paper we present a first evaluation of the SeeMe-diagramming technique. The results are drawn from four different case-studies.

A method that supports knowledge integration in the course of introduction and development of socio‐technical systems is the Socio‐technical Walkthrough (STWT). The paper describes the characteristics of the STWT method and the potential to support knowledge integration.The theoretical approach of the STWT is closely related to the notion of socio‐technical systems. Starting with the historical development of this term. the authors saw the necessity to adopt elements of newer system theory so as to achieve a better understanding of the conditions under which a social system and a technical system can be integrated.

1276624,The role concept as a basis for designing community systems.,2004,Thomas Herrmann and Isa Jahnke and Kai-Uwe Loser,,,,163-178,,This paper describes the sociological concept of roles as a basis for designing computer-supported community systems (CSCS). The goal is the systematic analysis of roles and role-development from a sociological point of view to enhance socio-technical community-systems. In system theory social structures are expectational structures and roles identify these expectations [22]. Roles explain how actors interact. collaborate and work together to cultivate knowledge exchange. The role concept in social science assumes that people interact with respect to their social roles and take certain roles as a basis for their social interaction and communication. Persons’ activities and interaction is shaped by roles and vice versa. In contrast. the role concept of computer science focuses on the management of access rights and access control models. and should be clearly differentiated from the sociological understanding. This paper presents the sociological perspective of the term “role” and explores it in more detail. Then. we present an explorative study of role-development in a web-based learning environment. We conclude by giving examples and making proposals for the technical support of roles. We pay special attention to role-taking. role-making. assigning roles. defining roles and changing roles.,True,oB2SRwsAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,85,https://www.academia.edu/download/45497122/HeJL04-RCa.pdf,5362067162676049680,/scholar?cites=5362067162676049680,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45497122/HeJL04-RCa.pdf,0,0,0

1276625,Systems design with the socio-technical walkthrough,2009,Thomas Herrmann,,,,336-351,IGI Global,Socio-technical systems integrate technical and organizational structures and are related to various stakeholders and their perspectives. The design of socio-technical systems has to support this integration and to take the differing perspectives into account. To support this goal. the design concepts have to be represented with appropriate documentation methods. which combine formal and informal aspects. Communication processes have to be facilitated which systematically refer to these kinds of documentation. Therefore a socio-technical. semi-structured modeling method (SeeMe) is introduced. It represents socio-technical concepts with diagrams which can be developed. evaluated and improved by the socio-technical walkthrough (STWT).

Computer support for perspectives allows people to view and work in a central information repository within personal contexts. However. work in personal perspectives encourages divergent thinking. Negotiation in group perspectives is needed to converge on consensus. shared understanding. and cooperation. Negotiation processes on their own can delay progress. By intertwining perspective and negotiation mechanisms. individual results can be systematically merged into a group product while work continues. Personal perspectives on shared information are thereby intertwined and merged into a shared group understanding.

In the case of those systems. adaptations which are initiated by individuals also affect other users in most cases. Therefore. a process of negotiation is required. A design principle called negotiability should be introduced. It helps users affected by adaptations to comment on them or to reject. accept or modify them.

Organization. and Ar chitecture. held in Darmstadt. Germany. on February 25–26. 1998. The idea for this workshop and actually the term “cooperative building” was created during the activi ties of initiating the consortium “Workspaces of the Future” for conducting an inter disciplinary R&D program in cooperation with partners from industry. We discovered that there was no appropriate forum to present research at the intersection of informa tion technology. organizational innovation. and architecture. The theme “Integrating information. organization. and architecture” reflects the challenges resulting from current and future developments in these three areas. In the future. work and cooperation in organizations will be characterized by a degree of dynamics. flexibility. and mobility that will go far beyond many of today's develop ments and examples. The introduction of information and communication technology has already changed processes and contents of work significantly. However. the de sign of work environments. especially physical work spaces as offices and buildings. remained almost unchanged. It is time to reflect these developments in the design of equally dynamic. flexible. and mobile work environments.

1276638,Incremental maintenance of materialized views,1997,Mukesh Mohania and Shin'ichi Konomi and Yahiko Kambayashi,,,,551-560,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Materialized views are important in databases. particularly in data warehouses. where they are used to speed up query processing on large amounts of data. These views need to be maintained incrementally in response to database updates. In this paper we investigate the problem of incremental maintenance of a materialized view in response to changes to the base data. We show that a materialized view can be maintained without accessing the view itself by materializing additional relations. We firstly give an algorithm for determining what additional relations need to be materialize in order to maintain a view incrementally. We then propose an algorithm for updating the materialized view (and the additional relations) based on the optimized operator tree used for evaluating the view as a query. A materialized view is updated by propagating updates to the nodes of its operator tree in a bottom-up fashion …,True,I_IUH2EAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,44,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0022063,5648221986123165282,/scholar?cites=5648221986123165282,,,,0,0,0

The current implementation of the Passage mechanism utilizes electronic scales and contact-free identification devices and thus allows for identification of arbitrary physical objects as well as immediate and unique identification of certain dedicated physical objects.

1276656,Time-constrained keyframe selection technique,2000,Andreas Girgensohn and John Boreczky,11,Multimedia Tools and Applications,3,347-358,Kluwer Academic Publishers,In accessing large collections of digitized videos. it is often difficult to find both the appropriate video file and the portion of the video that is of interest. This paper describes a novel technique for determining keyframes that are different from each other and provide a good representation of the whole video. We use keyframes to distinguish videos from each other. to summarize videos. and to provide access points into them. The technique can determine any number of keyframes by clustering the frames in a video and by selecting a representative frame from each cluster. Temporal constraints are used to filter out some clusters and to determine the representative frame for a cluster. Desirable visual features can be emphasized in the set of keyframes.

1276657,Methods and apparatuses for interactive similarity searching. retrieval. and browsing of video,2004,Jonathan T Foote and Andreas Girgensohn and Lynn Wilcox,,,,,,Method for interactive selecting video consisting of training images from a video for a video similarity search and for displaying the results of the similarity search are disclosed. The user selects a time interval in the video as a query definition of training images for training an image class statistical model. Time intervals can be as short as one frame or consist of disjoint segments or shots. A statistical model of the image class defined by the training images is calculated on-the-fly from feature vectors extracted from transforms of the training images. For each frame in the video. a feature vector is extracted from the transform of the frame. and a similarity measure is calculated using the feature vector and the image class statistical model. The similarity measure is derived from the likelihood of a Gaussian model producing the frame. The similarity is then presented graphically. which allows the time structure of the video to …,True,Dz6O99EAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,235,https://patents.google.com/patent/US6774917B1/en,5469683425306991179,/scholar?cites=5469683425306991179,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/40/31/2d/43e7651bfcfe84/US6774917.pdf,0,0,0

In several work organizations. end users need to tailor their software systems to better adapt them to their requirements and even to create or modify software artifacts. These are end-user development activities and are the focus of this paper. A model of the interaction between users and systems. which also takes into account their reciprocal coevolution during system usage. is discussed. This model is used to define a methodology aimed at designing software environments that allow end users to become designers of their own tools.

The strategy to identify and reduce these hurdles is developed in the framework of a methodology based on a recently introduced model of HCI. and exploits the technological innovations of XML (Extensible Markup Language). HCI is modelled as a cyclic process in which the user and the interactive system communicate by materializing and interpreting a sequence of messages. The interaction process is formalized by specifying both the physical message appearance and the computational aspect of the interaction. This formalization allows the adoption of notation traditionally adopted by users in their workplaces as the starting point of the interactive system design.

Figure 1 provides an overview of the three main activities compared to the participants (artists and technologists). while Figure 2 depicts the assistant. full partnership. and partnership models respectively. Strong involvement. influence. and leadership by a collaborator are indicated by shaded areas [5]. The assistant model is the one most commonly observed in a commercial creative team setting. where collaborators assume the responsibility for different phases of the project. and often even join the project for a brief time and leave after fulfilling their parts. This model is sometimes referred to as a conveyer model.

1276679,The creative process where the artist is amplified or superseded by the computer,1973,Stroud Cornock and Ernest Edmonds,,Leonardo,,11-16,Pergamon Press,The advent of computing stimulates a desire to re-examine the subject of creativity. Though the computer can replace man in the production of graphic images. its function in the arts is seen as assisting in the specification of art systems and in their subsequent real-time management. An art of system or process is placed in the context of primarily the visual or plastic arts but the authors disavow concern with any'new'or'modern technological'art. Various types of art systems are mentioned and advantages of the fully interactive one are considered. It is pointed out that the inclusion of complex real-time responses in an interactive art system can frequently make use of a computer. In such work. the artist and the viewer play an integral part. The traditional role of the artist. composer or writer is thus called into question; it may no longer be necessary to assume that he is a specialist in art-rather he is a catalyst of creative …,True,PaJGmKYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,164,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1572419,12043006269500054053,/scholar?cites=12043006269500054053,,,,0,0,0
