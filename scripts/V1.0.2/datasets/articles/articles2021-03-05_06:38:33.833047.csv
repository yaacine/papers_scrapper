1126425,Aromaticity and ring currents,2001,JANF Gomes and RB Mallion,101,,5,1349-1384,American Chemical Society,Accepting a commission to review progress in the subject embodied in our title is. perhaps. to take up something of a ‘poisoned chalice’. One of us. contributing on this same topic more than 20 years ago at the 1979 International Symposium on Aromaticity in Dubrovnik. wrote1 “A cynic would say that there are actually only two difficulties in discussing the subject of ‘aromaticity’and ‘ring currents’ sdeciding what is meant by ‘ring current’. and assigning a meaning to the term ‘aromaticity’!” That comment. though ostensibly facetious. had serious intent: it did encapsulate. with only a modicum of exaggeration. the problems that inherently beset any assessment such as the one attempted at Dubrovnik1 and in the present review. At the heart of the matter lies the undeniable fact that neither ring currents nor aromaticity are physical observables.Nevertheless. the intervening period has seen the ring-current idea. at least …,True,h6ZE_AwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,586,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr990323h,4716839807988492212,/scholar?cites=4716839807988492212,,"https://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/jfgomes/documentos/ArtigosPDF/ChemRev,%20101,%201349-83(2001).pdf",0,0,0

Formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers BV,For many years. the ISI Web of Knowledge from Thomson Reuters was the sole publication and citation database covering all  areas of science thus becoming an invaluable tool in bibliometric analysis. In 2004. Elsevier introduced Scopus and this is  rapidly becoming a good alternative. Several attempts have been made at comparing these two instruments from the point of  view of journal coverage for research or for bibliometric assessment of research output.    This paper attempts to answer the question that all researchers ask. i.e.. what is to be gained by searching both databases?  Or. if you are forced to opt for one of them. which should you prefer? To answer this question. a detailed paper by paper  study is presented of the coverage achieved by ISI Web of Science and by Scopus of the output of a typical university.

There are many institutions that use bibliometric indicators to steer research policy and for hiring or promotion decisions. Given the importance that counting citations has today. the aim of the work presented here is to show how citations are distributed within a scientific area and determine the dependence of the citation count on the article features. All articles referenced in the Web of Science in 2004 for Biology & Biochemistry. Chemistry.

The B3LYP method has been used to introduce a correlation effect into this type of calculation. Since this is a relatively new technique. its performance in conjunction with different basis sets has been tested using the Cu-H2O system as a test case. These tests were performed to select the basis sets for water and metal atoms to be used in studies on the water—metal cluster interaction. Additionally. a set of B3LYP calculations for the Cun-H2O (n = 2. 4. 5. 9. 12) systems has been performed to investigate the influence of the metal cluster size on the results.

At the (100) surface. modeled in the present work by the M12 cluster. all halide ions have been found to adsorb preferentially at the hollow site. followed by the bridge and by the top positions. The adsorption energy has been found to decrease when going from fluoride to iodide in both atom—ion and cluster—ion cases. The opposite trend is observed for the estimates of the charge transfer from the ions to the surface. When different metals are compared. the M12—X− interaction energies decrease in the order Au > Ag > Cu. but for the smaller ions some deviations from this line do appear.

All materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy.In the presence of isopentyl nitrite. the extent of functionalization was high and nearly independent on the amount of isopentyl nitrite and on the aniline substituents (R = F.

Adsorption energies. geometries and charges for methanol and the various intermediates were computed from geometry optimized calculations on a large cluster containing 22 copper atoms used to model the Cu(1 1 1) surface. The calculated parameters are reported for the most stable adsorption modes of the various species considered: CH3OH. CH3O. H2CO. H2CO2. HCO2. H and O. The results obtained are in good agreement with available experimental data. The adsorption energies obtained were then used to plot the energy variation along the decomposition of methanol.

It was found that HPT2 forms a bilayer structure at the interface. pointing its polar heads into the aqueous phase. Water molecules penetrate the hydrophilic head-group region but not the hydrophobic core. At the hydrophilic region water molecules establish hydrogen bonds with the ketone oxygen of the HPT2 molecule. Behind that zone. the water molecules show a preference in keeping their dipoles in the interfacial plane and these orientations remain in two or three molecular layers. The water dipole distribution is slightly asymmetric. having an average excess in the resulting component normal to the interfacial plane.

Additionally. the results of a test for the Cu5I− cluster are presented. The good quality of the DFT methods is recorded as they give results comparable to the MP2 and. for some cases. even to the MP4 level of standard calculations.

A detailed study of the properties of the first interface was already reported (J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999. in press). The iso-octane liquid is a hydrophobic analog of the very hydrophilic 2-heptanone. and the properties of the H2O/iso-octane interface are analyzed here and compared with the ones obtained for the H2O/2-heptanone system. It is shown that the basic features characterizing the interface structure (such as the non-existence of a mixed solvent region or the broadening of the sharp interface by capillary waves) are almost unaffected by the change of the hydrophilic nature of the organic solvent. A new method is proposed to calculate more accurately properties which depend on the distance to the interface.

The concepts developed here provide a very useful instrument for the description of the vector field of the magnetically induced currents and should be very helpful for the understanding of the contributions that different regions of a molecule give to its magnetic properties. The ingredients for this topological analysis are (1) the symmetry properties of the electronic Hamiltonian in the presence of the magnetic field and (2) the nature of certain singular points. Two categories of singular points are considered: (i) Nodal vortices which have associated a circulation around a nodal line and may be of the axial or toroidal types as previously considered by Hirschfelder; (ii) Stagnation points where the current vanishes without the vanishing of the charge density.

The analysis is general. applying both to the many-electron current density and to its one electron (orbital) components. The singular lines of the vector field form a stagnation graph which is the skeleton of the qualitative theory presented here. This graph may be disconnected. with one connected part playing a leading role in the description. Other secondary connected parts are encased into topologically spherical separatrices defined by two isolated singular points. This is one of the types of separatrices which are introduced here.

The results of simulations with conventional ab initio pair potentials. with and without three‐body induction corrections. are also presented.

Previous experimental studies indicate that the former reaction occurs with CH bond cleavage without the interference of other co-adsorbed species on the metal surface. However. it has been observed in theoretical works that tilting of the methoxy CO axis has a marked destabilization effect on the methoxy adsorption energy. This tilting of the methoxy CO axis is important in the decomposition reaction since it allows one of the methyl hydrogens to approach the surface. From the results reported in the present paper. we can predict a lower energy barrier for this reaction when hydroxy species are adsorbed on the surface. These findings also indicate that defects such …,True,h6ZE_AwAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,38,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039602899010274,7377131401128714265,/scholar?cites=7377131401128714265,,,0,0,0

The primary objective of the field study was to investigate the evolution of secondary organic and black carbon aerosols and their climate-related properties in the Sacramento urban plume as it was routinely transported into the forested Sierra Nevada foothills area. Urban aerosols and trace gases experienced significant physical and chemical transformations as they mixed with the reactive biogenic hydrocarbons emitted from the forest. Two heavily-instrumented ground sites – one within the Sacramento urban area and another about 40 km to the northeast in the foothills area – were set up to characterize the evolution of meteorological variables. trace gases. aerosol precursors. aerosol size. composition. and climate-related properties in freshly polluted and ""aged"" urban air.

Haze brings trouble to many computer vision/graphics applications as it diminishes the visibility of the scene. Haze is formed due to the two fundamental phenomena that are attenuation and the air light. Attenuation reduces the contrast and air light increases the whiteness in the scene. Haze removal techniques recover the color and contrast of the scene. These techniques are widely used in many applications such as outdoor surveillance. object detection. consumer electronics etc. The overall objective of this paper is to explore the various methods for efficiently removing the haze from digital images.

The Stokes signal is conventionally used for normalization since its scattering cross-section is a weaker function of temperature than that of the anti-Stokes signal. The potential of this temperature dependence of the Stokes signal to introduce errors in measurements has received only cursory mention in the literature. We show that this effect degrades the temperature accuracy by as much as 90%. Additionally the heavy fiber attenuation at the operating wavelength also makes calibration non-trivial. The technique described implements a corrective mechanism for this temperature dependence. offers the additional benefit of self-referencing of a heated curve rather than referencing to the fiber at room temperature. and demonstrates the viability of …,True,DDI_UyYAAAAJ:T_0gP6tLVL0C,18,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030401807001964,4229363204385508614,/scholar?cites=4229363204385508614,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manoj_Saxena4/publication/243218022_Compensation_for_temperature_dependence_of_Stokes_signal_and_dynamic_self-calibration_of_a_Raman_distributed_temperature_sensor/links/5c08ea22299bf139c7422456/Compensation-for-temperature-dependence-of-Stokes-signal-and-dynamic-self-calibration-of-a-Raman-distributed-temperature-sensor.pdf,0,0,0

Presently. the only magnetic resonance (MR) method available to study glycogen metabolism in vivo is 13C MR spectroscopy. but this technology is not routinely available on standard clinical scanners. Here. we show that glycogen can be detected indirectly through the water signal by using selective radio frequency (RF) saturation of the hydroxyl protons in the 0.5- to 1.5-ppm frequency range downfield from water. The resulting saturated spins are rapidly transferred to water protons via chemical exchange. leading to partial saturation of the water signal. a process now known as chemical exchange saturation transfer.

The lanthanide tetraamide derivatives of DOTA have shown considerable promise as PARACEST agents. taking advantage of the slow water exchange kinetics of this class of complex. We postulated that water exchange in these tetraamide complexes could be slowed even further by introducing a group to sterically encumber the space above the water coordination site. thereby hindering the departure and approach of water molecules to the complex. The ligand 8O2-bridged DOTAM was synthesized in a 34% yield from cyclen. It was found that the lanthanide complexes of this ligand did not possess a water molecule in the inner coordination sphere of the bound lanthanide.

Despite the clinical potential of the method. it is currently not widely used for diagnosis or for follow-up of treatment. While it is possible to perform acceptable 13C MRS at lower fields. the low natural abundance of 13C and the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of 13C MRS makes it desirable to utilize the advantage of increased signal strength offered by ultra-high fields for more accurate measurements. Concomitant with this advantage. however. ultra-high fields present unique technical challenges that need to be addressed when studying glycogen. In particular. the question of measurement reproducibility needs to be answered so as to give investigators insight into meaningful inter-subject glycogen differences. We measured muscle glycogen levels in vivo in the calf muscle in three patients with McArdle disease (MD). one patient with phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD) and four healthy controls by performing 13C MRS at 7T.

Unlike their synthetic counterparts. these crystals do not have well-developed cleavage and are consequently much more resistant to fracture. This phenomenon is due in part to the presence of acidic glycoproteins occluded within the crystals. By means of x-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. it is shown that the presence of the protein in synthetic calcite only slightly decreases the coherence length but significantly increases the angular spread of perfect domains of the crystals. In biogenic calcite. the coherence length is 1/3 to 1/4 as much as that in synthetic calcite and the angular spread is 20 to 50 times as wide.

GISAXS spectra at low subcritical incidence angles. indicative of a few nanometers thick surface region. showed that in vapor Nafion micelles at the surface tend to align parallel to the surface. while under water they are preferentially oriented normal to the surface. in agreement with previously proposed structural picture and with AFM and contact angle results. However. spectra at near-critical incidence angles representing the bulk of the films indicate the micelles preferentially align normal to the surface. regardless of the external phase. This observation is in contrast with previous studies that employed hydrophilic native Si substrates. in which the observed micelle orientation was parallel to the surface.

In vitro studies in which carboxylate-. carbonate-and phosphate-containing crystals are grown in the presence of partially purified acidic glycoproteins from these two tissues show that some of these macro-molecules are able to interact specifically with certain crystal faces. Significantly all the affected crystal faces contain a common stereochemical motif. Interesting differences. however. were observed in the modes of interaction between the mollusk and sea urchin derived acidic glycoproteins. Only the former can induce oriented calcite nucleation in vitro and only the latter can interact from solution with specific calcite crystal faces. These differences are ascribed in part to the fact that the mollusk macromolecules are much more acidic than those from the sea urchin. Some of the acidic glycoproteins are also occluded inside the growing crystals. In the case of the sea urchin. and not of the mollusk. the proteins are preferentially located at specific crystal planes and their presence influences the mechanical properties of the crystal. A detailed study of these composite crystals by X-ray synchrotron radiation shows how the presence of the protein influences the crystal mosaicity.

A hard and soft metal classification along with associated ligand groups (carboxyl. phenolic. amino. sulfidic) are used as a basis to predict metal speciation in the presence of aqueous organic matter. Compilation of conditional metal formation constants (log K′) are made for each ligand type using model ligands. Model ligands were chosen to reflect those found in NOM and bio-organic media.

Fluorescence surfaces were observed at pH 4.36 and deconvoluted using SIMPLISMA (Windig and Guilment 1991). There were a total of seven different fluorophores observed for these samples and each sampling site had between four and six of the fluorescent components. These components were observed to bind Al during titrations at the same pH. Multiresponse titration curves were fit using the method of Smith and Kramer (1998) and most of the binding strengths are similar to values for Suwannee River fulvic acid (logK' between 4.8 and 5.5). but there are strong sites (logK' = 7) and weak sites (logK' between 3 and 4) also observed.

The NOM was isolated using both reverse osmosis and low-pressure low-temperature evaporation for each sample site. These samples were titrated from −log[H+] 3 to 11 at 0.1 unit intervals. The data were analyzed using the Discrete Site Analysis (DISI) technique for pKa intervals of 0.2.

Acid−base titration data are fit to a continuous binding site model for the system represented as a pKa spectrum.

In this study we present a method which allows to estimate the PDI of linear polymers from a simple diffusion experiment.The approach is based on the differential diffusion profile observed for the main polymer chain signal versus the extremity signal. From this difference. a statistical analysis of the DOSY spectrum allows the PDI to be estimated accurately. to the condition that the Flory coefficient of the polymer chain is known. Alternatively. the mass average molar mass Mw and the number average molar mass Mn can be extracted separately from the same spectrum.Results on PEO mixes reveal that. using this new method. PDI can be estimated with a very good accuracy. This method can easily be applied to almost any kind of linear polymers.,True,HHoFyUUAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,81,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090780711002072,6204881707202199720,/scholar?cites=6204881707202199720,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justine_Vieville/publication/273661066_Polydispersity_index_of_polymers_revealed_by_DOSY_NMR/links/55082b220cf2d7a2812755fe/Polydispersity-index-of-polymers-revealed-by-DOSY-NMR.pdf,0,0,0
1126641,The use of sample rotation for minimizing convection effects in self-diffusion NMR measurements,2001,Nuria Esturau and Francesc Sánchez-Ferrando and José Adrián Gavin and Christian Roumestand and Marc-André Delsuc and Teodor Parella,153,Journal of Magnetic Resonance,1,48-55,Academic Press,Undesirable temperature gradients in a NMR sample tube are usually generated by an inappropiate temperature regulation system. We have shown that such convection effects can greatly distort the measurement of translational self-diffusion coefficients. The use of sample spinning helps to minimize such undesirable effects by disruption of convection fluxes due to resulting Coriolis forces that have a strongly stabilizing effect on the conducting state of the system (J. Lounila et al.. J. Magn. Reson. A118. 50 (1996)). This simple trick allows the accurate measurement of diffusion coefficients for a wide range of temperatures and solvents without the need for a convection-compensated NMR pulse sequences or more sophisticated temperature control units.

Several methods have recently been proposed to obviate certain drawbacks inherent to the Fourier transform approach (eg. poor resolution for strongly damped or truncated data. or spectral side lobes due to windowing or apodization processes). The most popular techniques developed thus far are based on either the maximum entropy principle (MEM) or the linear prediction approach (LP). MEM techniques (Z-7). maximizing the entropy of the spectrum. are claimed to be capable of enhancing resolution while simultaneously suppressing noise.

Some titania samples exhibited an induction period prior to the onset of nitrate removal and the size of the titania particles was found to influence the photocatalytic performance.

1126789,Alternative solvents for green chemistry,2013,Francesca M Kerton and Ray Marriott,,,20,,Royal Society of chemistry,Everyone is becoming more environmentally conscious and therefore. chemical processes are being developed with their environmental burden in mind. This also means that more traditional chemical methods are being replaced with new innovations and this includes new solvents. Solvents are everywhere. but how necessary are they? They are used in most areas including synthetic chemistry. analytical chemistry. pharmaceutical production and processing. the food and flavour industry and the materials and coatings sectors. However. the principles of green chemistry guide us to use less of them. or to use safer. more environmentally friendly solvents if they are essential. Therefore. we should always ask ourselves. do we really need a solvent? Green chemistry. as a relatively new sub-discipline. is a rapidly growing field of research. Alternative solvents-including supercritical fluids and room temperature ionic liquids-form a significant portion of research in green chemistry. This is in part due to the hazards of many conventional solvents (eg toxicity and flammability) and the significant contribution that solvents make to the waste generated in many chemical processes. Solvents are important in analytical chemistry. product purification. extraction and separation technologies. and also in the modification of materials. Therefore. in order to make chemistry more sustainable in these fields. a knowledge of alternative. greener solvents is important.

Such catalytic systems have previously been used extensively in alcohol oxidation reactions. The same catalyst system was also used for oxidative cross-couplings of benzylamines with anilines. The electronic and steric properties of the aniline partner were found to be of crucial importance in determining reactivity or lack thereof. A mechanism for these reactions is proposed based on the data obtained to date. In the absence of benzyl amines. electron-rich anilines were found to undergo dehydrogenative coupling and yields of the resulting azo products could be increased by replacing CuBr2 with CuBr.

Electron density distributions. orbital energies. and expectation values of rn obtained with different methods are compared with the ones resulting from the Schrödinger and Dirac equations. The most accurate are found to be the equations of Wood and Boring and of Barthelat. Pelissier. and Durand. (They reproduce almost exactly the Dirac electron densities and expectation values.) The simplest. though least accurate. equation is proposed by us. It gives the relativistic energy corrections with about 6% accuracy and retains exactly the form of the nonrelativistic Schródinger equation. Consequently. its application in analytical SCF‐CI calculations does not require any additional integral calculation.,True,oXFPX0sAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,38,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qua.560280609,13585708488754793668,/scholar?cites=13585708488754793668,,,0,0,0

The transfer of ubiquitin to substrate is a multistep process. Cdc4p is a component of a ubiquitin ligase that tethers the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p to its substrates. Among the domains of Cdc4p that are crucial for function are the F-box. which links Cdc4p to Cdc53p through Skp1p. and the WD-40 repeats. which are required for binding the substrate for Cdc34p. In addition to Cdc4p. other F-box proteins. including Grr1p and Met30p. may similarly act together with Cdc53p and Skp1p to function as ubiquitin ligase complexes. Because the relative abundance of these complexes. known collectively as SCFs. is important for cell viability. we have sought evidence of mechanisms that modulate F-box protein regulation.

An evaluation of the static and dynamic properties of the PTX−tubulin complex shows that small 6−12° variations in calculated torsions and a justifiable increase of the REDOR distance error to ≥±0.7 Å readily resolves key discrepancies around T-Taxol's service as the bioactive conformation.

Four main chapters are devoted to individuals. interpersonal relationships. group dynamics. and organisational contexts. The fifth chapter is a case study of the'turn round'of a workplace in which bullying was rife. There are three recurring themes: recognition. loss. and space.

This paper presents a scientific workflow based approach to facilitate the inside-out enzyme design process in the Grid execution environment by providing features such as resource consolidation. task parallelism. provenance tracking. fault tolerance and workflow reuse. which results in an automated. pipelined. efficient. extensible. stable. and easy-to-use computational process for enzyme design.,True,p7av1-4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050910001328,745881624707543572,/scholar?cites=745881624707543572,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050910001328/pdf?md5=d1ac61a6b14718734a68ef1534691e3a&pid=1-s2.0-S1877050910001328-main.pdf,0,0,0

1126856,Strategy for extending half-life in drug design and its significance,2018,Hakan Gunaydin and Michael D Altman and J Michael Ellis and Peter Fuller and Scott A Johnson and Brian Lahue and Blair Lapointe,9,ACS medicinal chemistry letters,6,528-533,American Chemical Society,Preclinical optimization of compounds toward viable drug candidates requires an integrated understanding of properties that impact predictions of the clinically efficacious dose. The importance of optimizing half-life. unbound clearance. and potency and how they impact dose predictions are discussed in this letter. Modest half-life improvements for short half-life compounds can dramatically lower the efficacious dose. The relationship between dose and half-life is nonlinear when unbound clearance is kept constant. whereas the relationship between dose and unbound clearance is linear when half-life is kept constant. Due to this difference. we show that dose is more sensitive to changes in half-life than changes in unbound clearance when half-lives are shorter than 2 h. Through matched molecular pair analyses. we also show that the strategic introduction of halogens is likely to increase half-life and lower …,True,p7av1-4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,11,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00018,6488193821898034749,/scholar?cites=6488193821898034749,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004573/,0,0,0

The usual way of performing this task is to measure the full Mueller matrix and discard the unused elements. For polarimeter designs with speed. miniaturization. or other constraints it may be desirable to have a system with reduced dimensionality that measures only the important elements of the Mueller matrix as efficiently as possible. In this paper. we develop a framework that allows partial MMPs to be analyzed. Quantitative metrics are developed by considering geometrical relationships between the space spanned by a particular MMP and the space occupied by the scene components.

The extruded woodplastic composite sill plate eliminates the splitting failure experienced by preservative treated wood sill plates and eliminated the need for hold-down connectors. while continuing to provide a moisture barrier between the untreated wood members and concrete. The walls with the new sill plate have resistances comparative to walls with hold-downs and the sill plate can be easily used to retrofit existing structures.

The denitrifier method. based on the isotope ratio analysis of nitrous oxide generated from sample nitrate by cultured denitrifying bacteria. has been described elsewhere for its use in nitrogen isotope ratio (15N/14N) analysis of nitrate.1 Here. we address the additional issues associated with 18O/16O analysis of nitrate by this approach. which include (1) the oxygen isotopic difference between the nitrate sample and the N2O analyte due to isotopic fractionation associated with the loss of oxygen atoms from nitrate and (2) the exchange of oxygen atoms with water during the conversion of nitrate to N2O.

Higher 15N/14N and lower 18O/16O ratios are observed in the warm season (April–September) in comparison to the cool season (October–March): The mean δ15N of nitrate for the warm and cool seasons is −2.1‰ and −5.9‰ (versus air N2). respectively. while the mean δ18O is 68.6‰ and 76.9‰ (versus Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). The few cool season rain events that had high 15N/14N and low 18O/16O exhibited trajectory paths originating from the south. similar to those of warm season samples.

Calculated nitrate Δ17O is sensitive to the relative importance of each nitrate formation pathway. suggesting that observations of nitrate Δ17O can be used to quantify the importance of individual reactions (e.g. N2O5 hydrolysis) leading to nitrate formation if the Δ17O value of ozone is known.,True,fMyI4fEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,192,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/9/5043/2009/,15222641638940947896,/scholar?cites=15222641638940947896,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/9/5043/2009/acp-9-5043-2009.pdf,0,0,0

Greenland. This record indicates that ice-core nitrate reflects changes in nitrogen oxide (NOx) source emissions and that anthropogenic emissions of NOx have resulted in a 12 per mil decline in δ15N of atmospheric nitrate from preindustrial values to present.

Greenland. The 15N/14N and 18O/16O ratios of NO3− in recently fallen snow are similar to those of surface snow. Diurnal variation is observed in 15N/14N of NO3−. and possibly 18O/16O. suggesting fractionating loss of NO3− from snow during the day. which is subsequently recovered at night. A larger seasonal variation is observed. with higher 15N/14N and lower 18O/16O of NO3− in summer than winter. which cannot be explained by postdepositional fractionation. The generally high 18O/16O of NO3− in Greenland snow (δ18O versus VSMOW = 65.2 to 79.6‰) indicates that oxygen atoms from ozone have been incorporated into NOx that was subsequently deposited as HNO3.

ICT is the flow of air pollutants from a source continent (e.g.. North America) to a receptor continent (e.g.. Europe). ICT of air pollutants occurs through two mechanisms:  (i) episodic advection and (ii) increasing the global background. which enhances surface concentrations. We outline the current scientific evidence for ICT of aerosols and ozone. both of which contribute to air pollution and radiative forcing. The growing body of scientific evidence for ICT suggests that a hemispheric-scale treaty to reduce air pollutant concentra tions may be appropriate to address climate and air quality concerns simultaneously.

Isotope ratios of HNO3 are controlled by the nitrogen isotope fractionation between NO and NO2. the ratio of NO2 to NO. and seasonal variations in HNO3 production. The observed seasonal range in δ15N requires either a large net fractionation (∼70‰) associated with NOx cycling or a seasonal change in the δ15N of NOx sources. The observed range in δ18O of nitrate is smaller than that calculated from HNO3 production pathways. suggesting that seasonal transport may also be required to explain the seasonality in nitrate δ18O.,True,fMyI4fEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,33,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008GL035551,1272101690419428307,/scholar?cites=1272101690419428307,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL035551,0,0,0

Ltd.,The CEST effect of many PARACEST MRI contrast agents changes in response to a molecular biomarker. However. other molecular biomarkers or environmental factors can influence CEST. so that a change in CEST is not conclusive proof for detecting the biomarker.

Both X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ab initio calculations have been applied to probe the electronic structure of the newly formed LiTiO2 phase.

X-ray absorption at the Ti K edge as a function of lithium content is interpreted as a sum of two coexisting crystallographic phases (anatase and Li-titanate). both in the case of chemically lithiated microcrystalline samples and electrochemically intercalated thin film samples. The changes in the near edge region of the Ti K edge (XANES region) indicate that the charge-compensating electron of the Li-ion mainly occupies the crystal field split Ti 3d t2g orbitals located at the bottom of the conduction band. Surface sensitive reflection mode XAFS indicates that intercalation leads to a 3−4 nm surface region characterized by an effective Ti oxidation state close to 3+.

It makes use of piezo tilt tables mounted below the crystals in a double crystal or channel cut crystal monochromator. Repetitive energy scans are performed by applying an oscillatory high voltage to the piezo translators of the tilt tables. Currently. this allows one to scan an energy range of several hundred eV in the hard x-ray range with repetition frequencies of typically 10 Hz.

The ability to tune CO to H2 product distributions is appealing for downstream processing into a variety of industrially relevant chemicals. Cu catalysts produce a wider range of products. and current efforts focus on controlling the product distribution by tuning the catalyst size. structure. oxidation state. and crystallographic orientation.

The goal was to examine any deviations from continuum flow behavior and to compare and contrast the Poiseuille and electro-osmotic flow situations. The fluid was composed of cationic counterions and nonpolar monatomic solvent molecules. The cylindrical surface of the pore wall was represented by a stochastic scattering boundary condition. The lack of any surface roughness and the computational efficiency of the fluid model enabled the velocity profile near the wall to be measured at very high spatial resolution. The simulation results indicate that both Poiseuille and electro-osmotic flow conform to continuum transport theories except in the first monolayer of fluid at the pore wall.

The adsorption layers on the surfaces of the thin membranes are found to provide a significant resistance to the flux of methane. This strong surface effect for thin membranes requires that the control volumes (where insertions and deletions are performed) must be placed far enough away from the membrane surface that they do not overlap with the surface adsorption layer. The permeance (flux/pressure drop) of methane through the surface layer is shown to be insensitive to both the average pressure and the pressure drop. In contrast. the permeance through the interior of the membrane increases with decreasing average pressure. These results are explained using a model which treats the transport through the surface barrier as driven by the pressure gradient and …,True,RxtcvuUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,81,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1360256,8726235303814812567,/scholar?cites=8726235303814812567,,,0,0,0

For networks cross-linked in the undeformed state. the modulus increases linearly with the cross-link density as expected from rubber elasticity theory. When cross-links are added to a network that was uniaxially deformed. the stress remains constant in accordance with the independent network hypothesis of Tobolsky. When the deformed network is subsequently released. permanent set is observed. Using the independent network hypothesis. together with the affine theory of rubber elasticity. a constitutive model is developed that accounts for the effect of the coupling between the cross-link density and strain histories of the network.

An extension of the SNAP form is proposed that includes quadratic terms in the bispectrum components. The extension is shown to provide a large increase in accuracy relative to the linear form. while incurring only a modest increase in computational cost. The mathematical structure of the quadratic SNAP form is similar to the embedded atom method (EAM). with the SNAP bispectrum components serving as counterparts to the two-body density functions in EAM.

Superior catalytic reactivity is observed for Pd NCs with {100} surface facets compared to {111} facets. The origin of the enhanced reactivity associated with a cubic morphology is related to the leaching susceptibility of the nanocrystals. Molecular oxygen plays a key role in facilitating the leaching of Pd atoms from the surface of the nanocrystals. The interaction of O2 with Pd is itself facet‐dependent. which in turn gives rise to more efficient leaching from {100} facets. compared to {111} facets under the reaction conditions.,True,qmTgUc8AAAAJ:i_7YvbSbtFEC,104,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201400483,17890105150062085856,/scholar?cites=17890105150062085856,,https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/2410/GC_OriginAV2014.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Here. we examine the magnetic excitations of FeSc 2 S 4 through time-domain terahertz spectroscopy under an applied magnetic field. At low temperatures an excitation emerges that we attribute to a singlet-triplet excitation from the SOL ground state. A threefold splitting of this excitation is observed as a function of applied magnetic field. As singlet-triplet excitations are typically not allowed in pure spin systems. our results demonstrate the entangled spin and orbital character of singlet ground and triplet excited states. Using experimentally obtained parameters we compare to existing theoretical models to determine FeSc 2 S 4’s proximity to the quantum critical point.

1127075,Pushing the limits of mercury sensors with gold nanorods,2006,Matthew Rex and Florencio E Hernandez and Andres D Campiglia,78,Analytical Chemistry,2,445-451,American Chemical Society,The method presented here provides a direct way to determine mercury in tap water samples at the parts-per-trillion level. Its outstanding selectivity and sensitivity results from the well-known amalgamation process that occurs between mercury and gold. The entire procedure takes less than 10 min. No sample separation or sample preconcentration is required. The only step prior to mercury determination consists of mixing the water sample with a gold nanorod solution in sodium borohydride. The analytical figures of merit demonstrate precise and accurate analysis at the parts-per-trillion level. The limit of detection (6.6 × 10-13 g·L-1) shows excellent potential for monitoring ultralow levels of mercury in water samples. ,True,XogztzEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,343,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac051166r,15142728676144961134,/scholar?cites=15142728676144961134,,,0,0,0

We found that. for common solvents used in the past such as water and ethanol. the limiting behavior ceases after a few laser firings and a turnover in the limiting curve appears.

However. for low viscosity liquids. such as carbon disulfide or pentane. the limiting is unaffected by the repetition rate. at least for frequencies up to 10 Hz. because of diffusion of the carbon black particles.

This results in a drastic enhancement of the quantum yield for charge carrier photogeneration and the charge carrier mobility. The mobile electrons have a mobility as high as 0.1 cm2/(V·s). which represents an increase of 4 orders of magnitude over non-annealed QD films and exceeds existing literature data on the electron mobility in CdSe quantum dot films. The lifetime of mobile electrons is longer than that of the exciton. A fraction of the mobile electrons gets trapped at levels below the conduction band of the CdSe nanocrystals. These electrons slowly diffuse over 50−300 nm on longer times up to 20 μs and undergo transfer to a TiO2 substrate.

Under carefully controlled conditions. the Mitsunobu reaction can be used to selectively dehydrate the ido ring to give the talo epoxide. Subsequently however. under more forcing conditions. the 2-deoxy streptamine ring undergoes Mitsunobu dehydration to give an aziridine. An unusual remote neighboring group effect was observed. When the primary hydroxyl of the ribose ring was blocked. aziridine formation on the deoxystreptamine ring did not occur. Both the epoxide and epoxide-aziridine neomycin building blocks can be ring-opened with azide and subjected to “click” type chemistry with terminal alkynes to generate a series of new neomycin analogues.

1127195,Theoretical design of conjugated organic polymers,2004,Ulrike Salzner,8,,7,569-590,Bentham Science Publishers,Predictions of excitation energies of π-conjugated oligomers and band gaps of conducting organic polymers at various theoretical levels are reviewed and compared to experimental data in gas. liquid. and solid phases. High level ab initio calculations reproduce the experimental excitation energies of polyenes in the gas phase very well. The assignment of the peaks to adiabatic and vertical excitations is. however. not certain. Solvent effects lower and disorder increases the excitation energies. In the solid state. bands of molecular crystals split and shift compared to individual molecules. Therefore. theoretical data should not agree completely with experiment. unless all medium effects are accounted for. Band structure calculations usually neglect most of the medium effects but can produce trends. helping with the analysis of substituent effects.

In the recent past. many literature reports have suggested that the side chains play a critical role in molecular packing and strongly impact the charge transport properties of conjugated polymers. In this work. we have investigated the influence of side-chains on the charge transport behavior of a novel class of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based alternating copolymers. To investigate the role of side-chains. we prepared four diketopyrrolopyrrole–diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP–DPP) conjugated polymers with varied side-chains and carried out a systematic study of thin film microstructure and charge transport properties in polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs).

Substantial optimization and development of new π-conjugated materials has resulted in the demonstration of several practical devices. particularly in displays and photoreceptors. However. applications of organic semiconductors in bipolar junction devices. e.g. rectifiers and inverters. are limited due to an imbalance in charge transport. The performance of p-channel organic semiconducting materials exceeds that of electron transport. In addition. electron transport in π-conjugated materials exhibits poorer atmospheric stability and dispersive transient photocurrents due to extrinsic carrier trapping.

The energy gap between the linear and the bent geometry for CaF2 at both the SCF and the MP2 level is extremely small. Small basis sets lead to bent structures and bond lengths that are much too short. indicating a large BSSE. The inclusion of d orbitals is a precondition to obtain bent geometries. but a large set of 4p orbitals is crucial for the geometry determination as well. since p orbitals favour linear structures. Thus. near the HF limit. basis sets do not indicate significant bending if the 3d and the 4p orbitals are equally well represented. Correlation effects are of minor importance.

In the absence of counterions. defects are delocalized. Counterions induce localization. For dications two polarons on the same chain are preferred over a bipolaron. Intragap absorptions arise in charged species. no matter whether defects are localized or delocalized. Cations and dications give rise to two sub-band transitions. The cation peaks have lower energies than those of dications. The first excitations of cations have lower oscillator strengths than the second; for dications the second peak is weaker than the first.

To study substituent effects on energy levels and energy gaps systematically. CH3-. OH-. NH2-. CN-. and CCH-substituted bithiophenes were examined with density functional theory and NBO analysis. Total charges and π-electron densities were analyzed separately to examine π- and σ-effects. Second-order perturbation theory was used to quantify conjugation in terms of orbital interactions. NBO orbital energies were employed to investigate the effect of alternating donor−acceptor substitution. Substituents in 3- and 4-positions shift HOMO and LUMO levels in parallel and hardly influence HOMO−LUMO gaps.

Capacitance constitutes a key parameter to explore which mechanisms control particular functioning and undesired effects as current hysteresis. Analyzing capacitive responses allows addressing not only the nature of charge distribution in the device but also the kinetics of the charging processes and how they alter the solar cell current. Two main polarization processes are identified. Dielectric properties of the microscopic dipolar units through the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition account for the measured intermediate frequency capacitance. Electrode polarization caused by interfacial effects. presumably related to kinetically slow ions piled up in the vicinity of the outer interfaces. consistently explain the reported excess capacitance values at low frequencies.

The bipartite peptide (derived N-terminally from galanin and C-terminally from mastoparan) was found to exhibit prominent characteristics of (i) amphiphilic α-helices. (ii) intrinsically disordered peptides. as well as (iii) β-pleated amyloid fibrils. and these conformational states become interconverted as a function of concentration. We used a complementary approach of solid-state 19F-NMR and circular dichroism in oriented membrane samples to characterize the structural and dynamical behaviour of TP10 in its monomeric and aggregated forms. Nine different positions in the peptide were selectively substituted with either the L- or D-enantiomer of 3-(trifluoromethyl)-bicyclopent-[1.1.1]-1-ylglycine (CF3-Bpg) as a reporter group for 19F-NMR. Using the L-epimeric analogs. a comprehensive three-dimensional structure analysis was carried out in lipid bilayers at low peptide concentration. where TP10 is monomeric. While the N-terminal region is flexible and intrinsically unstructured within the plane of the lipid bilayer. the C-terminal α-helix is embedded in the membrane with an oblique tilt angle of ∼55° and in accordance with its amphiphilic profile. Incorporation of the sterically obstructive D-CF3-Bpg reporter group into the helical region leads to a local unfolding of the membrane-bound peptide. At high concentration. these helix-destabilizing C-terminal substitutions promote aggregation into immobile β-sheets. which resemble amyloid fibrils.

In addition. the new catalyst system for the first time enables amidation of aryl arenesulfonates and aqueous amination protocols that do not necessitate the use of cosolvents. The substrate scope has been significantly expanded to include aryl halides containing primary amides and free carboxylic acid groups.

The  polarisation is inferred from the relative fraction of energy carried by charged and neutral hadrons in the hadronic  decays.

Thioethers constitute a simple. robust system with which molecular rotation can be actuated both thermally and mechanically. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy allowed the measurement of the rotation of individual molecules as a function of temperature and the quantification of both the energetic barrier and pre-exponential factor of the motion.

Alloy compositions are complex and often heterogeneous at the atomic‐scale and the exact mechanisms by which many of these processes operate have yet to be discovered.

We show here by a combination of in situ microscopy and spectroscopy techniques that. in the presence of reactants. an oxide catalyst’s chemical state and morphology are dynamically modified. The reduction of Cu2O films is studied under ambient pressures (AP) of CO. The use of complementary techniques allows us to identify intermediate surface oxide phases and determine how reaction fronts propagate across the surface by massive mass transfer of Cu atoms released during the reduction of the oxide phase in the presence of CO.

Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy imaging of individual styrene molecules reveals their internal structure and hence the orientation of their dipole moment parallel to the Au{111} surface.

From the parsed chemical name. an XML parse tree is constructed that is operated on in a stepwise manner until the structure has been reconstructed from the name. Results from OPSIN on various computer generated name/structure pair sets are presented.

Ideally. the best binders are selectively amplified. However. theoretical studies predict this is not always the case. This paper describes the first quantitative experimental evidence proving that. under special circumstances. the preferential amplification of suboptimal synthetic receptors can indeed occur.

We propose an alternative: the 'silver standard corpus' (SSC). a corpus that has been generated by the harmonisation of the annotations that have been delivered from a selection of annotation systems.

The annotation systems have been evaluated against the harmonised set (630.324 sentences. 15. 956. 841 tokens). We can demonstrate that the annotation of proteins and genes shows higher diversity across all used annotation solutions leading to a lower agreement against the harmonised set in comparison to the annotations of diseases and species. An analysis of the most frequent annotations from all systems shows that a high agreement amongst systems leads to the selection of terms that are suitable to be kept in the harmonised set.

1127387,Highly selective room-temperature copper-catalyzed C− N coupling reactions,2006,Alexandr Shafir and Stephen L Buchwald,128,Journal of the American Chemical Society,27,8742-8743,American Chemical Society,Through the use of cyclic β-diketones as supporting ligands. the copper-catalyzed coupling of aryl iodides with aliphatic amines occurs at room temperature in as little as 1 h. These high reaction rates allow for the coupling of a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl iodides at room temperature. This method is highly tolerant of a number of reactive functional groups. including −Br and aromatic −NH2 as well as phenolic and aliphatic −OH. The high selectivity of the CuI−β-diketone catalyst for aliphatic amines represents a useful complement to the palladium-based methods. ,True,v2uaml0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,466,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja063063b,1341803323647509195,/scholar?cites=1341803323647509195,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47967176/JACS06_Highly_Selective_Room-Temperature_Copper-Catalyzed_CN_Coupling_Reactions.pdf,0,0,0

Selective N-arylation was accomplished at room temperature using 2-isobutyrylcyclohexanone (a β-diketone) as supporting ligand. while selective O-arylation required the use of 3.4.7.8-tetramethylphenanthroline at 80−110 °C. Systematic examination of the reaction scope revealed that high levels of selectivity are achieved for a variety of substrates. provided that nonchelating (or weakly chelating) aminoalcohols are used.

The mechanism is explored by using DFT calculations. which show a vanishingly small activation barrier for the CC bond‐forming step. In fact. taking advantage of an efficient in situ hypervalent activation. the iodoarenes are shown to undergo a cross‐ dehydrogenative CC coupling at the CH ortho to the iodine. When Oxone is used as terminal oxidant. the process is found to benefit from a rapid initial formation of the hypervalent ArI(OR)2 species and the sulfate‐accelerated final coupling with a ketone.

In such a way. equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide and carbonate ions are obtained in a good yield referred to the charge transferred. However. by performing this process under controlled potential conditions. unsatisfactorily low turnover numbers are found because these reduction products are able to abstract progressively the nickel promoter from the electrocatalytic cycle. Carbonate ions in fact enter the coordination sphere of nickel(II). giving a mixed complex which can be reduced at potentials more negative than the precursor species. while carbon monoxide reacts with nickel(O) leading to the formation of a quite inert carbonyl-bipyridyl compound.

It is demonstrated that the nematic to optically isotropic viscoelastic phase transition is driven by an increase of surface charge of the micelle. It is argued that the surface-active nature of both the molecules is the primary driving force for these transitions and the symmetry observed.

Differences in behavior between addition of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to cetyltrimethylammonium-p-toluenesulfonate (CTAPTS) solutions are investigated by NMR and molecular modeling techniques. It is concluded that the complex formed between SDS and CTAPTS is more tightly bound than that between SDBS and CTAPTS. leading to precipitation rather than vesicle formation in the latter case. Molecular modeling shows that the SDBS chain has a bend in the molecule. and this facilitates loose packing of the complex neccessary for the formation of vesicles. ,True,lEMMmY4AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,97,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la971024v,9874651813579979874,/scholar?cites=9874651813579979874,,,0,0,0

Membrane/lipid rafts (MLR). discrete regions of the plasmalemma enriched in cholesterol. glycosphingolipids. and sphingomyelin. are essential for the development and stabilization of synapses. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1). a cholesterol binding protein organizes synaptic signaling components within MLR. It is unknown whether loss of synapses is dependent on an age-related loss of Cav-1 expression and whether this has implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.   Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed brains from young (Yg. 3-6 months). middle age (Md. 12 months). aged (Ag. >18 months). and young Cav-1 KO mice and show that localization of PSD-95. NR2A. NR2B. TrkBR. AMPAR. and Cav-1 to MLR is decreased in aged hippocampi. Young Cav-1 KO mice showed signs of premature neuronal aging and degeneration.

Higher plasma levels of IL-6. in turn. increase the risk of many conditions associated with aging including age-related cognitive decline. However. the mechanisms underlying this association between IL-6 and cognitive vulnerability remain unclear.  Methods and Findings We investigated the role of IL-6 in brain aging in young (4 mo) and aged (24 mo) wild-type C57BL6 and genetically-matched IL-6−/− mice. and determined that IL-6 was necessary and sufficient for increased neuronal expression of the superoxide-producing immune enzyme.

Furthermore. superoxide production by NADPH-oxidase was directly responsible for age-related loss of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. neurons essential for normal information processing. encoding. and retrieval in hippocampus and cortex. Targeted deletion of IL-6 or elimination of superoxide by chronic treatment with a superoxide-dismutase mimetic prevented age-related loss of PV-interneurons and reversed age-related cognitive deficits on three standard tests of spatial learning and recall.

Free radicals are proposed as key elements in the multifactorial process of aging and it is predicted that the longer‐lived gender should have lower levels of oxidative stress.

We also found that at lower T mitochondria produced more carbon-centered lipid radicals. a species known to activate uncoupling proteins. These data indicate that reduced mitochondrial ROS production is not one of the mechanisms mediating lifespan extension at lower T.

We report here that CTR1 is required for the activation of signaling to the MAPK pathway by the ligands of three major receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including FGF. PDGF and EGF. Induction of Erk1/2 phosphorylation was compared in isogenic wild type CTR1+/+ and CTR1−/− cells. Whereas all three ligands increased pErk1/2 in the CTR1+/+ cells. they failed to do this in CTR1−/− cells. While FGF did not enhance the phosphorylation of AKT in the CTR1+/+ cells. both PDGF and EGF increased pAKT in the CTR1+/+ but not CTR1−/− cells. The deficit in Erk1/2 phosphorylation in the CTR1−/− cells was rescued by adding Cu to the medium. and it was induced in CTR1+/+ cells by treatment with a Cu chelator.

It is a target of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of anti-diabetes drugs whose binding modulate both electron transfer and cluster transfer properties. The [2Fe-2S] cluster in mNT is destabilized upon binding of NADPH. which leads to loss of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to the solution environment. Because mNT is capable of transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to apo-acceptor proteins. we sought to determine whether NADPH binding also affects cluster transfer. We show that NADPH inhibits transfer of the [2Fe-2S] cluster to an apo-acceptor protein with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 200 μm. which reflects that of NADPH concentrations expected under physiological conditions.

While the 5‐methyl derivative 2 exhibits an antiferroelectric transition at 41 K. such a phase transition was not observed in 5‐bromo derivative 3 down to 4.2 K. Suppression of the phase transition in the latter may be interpreted in terms of quantum paraelectricity based on proton‐tunneling along the hydrogen bond. The reason for the appearance of antiferroelectric ordering coupled with the phase transition in 2 may be ascribed to reduction of the tunneling frequency due to symmetry breaking caused by the methyl group.

By analyzing the data on BHP. a tunnel splitting of (64±2) cm−1 associated with the quantum mechanical motion of the hydrogen atom in the intramolecular O–H–O hydrogen bond was derived along with the Debye temperature 60.8 K and two Einstein temperatures 131.4 (nondegenerate) and 210.4 K (doubly degenerate). The enthalpy change of 225 J mol−1 and entropy change of 6.8 J K−1 mol−1 were determined for the total thermal effects associated with the two phase transitions in BDP. The value of the transition entropy is consistent with the twofold disorder in the high temperature phase.

They can be obtained by synthesis. with high purity and controlled stoichiometry but with much larger preparation efforts and costs with respect to natural ores. Their properties can be tailored by changing the metals of the layer. or by inserting proper inorganic or organic anions. The reason of the few industrial applications of LDHs might be the difficulty of scaling up their synthesis and anion exchange methods. requiring often cumbersome procedures for filtering. recovery and purification of the final products.

It is shown that if a part of the local electron density varies linearly with an external stimulus. the diffracted signal is not only a function of the stimulation frequency Ω. but also of its double 2Ω. These frequency components can provide. under certain conditions. selective access to partial diffraction contributions that are normally summed up in the interference pattern. A phasing process applied to partial diffraction terms would allow recovery of the substructure actively responding to the stimulus.

Moreover. LDHs are used in various technological applications to improve stability and processability. The crystal chemistry of hydrotalcite-like compounds was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). automated electron diffraction tomography (ADT) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)-GC-MS to shed light on the mechanisms involved in ion exchange and absorption of contaminants. mainly carbonate anions. For the first time. ADT allowed a structural model of LDH_NO3 to be obtained from experiment. shedding light on the conformation of nitrate inside LDH and on the loss of crystallinity due to the layer morphology. The ADT analysis of a hybrid LDH sample (LDH_EUS) clearly revealed an increase in defectivity in this material. XRPD demonstrated that the presence of carbonate can influence the intercalation of organic molecules into LDH. since CO3-contaminated samples tend to adopt d spacings that are approximate multiples of the d spacing of LDH_CO3. TGA-GC-MS allowed intercalated and surfaceadsorbed organic molecules to be distinguished and quantified. the presence and amount of carbonate to be confirmed. especially at low concentrations (< 2 wt%). and the different types and strengths of adsorption to be classified with respect to the temperature of elimination.,True,nl7dEggAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,35,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Perioli/publication/280085422_Structural_Characterisation_of_Complex_Layered_Double_Hydroxides_and_TGA-GC-MS_Study_on_Thermal_Response_and_Carbonate_Contamination_in_Nitrate-_and_Organic-Exchanged_Hydrotalcites/links/580de72508ae0360753c7460/Structural-Characterisation-of-Complex-Layered-Double-Hydroxides-and-TGA-GC-MS-Study-on-Thermal-Response-and-Carbonate-Contamination-in-Nitrate-and-Organic-Exchanged-Hydrotalcites.pdf,16539681738024252508,/scholar?cites=16539681738024252508,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luana_Perioli/publication/280085422_Structural_Characterisation_of_Complex_Layered_Double_Hydroxides_and_TGA-GC-MS_Study_on_Thermal_Response_and_Carbonate_Contamination_in_Nitrate-_and_Organic-Exchanged_Hydrotalcites/links/580de72508ae0360753c7460/Structural-Characterisation-of-Complex-Layered-Double-Hydroxides-and-TGA-GC-MS-Study-on-Thermal-Response-and-Carbonate-Contamination-in-Nitrate-and-Organic-Exchanged-Hydrotalcites.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A synchrotron radiation fiber diffraction structural study of the axial filament of siliceous spicules from two species of marine sponges (the Demosponge Geodia cydonium and the Hexactinellid Scolymastra joubini) was carried out. The sharpness of the spots in the diffraction patterns indicated that the protein units in the filament of both samples were highly organized. A possible explanation is that the arrangement of the protein units is similar to that of the pores in highly ordered siliceous mesoporous materials. Nevertheless. the diffraction patterns are quite different for the two types of spicules. The pattern of G. cydonium is consistent with a regular 2D hexagonal lattice of protein units in the direction perpendicular to the spicule axis. with a repeating distance of 5.8 nm; the units are linked to form fibers along the axis.

Molten salts are currently used as heat storage media to enable power generation during the night-cycle. Metal hydrides offer the possibility of storing energy with an order of magnitude less raw material than molten salts due to their impressive energy densities.

Since aluminum is potentially toxic. it is important to be able to characterize its speciation in solution. Three major difficulties are the existence of a large number of equilibrium processes. its ready hydrolysis. and the lack of suitable spectroscopic probes. One way of looking directly at the aluminum environment is by 27Al NMR. but there are difficulties with spectral assignment. A comparison of solid-state structures determined by X-ray crystallography with these NMR spectra offers a means of determining which species are important components in the solution state.

In the field of electron transfer reactions. screening can be performed through the application of Marcus Hush theory to calculate the activation free energy of any potential reaction. This work describes the most accurate and efficient approach for modelling the electron transfer process. In particular. the importance of using an electron transfer complex to model these reactions rather than considering donor and acceptor molecules as separate entities is highlighted. The use of the complex model is found to produce more accurate calculation of the electron transfer energy when the donor and acceptor spin densities are adequately localised.,True,G3BElNkAAAAJ:inmFHauC9wsC,20,https://pubs.rsc.org/--/content/articlehtml/2016/ra/c5ra26483a,14389535231887723800,/scholar?cites=14389535231887723800,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/getauthorversionpdf/c5ra26483a,0,0,0

1127824,Synthesis of Furans from Sugars Via Keto Intermediates,2018,Joseph B Binder,,,,,,BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Five-carbon and six-carbon furans such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural may be derived from renew able resources and are promising platform chemicals which may be used in a wide range of applications. For instance. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural may be oxidized into 2. 5-furandi carboxylic acid. a component of polyesters resembling poly ethylene terephthalate but with improved barrier properties. The challenge of producing furan compounds such as 5-hy droxymethylfurfural in high yield at low cost hinders such applications. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is traditionally pro duced from fructose. yet fructose is not as common as other sugars like sucrose and glucose and the pathways are not efficient.

Despite the high porosity. these sediments are not in suspension. as reflected in IFs of 0.1 or higher.Upon burial. the sediments lose porosity by mechanical compaction. and concurrently. the calcite particles recrystallize into progressively more equant shapes.

Effective burial stress is caused by the weight of all overlying water and sediments as counteracted by the pressure in the pore fluid. so the regional overpressure in the Central North Sea is one reason why the two localities have different relationships between temperature and effective burial stress. In the chalk of the Ontong Java Plateau the onset of calcite‐silicate pressure dissolution around 490 m below sea floor (bsf) corresponds to an interval of waning porosity‐decline. and even the occurrence of proper stylolites from 830 m bsf is accompanied by only minor porosity reduction.

1127863,Chalk: composition. diagenesis and physical properties,2007,Ida Lykke Fabricius,55,,,97-128,Dansk Geologisk Forening,Chalk is a sedimentary rock of unusually high homogeneity on the scale where physical properties are measured. but the properties fall in wide ranges. Chalk may thus be seen as the ideal starting point for a physical understanding of rocks in general. Properties as porosity. permeability. capillary entry pressure. and elastic moduli are consequences of primary sediment composition and of subsequent diagenetic history as caused by microbial action. burial stress. temperature. and pore pressure. Porosity is a main determining factor for other properties. For a given porosity. the specific surface of the sediment controls permeability and capillary entry pressure. As diagenesis progresses. the specific surface is less and less due to the calcite component and more and more due to the fine-grained silicates. as a reflection of the coarsening and cementation of the calcite crystals. The elastic moduli. which define sonic velocity. are for a given porosity mainly controlled be the degree of pore-stiffening cementation. which may be quantified by effective medium modeling. Diagenetic processes include mechanical compaction. pore-stiffening cementation. dissolution. and pore-filling cementation. Processes involving clay. silica. and calcite are interlinked. but progress differently in different localities. This partly depends on primary sediment composition. including organic content. which may induce the formation of concretions by microbial action. The diagenetic processes also depend on water depth. rate of burial. and over-pressuring. These factors cause the stress. temperature and pore-pressure to increase at different rates during burial in different localities.,True,5sJuL1cAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,90,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13706247.pdf,8660003438013203256,/scholar?cites=8660003438013203256,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13706247.pdf,0,0,0

The ultrasonic compressional‐ and shear‐wave velocities (VP and VS) for dry and water‐saturated samples were measured at up to 75 bar confining hydrostatic pressure corresponding to effective stress in the reservoir. The porosity is the main control of the ultrasonic velocities and therefore of the elastic moduli. The elastic moduli are slightly higher for samples from the South Arne Field than from the Dan Field for identical porosities.

Fifty-nine Tor and Ekofisk Formation chalk samples from five North Sea chalk reservoirs were investigated. All contain quartz and clay minerals. most commonly kaolinite and smectite. with trace amounts of illite. The contents of calcite and quartz are inversely correlated and both are independent of the content of clays. We thus infer that the main part of the silica is of biogenic origin.

Berea sandstone is often used as a reference formation to study mechanisms that affect permeability in reservoir sandstones. Both heating of the pore fluid and reduction of the pore fluid salinity can reduce permeability in Berea sandstone.

D. studies; they never follow the course of action originally intended! The present thesis is no different. When I back in august 2002 commenced the Ph. D. study at Høgskolen i Stavanger (HiS) as a geologist. the intention of my supervisors. Professor Rasmus Risnes and Professor Vidar Hansen. was to bridge one of the gaps existing between geology and engineering sciences. The vast engineering experience collected over the years at HiS with respect to mechanical properties of Upper Cretaceous chalk needed a geological explanation. especially after it became clear that mechanical strength depends on type of pore fluid as exemplified by the water weakening effect. The main purpose of the thesis was to study particle contacts by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thereby unravel some of the secrets behind chalk cohesion.Three months of the autumn of 2003 was spent at Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Aarhus performing SEM studies of chalk. Three months of the following spring was spent at Materials Research Department at Risø National Laboratory. mainly with TEM studies of chalk. but also with testing the usefulness of other microscope based examination techniques including low vacuum SEM (LV-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).,True,5sJuL1cAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC,52,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13732326.pdf,7801790224728057968,/scholar?cites=7801790224728057968,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13732326.pdf,0,0,0

Hydrogen-Bonding and Structural Effects,2014,Jean-Michel Savéant and Cédric Tard,136,Journal of the American Chemical Society,25,8907-8910,American Chemical Society,Electron transfer in azobenzene derivatives bearing two carboxylic acid groups is coupled with intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner in the title 2e– + 2H+ redox couple. The presence of the pendant acid–base functions pushes the redox chemistry of the azo/hydrazo couple toward positive potentials by as much as 0.75 V. This is essentially the result of H-bonding of one of the nitrogen atoms by the neighboring carboxylic group and H-bonding of one carboxylate by the neighboring protonated nitrogen atom. The two electron-transfer reactions. particularly the second one. are accompanied by strong structural changes. which results in the occurrence of a square scheme mechanism in which electron transfer and structural change are not concerted.

Application of the model to the electrochemical reductive cleavage of the O–O bond of an organic peroxide in the presence of a proximal acid group illustrates the applicability of the model and provides an example demonstrating that electron transfer. heavy-atom bond breaking. and proton transfer may be all concerted.

The successful application of this method for temperature calibration was demonstrated from an assessment. from high‐resolution solid‐state 13C NMR spectroscopy. of the phase transition temperatures for solid tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane and for solid 2.2‐dimethylpropane‐1.3‐diol.,True,NiWRoO4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,61,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrc.1260320611,10958072297486740454,/scholar?cites=10958072297486740454,,,0,0,0

This study investigates known solvent extraction technologies with a wide range of solvents for lipid extraction from SCGs. and determines the effect of solvent selection and process temperature on the extraction efficiency and composition of the obtained oil. A correlation between increasing solvent boiling point. and therefore process temperature. and improved oil extraction efficiency was observed in Soxhlet extractions with a wide range of solvents. Experiments at elevated temperatures (up to 200 °C) were performed through Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) and temperature increase initially improved the oil extraction efficiency when non-polar solvents were used. before decreasing it at higher temperatures.

In this study. the dialkylimidazolium‐based low temperature melting organic salts know as “ionic liquids” (ILs) are used as electrolytes. At room temperature these liquids are miscible with acetonitrile which makes it easy to use them for adjustment of analyte mobility and separation. The anionic part as well as the concentration of an IL influence the general electrophoretic mobility of the buffer system.

The synthesis was carried out by reducing AuIII to Au0 in an aqueous solution of chitosan and different organic acids (i.e.. acetic. malonic. or oxalic acid). We have demonstrated that by varying the nature of the acid it is possible to tune the reduction rate of the gold precursor (HAuCl4) and to modify the morphology of the resulting metal nanoparticles. The use of chitosan. a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer with a large number of amino and hydroxyl functional groups. enables the simultaneous synthesis and surface modification of AuNPs in one pot.

Using an ethane/air mixture with a C2H6/O2 ratio = 1.5 and a preheat temperature ranging from 250 to 400°C results in a 55% ethylene yield. a value even higher than those reported in the same experimental conditions over Pt-based catalysts. By investigating the effect of the experimental conditions. we found that the major role of increasing the feed flow rate and decreasing the C2H6/O2 ratio is to raise the degree of adiabaticity of the reactor and. consequently. ethane conversion and temperature. The selectivity to ethylene also seems to increase with increasing temperature. but only up to about 950°C. At higher temperatures. further degradation of ethylene to C2H2 and CH4 occurs.

The ceria samples with well-defined nanostructures (nanocubes/Ce-NC and nanorods/Ce-NR) have been prepared using the hydrothermal method. Mesoporous ceria (Ce-MES) and ceria synthesized with solution combustion technique (Ce-SCS) have also been prepared for comparison. The lowest CO oxidation temperature has been reached by using ceria nanocubes (Ce-NC). This high activity draws immense contributions from the highly reactive (100) and (110) surfaces of the truncated nanocubes. The Ce-MES and Ce-SCS samples. despite their high surface areas. are unable to outdo the activity of Ce-NC and Ce-NR due to the abundant presence of (111) crystalline planes.

The oscillations are not chaotic but have a kinetic genesis. The oscillating behaviour is established over the pre-reduced catalyst after a transient phase whose duration is reduced with increasing the reactant inlet concentration. The addition of O2to the feed reduces the average N2O conversion and does not substantially affect the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillations up to an O2/N2O inlet ratio equal to 10; only at higher inlet ratios do the oscillations disappear. Fourier analysis has revealed that the frequency of the oscillations increases by increasing either the feed flow rate or the N2O reactor inlet concentration.

In the present study. we studied the metabolomic profiles using high analyte specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to attain a systemslevel view of the shift in metabolism in cells progressing along the path to CRC. Colonic tissues including tumor. polyps and adjacent matched normal mucosa from 26 patients with sporadic CRC from freshly isolated resections were used for this study. The metabolic profiles were obtained using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. Our data suggest there was a distinct profile change of a wide range of metabolites from mucosa to tumor tissues. Various amino acids and lipids in the polyps and tumors were elevated. suggesting higher energy needs for increased cellular proliferation. In contrast. significant depletion of glucose and inositol in polyps revealed that glycolysis may be critical in early tumorigenesis. In addition. the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine. and the decrease of uric acid concentration. suggest that the purine biosynthesis pathway could have been substituted by the salvage pathway in CRC. Further. there was a step-wise reduction of deoxycholic acid concentration from mucosa to tumors. It appears that to gain a growth advantage. cancer cells may adopt alternate metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis and this flexibility allows them to adapt and thrive in harsh environment.,True,b2YYsN8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,84,https://www.mcponline.org/content/mcprot/early/2010/02/10/mcp.M900551-MCP200.full.pdf,5880735344934395933,/scholar?cites=5880735344934395933,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pehyean_Cheah/publication/41421724_Metabolic_profiling_in_colorectal_cancer_reveals_signature_metabolic_shifts_during_tumorigenesis/links/55b5987f08ae092e96558c78/Metabolic-profiling-in-colorectal-cancer-reveals-signature-metabolic-shifts-during-tumorigenesis.pdf,0,0,0

In October and Novernber 1990 a large number of experimental rneans had been deployed in the area. including additional sounding systems. automated stations at high elevation sites wind profilers. sodars. constant level balloons. and four research airplanes. The rnain focus was on the quantification of the retardation of the cross-mountain flow by the range. but a number of related rnesoscale phenornena had been captured. e.g. the forrnation of lee waves. lee eddies. sheltering areas. and local surface winds. The data interpretation was supported by an extensive effort in rneso-scale numerical rnodelling. and it is argued that only numerical models conveniently qualified by observations. can docurnent the momentum budget in a consistent way.

The imprint of the biomass burning plumes over the Gulf of Guinea showed a well marked intraseasonal variability which is controlled by the position and strength of the southern hemispheric African Easterly Jet (AEJ-S). Three different periods were identified which correspond to active and break phases of the AEJ-S: 25 July–2 August (active phase). 3 August–8 August (break phase) and 9 August–31 August (active phase). During the AEJ-S active phases. the advection of the biomass burning plumes out over the Atlantic ocean was efficient in the mid-troposphere. During the AEJ-S break phases. pollutants emitted by fires were trapped over the continent where they accumulated. The continental circulation increased the possibility for the biomass burning plumes to reach the convective regions located further north. As a consequence. biomass burning plumes were found in the upper troposphere over the Gulf of Guinea during the AEJ-S break phase. Observational evidences from the ozonesounding network at Cotonou and the carbon monoxide measured by MOPITT confirmed the alternation of the AEJ-S phases with low ozone and CO in the mid-troposphere over the Gulf of Guinea during the break phase.,True,R8NK17EAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,67,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/8/3951/2008/,17330872750133861819,/scholar?cites=17330872750133861819,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/8/3951/2008/acp-8-3951-2008.pdf,0,0,0

Measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) columns from the GOME and MOPITT satellite instruments. respectively. are used in conjunction with the GEOS-CHEM global model of transport and tropospheric chemistry to identify the major events of long range transport that reach Europe over the course of summer 2000. Sensitivity model simulations are used to analyse observed O3 distributions with respect to the impact of long range transport events. For that purpose. we used in-situ O3 observations taken at the mountain site of Jungfraujoch as well as O3 vertical profiles taken in the vicinity of central European cities. Over the course of summer 2000. we identified 9 major episodes of transatlantic pollution transport; 7 events are associated with transient cyclones while 2 events occur through zonal transport (e.g. by advection in the strong low-level westerly winds established in summer between the Azores anticyclone and transient cyclones). We find that on average three episodes occur per month with the strongest ones being in June. The number and frequency of long range transport events that reach Europe are driven by the position and strength of the Azores anticyclone. Model sensitivity simulations indicate that the summer mean North American O3 contribution ranges from 3 to 5 ppb (7–11%) in the planetary boundary layer and 10 to 13 ppb (18–23%) in the middle and upper troposphere. During particular episodes. North American sources can result in O3 enhancements up to 25–28 ppb …,True,R8NK17EAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,65,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/6/2057/2006/,8480594243730750674,/scholar?cites=8480594243730750674,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/6/2057/2006/acp-6-2057-2006.pdf,0,0,0

The vertical resolution of the satellite measurements ranges from 2 to 4 km. The analysis has been performed on isentropic surfaces: 400 K (lower stratosphere) for all the species and 360 K (upper troposphere) only for CO.

Modelled as well as assimilated fields of both ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been used in order to better document this event. O3 and CO from Aura/MLS and Terra/MOPITT instruments. respectively. are assimilated into the three-dimensional chemical transport model MOCAGE of Météo-France using a variational 3-D-FGAT (First Guess at Appropriate Time) method. The validation of O3 and CO assimilated fields is done using self-consistency diagnostics and by comparison with independent observations such as MOZAIC (O3 and CO). AIRS (CO) and OMI (O3). It particularly shows in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region that the assimilated fields are closer to MOZAIC than the free model run.

The primary motivation of this study is to use OSSEs to assess how these infrared instruments can constrain different errors affecting AQ hindcasts and forecasts (emissions. meteorology. initial condition and the 3 parameters together). The first instrument (GEO-TIR) has a configuration optimized to monitor O3 and CO in the lowermost troposphere (LmT; defined to be the atmosphere between the surface and 3 km). and the second instrument (GEO-TIR2) is designed to monitor temperature and humidity. Both instruments measure radiances in the same spectral TIR band. Results show that GEO-TIR could have a significant impact (GEO-TIR is closer to the reference atmosphere than GEO-TIR2) on the analyses of O3 and CO LmT column. The information added by the measurements for both instruments is mainly over the Mediterranean Basin and some impact can be found over the Atlantic Ocean and Northern Europe. The impact of GEO-TIR is mainly above 1 km for O3 and CO but can also improve the surface analyses for CO. The analyses of GEO-TIR2 show low impact for O3 LmT column but a significant impact (although still lower than for GEO-TIR) for CO above 1 km.

Since the total column of N2O reflects concentrations in the middle troposphere. cloud-free columnar N2O measurements are used to assess transport processes in the equatorial band (10° S–10° N). We compare the measured data set with the outputs produced by the 3-D chemical-transport model MOCAGE during the period MAM 2002–2004. To reflect MAM 2008 concentrations. MOCAGE results have been scaled by a factor 1.0125 in order to represent the change in concentration of N2O since 2004. IASI N2O equatorial measurements show a maximum over Africa (4.96×10−3 kg m−2) and a minimum over South America (4.86×10−3 kg m−2) in reasonable agreement with the outputs from MOCAGE despite the fact that emissions of N2O are more intense over America than over Africa. The amplitude of the longitudinal variation of total column N2O along the equatorial band is twice as intense in the measurements (~1.6%) than as in the model calculations (~0.8%). and much greater than the IASI mean random error (0.16–0.33%).

The aerosol particles have this effect because cloud droplets must condense on preexisting tiny particles in the same way as dew forms on cold objects; more aerosol particles from human-made emissions lead to larger numbers of smaller cloud droplets. One major pathway for low-level cloud enhancement is through the suppression of rain by reducing cloud droplet sizes. This leaves more water in the cloud for a longer time. thus increasing the cloud cover and water content and thereby reflecting more solar heat to space. This effect is strongest over the oceans. where moisture for sustaining low-level clouds over vast areas is abundant.

The dense rotational structure of the electronic spectrum is characteristic of a b-type transition with a transition moment at 8°±3° to the b-axis. consistent with excitation of the 2PY half of the dimer. A tunneling splitting of 520±10 MHz appears in the spectrum. due to a double proton transfer in 2PY· 2HP. The double proton transfer exchanges the chemical identity of the two monomer units. thereby leading to a double tautomerization. Theoretical calculations suggest that the barrier to such motion is about 8 kcal/mol in the ground state; hence. the observed tautomerization apparently occurs in the excited state.

The spectra of the “tagged” (H2O)n-·Ar clusters indeed exhibit the signature AA band. but assignment of this motif to a particular isomer is complicated by the fact that argon attachment produces significant population of three isomeric forms (as evidenced by their photoelectron spectra). We therefore also investigated the bare clusters since they can be prepared exclusively in the high binding (isomer class I) form.

Using sulfuric acid and a commercial Nafion/silica composite solid acid catalyst (SAC-13). initial kinetics were measured for the reactions of a series of linear chain carboxylic acids (acetic. propionic. butyric. hexanoic. and caprylic acid) with methanol at 60 °C. It was found that reaction rate decreased as the number of carbons in the linear alkyl chain increased for both H2SO4 and SAC-13.

A mechanism of reduction is proposed based on spectroscopic measurements of the surface phases before and after H2 treatment at 400 °C. Cobalt oxide Co3O4 is present on all air-calcined catalysts. and is reduced rapidly to CoO at temperatures >300 °C in hydrogen. CoO is then more slowly reduced to Co metal on the unpromoted catalysts at 400 °C. If the promoters MgO and ThO2 are present. a reaction between CoO and promoter can occur resulting in new phases which are more resistant to reduction than CoO alone.

Metal atoms can be formed by thermally vaporizing metals under vacuum. The enhanced reactivity of metal atoms compared with bulk metals is partly due to the endothermicity of the atoms and partly due to kinetic factors. The desired atom–molecule reaction will compete only if there is a large excess of the organic molecules; atom–molecule ratios of 1:10 to 1:50 are commonly used to obtain acceptable yields of organometallic products based on the metal vapor condensed.

The formation of these nanoparticles confounds the use of soluble Zn salts as positive controls during cytotoxicity testing of other Zn-containing nanoparticles. such as ZnO. These nanoprecipitates can either be crystalline or amorphous and vary in composition depending upon the concentration of Zn(II) within the medium. The cytotoxicity and immune system response of these nanoparticles in situ are similar to those of 30 nm ZnO nanoparticles. The low residual level of truly soluble Zn species (taken as species passing through a 2 kDa membrane) in cell culture media with serum is insufficient to elicit any appreciable cytotoxicity.

Electrochemical methods were chosen for this purpose and the results show that they all act as mixed-type corrosion inhibitors under tested conditions. According to the potentiodynamic polarization results inhibition efficiency at corrosion potential increases in the following order imidazole < purine < adenine < 6-benzylaminopurine. which is in agreement with the expectation that the increase of molecular weight and number of heteroatoms in the molecule leads to the increase of inhibition efficiency degree. In the broader potential range. adenine is more efficient. The mechanism of inhibitor action includes adsorption on copper surface that fits the Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

The PVC based membrane of (I) with DBBP as plasticizer and having anion excluder. NaTPB in the ratio PVC: I: NaTPB: DBBP (150: 10: 2: 200) gave the best results in terms of working concentration range (1.3× 10-5-1.0× 10-1 M) with a Nernstian slope (30.0 mV/decade of activity). The useful pH range of the sensor is 3.0–7.4. beyond which a drift in potential was observed. The response time of the sensor is 10s and the lifetime was about 2 months during which it could be used without any measurable divergence. It had good stability and reproducibility. The membrane worked satisfactorily in non-aqueous medium up to 40%(v/v) non-aqueous content. The selectivity coefficient values indicate that the electrode is highly selective for Zn 2+ over a number of other cations except Na+ and Cd 2+. Although Na+ and Cd 2+ are likely to cause some interference. they would not interfere if present at the concentrations< 1× 10-5 and< 5× 10-5 M. respectively.

Ltd.,Tip‐enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) spectroscopy is a promising technique for nanoscale chemical analysis. However. there are several challenges preventing widespread application of this technology. including reproducible fabrication of efficient TERS probes. These problems reflect a lack of clear understanding of the origins of. and the parameters influencing TERS. It is believed that the coating characteristics at the apex of the tip have a major effect on the near‐field optical enhancement and thus the TERS activity of a metalized probe. Here we show that the aspect ratio of the tip can play a significant role in the efficiency of TERS probes.

A major obstacle that prohibits a wider application range is the low frame capture rate. The speed of FM-AFM is limited by the low bandwidth of the automatic gain control (AGC) and frequency demodulation loops. In this work we describe a novel algorithm that can be used to overcome these weaknesses. We analysed the settling times of the proposed loops and that of the complete system. and we found that an approximately 70-fold improvement can be achieved over the existing real and virtual atomic force microscopes.

We report that the electrochemical properties of a promising negative electrode material. Na2Ti3O7. are improved by exfoliating its layered structure and forming 2D nanoscale morphologies. nanoplatelets. and nanosheets. Exfoliation of Na2Ti3O7 was carried out by controlling the amount of proton exchange for Na+ and then proceeding with the intercalation of larger cations such as methylammonium and propylammonium. An optimized mixture of nanoplatelets and nanosheets exhibited the best electrochemical performance in terms of high capacities in the range of 100–150 mA h g–1 at high rates with stable cycling over several hundred cycles.

We demonstrate here that transition metal chalcogels of approximate formula MoS3.4 achieve a high gravimetric capacity close to 600 mAh g–1 (close to 1000 mAh g–1 on a sulfur basis) as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Transition metal chalcogels are amorphous and comprise polysulfide chains connected by inorganic linkers. The linkers appear to act as a “glue” in the electrode to prevent polysulfide shuttling. The Mo chalcogels function as electrodes in carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes. which further provides evidence of polysulfide solubility not being a limiting issue.

Here. we develop a novel graphene-capped multichannel array sample platform that extends the capabilities of photoelectron spectromicroscopy to routine liquid and atmospheric pressure studies with standard PEEM setups. Using this platform. we show that graphene has only a minor influence on the electronic structure of water in the first few layers and thus will allow for the examination of minimally perturbed aqueous-phase interfacial dynamics.

Linear dichroism in the carbon 1s → σ*C-C transition has been interpreted within a building block model and a molecular orbital model. leading to two different descriptions for the angular dependence of this feature. When used for measurement of molecular orientation. the application of these two different models will lead to different results. We have explored the linear dichroism in the carbon 1s NEXAFS spectra of single crystals of the linear n-alkane hexacontane (n-C60H122). An analysis of the angular dependence in this spectrum shows that the transition dipole moment associated with the carbon 1s → σ*C-C transition is oriented along the macromolecular chain axis. contradicting the predictions of the building block model.

This study will advance the knowledge of heavy metal water pollution in China from a spatial–temporal perspective. Specifically. this study addressed the following:(1) spatial patterns of heavy metal water pollution levels were analyzed using data of prefecture-level cities from 2004 to 2011; and (2) spatial statistical methods were used to examine the underlying socioeconomic and physical factors behind water pollution including socioeconomic transitions (industrialization. urbanization. globalization and economic development). and environmental characteristic (natural resources. hydrology and vegetation coverage). The results show that only Cr pollution levels increased over the years. The individual pollution levels of the other four heavy metals. As. Cd. Hg. and Pb. declined. High heavy metal water pollution levels are closely associated with both anthropogenic activities and physical environments. in particular abundant mineral resources and industrialization prosperity.

The main advantages of the modified UNIFAC method are a better description of the temperature dependence and the real behavior in the dilute regionand that it can be applied more reliably for systems involving molecules very different in size.

Thermodynamic models are used to predict IDACs since experimental data can be difficult and costly to obtain. The models most often employed for predictive purposes are the “original and modified UNIFAC Group Contribution Methods” (GCMs). COSMO-RS (COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents) is an alternative predictive method for a wide variety of systems that requires a limited minimum number of input parameters. A significant difference between GCMs and COSMO-RS is that a given GCMs' predictive ability is dependent on the availability of group interaction parameters. whereas COSMO-RS is only limited by the availability of individual component parameters.

It allows the creation of hierarchical bi‐porous features that work in tandem to enhance gas uptake capacity and separation. Smaller pores from UBUs promote selectivity. while larger inter‐UBU packing pores increase uptake capacity. The effectiveness of this UBU strategy is shown with a cobalt MOF (denoted SNNU‐45) in which octahedral cages with 4.5 Å pore size serve as UBUs. The C2H2 uptake capacity at 1 atm reaches 193.0 cm3 g−1 (8.6 mmol g−1) at 273 K and 134.0 cm3 g−1 (6.0 mmol g−1) at 298 K.

We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database. our objectives were: 1. to determine if H: D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests. including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 2. to ascertain if the H: D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (eg stand-level basal area.

Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (P V). dry season length (S D). and mean annual air temperature (T A) emerged as key drivers of variation in H: D relationships at the pantropical and region scales.

We estimate the effect of incorporating H on tropics-wide forest biomass estimates in 327 plots across four continents using 42 656 H and diameter measurements and harvested trees from 20 sites to answer the following questions: 1. What is the best H-model form and geographic unit to include in biomass models to minimise site-level uncertainty in estimates of destructive biomass? 2. To what extent does including H estimates derived in (1) reduce uncertainty in biomass estimates across all 327 plots? 3. What effect does accounting for H have on plot-and continental-scale forest biomass estimates? The mean relative error in biomass estimates of destructively harvested trees when including H (mean 0.06). was half that when excluding H (mean 0.13). Power-and Weibull-H models provided the greatest reduction in uncertainty. with regional Weibull-H models preferred because they reduce uncertainty in smaller-diameter classes (≤ 40 cm D) that store about one-third of biomass per hectare in most forests. Propagating the relationships from destructively harvested tree biomass to each of the 327 plots from across the tropics shows that including H reduces errors from 41.8 Mg ha− 1 (range 6.6 to 112.4) to 8.0 Mg ha− 1 (− 2.5 to 23.0).

With a hierarchical Bayesian approach. we quantified the distribution of mortality and growth rates of all tree species at each site. This allowed us to test the prediction that demographic differences facilitate species richness. as suggested by the theory that a tradeoff between high growth and high survival allows species to coexist.

This pervasive alteration of mature tropical forests was attributed to global environmental change. such as an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. nutrient deposition. temperature. drought frequency. and/or irradiance. We used standardized. repeated measurements of over 2 million trees in ten large (16–52 ha each) forest plots on three continents to evaluate the generality of these findings across tropical forests. Aboveground biomass increased at seven of our ten plots. significantly so at four plots. and showed a large decrease at a single plot. Carbon accumulation pooled across sites was significant (+0.24 MgC ha−1 y−1. 95% confidence intervals [0.07. 0.39] MgC ha−1 y−1). but lower than reported previously for Amazonia. At three sites for which we had data for multiple census intervals. we found no concerted increase in biomass gain. in conflict with the increased productivity hypothesis. Over all ten plots. the fastest-growing quartile of species gained biomass (+0.33 [0.09. 0.55] % y−1) compared with the tree community as a whole (+0.15 % y−1); however. this significant trend was due to a single plot. Biomass of slow-growing species increased significantly when calculated over all plots (+0.21 [0.02. 0.37] % y−1). and in half of our plots when calculated individually.

One prominent hypothesis suggests that rare species are at an advantage because trees have lower survival in areas of high conspecific density due to increased attack by natural enemies. a process known as negative density dependence (NDD). A consensus is emerging that NDD is important for plant‐species coexistence in tropical forests. Most evidence comes from short‐term studies. but testing the prediction that NDD decreases the spatial aggregation of tree populations provides a long‐term perspective. While spatial distributions have provided only weak evidence for NDD so far. the opposing effects of environmental heterogeneity might have confounded previous analyses.

Given the longevity of large trees and the scarcity of appropriately long-term demographic data. standing size distributions are a potential tool for predicting species' responses to disturbances and resultant changes in population structure. Here we test the utility of several different measures of size distribution for predicting subsequent population changes at the intraspecific level using demographic records from two subsampled 50-ha tree plots in Malaysia (Pasoh and Lambir). Most measures of size distribution failed to successfully predict population change better than random; however. the 'coefficient of skewness' (a measure of the relative proportion of small vs. large stems in a population) was able to correctly predict the direction of population change for approximately three-quarters of species at both sites.

Comparison of estimated parameters of self-pollen affinity between high density undisturbed and low density selectively logged forests indicated that self-pollen was selectively excluded from mating in the former. probably due to partial self incompatibility or inbreeding depression until seed maturation. By estimating the self-pollen affinity of each mother tree in both forests. mother trees with higher amount of self-pollen indicated significance of self-pollen affinity with negative estimated value. The exclusion of self-fertilization and/or inbreeding depression during seed maturation occurred in the mother trees with large female fecundity. whereas reproductive assurance increased self-fertilization in the mother trees with lower female fecundity.,True,i4B30ngAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123445,6722558463857521219,/scholar?cites=6722558463857521219,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123445,0,0,0

This was primarily suggested by the highly heterogeneous body matrix mineralogy due to the presence of a large variety of minerals such as haematite. quartz. rutile and feldspar species. while the slip coating was basically made of haematite alone.

Dordrecht,In chemistry education. micro–macro thinking using structure–property relations is considered as a key conceptual area for students. However. it is difficult but challenging for students and teachers. In this chapter. we have redefined this domain in terms of a coherent set of philosophical. substantive and pedagogical substructures. Starting from the philosophy that chemistry should be considered as a human activity. scientific and technological developments are interrelated with issues in society and part of our cultures.

This framework identifies five integrated moral elements of care – attentiveness. responsibility. competence. responsiveness and trust. This paper explicates on each of these elements to evaluate the piloting and implementation of a teaching and learning professional development model at a South African higher education institution. The political ethics of care was found to be a useful normative framework for a group of higher educators to reflect on the process of engaging in teaching and learning professional development in that it revealed the importance of differential power relations. the importance of working collaboratively and being attentive to the needs of both caregivers and care receivers.,True,OLRCZO8AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,46,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13562517.2014.880681,3909391649923212397,/scholar?cites=3909391649923212397,,https://repository.uwc.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10566/1301/Bozalek_ProfDevEthicsOfCare_2014.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Two conditions for meaningful activities were identified: (1) students should be motivated to attain a certain goal and (2) they should have rudimentary conceptual and procedural knowledge of how to attain that goal. Together. these were expected to serve as an advance organizer for functional activities. In a professional practice. professionals know more or less how the activities they perform are going to contribute to the objective they want to achieve. We expected that this structure of means‐end relationships could be adapted to yield advance organizers for educational use. This idea emerged from two previous research cycles.

Firstly. the goals of these programmes are discussed and related to the concept of empowerment. Next. in a selection of empirical studies. four general strategies for professional development are analysed (providing access to innovative units. organising reflection. collaboration and organising the design of innovative units by teachers). This analysis results in two outcomes: (1) a sequence of events for teacher-based and context-based curriculum design and (2) the conclusion that in these studies explicit relations between the goals. the strategies and the activities in these programmes are lacking; they should be made more explicit.

Dordrecht,In this paper we elaborate on three potential strategies to promote meaningful chemistry education: using relevant contexts. offering content on a need-to-know basis. and making students feel that their input matters. We illustrate that it is educationally worthwhile to incorporate these characteristics. through our work on a particular chemistry module. Such emphasis leads to concrete. empirically based designs of modules and to heuristic guidelines for educational design decisions. It also productively informs further theorizing. such as an improved conceptualisation of the relations between the three characteristics.

The difficulty in modifying arginine residues lies in the fact that they are less reactive than lysine residues. Consequently. typical chemo-selective reactions which employ “kinetic” selectivity (active esters. Michael addition. etc.) cannot be used to target these residues. The chemistry exploited herein relies on “thermodynamic” selectivity to achieve selective modification of arginine residues. ω-Methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) bearing an α-oxo-aldehyde group was synthesized and used to demonstrate the selective modification of lysozyme at arginine residues.

One validated approach for addressing this issue is to process them into colloidal dispersions known as “nanocrystals” (NCs). However.

In addition. the stabilizer provides a means of anchoring targeting moieties to the NCs for achieving deposition or uptake at specified locations.

OC33S. OC34S and O13CS from 195 to 260 nm. The OCS isotopologues were synthesized from isotopically-enriched elemental sulfur by reaction with carbon monoxide. The measured cross section of OC32S is consistent with literature spectra recorded using natural abundance samples. Relative to the spectrum of the most abundant isotopologue. substitution of heavier rare isotopes has two effects. First. as predicted by the reflection principle. the Gaussian-based absorption envelope becomes slightly narrower and blue-shifted. Second. as predicted by Franck-Condon considerations. the weak vibrational structure is red-shifted. Sulfur isotopic fractionation constants (33ε. 34ε) as a function of wavelength are not highly structured. and tend to be close to zero on average on the high energy side and negative on the low energy side. The integrated photolysis rate of each isotopologue at 20 km. the approximate altitude at which most OCS photolysis occurs. was calculated. Sulfur isotopic fractionation constants at 20 km altitude are (−3.7 ± 4.5)‰ and (1.1 ± 4.2)‰ for 33ε and 34ε. respectively. which is inconsistent with the previously estimated large fractionation of over 73‰ in 34ε. This demonstrates that OCS photolysis does not produce sulfur isotopic fractionation of more than ca. 5‰. suggesting OCS may indeed be a significant source of background stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Finally. the predicted isotopic fractionation constant for 33S excess (33E) in OCS photolysis is (−4.2 ± 6.6)‰. and thus photolysis of OCS is not expected to be the source of the non-mass …,True,CVtvNmQAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,48,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/10293/2011/,1072011584662400538,/scholar?cites=1072011584662400538,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/10293/2011/acp-11-10293-2011.pdf,0,0,0

The reduction of O2 obeys the Levich equation. The inhibition of the copper corrosion in aerated 3% NaCl solution was studied by using potentiodynamic polarisation and linear polarisation resistance (LRP) in the presence of different concentrations of a bipyrazolic compound named N.N-bis (3-carbomethoxy-5-methylpyrazol-1-ylmethyl) cyclohexylamine (BiPyA). The presence of this compound in the solution decreases the corrosion current density and increases the linear resistance polarisation. The inhibition efficiencies obtained from cathodic Tafel plots and LRP methods are in good agreement.

The disproportionation reaction 2CuI + L → Cu0 + CuII(L) is the crucial step. as it continuously provides the active species for both the initiation (Cu0) and the reversible termination step (CuII).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The first example of living radical polymerization of vinyl chloride carried out in water at 25 °C is reported. This polymerization was initiated by iodoform and catalyzed by nascent Cu0 produced by the disproportionation of CuI in the presence of strongly CuII binding ligands such as tris(2‐aminoethyl)amine or polyethyleneimine. The resulting poly(vinyl chloride) was free of structural defects. had controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution. contained two ∼CHClI active chain ends. and had a higher syndiotacticity (62%) than the one obtained by conventional free‐radical polymerization at the same temperature (56%). This novel polymerization proceeds. most probably. by a combination of competitive pathways that involves activation by single electron transfer mediated by nascent Cu0 and degenerative chain transfer. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Non‐transition metal‐catalyzed living radical polymerization (LRP) of vinyl chloride (VC) in water at 25–35 °C is reported. This polymerization is initiated with iodoform and catalyzed by Na2S2O4. In water. S2O dissociates into SO that mediates the initiation and reactivation steps via a single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The exchange between dormant and active propagating species also includes the degenerative chain transfer to dormant species (DT). In addition. the SO2 released from SO during the SET process can add reversibly to poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) radicals and provide additional transient dormant ∼SO radicals.

In cobalt hangman porphyrins. a carboxylic acid group on a xanthene backbone is positioned over a metalloporphyrin to serve as a proton relay.

In case the core space of the pores remains open. such conventional SILPs exhibit lack of gas absorption specificity. while complete pore filling leads to diffusivity that is very low compared to that for corresponding bulk ILs; the latter drop is largely due to the high tortuosity of the pore network of the support. The inverse SILPs prepared in this work exhibited promising CO2/N2 separation performance that had reached the value of 20 at …,True,8nrx1_4AAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,41,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp5062946,8387054627351337732,/scholar?cites=8387054627351337732,,http://pstorage-acs-6854636.s3.amazonaws.com/3877909/jp5062946_si_001.pdf,0,0,0

Based on sorption measurements. it was concluded that asymmetric activation occurs mainly due to the pre-formulated rigid shape of the composite membrane. In the case of skin samples. the observed low-pressure hysteresis was attributed to the existence of constrictions. which hinder the access of gas molecules to certain micropores.

Our experience has shown that the evaluation of real scientometric systems needs compromises among the parties interested and between the practical applicability and the theoretical requirements of scientometrics.,True,63EXpt0AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,68,https://www.jstor.org/stable/24105076,11095461202436285898,/scholar?cites=11095461202436285898,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Vinkler/publication/243775762_Evaluation_of_the_publication_activity_of_research_teams_by_means_of_scientometric_indicators/links/0a85e53b26e6d9c1cd000000/Evaluation-of-the-publication-activity-of-research-teams-by-means-of-scientometric-indicators.pdf,0,0,0
1129214,Subfield problems in applying the Garfield (Impact) Factors in practice,2002,Péter Vinkler,53,Scientometrics,2,267-279,Kluwer Academic Publishers,The assessment of the publications of research teams working on different subfields raises concerns because of the different scientometric features of the subfields. For equalizing the differences in the Garfield (Impact) Factors of journals. several methods applied in practice have been described. A new indicator – Specific Impact Contribution (SIC) relating the citation share of a respective team (or journal) in the total citations of the teams (or journals) evaluated to its share in publications – was introduced. It has been realized that the normalized Garfield Factors and the normalized SIC values are identical measures within any selected set of journals. Consequently. the Garfield Factor of a journal should be assumed as an indicator characterizing the contribution of the information channel as a whole. appropriately.,True,63EXpt0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,65,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014860726532,1231286951710039884,/scholar?cites=1231286951710039884,,,0,0,0

This concentration level is not enough for sufficient acceleration of the photobleaching or trap‐generation in the photoactive layer and therefore such short treatment (100 minutes) does not affect the short‐circuit current of the device.

However. the published data on this effect are very limited and none of them includes analysis of light intensity dependence of the key cell parameters. We report such analysis for bulk heterojunction solar cells of various sizes and suggest that the origin of both the size and the light intensity effects should include underlying physical mechanisms other than conventional series resistance dissipation. In particular. we conclude that the distributed nature of the ITO resistance and its influence on the voltage dependence of photocurrent and dark current is the key to understanding size limitation of the organic photovoltaics (OPV) efficiency.

The results suggest that the radical reaction responsible for the photodegradation takes place at terminal thiophene rings exposed at points were the conjugation is broken. This proposed mechanism is supported by the fact that stability scales with regio-regularity following the ratio of head-to-tail connected thiophene units.

Inc,Organic photovoltaics (OPV) is a promising field. which may become one of the solutions to the challenge of moving energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy technologies. The field has been subject to extensive research. and practical devices using OPV have been demonstrated on a large scale (1). This chapter describes the field of OPV with a focus on the materials and cell processing. A general introduction to solar cell technology and OPV is given. This is followed by an extensive discussion of the different materials applied within OPV and how they affect the overall cell performance. Additionally. the processing of OPV is described and the approaches to large-scale production. where the ambitious perspective is a production capacity of 1 GWpeak per day based on only abundant elements. In 2009. the worldwide energy consumption was 12.186 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe). With continuous industrialization. growth in human welfare. and growth in the human population. it is clear that energy demands will only increase in the future. Consequently. from 2009 to 2010. the worldwide energy consumption increased by 5.4%. Energy is normally obtained from the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal. gas. and oil. for which there is a limited supply. At present. fossil sources of energy are being harvested at a high pace implying that in terms of present-day reserve-to-production ratio. the planet is only left with 126 years of coal. 60 years of natural gas. and 54 years of oil (2).

1129276,Concentrated Light for Organic Photovoltaics,2012,Thomas Tromholt,,Stability and Degradation of Organic and Polymer Solar Cells,,,John Wiley & Sons,Concentrated light within the field of OPV has only recently been studied and therefore the entire field is relatively undiscovered. However. the first demonstrations of this technique have shown a large potential. A wide range of applications have already been studied ranging from using concentrated light as a practical tool to accelerate OPV degradation to using it as a new physical environment for solar cell analysis. This chapter gives an overview of what has been established within the field of concentrated light for OPV. A presentation of the different techniques used for obtaining concentrated light is given to provide an understanding of the conditions for the experimental work. This is followed by a presentation of examples of experimental work conducted using concentrated light on OPV. First. an example of using concentrated light as an acceleration parameter for the degradation of semiconducting polymers is given. Then. the response of organic solar cells under operation to concentrated sunlight is presented. Finally. an application of concentrated sunlight used as a physical probe to get a deeper understanding of the physics of the operation of organic solar cells is given. Conventionally. concentrated light was developed in relation to concentrated photovoltaics (CPV). The concept behind this technology is to focus sunlight from a large area through optical components. the collector. down to a small area. the absorber.

In thin films the polymers had optical band gaps in the range of 1.64-1.80 eV. For solubility the polymers have incorporated alkyl groups on the SDT unit and thermally removable ester groups on the DTZ unit that can be eliminated around 200 C for improved photochemical stability in thin films. The bulkiness of the alkyl chains on the SDT unit proved to be very significant in terms of photovoltaic performance of the polymer: PCBM solar cells. Polymers based on 4. 4-dihexyl-4H-silolo [3. 2-b: 4. 5-b′] dithiophene reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 1.45% but changing the alkyl groups to more bulky ethylhexyl chains reduced the PCE to 1.17%. More noteworthy is that the photovoltaic performance improves for the polymers based on 4. 4-dihexyl-4H-silolo [3. 2-b: 4. 5-b′] dithiophene after the ester groups has been eliminated from the DTZ unit by a thermal treatment around 200 C. To confirm that elimination of the solubilizing groups improve the long term durability of the materials the photochemical stability was estimated by a novel accelerated degradation method by which the photobleaching of the polymer was followed during degradation at 100 solar intensities.

We describe the structure of the cytosolic ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 and identify a multiligand-binding site important in regulating channel sensitivity within the TRPV1-ARD. The structure reveals a binding site that accommodates triphosphate nucleotides such as ATP. and biochemical studies demonstrate that calmodulin binds the same site.

While the linker regions for the EC1’-EC2’ and EC3’-EC4’ pairs display binding of three Ca2+ ions similar to that of vertebrate cadherins. domains EC2’ and EC3’ are joined in a “kinked” orientation by a previously uncharacterized Ca2+-free linker.

Sdks mediate cell-cell adhesion with homophilic specificity that underlies their neuronal targeting function. Here we report crystal structures of Sdk1 and Sdk2 ectodomain regions. revealing similar homodimers mediated by the four N-terminal immunoglobulin domains (Ig1–4). arranged in a horseshoe conformation. These Ig1–4 horseshoes interact in a novel back-to-back orientation in both homodimers through Ig1:Ig2. Ig1:Ig1 and Ig3:Ig4 interactions. Structure-guided mutagenesis results show that this canonical dimer is required for both Sdk-mediated cell aggregation (via trans interactions) and Sdk clustering in isolated cells (via cis interactions). Sdk1/Sdk2 recognition specificity is encoded across Ig1–4. with Ig1–2 conferring the majority of binding affinity and differential specificity. We suggest that competition between cis and trans interactions provides a novel mechanism to sharpen the specificity of cell-cell interactions.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19058.001,True,FxrU-U4AAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC,29,https://elifesciences.org/articles/19058,16078823907684893857,/scholar?cites=16078823907684893857,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/19058.pdf,0,0,0

Very high selectivity towards cinnamyl alcohol together with high activity have been obtained provided a high temperature treatment of the catalyst is performed. HRTEM.

To explore the potential of this reaction. we first considered the system Fe-Co-B which has been investigated by other authors [3]. with the aim of examining the characteristics of the product obtained in the easiest way and without any particular precautions.An aqueous solution of FeSO 4 and CoCl 2 with ratio Fe/Co= 7/3 was dropped into excess 2 M KBH4 kept in an ice bath. and vigorously stirrea. The fine black precipitate. when washed with water and with acetone. is highly pyroforic; a stable product was. however. obtained by slowly drying the wet precipitate in air. Chemical analysis of the sample. gave Fe37ColT-B1503~ composition. As in other preparations carried out in air [4]. a non-negligible portion of the product (about 13% in weight) is oxygen.

The anionophoric activity of these molecules showed a parabolic dependence with lipophilicity. with an optimum range for transport efficiency.

While the optimal value of log P and the curvature of the parabolic dependence is a property of the membrane (and so similar for the different series of substituents) we found that for relatively simple substituents in certain locations on the tambjamine core. hydrophobic interactions clearly dominate. but for others. more specific interactions are present that change the position of the membrane …,True,3IwvbMcAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,35,https://pubs.rsc.org/hy/content/articlehtml/2016/sc/c5sc03932k,12417866423868656439,/scholar?cites=12417866423868656439,,https://pubs.rsc.org/hy/content/articlehtml/2016/sc/c5sc03932k,0,0,0

As a result. four separate binding affinity scales (ladders) including thirty-eight receptors were obtained with the scales anchored to indolocarbazole. The results indicate that the binding strength is largely. but not fully. determined by the strength of the primary hydrogen-bonding interaction. The latter in turn is largely determined by the basicity of the anion. The higher is the basicity of the anion the stronger in general is the binding. leading to the approximate order of increasing binding strength. lactate< benzoate< acetate trimethylacetate. which holds with all investigated receptors. Nevertheless. there are a number of occasions when the binding order changes with changing of the carboxylate anion. sometimes quite substantially. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that this is primarily connected to preferential binding of trimethylacetate. supposedly caused by an additional hydrophobic/solvophobic interaction.

It is widespread in Spain. Southern Italy and Turkey and from the Middle Eastern countries to Afghanistan. Usually. its drupes are ground into a deep-red or purple powder used as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine to add a lemony taste to salads and meat. In Turkish cuisine. it is added to the salad served with kebab and lahmacun bread. Thus. the majority of studies on R. coriaria species (antimicrobial activity) have focused only on its fruits. and little is known about the biological activity and mass spectrometric characterization of the constituents of its leaves [1. 2]. The antioxidant activity of fruit extracts of R. coriaria has been demonstrated only in cell-free models of oxidative stress (inhibition of superoxide anion formation from the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. inhibition of lipid peroxidation. etc.[2. 3]).The leaves contain large amounts of hydrolysable gallotannins which have never been structurally characterized with physicochemical techniques (mass spectrometry and NMR) but are extensively employed in tanning leather [4]. Erdèlyi et al.[5] suggested that the gallotanninsʼ anti-inflammatory activity may arise from free radical scavenging and from inhibition of the expression of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines. as well as action on eNOS isoforms and cyclooxygenase (COX).

The method was performed in a sealed reaction tube and offered more sensitive. fast. high-throughput. and cost-effective detection. The SP was designed with a fluorophore at the 3′-end. and the fluorescence was quenched by a GGG-triplet at the 5′-end without any other additional quenchers.

The values. on account of the large dE(x)/dt measured. are higher than those found for V6O13 or TiS2.,True,ObV0lQgAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167273887900178,4609302650135637519,/scholar?cites=4609302650135637519,,,0,0,0

High catalyst turnover numbers and sometimes high enantiomeric excess were observed. New catalytic reactions with metalloporphyrins have recently been reported; these are the olefination of aldehydes and cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes.

Its reduction mechanism gives rise at first. in a 3-electron process. to an irreversible species involving the formation of radical anions. Successively. a direct two-electron reduction of other quinone groups occurs. This second step. which involves 4 e in quasi-thermodynamic conditions. is reversible and allows cells of the type Li/LiClO4-PC.DME/NBHQ.C to be cycled for more than 500 cycles at the C/2 rate between 3.5 and 2.0 V.
