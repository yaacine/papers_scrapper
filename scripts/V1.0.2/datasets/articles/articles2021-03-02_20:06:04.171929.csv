1107902,CFD simulation of cross-ventilation for a generic isolated building: impact of computational parameters,2012,R Ramponi and B Blocken,53,Building and Environment,,34-48,Pergamon,Accurate CFD simulation of coupled outdoor wind flow and indoor air flow is essential for the design and evaluation of natural cross-ventilation strategies for buildings. It is widely recognized that CFD simulations can be very sensitive to the large number of computational parameters that have to be set by the user. Therefore. detailed and generic sensitivity analyses of the impact of these parameters on the simulation results are important to provide guidance for the execution and evaluation of future CFD studies. A detailed review of the literature indicates that there is a lack of extensive generic sensitivity studies for CFD simulation of natural cross-ventilation. In order to provide such a study. this paper presents a series of coupled 3D steady RANS simulations for a generic isolated building. The CFD simulations are validated based on detailed wind tunnel experiments with Particle Image Velocimetry.

It is strongly influenced by wind speed and direction. which in turn are affected by urban morphology. This paper first provides a detailed review of the literature for CFD studies of outdoor ventilation for generic urban configurations. The review indicates that there is a clear lack of studies for urban configurations where not all parallel streets have equal street widths. Next. the paper presents Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of outdoor ventilation for generic configurations with parallel streets of equal and unequal street widths.

To estimate wind-induced ventilation. pressure coefficients (Cp) on the building envelope are key inputs. as well as local wind speed and direction. Cp data obtained by primary sources such as measurements or CFD simulations are considered the most reliable but can be difficult to obtain. An easy alternative are Cp secondary sources. such as databases providing literature data correlations. Therefore an issue arises regarding the choice of the source of pressure coefficients.This paper investigates the effects of Cp from primary and secondary sources on the predicted energy saving potential of night ventilation of an isolated office building for several European climates and some relevant design conditions and simulation parameters.

However. the impact of the latter factors on the effectiveness of night-ventilation is often disregarded. altering the predicted building energy performance. Building Energy Simulation tools coupled with Airflow Network models allow estimating the effect of the urban environment on the cooling energy savings due to night-ventilation. Nevertheless. external sources of wind flow data are needed to account for the wind shielding effect of surrounding buildings.In this paper. the cooling effectiveness of night-ventilation for an office building placed in the center of urban areas of increased density is analyzed for three European locations.

The computational grid is based on a grid-sensitivity analysis and the computational model is successfully validated using PIV measurements for a generic isolated building from literature.

1107909,A computational study on the influence of urban morphology on wind-induced outdoor ventilation,2012,R Rubina Ramponi and BJE Blocken,,,,,International Environmental Modelling and Software Society (iEMSs),Accurate modeling of urban wind flow is important for the assessment of the natural ventilation of the outdoor environment and therefore for outdoor air quality. Different geometrical levels of analysis can be used. ranging from regular arrays of obstacles to real and complex case studies. In order to avoid the complexity of real case studies and to obtain more generic results. regular arrays of obstacles represent a suitable level to study the relation between urban morphology and outdoor ventilation. This paper presents the first results of a numerical study with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of isothermal wind flow in generic urban configurations. Nine urban configurations are defined with regular arrays of obstacles by increasing the plan area density (from 0.1 to 0.6) and the frontal area density (from 0.02 to 0.45). By this variation. the flow structure varies from isolated obstacle flow over wake interference flow to skimming flow. Among the nine configurations defined. four test cases are selected for a preliminary study. 3D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations are performed for the four selected configurations and the simulations are compared with experimental wind-tunnel data. An overall fairly good agreement is found between the experimental and numerical results obtained with RANS simulations. The results allow establishing some relationships between morphological and fluid dynamics parameters of urban wind flow and outdoor ventilation. It is found that the upstream building density can cause a decrease of up to the 70% of the ventilation rate in the central street.

1107910,Evaluation of wind-driven ventilation in building energy simulation: Sensitivity to pressure coefficients,2011,Rubina Ramponi and Daniel Cóstola and Adriana Angelotti and B Blocken and JLM Hensen,,,,,Lausanne. CISBAT,Building Energy Simulation (BES) tools integrate wind-driven ventilation in buildings either by imposing the airflow rate in a Zone-Airflow module or by calculating it through Airflow Network (AFN) models. When the AFN models are used. pressure coefficients are crucial for obtaining accurate results. This is particularly important in case of complex geometries or buildings with large openings. when the uncertainties related with the use of simplified models are higher and can affect the results. This paper describes a preliminary study on the effects of the pressure coefficients on the BES simulations of a cross-ventilated building with large openings. The single-zone building has a high thermal mass and is subjected to windinduced night ventilation. Simulations are performed with the Zone-Airflow module and the AFN model within the code EnergyPlus. The airflow rate imposed in the Zone-Airflow module is obtained by performing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the opened-building (ie the building with ventilation openings). The pressure coefficients used for the AFN simulations are obtained in five different ways:(i) the surface-averaged calculation in EnergyPlus.(ii) the Air Ventilation and Infiltration centre (AIVC) database.(iii) the Tokyo Polytechnic University (TPU) database.(iv) wind-tunnel measurements and (v) CFD simulations performed on a closed (sealed) building (ie the building with ventilation openings closed).

In addition. it allows efficient parametric studies and the simultaneous (ie coupled) simulation of outdoor wind flow and indoor air flow. In this paper. CFD for coupled wind-induced natural ventilation is evaluated by comparison with detailed wind tunnel measurements with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The focus is a parametric analysis of the influence of the inflow turbulent kinetic energy and the near-wall treatment on the predicted indoor mean velocity pattern. The 3D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved with the RNG ke turbulence model for a generic isolated building model with large openings.

However. the primary method of synthetic ammonia production. the Haber Bosch process. is resource demanding and unsustainable. Here we report a novel ammonia production strategy. exemplified in an electrochemical lithium cycling process. which provides a pathway to sustainable ammonia synthesis via the ability to directly couple to renewable sources of electricity and can facilitate localized production. Whereas traditional aqueous electrochemical approaches are typically dominated by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). we are able to circumvent the HER by using a stepwise approach which separates the reduction of N2 from subsequent protonation to NH3. thus our synthesis method is predominantly selective for ammonia production.

Unfortunately. film morphologies vary from sample to sample. often with undesirable characteristics such as folded sheets and patchwise depositions. In conventional Langmuir–Blodgett deposition of graphene oxide. alcohol (typically methanol) is used to spread the graphene oxide sheets onto an air–water interface before deposition onto substrates.

Conventional Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) deposition is often considered to give the highest degree of morphology control. but film microstructures still vary widely between GO samples. The main challenge is in the sensitive self-assembly of GO samples with different sheet sizes and degrees of oxidation. To overcome this drawback. here. we identify a general method that relies on robust assembly between GO and a cationic surfactant (cationic surfactant-assisted LB). We systematically compared conventional LB and cationic surfactant-assisted LB for three common GO samples of widely different sheet sizes and degrees of oxidation.

Based on its surface atomic properties. CeO2 is one of the most common supports for stabilizing single metal atoms. Many single atom catalysts are limited in their metal contents by the formation of metal nanoparticles once the catalyst support capacity for single atoms has been exceeded. Currently. there are no direct measurements to determine the capacity of a support to stabilize single atoms. In this work we develop a nanoparticle-based technique that allows for quantification of that capacity by redispersing Ru nanoparticles into single atoms and taking advantage of the different catalytic properties of Ru single atoms and nanoparticles in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction.

Despite decades of research on photocatalytic materials.[1] TiO2. one of the oldest known photoactive materials.[2] remains the most promising. typically believed to be limited by fast electron-hole recombination [3]. To improve upon pre-existing materials. much work in the literature focuses on adding co-catalysts to separate electrons and holes across heterojunctions and thereby suppress recombination.Photocatalytic rates are typically normalized by total catalyst mass. despite mass not correlating directly to reaction mechanisms [4]. Since co-catalysts are added to improve the absorbed-photon-to-product conversion efficiency. the quantum yield (QY)—ie. normalizing product by the number of absorbed photons—is a better metric. Unfortunately. QYs are difficult to measure for heterogeneous systems and are only reported for monochromatic light [5]. If solar irradiation is to be used directly for a photocatalytic process. however. the QY. a function of excitation energy. matters at all wavelengths of the solar spectrum. To this end. we present a method of approximating QYs for polychromatic systems. By applying this method to a model TiO2/gC 3N4 system. we show that mass-normalization can artificially enhance the apparent performance of composite systems; the generality of this problem for other cocatalyst systems is demonstrated by means of a generic. modeled heterojunction system.,True,t70id_IAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper19120/NAM_ExtendedAbstract_Kunz.pdf,,,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper19120/NAM_ExtendedAbstract_Kunz.pdf,0,0,0

It is hypothesized that Au is capable of producing hydrogen peroxide from molecular hydrogen and oxygen as an intermediate used in selective oxidation reactions [2].

Herein. we report a simplified method of fabricating zeolite Faujasite (FAU) thin films through the direct wet deposition of zeolite FAU thin films using stabilized colloidal suspensions. Zeolite FAU suspensions are stabilized by adjusting the pH values and the suspensions are spin-coated on a silicon wafer substrate to form dense zeolite FAU thin films. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to investigate the colloidal properties of the zeolite FAU suspensions. The time-dependent hydrodynamic radius R h was derived from DLS measurements for use as a quantitative measure of colloidal stability. It was found that high pH values destabilize the colloidal suspensions. Thin film samples cast using the relatively stable zeolite FAU suspensions yielded thin films with uniform morphology.

Solar energy is the most vastly available energy and very effective in terms of energy conversion. The most common solar thermal collector used is the black surface as radiant absorber but the thermal energy efficiency is low. In this study. the effect of nanofluid has been analyzed by using as working fluid for direct solar collector. The extinction coefficient of water based aluminum nanofluid has been investigated and evaluated by varying nanoparticle size and volume fraction.

But it is found from the literature that the study on the impeller-diffuser-volute interaction as well on the performance of the turbocharger centrifugal compressor by varying the geometry of volute has not been the focus of attention in these works. Hence a numerical analysis has been carried out in this work to extensively explore impeller-diffuser-volute fluid interaction as well as to predict the flow and turbulence characteristics of the centrifugal compressor by varying the volute geometry without changing the number of impeller blades.

Low solidity is achieved by using a low chord to pitch ratio. In this work. a CFD simulation is carried out to examine the effect of solidity on airflow field of a turbocharger centrifugal compressor which consists of a simple-splitter impeller and a vaned diffuser. By changing the number of diffuser vanes while keeping the number of impeller blades constant. the solidity value of the diffuser is varied. The characteristics of the compressor are evaluated for 6. 8. 10 and 12 stator vanes which correspond to solidity of: 0.78. 1.04. 1.29 and 1.55. respectively. The spatial distribution of the pressure. velocity and turbulent kinetic energy show that the diffuser solidity has significant effect on flow field and compressor performance map. The compressor with a 6 vanes diffuser has higher efficiency and operates at a wider range of flow rate relative to that obtainedwith larger vans number.However a non-uniform flow at the compressor exit was observedwith relatively high turbulent kinetic energy.,True,ROBycV4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/handle/11025/22411,2624233011099676728,/scholar?cites=2624233011099676728,,https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/11025/22411/1/Chehhat.pdf,0,0,0

The vertical wall inside the open cavities facing the aperture is assumed to be isothermal while the other walls are kept insulated. Heat transfer steady laminar natural convection is studied by solving the non-dimensional governing equations of mass. momentum and energy in the framework of a finite volume method. The analysis are carried out under Rayleigh number range of 9.41× 105 to 3.76× 106. inclination 0 to 90 and opening ratio 0.25. 0.5 and 1. The model results for avaergar Nusselt number evaluation was in good agreement with other published work for similar configuration. The results show that convective average Nusselt number decreases by 93% when the inclination angle increased from 0 to 90 due to the trapped vortices that limit the airflow throughout the cavity. The air flowing through the cavit is maximum when the the inclination angle is zero even at higher values of Raylight number. Results show also that decreasing the opening ratio from 1 to 0.25 leads to a drop in heat loss by 22.79%.

Many research works both experimental and numerical on the diffuser volute interactive phenomenon have been undertaken so far. But it is found from the literature that the study on the impeller-diffuser-volute interaction as well on the performance of the turbocharger centrifugal compressor by varying the geometry of volute has not been the focus of attention in these works. Hence a numerical analysis has been carried out in this work to extensively explore impeller-diffuser-volute fluid interaction as well as to predict the flow and turbulence characteristics of the centrifugal compressor by varying the volute geometry without changing the number of impeller blades.

A great attention has been put on the influence of upstream conditions upon the global flow structure and the mixing process. The mixing behavior is studied through the spatial and temporal development of the mixture fraction of the annular and the inner fluids. and examined by means of flow visualization and statistics. It is shown that the turbulent mixing process and the mixture fraction field in coaxial jets depend on the upstream conditions. even though a quasi self-similar state is reached. The mixing alterations are explained by the understanding of the flow dynamics modifications implied by the different upstream conditions. These alterations are mainly due to the intense generation of streamwise vortices. favored by high inlet velocity gradients and velocity ratios. as well as low ratios between the inner and the …,True,Wb12MBIAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,29,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14685240600833094,6453432569708185377,/scholar?cites=6453432569708185377,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00261424/document,0,0,0

They are validated by comparison against laboratory experiments. The mixing process is studied by seeding a passive tracer first in the outer annular jet. then in the inner jet.

Dordrecht,Large-Eddy Simulations are performed to investigate the Reynolds number influence on coaxial jets. These simulations are validated by comparison against laboratory experiments. For high enough Reynolds numbers. the jet develops streamwise vortices from the beginning of the transition corresponding to the so-called “mixing transition”. This implies a non-stationary behaviour of the recirculation bubble present for a very high velocity ratio between the outer and the inner jets. We investigate the Reynolds number influence on mixing by seeding a passive tracer in the outer stream. The tracer exhibits mushroom shape structures associated with counter-rotating streamwise vortices from the beginning of the jet development in the “mixing transition” state.

Low solidity is achieved by using a low chord to pitch ratio. In this work. a CFD simulation is carried out to examine the effect of solidity on airflow field of a turbocharger centrifugal compressor which consists of a simple-splitter impeller and a vaned diffuser. By changing the number of diffuser vanes while keeping the number of impeller blades constant. the solidity value of the diffuser is varied. The characteristics of the compressor are evaluated for 6. 8. 10 and 12 stator vanes which correspond to solidity of: 0.78. 1.04. 1.29 and 1.55. respectively. The spatial distribution of the pressure. velocity and turbulent kinetic energy show that the diffuser solidity has significant effect on flow field and compressor performance map.

It has the most favor to produce pure water to overcome the water needs issue in arid regions. For this reason. several researches were undertaken a local manufacturing devices which can realize this objective. The focus of this article is to discuss a new approach of solar distillation system. The aim is to combine a double slope solar still with a cylindrical solar water heater which can be motivated by the two following significant reasons: firstly. to increase water temperature inside the solar still in order to improve with. high level. its distillate production capability. besides. the cylindrical type solar heater has a good ability of heating water with low heat losses to the ambient surrounding. Both of the previous systems may form a double slope active solar still. Performed numerical investigations are based on the determination of temperature and distillate mass profiles in the case of an active solar still and to compare them to those of solar still without preheating system. The computer program has been elaborated in this study using Fortran 6.6 language as an investigation platform to examine temperature and mass production parameters. Simultaneously. temperature increasing and mass production have been computed through the active solar still and compared to the uncoupled system (passive solar still).

The conventional fluids being used today are based on a mixture of distilled water (DW) and ethylene glycol (EG). which widens the operational temperature range but at the same time limits the heat removal. Therefore. the use of nanofluids for improving heat transfer performance has soared over the past few years. The problem is that most of the reports highlight the short-term heat transfer results which may not be true over time. In this paper. a suggested best practice for analyzing the usage of nanofluids in heat transfer applications is presented. specifically for an actual car radiator.

In the subject of modelling and improving the performances of PTCs and their heat collector elements (HCEs). the thermal. optical and aerodynamic study of the fluid flow and heat transfer is a powerful tool for optimising the solar field output and increase the solar plant performance.

To use the full potential of the thermoelectric module (TEM). the heat rejected from the hot side of the module is harnessed for a low-temperature heating application. The cooling chamber used is a well-insulated rectangular container made of Aluminum. The system was designed to achieve 10 °C in the cold chamber to act as a refrigerator. Experimental results demonstrated that the system could reach the desired temperature of about 10 °C in the coldchamber. while on the hot side; theobtained temperature was about 40 °C. A higher coefficient of performance (COP) of about 0.61 was obtained for both cooling and heating effects.

Under nonadiabatic conditions. multiple flame edges and multiple propagation speeds (positive and negative) are discussed. Different regions of multiple propagation speeds have been revealed ranging from two to four. depending on the value of the heat loss parameter and Damkohler number. which is inversely proportional to the strain rate. A combustion wave is modeled by connecting a strongly burning flame on one side of the burner to a weakly burning flame on the other side. These combustion waves are changing with increasing Dam number into flame edges with the fact that the strongly burning flame is the dominant.[DOI: 10.1115/1.4035922],True,ynPD3eYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,2,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/thermalscienceapplication/article/9/3/031001/379906,9765260419448152643,/scholar?cites=9765260419448152643,,,0,0,0

The interaction of preferential diffusion and heat loss for a planar premixed flame is investigated using a thermodiffusive (constant density) model. The flame is studied as a function of three nondimensional parameters. namely. Damköhler number (ratio of diffusion time to chemical time). Lewis number (ratio of thermal to species diffusivity). and heat loss. A maximum of four solutions are identified in some cases. two of which are stable. The behavior of the eigenvalues of the linearized system of stabilty is also discussed. For low Lewis number. the heat loss plays a major role in stabilizing the flame for some moderately high values of Damköhler number. The results show the effect of increasing or decreasing Lewis number on adiabatic and nonadiabatic flames temperature and reaction rate as well as the range of heat loss …,True,ynPD3eYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,2,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/thermalscienceapplication/article-abstract/9/3/031010/379905,1219421484802006959,/scholar?cites=1219421484802006959,,,0,0,0

Therefore. using solar water heater (SWH) for providing a major part of this energy demand seems necessary in line with socio-economic development and continuous improvement of standards of living. Applications such as space and water heating are not well-developed in Algeria and no need to say that using energy management software packages is an excellent solution for enhancing management applications of energy development-based systems. Therefore current study uses TSOL and MeteoSyn software packages to investigate the potential of using SWHs for a residential apartment in 37 stations in Algeria. Results indicated that In Salah. Tamanrasset. and Adrar stations that respectively accounted for 85.6%. 81.2%. and 76.7% of total thermal demand provision were the most suitable ones for SWH usage. Also. given the results it can be observed that in case of using SWH in 37 stations. 150160 kWh of thermal energy for space heating and 99861 kWh for sanitary hot water is produced which. due to not using fossil fuels for generating this thermal energy. savings up to 56783 kg in CO2 emissions are obtainable annually.,True,_w7hEbgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,15,https://jser.ut.ac.ir/article_67424.html,6952321283140139251,/scholar?cites=6952321283140139251,,https://jser.ut.ac.ir/article_67424_89aac3fd09f4579cf81271eb5c9b9c77.pdf,0,0,0

The trouble is the provisioning of drinking water. Several techniques are used but solar distillation; which seems to be an appropriate. economical. and easy solution. Conventional solar distiller is used in the Saharan areas but the yield of this device is low. that's why there are several studies that are focused on improving this distiller. The technique of double glazing gives an increase in the efficiency of a solar collector; hence. the idea of using the same technique in a conventional solar distiller. Two covers of glasses separated by 1 cm. isolated from the four sides was put on a distiller of dimensions 0.5 × 0.5 m.

In this paper. the spray pyrolysis deposition method with a moving nozzle has been used to fabricate the organic-inorganic perovskite material layer: methylammonium lead triiodide CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). In this context. three samples of organic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 material have been deposited under various processing temperatures; 70 C. 80 C and 100 C at ambient conditions in order to deduce the effect of temperature on different optical and morphological parameters. namely. layer form. band gap and Auerbach energy.

The first is considered a classical technique called Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) which is based on the processing of the stator current by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The second is anadvanced technique based on a Discrete Wavelet Energy Ratio (DWER) of three stator currents. The aim objective of this paper is to compare the ability and effectiveness of both techniques to detect the ITSC fault and the UVS in induction motors. and distinguishing between them. An experimental implementation tests the two diagnosis techniques. The results obtained show that the MCAS technique by the FFT analysis has a difficult to discriminate between the current harmonics due to the provide voltage unbalance and those originated by ITSC faults. Unlike the DWERtechnique. which has high sensitivity and exceptional ability to detect and distinguish between the two faults that lead to the reliability of the diagnosis system. To demonstrate that the DWER is an accurate and robust diagnosis approach are used the neural network (NN) as a tool to classify the faults (ITSC and USV) where using DWER indicators as NN input.

The initial development of fuel flows was analyzed by imaging the spray behavior with high-magnification optics and by static pressure measurements of the spray field with a piezoresistive transducer. The experimental results are discussed with a mathematical liquid film model. Fuel evaporation at high fuel temperatures causes static gas pressure to increase inside and near the nozzle.

Following a delay period between signal initiation and first appearance of fuel at the nozzle exit. four stages have been identified during the spray development: a very early asymmetric poorly atomised jet penetrating in the central part of the nozzle hole with a tip velocity proportional to injection pressure. an asymmetric non-hollow spray. a swirl-developing hollow-cone spray with a multi-layer structure. and a fully-developed and well atomised hollow-cone spray with a cone angle nearly independent of injection pressure. The first two stages correspond to the period before the liquid film is formed in the nozzle hole and the last two to the period of film development. Due to the transient nature of the spray and its varying structure with time it has been necessary to estimate the penetration of the spray in two different ways; in terms of its leading edge during the first two stages and in terms of the distance to its maximum width at the last two.

Spray images have confirmed that penetration decreases with increasing chamber pressure or decreasing injection pressure. that higher droplet velocities are present at the spray centre and that a multi layer structure is formed along the spray axis. Stronger interaction between the six sprays is observed as the chamber pressure increases. The PDA measurements under both atmospheric and high pressure revealed that the mean droplet velocity prior to fuel impingement on the surface reaches its peak at the spray axis unlike the droplet mean diameter which exhibits an off-centre peak. The results also showed that the temporal variation of the mean droplet velocity at the spray centreline is similar to the predicted injection velocity variation at the nozzle exit while. further downstream and away from the centreline. three stages have been identified in the spray structure: leading edge. steady-state and tail.

1108361,Static pressure Distribution inside the Swirl spray,2006,Seoksu Moon and Essam Abo-Serie and Hyundong Shin and Choongsik Bae,,,,,,The transient static pressure of the air located along the centerline of the spray from a DISI pressure swirl injector was measured for different injection pressures. fuel temperatures and injection durations. The drop in the pressure at the centerline was found to be mainly attributed to the swirling liquid and enhanced with the swirling velocity manifested by the injection pressure. With increasing the injection duration. the pressure was found to be continuously dropped. although the measured swirling momentum of the liquid reaches an asymptotic value and remains constant until the needle starts to close. This implies that the pressure at the centerline of a transient spray does not reach its asymptotic value which corresponds to the case of a continuously injected spray. At higher fuel temperature. the air pressure at the centerline increases and can reach a value more than atmospheric pressure due to the sudden evaporation of the fuel after been released underneath the needle. This high air pressure pushes the main stream of the spray to the radial direction resulting in a larger nozzle spray angle which is soon collapsed after a short distance due to the severe expansion of the air and enhanced swirling motion.

1108363,Aerodynamics assessment using CFD for a low drag Shell Eco-Marathon car,2017,Essam Abo-Serie,3,Journal of Thermal Engineering,6,1527-1536,,Having a small car running with low power can be achieved by reducing the aerodynamics drag. rolling resistance and mechanical frictions between the moving parts. The Shell Eco-Marathon competition held around the world with events in Europe. USA and Asia shows every year new techniques and ideas to reduce the power needed to drive the car. The record of over 3400 km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel is an indication of how car can run efficiently. The problem with these low drag cars is the driver perception about the shape of the car. Although the tear drop shape is known as having the minimum drag. practically this shape cannot be used due to size and packaging limitations in addition to the safety issue. In this work. a low drag concept car is proposed using initial CAD design. The concept car is examined using a commercial CFD software by simulating the airflow around car. The spatial distribution of the pressure and velocity vectors are utilized to improve the car shape and to achieve a low drag force coefficient while keeping the down force at its minimum value. By changing the car front. underneath and rear shapes. it was possible to reduce the drag coefficient from 0.430 for the baseline to 0.127 for the final design. while meeting the competition regulations.,True,EnasExcAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,8,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/thermal/article/353657,8335594388224540270,/scholar?cites=8335594388224540270,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/364700,0,0,0

Heat transfer steady laminar natural convection is studied by solving the non-dimensional governing equations of mass. momentum and energy in the framework of a finite volume method. The analysis are carried out under Rayleigh number range of 9.41× 105 to 3.76× 106. inclination 0 to 90 and opening ratio 0.25. 0.5 and 1. The model results for avaergar Nusselt number evaluation was in good agreement with other published work for similar configuration. The results show that convective average Nusselt number decreases by 93% when the inclination angle increased from 0 to 90 due to the trapped vortices that limit the airflow throughout the cavity. The air flowing through the cavit is maximum when the the inclination angle is zero even at higher values of Raylight number.

The stray inductance of switching cells must be minimised to limit the over-voltage of power switches like IGBTs. MOSFETs or HEMTs. This is one of the reasons why 3D integration concepts are considered today. This paper deals with a busbar-like integration concept called “Power Chip-on-Chip” (PCoC). Although this concept can improve the electrical and EMI behaviours of power converters. the heat extraction is an important issue. A parametric study using an impedance analyser is conducted to study the influence of the cooling system on the stray inductance value. An experimental set-up is then outlined to validate the preliminary study. We demonstrate that the stray inductance (and thus the over-voltage) of a PCoC package is lower than this of a planar power module using the same components.,True,zYz6Ni4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6342785/,6465043338809591052,/scholar?cites=6465043338809591052,,,0,0,0

These coatings typically contain ceramic particles in an electrodeposited matrix such as nickel. The aim of this work is to obtain an electrolytic nickel matrix (binder) with and without adding silicon carbide SiC microparticles (mean diameter 0.8 µm) which have a high hardness and a good chemical stability. The structural (Ni-SiC) composite and pure nickel coatings were prepared by electroplating deposition on steel in a Watts bath of electroplating chloride. The surface morphology. microstructure. and composition were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). nanoindentation. scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer. The characterizations of the deposited layers are carried out in 3.5 % NaCl solution. The weight loss and the polarization results highlighted that the corrosion rate decreases with the increase of SiC concentration up to 15 gl – 1. This decrease is probably due to the presence of SiC particles leading to improved corrosion resistance. These properties are mainly due to the homogeneous distribution of the constituents SiC as determined by AFM technique and the possibilities of combining the characteristics of base metals and their coatings.

1108388,Tribological Study of Molybdenum Nitrides Under the Effect of Vanadium,2018,A Abboudi and B Chermime and H Djebaili and S Boulahrouz,,,,,Sumy State University,Our study of the MoVN ternary thin films has the objective of improving certain tribological and mechanical characteristics and of finding the appropriate stoichiometry to have the microstructure that corresponds to the desired properties using the characterization techniques: SEM -XRD-EDS-XPS- WDS. Nano-indentation and the scrash-test. Note that wear and friction resistance does not depend on the internal characteristics of the materials in contact as is usually the case for mechanical properties. but rather depends mainly on the structure and morphology and experimental conditions. Hypotheses will be presented in order to explain the tribological behavior of deposits and to match them to their physicochemical and mechanical properties. The EDS-XPS microanalyses revealed that the atomic ratio (N/V) ~ 1 for VN. that (N/Mo)  1.22 for MoN and that (N/(Mo + V))  1 for the MoVN ternary films. From this figure we find that the MoN film has an average coefficient of friction of 0.65. This film then has good wear resistance. Comparing this value with that obtained on MoN coatings deposited by the Alcatel PVD sputtering system on AISI substrate. (which is of the order of 0.45) therefore better than that deposited on XC100 and Si . This variation can be explained by the nature that differs between the coating/substrate interface and the other links that are generated. By comparing the Mo-V-N and MoN films. we can then say: increasing the V content in the Mo-V-N film is more favorable for the production of films with a low average value of the coefficient of friction. Which remains lower than that of MoN film (0.65)?

The weld quality is mainly characterised by welding arc. since the energy for the welding is transferred through arc plasma. and it affects the weld bead formation. The transport phenomena in a tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding arc plays a very important role in producing weldments of high quality. The TIG welding arc exerts heat flux. current density and pressure distributions on the surface of the weld pool [4]. For predicting the weld pool geometry and metallurgical structures. accurate information about the welding arc influencing the weld pool is prerequisite.

1108428,Residual Stress Analysis in the Titanium by Eddy Current Method,2009,S Mekhlouf and M Zergoug and Y Benkedda,,5th International Workshop NDT in Progress,,,,Control by eddy current is one of techniques that are very used in nondestructive evaluation of materials. These processes find a significant application in the determination of the mechanical and metallurgical parameters of materials. The object of this work is to carry out an analysis of the residual stresses in the material created by external solicitations and analyses by eddy currents as a non destructive testing method. The analysis of the eddy current results will be compared to the results obtained by the traditional methods (X-rays diffraction…) in order to determine a relation between the non-destructive tests and destructive. It was shown in this work that all microstructure modifications of the samples were detected and they can be quantified by eddy current impedance measurement. The impedance analysis by eddy current will be correlated with the microstructure changes observed in the material because of plastic damage and fatigue.,True,Z2MxPlkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://www.ndt.net/article/Prague2009/ndtip/proceedings/Mekhlouf-Zergoud_6.pdf,2547192355126641671,/scholar?cites=2547192355126641671,,https://www.ndt.net/article/Prague2009/ndtip/proceedings/Mekhlouf-Zergoud_6.pdf,0,0,0

A mathematical model is developed in order to solve the Navier–Stokes equations expressed in the stream–vorticity formulation coupled with heat equation taking into account the liquid solid phase change. Using the stream–vorticity formulation in incompressible fluid flow. the same problem is solved with reducing the number of transport equations. Therefore. only one transport equation (vorticity) and one Poisson equation (stream) are considered in this model. The FORTRAN programming and the numerical simulation are then achieved using appropriate discretization that ensures the convergence of the numerical methods to solve a large and sparse linear algebraic systems.

1108448,Cold flow: A review of a technology to avoid wax deposition,2008,D Merino-Garcia and S Correra,26,,4,446-459,Taylor & Francis Group,Off-shore production of crude oil is greatly affected by the formation of solid deposits. These solids range from asphaltenes to gas hydrates and waxes. Long-chain alkanes (with a carbon number > 20) are commonly known as waxes and they are the fraction of petroleum that causes the greatest economical losses in oil recovery. The low temperature of water at the sea bed makes the oil cool down to temperatures below the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT or Cloud Point). leading to nucleation and adhesion of waxes to the pipe walls. Some patents deal with the remediation of this fouling by generating a slurry in a controlled way. so that it will not adhere to the walls.

The catalyst used was a 0.3% platinum/amorphous silica–alumina catalyst. Temperature and space velocity exhibited the biggest effect on wax conversion rate but a significant role was played by the pressure and the H2/wax ratio as well. The results indicated an inverse relationship between pressure and conversion rate while an opposite behaviour was shown by the H2/wax ratio. The effect of the last two variables was explained respectively in terms of the reaction mechanism of n-paraffins on bifuctional catalyst and the effect of the vapour–liquid equilibrium (VLE) on apparent conversion rate and isomer content of products.,True,jR9t1aoAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,64,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586105005341,14620802866551809004,/scholar?cites=14620802866551809004,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincenzo_Calemma/publication/236677159_Hydroconversion_of_Fischer--Tropsch_waxes_Assessment_of_the_operating_conditions_effect_by_factorial_design_experiments/links/56a2521308aeef24c585cac4/Hydroconversion-of-Fischer--Tropsch-waxes-Assessment-of-the-operating-conditions-effect-by-factorial-design-experiments.pdf,0,0,0

Up to now. the focus in wax studies has been mainly on the radial transport of waxes to the cold wall through molecular diffusion. but other mechanisms that have been cited (and so far neglected) may count on the kinetics of deposit formation. An analysis of the experimental evidence is presented here. leading to the conclusion that an important role may be played by the axial convective transport and the oil gelation on the cold surface (i.e.. by the bulk liquid-to-gel change driven by the temperature change). Gelation is faster than molecular diffusion and may lead to the formation of a loose solid network that is slowly filled by diffusion (by aging) in a successive step.

The flow takes place in a laboratory test loop. The crystals have a tendency to form aggregates. producing a gel-like structure. The resulting product can be modeled as a Bingham fluid. but its rheological parameters (yield stress and viscosity) depend on the amount and state of the segregated phase. whose evolution is in turn influenced by the flow. Of course temperature plays a key role. Wax can form a solid deposit at the pipe wall. reducing the pipe radius and this phenomenon is also taken into account.

More detailed models have been proposed that are able to estimate the range of pressures at which asphaltene deposits are expected.

Although humans have used the oceans for millennia. technological developments now allow exploitation of fisheries resources. hydrocarbons and minerals below 2000 m depth. The remoteness of the deep seafloor has promoted the disposal of residues and litter. Ocean acidification and climate change now bring a new dimension of global effects. Thus the challenges facing the deep sea are large and accelerating. providing a new imperative for the science community. industry and national and international organizations to work together to develop successful exploitation management and conservation of the deep-sea ecosystem. This paper provides scientific expert judgement and a semi-quantitative analysis of past. present and future impacts of human-related activities on global deep-sea habitats within three categories: disposal. exploitation and climate change. The analysis is the result of a Census of Marine Life – SYNDEEP workshop (September 2008). A detailed review of known impacts and their effects is provided.

Although there are several conceptual frameworks for describing these links. the DPSIR (Drivers – Pressures – State change – Impact – Response) framework has been widely adopted. Two possible reasons for this are: either the framework fulfils a major role. resulting from convergent evolution. or the framework is used often merely because it is used often. albeit uncritically. This comprehensive review. with lessons learned after two decades of use. shows that the approach is needed and there has been a convergent evolution in approach for coastal and marine ecosystem management. There are now 25 derivative schemes and a widespread and increasing usage of the DPSIR-type conceptual framework as a means of structuring and analyzing information in management and decision-making across ecosystems. However. there is less use of DPSIR in fully marine ecosystems and even this was mainly restricted to European literature. Around half of the studies are explicitly conceptual. not illustrating a solid case study. Despite its popularity since the early 1990s among the scientific community and the recommendation of several international institutions for its application. the framework has notable weaknesses to be addressed.

The distribution of nursery areas of 11 important commercial species of demersal fish and shellfish was analysed in the European Union Mediterranean waters using time series of bottom trawl survey data with the aim of identifying the most persistent recruitment areas. A high interspecific spatial overlap between nursery areas was mainly found along the shelf break of many different sectors of the Northern Mediterranean indicating a high potential for the implementation of conservation measures. Overlap of the nursery grounds with existing spatial fisheries management measures and trawl fisheries restricted areas was also investigated. Spatial analyses revealed considerable variation depending on species and associated habitat/depth preferences with increased protection seen in coastal nurseries and minimal protection seen for deeper nurseries (e.g. Parapenaeus longirostris 6%). This is partly attributed to existing environmental policy instruments (e.g. Habitats Directive and Mediterranean Regulation EC 1967/2006) aiming at minimising impacts on coastal priority habitats such as seagrass. coralligenous and maerl beds.

Although many technical regulations have been introduced to limit unwanted catches. there is little understanding of the underlying socio-economic and institutional incentives causing discard at the fisher level. The paper presents an approach which views discards as a result of decisions made both on deck and at earlier stages of the fishing planning and implementation process. Decisions made by fishers resulting in a more selective fishery are considered “selective behaviour”. It is argued that fishing practices are institutionally embedded within three institutional spheres: “state”. “market”. and “community”. which together with “natural conditions” create incentives and frameworks for discard and selective behaviour.

In recent years. Pressure-State-Response (P-S-R) frameworks have been central to conceptualizing marine ecosystem issues and then translating those to stakeholders. environmental managers and researchers. Society is concerned about the risks to the natural and human system posed by those Pressures (thus needing risk assessment) and then needs to act to minimize or compensate those risks (as risk management). This research relates this to the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressure-State(change)-Impact-Response) hierarchical framework using standardized terminology/definitions and lists of impacting Activities and Pressures affecting ecosystem components. incorporating the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) legal decision components. This uses the example of fishing activity and the pressure of trawling from abrasion on the seabed and its effects on particular components.

Indigenous people and early navigators knew of some of them. but we are only just finding out that there may be 100 000 large seamounts and up to a million smaller features. Seamounts are steepsided underwater volcanoes with a geological life history. The physical characteristics can generate upwelling of nutrients. the formation of density cones or the retention of water masses. These hydrological phenomena may lead to local enhancement of primary production. However. a more important mechanism appears to be the trapping of small migrating organisms. both zooplankton and mesopelagic organisms. over the summit and flanks. depending on the depth of the peak.

Since 1950. the global fish catch has been increasingly dominated by species with low intrinsic vulnerability. indicated by a decline in mean vulnerability of the taxa in the catches. This decline is strongest in catches of coral reef fishes. probably as a result of overexploitation of the more vulnerable species. The change is less apparent in estuaries. where fish communities are more transient. The opposite is observed at seamounts. where more vulnerable species have become exploited and serially depleted in recent years. Rates of change in the mean vulnerability index in the catches from different areas are negatively correlated with the number of threatened fishes on the IUCN Red List.

In order to better understand the trophic dynamics of these species in the Azores. the diets of thornback ray and tope shark caught in this area during 1996 and 1997 were analyzed to describe feeding patterns and to investigate the effect of sex. size. and depth and area of capture on diet. Thornback rays fed mainly upon fishes and reptants. but also upon polychaetes. mysids. natant crustaceans. isopods. and cephalopods. In the Azores. this species preyed more heavily upon fish compared with the predation patterns described in other areas. Differences in the diet may be due to differences in the environments (e.g. in the Azores. seamounts and oceanic islands are the major topographic features. whereas in all other studies. continental shelves have been the major topographic feature). No differences were observed in the major prey consumed between the sexes or between size classes (49−60. 61−70. 71−80. and 81−93 cm TL). Our study indicates that rays inhabiting different depths and areas (coastal or offshore banks) prey upon different resources. This appears to be related to the relative abundance of prey with habitat. Tope sharks were found to prey almost exclusively upon teleost fish: small shoaling fish. mainly boarfish (Capros aper) and snipefish (Macroramphosus scolopax). were the most frequent prey.

The pattern was similar when considering only commercially exploited species. Biological characteristics leading to greater vulnerability included a longer life span. later sexual maturation. slower growth and lower natural mortality. The results supported the contention that seamount fishes. especially those that aggregate on seamounts. are highly vulnerable to exploitation and that fishing on seamounts may not be sustainable at current levels and with current methods.

Both species tended to feed on harder prey. such as echinoderms and gastropods. as they grew. Although both species feed upon similar resources. the diet overlap was low.

The present paper identifies the principal CWC species landed by bottom longlining in Faial (Azores) from 150 to 600 m depth. Data were obtained from a survey of 297 landings during four months coupled with 16 interviews with fishermen. A distinction was made among corals brought on deck directly entangled in the fishing gear (primary by-catch) from corals brought up associated with other larger CWC species or rocks (secondary by-catch). Forty-five (15.2%) of 297 fishing trips surveyed landed coral specimens. The survey recorded 39 different CWC taxa in the by-catch. belonging to five different orders (Scleractinia. Alcyonacea.

1108554,A riot of species in an environmental calm: the paradox of the species-rich deep-sea floor,2002,RN Gibson and Margaret Barnes and RJA Atkinson,,Oceanography and Marine Biology: an annual review,,311,CRC,Deep-sea ecosystems are the most extensive and remote ecosystems on Earth. Perception of the deep-sea benthic environment has changed dramatically in the last century from one of an azoic. or at least species-poor habitat to one that is rich in species. The early misconception was created. in part. by evidence of vast. monotonous expanses of cold. dark sediment plains with little obvious spatial or temporal heterogeneity. Given that many species-rich ecosystems on Earth are obviously heterogeneous. it is surprising that some estimates of species numbers in the deep sea (eg∼ 107 macrofaunal species) rival those for tropical rainforests. Although other estimates are more conservative (eg 5× 105 macrofaunal species). it is clear that deep-sea benthic habitats contain many species. The paradox of high deep-sea diversity has generated a number of explanatory hypotheses. including some that are currently difﬁcult to test and others that are the focus of ongoing study. Approaches include analyses of local. regional. and global patterns. and experimental manipulations within habitats. Mechanistic generalisations are difﬁcult to make because experimentation and sampling coverage are spatially and temporally limited. but evidence to date suggests that small-scale habitat variability and patchy disturbance. as well as global and regional variability. may play roles in maintaining deep-sea diversity. The importance of small-scale habitat variability and patchy disturbance has been demonstrated for only a small subset of species. many of which are opportunists.

Similarities and differences in assemblage composition have been driven by large‐scale events. such as the trans‐Arctic interchange. which has shaped the species pool. and cycles of glaciation. which have determined phases of local or regional extinction and colonization.

This paper compiles and summarizes current knowledge of the diversity of marine taxa in Canada's three oceans while recognizing that this compilation is incomplete and will change in the future. That Canada has the longest coastline in the world and incorporates distinctly different biogeographic provinces and ecoregions (e.g.. temperate through ice-covered areas) constrains this analysis. The taxonomic groups presented here include microbes. phytoplankton. macroalgae. zooplankton. benthic infauna. fishes. and marine mammals. The minimum number of species or taxa compiled here is 15.988 for the three Canadian oceans. However. this number clearly underestimates in several ways the total number of taxa present. First. there are significant gaps in the published literature. Second. the diversity of many habitats has not been compiled for all taxonomic groups (e.g.. intertidal rocky shores. deep sea). and data compilations are based on short-term. directed research programs or longer-term monitoring activities with limited spatial resolution. Third. the biodiversity of large organisms is well known. but this is not true of smaller organisms. Finally. the greatest constraint on this summary is the willingness and capacity of those who collected the data to make it available to those interested in biodiversity meta-analyses. Confirmation of identities and intercomparison of studies are also constrained by the disturbing rate of decline in the number of taxonomists and systematists specializing on marine taxa in Canada.

Our results listed approximately 17.000 marine species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea. However. our estimates of marine diversity are still incomplete as yet—undescribed species will be added in the future. Diversity for microbes is substantially underestimated. and the deep-sea areas and portions of the southern and eastern region are still poorly known.

This paper integrated the findings of reviews of major world regions by the Census and provides a global perspective on what is known and what are the major scientific gaps. Study metrics were regional species richness. numbers of endemic and alien species. numbers of species identification guides and taxonomic experts. and a state-ofknowledge index. The threats to biodiversity were classified across the regions. A poor to moderate correlation between species richness and seabed area. and sea volume. and no correlations with topographic variation. were attributed to sparse. uneven and unrepresentative sampling in much of the global marine environment. Many habitats have been poorly sampled. particularly in deeper seas. and several species-rich taxonomic groups. especially of smaller organisms. remain poorly studied. Crustacea. Mollusca. and Pisces comprised approximately half of all known species across the regions. The proportion that these and other taxa comprised of all taxa varied sufficiently to question whether the relative number of species within phyla and classes are constant throughout the world.

Investigations of deep-sea habitats and their fauna began in the late 19th century. In the intervening years. technological developments and stimulating discoveries have promoted deep-sea research and changed our way of understanding life on the planet. Nevertheless. the deep sea is still mostly unknown and current discovery rates of both habitats and species remain high.

We summarized all available information on benthic biodiversity (Prokaryotes. Foraminifera. Meiofauna. Macrofauna. and Megafauna) in different deep-sea ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea (200 to more than 4.000 m depth). including open slopes. deep basins. canyons. cold seeps. seamounts. deep-water corals and deep-hypersaline anoxic basins and analyzed overall longitudinal and bathymetric patterns. We show that in contrast to what was expected from the sharp decrease in organic carbon fluxes and reduced faunal abundance. the deep-sea biodiversity of both the eastern and the western basins of the Mediterranean Sea is similarly high. All of the biodiversity components. except Bacteria and Archaea. displayed a decreasing pattern with increasing water depth. but to a different extent for each component. Unlike patterns observed for faunal abundance. highest negative values of the slopes of the biodiversity patterns were observed for Meiofauna. followed by Macrofauna and Megafauna. Comparison of the biodiversity associated with open slopes. deep basins. canyons. and deep-water corals showed that the deep basins were the least diverse.

The machine-learning algorithm. Random Forests. was employed to model and predict seafloor standing stocks from surface primary production. water-column integrated and export particulate organic matter (POM). seafloor relief. and bottom water properties. The predictive models explain 63% to 88% of stock variance among the major size groups. Individual and composite maps of predicted global seafloor biomass and abundance are generated for bacteria. meiofauna. macrofauna. and megafauna (invertebrates and fishes). Patterns of benthic standing stocks were positive functions of surface primary production and delivery of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to the seafloor. At a regional scale. the census maps illustrate that integrated biomass is highest at the poles. on continental margins associated with coastal upwelling and with broad zones associated with equatorial divergence. Lowest values are consistently encountered on the central abyssal plains of major ocean basins The shift of biomass dominance groups with depth is shown to be affected by the decrease in average body size rather than abundance. presumably due to decrease in quantity and quality of food supply.

Since isolation of extracellular DNA from sediments is a difficult and unsolved task. in this study we developed an efficient procedure to recover simultaneously DNA associated with microbial cells and extracellular DNA from the same sediment sample. This procedure is specifically suitable for studying extracellular DNA because it avoids any contamination with DNA released by cell lysis during handling and extraction.

The Mediterranean basin has been proposed as a hot spot of terrestrial and coastal marine biodiversity but has been supposed to be impoverished of deep-sea species richness. We summarized all available information on benthic biodiversity (Prokaryotes. Foraminifera. Meiofauna. Macrofauna. and Megafauna) in different deep-sea ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea (200 to more than 4.000 m depth). including open slopes. deep basins. canyons. cold seeps. seamounts. deep-water corals and deep-hypersaline anoxic basins and analyzed overall longitudinal and bathymetric patterns. We show that in contrast to what was expected from the sharp decrease in organic carbon fluxes and reduced faunal abundance. the deep-sea biodiversity of both the eastern and the western basins of the Mediterranean Sea is similarly high. All of the biodiversity components. except Bacteria and Archaea. displayed a decreasing pattern with increasing water depth. but to a different extent for each component. Unlike patterns observed for faunal abundance. highest negative values of the slopes of the biodiversity patterns were observed for Meiofauna. followed by Macrofauna and Megafauna. Comparison of the biodiversity associated with open slopes. deep basins. canyons. and deep-water corals showed that the deep basins were the least diverse.

A novel in situ fluorescence XAFS setup with a multi element silicon drift detector allows time-resolved in situ studies on catalysts with small noble metal concentrations. Significant structural differences were found between a 0.5 wt% Ir/Al2O3 and a 2.5 wt% Ir/Al2O3 catalyst upon treatment in He and H2. After He treatment metallic clusters form on high loading Ir catalysts but not when the loading is small. Upon H2 treatment metallic Ir clusters are detected in both catalysts. but the particle size is smaller when a low loading is used. The smaller clusters appear to be more sensitive to oxidation.

They make up more than 98% of all Asian businesses that provide two out of three private sector jobs in the region. Therefore. it is vitally important for Asia’s economic success to have fully functioning support measures for SMEs. However. SMEs face challenges from limited access to finance. lack of databases. low R&D expenditures. undeveloped sales channels. and low levels of financial inclusion. which are some of the reasons behind the slow growth of SMEs.

Oil prices accelerated from about $35/barrel in 1981 to beyond $111/barrel in 2011. At the same time interest rates subsided from 16.7 per cent per annum to about 0.1. This paper explains how this long‐term price increase was. in most cases. caused by expansionary monetary policies that heightened oil prices through interest rate channels. Aggressive monetary policies stimulated oil demand and blew up oil prices. a trend that led to slower economic growth. As for elasticities. the results described in this paper show that oil demand price elasticity is low value and unlike some earlier literature states. supply price elasticity is statistically significant.

Electricity tariffs are often regulated by governments; It has to be kept in low price to serve for every households as a necessary goods. Sources of revenue from green energy comes only from user charges. Hence it is not so much attractive for private investors. The paper is proposing a model for utilization of the tax revenue spillover of green energy supply by returning the portion of it to green energy projects in order to increase their rate of return. In addition. the paper is proposing a social community based funding scheme for smaller scale green projects (e.g. solar and wind).

Given their importance for national economies. it is imperative to find ways to provide SMEs with stable finance. One efficient way to promote SME financing is through credit guarantee schemes. by which the government guarantees a portion (ratio) of a loan provided by a bank to a SME. Due to asymmetry of information between banks and SMEs. total loans to SMEs are smaller than the desired level of SME loan demand. Therefore. providing credit guarantees reduces information asymmetry between SME and banks. which increases the amount of loans to SMEs. The ultimate goal of the government is to provide a desired level of loans to SMEs by reducing information asymmetry.

This could threaten the expansion of green energy needed to provide energy security and meet climate and clean air goals. Several developed and developing economies are still following pro-coal energy policies and the extra CO2 generated by new coal-fired power plants could more than wipe out any reductions in emissions made by other nations. Finance is the engine of development of infrastructure projects. including energy projects. Generally financial institutions show more interest in fossil fuel projects than green projects. mainly because there are still several risks associated with these new technologies and they offer a lower rate of return. If we want to achieve sustainable development goals. we need to open a new file for green projects and scale up the financing of investments that provide environmental benefits. through new financial instruments and new policies. such as green bonds. green banks. carbon market instruments. fiscal policy. green central banking. financial technologies. communitybased green funds. etc.. which are collectively known as “green finance”.,True,iq6UvEMAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,41,http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/woo/Woo-Articles%20from%202012/Sachs-Woo-Yoshino-Farhad.2019.Green%20Finance.pdf,18164330375037725797,/scholar?cites=18164330375037725797,,http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/woo/Woo-Articles%20from%202012/Sachs-Woo-Yoshino-Farhad.2019.Green%20Finance.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we analyze the causes of the prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy (the lost decade). Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has argued that Japan's lost decade is an example of a liquidity trap. However. our empirical analysis shows that stagnation of the Japanese economy comes from its vertical IS curve rather than a horizontal LM curve. so the Japanese economy has been facing structural problems rather than a temporary downturn. The vertical IS curve is caused by an insensitivity of investment to a lower interest rate partly because of the decline of sales due to the aging population and firms not wanting to invest. The structural problems come from the aging demographic. which is often neglected by scholars and policy‐makers. and also from the allocation of transfers from the central …,True,iq6UvEMAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,41,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cwe.12149,8387252771346487833,/scholar?cites=8387252771346487833,,,0,0,0

In order to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. the Bank of Japan (BOJ) recently set an inflation target of 2 per cent and implemented an aggressive monetary policy so this target could be achieved as soon as possible. Although prices started to rise after the BOJ implemented monetary easing. this may have been for other reasons. such as higher energy prices as a result of the depreciated Japanese yen. This paper shows that quantitative easing may not be able to stimulate the Japanese economy.

This simple economy uses these two components to evaluate how oil prices affect the consumer economy’s GDP and inflation over the period 1960-2011. This model assumes that changes in the oil price transfer to macro variables through either supply or demand channels. In order to examine the effects of this transfer. an IS curve is used to look at the demand side and a Phillips curve is used to analyze inflationary effects from the supply side. along with any effects that could hinder economic growth. Using this theoretical framework as a base makes it possible to conduct an empirical analysis of the supply and demand channels. This analysis concludes that movements in the oil price mainly affect the economy through the demand side by reducing household expenditures and energy consumption. Additionally. this analysis provides several additional findings. among which are the relationship between expansionary monetary policies and heightened oil prices. the demand side’s elasticities (price and income). and the supply side’s price elasticity.,True,iq6UvEMAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,29,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2333991,1156484736480144180,/scholar?cites=1156484736480144180,,,0,0,0

As expected. we found that oil-producers (here. Iran and Russia) benefit from oil price shocks. However contrary to previous findings. they also benefit from the indirect effect through their trade partners. For oil-consuming economies. the effects are more diverse. In some countries. output falls in response to an oil price shock. while some others seem to be relatively immune. Generally. those countries which trade more with oil producers gain indirect benefits via higher demand from oil-producers. For instance. the Netherlands. Germany. France. Italy. the US. the UK. and China get a negative direct effect and positive indirect effect from oil producing countries. This is exactly the result that we anticipated.

We argue that the best exchange rate regime depends on the policy goal. Small open economies. such as those that experienced the recent currency and economic crises in Asia. should decide for themselves what their policy goals are. and then choose the exchange rate regime that is most conducive to achieving those goals. Adopting a basket-peg with trade weights will not in general be the optimal choice. In comparison to the dollar-peg. there are three possible advantages to the peg against the basket comprising two currencies. say the dollar and the yen. If the policy goal is to maintain monetary policy autonomy. then the best exchange rate regime is floating exchange rates. provided the autonomy is used wisely. J. Japanese Int.

These countries were chosen for this research because they are the world's three largest oil consumers. The main objective of this study is to see whether these economies are still reactive to oil price movements. The results obtained suggest that the impact of oil price fluctuations on developed oil importers’ GDP growth is much lower than on the GDP growth of an emerging economy. The main reasons for this lie in fuel substitution (higher use of nuclear energy. gas. and renewables). a declining population (for Japan). the shale gas revolution (for the United States). and strategic oil stocks and government-mandated …,True,qe3wShkAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC,70,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13547860.2015.1057955,8797315588926019174,/scholar?cites=8797315588926019174,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/115347/1/826898645.pdf,0,0,0

Our earlier research found that easy monetary policy had a significant impact on energy prices during the period of 1980–2011. This paper finds that after the subprime mortgage crisis. the weaker exchange rate of the US dollar caused by the country's quantitative easing pushed oil prices in US dollars upward over the period of 2009–2012. by causing investors to invest in the oil market and other commodity markets while the world economy was in recession in this period.

Our results confirm that energy price (oil price) has a significant impact on food prices. According to the results of impulse response functions. agricultural food prices respond positively to any shock from oil prices. Our results show that there is a linkage between energy and food security through price volatility. Since inflation in oil price is harmful for food security. it would be necessary to diversify the energy consumption in this sector. from too much reliance on fossil fuels to an optimal combination of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources that will be in favor of not only the energy security by also the food security.

Oil prices accelerated from about $35/barrel in 1981 to beyond $111/barrel in 2011. At the same time interest rates subsided from 16.7 per cent per annum to about 0.1. This paper explains how this long‐term price increase was. in most cases. caused by expansionary monetary policies that heightened oil prices through interest rate channels. Aggressive monetary policies stimulated oil demand and blew up oil prices. a trend that led to slower economic growth. As for elasticities. the results described in this paper show that oil demand price elasticity is low value and unlike some earlier literature states. supply price elasticity is statistically significant.

Sources of revenue from green energy comes only from user charges. Hence it is not so much attractive for private investors. The paper is proposing a model for utilization of the tax revenue spillover of green energy supply by returning the portion of it to green energy projects in order to increase their rate of return. In addition. the paper is proposing a social community based funding scheme for smaller scale green projects (e.g. solar and wind).

Given their importance for national economies. it is imperative to find ways to provide SMEs with stable finance. One efficient way to promote SME financing is through credit guarantee schemes. by which the government guarantees a portion (ratio) of a loan provided by a bank to a SME. Due to asymmetry of information between banks and SMEs. total loans to SMEs are smaller than the desired level of SME loan demand. Therefore. providing credit guarantees reduces information asymmetry between SME and banks. which increases the amount of loans to SMEs. The ultimate goal of the government is to provide a desired level of loans to SMEs by reducing information asymmetry.

This could threaten the expansion of green energy needed to provide energy security and meet climate and clean air goals. Several developed and developing economies are still following pro-coal energy policies and the extra CO2 generated by new coal-fired power plants could more than wipe out any reductions in emissions made by other nations. Finance is the engine of development of infrastructure projects. including energy projects. Generally financial institutions show more interest in fossil fuel projects than green projects. mainly because there are still several risks associated with these new technologies and they offer a lower rate of return. If we want to achieve sustainable development goals. we need to open a new file for green projects and scale up the financing of investments that provide environmental benefits. through new financial instruments and new policies. such as green bonds. green banks. carbon market instruments. fiscal policy. green central banking. financial technologies. communitybased green funds. etc.. which are collectively known as “green finance”.,True,qe3wShkAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC,41,http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/woo/Woo-Articles%20from%202012/Sachs-Woo-Yoshino-Farhad.2019.Green%20Finance.pdf,18164330375037725797,/scholar?cites=18164330375037725797,,http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/woo/Woo-Articles%20from%202012/Sachs-Woo-Yoshino-Farhad.2019.Green%20Finance.pdf,0,0,0
1108727,Causes and remedies of the Japan's long‐lasting recession: Lessons for China,2016,Naoyuki Yoshino and Farhad Taghizadeh‐Hesary,24,China & World Economy,2,23-47,,Japan has suffered from sluggish economic growth and recession since the early 1990s. In this paper. we analyze the causes of the prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy (the lost decade). Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has argued that Japan's lost decade is an example of a liquidity trap. However. our empirical analysis shows that stagnation of the Japanese economy comes from its vertical IS curve rather than a horizontal LM curve. so the Japanese economy has been facing structural problems rather than a temporary downturn. The vertical IS curve is caused by an insensitivity of investment to a lower interest rate partly because of the decline of sales due to the aging population and firms not wanting to invest. The structural problems come from the aging demographic. which is often neglected by scholars and policy‐makers. and also from the allocation of transfers from the central …,True,qe3wShkAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC,41,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cwe.12149,8387252771346487833,/scholar?cites=8387252771346487833,,,0,0,0

Using data for the years from 1980 to 2009. the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis was tested utilizing the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) methodology.

To realize the goals of this study. a pollution model was established applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) methodology. The results revealed that the pollution haven hypothesis does exist in Vietnam because capital increases pollution. In addition. imports also increase pollution which indicates that most of Vietnam's imported products are energy intensive and highly polluted. However. exports have no effect on pollution which indicates that the level of exports is not significant enough to affect pollution. Moreover. fossil fuel energy consumption increases pollution while renewable energy consumption has no significant effect in reducing pollution.

We propose a new approach based on the cross-correlation estimates to understand how economic growth and CO2 emissions are related. Our proposal is that if there is a positive cross-correlation between the current level of income and the past level of CO2 emissions and a negative cross-correlation between the current level of income and the future CO2 emissions. then CO2 emissions will decline with an increase in income over time. consistent with the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. First. for 21 out of 181 countries (12%). there is clear evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis.

Using the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. this study analyses the impact of electricity generated using RES on the environment and trade openness for the period 1980-2009. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach the results show that the elasticities of electricity production from renewable sources with respect to CO2 emissions are negative and significant in both the short and long-run. This implies the potential of renewable energy in controlling CO2 emissions in both short and long-run in Malaysia. Renewable energy can ensure sustainability of electricity supply and at the same time can reduce CO2 emissions. Trade openness has a significant negative effect on CO2 emissions in the long-run. The Granger causality test based on Vector Error Correction Mode (VECM) indicates that there is an evidence of positive bi-directional Granger causality relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in the short and long-run suggesting that carbon emissions and economic growth are interrelated to each other. Furthermore. there is a negative long-run bi-directional Granger causality relationship between electricity production from renewable sources and CO2 emissions.

Six out of eight dirty industries are found to show statistically significant inverted U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth. thus the EKC. Export from industries such as textile. wearing apparel and leather. manufacture of fabricated metal products and electrical machinery significantly increase CO2 emissions in Malaysia. Most of the import coefficients are significant and positively related to CO2 emissions. which is in contrast to the PHH. This strongly rejects the PHH for CO2 emissions in Malaysia-China trade. There is no evidence that domestic production of pollution-intensive goods in Malaysia is being replaced by imports from China. Based on the analysis. Malaysia-China bilateral trade increases CO2 emissions in Malaysia. There is therefore urgent need that electricity generation in Malaysia is from clean and sustainable sources. There have been efforts by the Malaysian government towards achieving this objective through its many related policies introduced since the beginning of this new millennium.,True,s2Wmh1kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,18,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azlinda_Azman/publication/282208947_Evidence_of_the_environmental_Kuznets_curve_Implications_of_industrial_trade_data/links/5607a04f08ae8e08c09272f1/Evidence-of-the-environmental-Kuznets-curve-Implications-of-industrial-trade-data.pdf,10957763330406057126,/scholar?cites=10957763330406057126,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azlinda_Azman/publication/282208947_Evidence_of_the_environmental_Kuznets_curve_Implications_of_industrial_trade_data/links/5607a04f08ae8e08c09272f1/Evidence-of-the-environmental-Kuznets-curve-Implications-of-industrial-trade-data.pdf,0,0,0

This study considers 67 industries (2-digit and 3-digit SITC classifications) and investigates the short-run (J-curve pattern) and the long-run effects of the real depreciation ringgit/yen on the trade balance of each industry. Using annual import and export data over the period of 1974-2009. this study employs the bounds testing approach to cointegration and error-correction modelling. The empirical results indicate that whilst depreciation of ringgit has short-run significant effects on the trade balance in majority of the industries. the short-run effects translate into the favorable long-run effects only in 24 of the 67 industries.

Energy Consumption and Trade with Environmental Degradation: The Case Study of Five Asean Countries,2013,BEHNAZ Saboori,,,,,Universiti Sains Malaysia,Climate change or global warming is one of the most serious environmental threats of the 21st century. It is the only global environmental problem that receives the attention of heads of states and governments. Scientific researches by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict millions of people will confront shortage of food and water and a greater risk to quality of life due to the climate change. IPCC also identified that developing countries are among the most vulnerable regions to climate change due to the lack of social. technological and financial resources (IPCC. 2007). The Southeast Asian region which comprised mostly of developing countries is already affected by climate change and the worst is yet to come (IPCC. 2007). There are a number of factors that make the region more vulnerable to the climate change. A seminal study conducted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2009 listed them as follows; rapid population growth (2 percent annually) compared with the global average (1.4 percent); long coastlines; high concentration of population and economic activities in coastal areas; heavy reliance on agriculture for providing livelihoods and high dependence on fisheries. natural resources and forestry in many of its countries (ADB. 2009)Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions which is responsible for about 60 percent of the greenhouse effect (Ozturk & Acaravci. 2010a). significantly contribute to the warming of global temperatures and climate change (IPCC. 1997).

The data on the growth rate of GDP per capita. number of international tourist arrivals and other explanatory variables are averaged over 4-year non-overlapping periods giving six observations per countries (albeit the last observation covers only a two-year period). The explanatory variables included the degree of development. physical investment rate. human capital rate. trade openness. government consumption expenditure. inflation rate. fluctuations in growth rate and political rights. The study employs Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to estimate the effect of the tourism industry and other explanatory variables on economic growth. The analysis was conducted in three levels. First. it uses the number of international tourist arrivals as a proxy for tourism development. Second. it uses the logarithm of the variables without the number of international tourists in the model. Third. it uses both variables as proxies for tourism development. Results of the three models show that the inbound and outbound effects of tourism on economic growth are positive and significant.

The progress of energy transition by considering geopolitical risk has not been considered seriously yet. This paper contributes to the literature by modeling and analyzing energy transition patterns in Russia with emphasis on geopolitical risks factor as a giant fossil fuels producer using the ARDL bounds testing method over the period of 1993–2018. The main results proved long-run negative impact of economic growth. population growth and inflation rate on energy transition of Russia. while CO 2 emissions. geopolitical risk. exchange rate and financial openness have positive impacts on energy transition movement in the country. Furthermore. we found out that in the short-run. the relationship between energy transition improvement and economic growth. CO 2 emissions. population growth and inflation rate is negative. while geopolitical risk. exchange rate and financial openness are the only variables which accelerate energy transition in the country. As major concluding remarks. Russia’s policy makers should draw attention to the long-run energy plans in the country. Furthermore. lowering dependency of Federals’ budget to the oil and gas revenues would be a useful policy to reduce negative impact of economic growth on energy transition movement in the country. Another recommendation is to determine rapid decarbonizing policies in the country.

US LNG with a production capacity of over 60 million tonnes per year will be indexed to Henry Hub prices. Henry Hub being a natural gas hub in the state of Louisiana. America. US LNG was regarded as a great way of reducing the LNG import cost to Asian importers which were experiencing increased LNG import costs. Rocketing LNG import costs resulted from rapid demand growth and high international LNG prices in the early 2010s and motivated discussions about de-linkage of LNG prices from crude oil prices among Asian importers. Increased domestic oil production led to the fall of the US crude oil imports. which brought down the crude oil price in the international market. Oil price falls resulted in a disappearance of the price advantage of US LNG over traditional crude oil-indexed LNG.

1108779,Energy. human capital and economic growth in Asia Pacific countries—Evidence from a panel cointegration and causality analysis,2016,Zheng Fang and Youngho Chang,56,Energy Economics,,177-184,North-Holland,This paper examines the cointegration and causal relationship between energy consumption and economic development in 16 Asia Pacific countries over the period 1970–2011 using the augmented production function which considers not only physical capital and labor but also human capital. This is likely among the first of the energy–growth nexus literature to include human capital in the multivariate framework. Using recently developed panel unit root test and cointegration test that allow for cross-sectional dependence. this paper finds a long-run cointegrating relationship between these variables. Continuously-updated fully modified (Cup-FM) estimates are subsequently compared with panel heterogeneous fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) results to confirm the importance of accounting for interdependence across countries.

This study used the causality approach developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995) to explore the causality between oil prices and stock prices in the long-run and their short-term impact. The generalized impulse response functions were applied to the monthly data in the period from January 1997 to July 2013. In this study. to capture the different characteristics of oil refining. exporting and importing. three Asian economies were examined. The results indicate that the manner in which a market reacts to hikes in oil prices varies between different markets and periods.

Uneven distribution of energy resources and uneven paces of economic development among ASEAN countries complicate the question. The ASEAN Power Grid (APG) that interconnects all ASEAN countries and enables cross-border power trade could potentially provide cost-saving solutions. This study builds a dynamic linear programming model and simulates optimal development paths of power generation capacities in ASEAN countries. Scenarios are built around the assumptions about the power trade policy regimes. It is found that more open power trade regime encourages development of renewable sources of power generation. and accrues more savings in the total cost of meeting the growing future power demand from 2010 to 2030.,True,qgTUUugAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,63,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X1200048X,338589583654295924,/scholar?cites=338589583654295924,,https://www.eria.org/ERIA-DP-2012-15.pdf,0,0,0

A structural vector autoregressive approach is employed to examine the dynamics between oil price shocks and gold returns. Various oil price proxies are used in the empirical examination to capture potential nonlinearities in the dynamics between oil price shocks and gold returns. Oil price shocks appear to have a statistically significant and positive impact on real gold returns contemporaneously. The impact is found to be symmetric but nonlinear.

The objective of the study is to explore qualitatively why the energy security situation has not improved. To answer the ‘why’ question. the study opens up a new perspective by analyzing the relationship between energy security and energy policies from the macroeconomic reform perspective.

Singapore is reliant on foreign direct investments and exports so competition from countries with lower costs such as China and India is exerting pressure on the government to reduce the costs of doing business here. Electricity cost is one of these. Deregulation is believed to be able to bring about lower electricity costs due to the various efficiency gains possible. This study concerns itself mainly with production efficiency and attempts to calculate possible production efficiency gains by using linear programming model.

The contemporary ecological crisis is an urgent global concern which requires global incorporated solution and sincere commitment of nations (Kevin and Edmund 1994. 7-10). Essential components for human survival. primarily water and food supplies are being threatened across the world by population and consumption pressures (Mary and John 2009). Natural environment is rapidly deteriorated with many anthropogenic activities like unprecedented industrialization of modern society. especially with the drastic growth of human population and increased demand for food and energy (Mary and John 2009). The world of nature is being violated and demolished in an incomparable way all around the world by either secularists or godly people of different faiths. However. regardless of diverse faiths and sentiments. religious beliefs certainly perform a crucial position in underpinning human existence and functioning of human being (Kay 1993. 43). Widespread destruction of species. continual loss of habitat and accelerating climate change issues are demanding interfaith efforts to reverse current trends and to move toward sustainable future for humans and nature.

Human activities. awareness and habits are of paramount importance in remedying the current state of environment. The shaping of attitude. values. perception. commitment and practice of human beings necessary to preserve and protect the environment is closely associated with their belief. worldview. tradition and culture. Hence. religion plays an influential role in developing new patterns of behavior toward the environment. In the context of Malaysia. it is evident that the condition of the environment in Malaysia is worsening as the country continues to industrialize dramatically. As a country with over 60% Muslims. it is necessary to look at environmental preservation from an Islamic perspective. Therefore. this study aims to determine how knowledge and understanding of Islamic teachings of the environment is important. The subjects were 400 Muslim individuals across Malaysia who were randomly selected from different organizations. universities and companies.

In remote and / or sparsely populated as well as in conflict-prone regions. these can be difficult to assess. in particular when they are of a large scale. Analyzing land use and land cover changes can be an important initial step towards establishing the quantity and quality of impacts. Drawing from very-high-resolution-multi-temporal-satellite-imagery. this paper reports on a study which employed the Random Forest Classifier and Land Change Modeler to derive detailed information of the spatial patterns and temporal variations of land-use and land-cover changes resulting from the China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines in Ann township in Myanmar’s Rakhine State of Myanmar. Deforestation and afforestation conversion processes during pre- and post-construction periods (2010 to 2012) are compared. Whilst substantial forest areas were lost along the pipelines. this is only part of the story. as afforestation has also happened in parallel. However. afforestation areas can be of a lower value. and in order to be able to take quality of forests into account. it is of crucial importance to accompany satellite-imagery based techniques with field observation.

This study reports on an analysis of the information about the uses and the rationales for these programs drawn from the websites of Australian schools. Wide-ranging claims are made for the benefits of these programs for students with difficulties and for typically developing students but there is evidence that they are not effective in improving academic and other skills. Although the survey is limited to 117 schools with websites that mention PMPs. the uncritical acceptance of these programs by schools and teachers is of concern.

Multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have frequently been used to examine the impact of climate change on agriculture. However. these studies do not focus on country-specific issues related to the link between climate change and agriculture. This paper aims to address this gap by investigating the economy-wide impacts of climate change on Nepalese agriculture. Nepal makes an interesting case study as it has one of the most vulnerable agricultural economies in South Asia. This paper develops a comparative static multi-household CGE model to trace the direct and indirect impacts of climate change in Nepal. The results suggest that climate change has a significant negative impact on the overall Nepalese economy due to the induced loss of agricultural productivity …,True,mY6x9s8AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999316305004,1310274058391073308,/scholar?cites=1310274058391073308,,https://www.academia.edu/download/65410280/2017_Eco_Mod_Chalise_et_al_and_Sarker.pdf,0,0,0

India. Nepal. Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The study finds that about 30% of the total energy in the manufacturing industry is used in this sector. which is about 11% of total industrial input. contributing approximately 13% to the Manufacturing Value Added (MVA). Electricity. on the other hand. shares almost 60% of total energy consumption in the five countries in South Asia. followed by natural gas. coal. kerosene and diesel. The study also finds that CO2 emissions vary across sectors in countries in which the study was conducted. For instance. while in Bangladesh CO2 emissions are primarily caused by electricity generation. in India the majority of CO2 emissions are originated from coal. On the contrary. CO2 emissions in Nepal are mostly generated through other fuels such as Charcoal. Diesel and Kerosene.

The borders of modern Bangladesh took shape during the Partition of Bengal and British India in 1947. when the region became the eastern wing of the newly formed state of Pakistan. Following years of political exclusion. ethnic and linguistic discrimination. and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing. a surge of popular agitation. nationalism and civil disobedience led in 1971 to the Bangladesh Liberation War. resulting in the separation of the region from Pakistan and the formation of an independent Bangladesh. After independence. the new state proclaimed a secular multiparty democracy. The country then endured decades of poverty. famine. political turmoil and numerous military coups.

Bangladesh introduced VAT in 1991 replacing the previous taxes like sales tax. excise duty and business turnover taxes. In last two decades VAT has become an all encompassing domestic tax covering the domestic manufacturing. wholesale. retail and all the service sectors in the country. This paper is a first attempt to measures the incidence of Value Added Tax (VAT) in Bangladesh. The results show that the VAT incidence varies for people in different income groups. For instance. the VAT incidence for the lowest income group is 6.92 percent whereas for the highest income group it is only 4.56 percent. The higher income groups are also enjoying fewer burdens than the lower income groups.

Hence. it is necessary to study factors affecting this economic variable. The exchange rate and risk associated with its unexpected volatilities can be noted as the factors affecting export. On this basis. this research aims to investigate the effect of real exchange rate risk on Iran’s non-oil export. To do this. the disaggregate data belonging to 13 Iran’s trading partners over the period of 1985-2010 was used. The panel data approach was also utilized in the analysis process. Furthermore. to more accurate investigate of this subject. 7 alternative criteria were used to assess the volatility of real exchange rate. The results indicated that the exchange rate risk has a positive and significant effect on Iran’s non-oil export in the short-run. This result could be attributed to the positive nature of exchange rate volatility in Iran so that this matter could change the expectations of economic agents. especially exporters. to improve the general trend of real exchange rate.,True,Q93ZrWwAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,6,http://egdr.journals.pnu.ac.ir/m/article_223_7847476309809f21e09997844817254c.pdf?lang=en,10931735977287843347,/scholar?cites=10931735977287843347,,http://egdr.journals.pnu.ac.ir/m/article_223_7847476309809f21e09997844817254c.pdf?lang=en,0,0,0

For the first time in Iran. we have used the wavelet decomposition technique to study this relation. Both TFP growth and inflation series between 1960-2006 are decomposed up to three levels. Our analysis of causality relations between all the composed and decomposed series shows that though no statically meaningful effect between original series has been proved. there are some negative relations between decomposed series in first and second level. Moreover. our study reveals some previously unknown spillover effects between various frequencies of both series as explained in paper.

The current study results reject a long run relationship between price and energy productivity. based on a standard co-integration test. However. using an asymmetric co-integration (hidden cointegration) approach. we observe a meaningful relationship between price end energy efficiency. This results implies that continuation of the decreasing trend of real energy prices will result in further reductions in energy productivity.

Herein. we simulate the photovoltaic device performance of various n-type contact material pairings with tin(II) sulfide (SnS). a p-type absorber. The performance of the contacting material. and resulting device efficiency. depend most strongly on two variables: conduction band offset between absorber and contact layer. and doping concentration within the contact layer. By generating a 2D contour plot of device efficiency as a function of these two variables. we create a performance-space plot for contacting layers on a given absorber material.

Its electrical and optical properties can be appropriately tuned via nitrogen-doping to create a semi-transparent tunnel junction to a back-contact. We fabricate Cu2O-based heterojunction thin-film solar cells and insert a 20 nm-thick Cu2O:N hole-transporting layer between a silver back-contact and a Cu2O light-absorbing layer. The insertion of a 20 nm-thick Cu2O:N layer results in sizeable enhancements of fill-factor and power conversion efficiency of the solar cells.

Although the product. hydrogen. can be applied directly as a fuel. a very promising direction is to use it as a key feedstock in the production of synthetic liquid fuels. such as those made by the Fischer–Tropsch method.[1] Solar water splitting is achieved by using a semiconductor cell to straddle the water redox potential thereby donating holes and electrons at the anode and cathode. respectively.[2. 3] The anode reaction of conventional cells requires high overpotential owing to highenergy intermediate states.[4] which makes the development of efficient photoanodes an intense area of current research.

A strong contributing factor to this underperformance is the conduction-band offset between Cu2O and its n-type heterojunction partner or electron-selective contact. In the present work. a broad range of possible n-type materials is surveyed. including ZnO. ZnS. Zn(O.S). (Mg.Zn)O. TiO2. CdS. and Ga2O3. Band offsets are determined through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical bandgap measurements. A majority of these materials is identified as having a negative conduction-band offset with respect to Cu2O; the detrimental impact of this on open-circuit voltage (VOC) is evaluated through 1-D device simulation.

AZTSe is weakly n‐type. and this study reports for the first time on how the carrier density is impacted by stoichiometry. This study presents the first‐ever photovoltaic device based on AZTSe. which exhibits an efficiency of 5.2%. which is the highest value reported for an n‐type thin‐film absorber.

Further. we find that sodium impacts the relative ratios of two sub-bandgap peaks in the 4 K photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CZTSe (one at ∼0.85 eV and another at ∼0.92 eV). We propose that both of these sub-bandgap peaks stem from intrinsic point defects in CZTSe rather than from electronic states introduced by sodium; this is supported by a measurement on a sodium-free single-crystal of CZTSe.

Temperature-dependent Hall mobilities measured on these films are comparable to monocrystalline Cu2O at temperatures above 250 K. reaching 62 cm2/V s at room temperature. At lower temperatures. the Hall mobility appears limited by carrier scattering from ionized centers.

To reduce back-contact resistance and create an electron-reflecting back surface field. high carrier density and appropriate work function are desired for the layer. Its electrical and optical properties can be appropriately tuned via nitrogen-doping to create a semi-transparent tunnel junction to a back-contact. We fabricate Cu2O-based heterojunction thin-film solar cells and insert a 20 nm-thick Cu2O:N hole-transporting layer between a silver back-contact and a Cu2O light-absorbing layer. The insertion of a 20 nm-thick Cu2O:N layer results in sizeable enhancements of fill-factor and power conversion efficiency of the solar cells.

A self-consistent optical-electrical model that considers nonideal losses within the devices is developed. For single-junction devices. we find that the impact of photon recycling on the voltage increases monotonically with the injection level. For record-level GaAs solar cells. the voltage boost is 33 mV under open-circuit conditions and 13 mV at the maximum power point. For tandem GaAs/Si solar cells. photon reabsorption moderates the sensitivity of tandem efficiency to both obvious parameters like absorber thickness and implicit parameters like shunt resistance (R sh ) and bulk lifetime.

Grain size. Hall mobility. and majority-carrier concentration monotonically increase with growth temperature. However. the charge collection as measured by the long-wavelength contribution to short-circuit current exhibits a non-monotonic behavior: the collection decreases with increased growth temperature from 150 °C to 240 °C and then recovers at 285 °C. Fits to the experimental internal quantum efficiency using an opto-electronic model indicate that the non-monotonic behavior of charge-carrier collection can be explained by a transition from drift- to diffusion-assisted components of carrier collection.

Because both subcells are contacted independently in a 4T tandem. multiple stacked semitransparent contacts are needed. causing optical and series resistance losses.

In the insulator. the low-temperature antiferromagnetic order results from superexchange among correlated electrons and couples to a (1/2. 1/2. 1/2) superlattice distortion. Applying pressure suppresses the insulating state. but enhances the magnetism as the superexchange increases with decreasing lattice constant. By comparing our results under pressure to previous studies of doped crystals. we show that this dependence of the magnetism on the lattice constant is consistent for both band broadening and band filling. In the high-pressure metallic phase the lattice symmetry is reduced from cubic to monoclinic. pointing to the primary influence of charge correlations at the transition.

A detailed understanding of the effect of Zn excess on device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Thus. specific criteria for high-performance devices. in particular discriminating between the effects of Zn-rich features at the front versus the back of the absorber. are desired. In this study. we report that co-evaporated kesterite absorbers can demonstrate high device efficiency despite the presence of large quantities of ZnSe. However. the benign presence of ZnSe is found to be conditional. While large ZnSe grains on the back of the absorbers are not harmful to device performance. the ZnSe grains produced by excess Zn near the end of the deposition degrade the cell efficiency from 8% level to 6% level (without anti-reflection coatings).

A molecular inhibitor–an additive that modifies the surface attachment kinetics but does not decompose and contribute impurity atoms to the film–is added during the nucleation and/or growth stages of the film. Here we show that the reaction by-product VTMS can serve as such an inhibitor. If the inhibitor is added during the nucleation stage. when bare substrate surface is still exposed. the inhibitor greatly reduces the rate of coalescence and promotes the formation of a large density of uniformly-sized copper islands.

Two fluorinated poly (amic acid) s were studied: 6FDA/4-BDAF and 6FDA/1. 3 (3)-APB. Thermal curing of the silver (I)-doped poly (amic acid) films led to silver (I) reduction and formation of reflective surface-silvered polyimide films at silver concentrations from 2 to 10 wt%. Even very low concentrations (2 wt%. 0.28 vol%) gave excellent specular reflectivity with the isopropylidene-containing polyimides. The reflective surfaces were optimized when the cure temperature was 275–300 C. although X-ray diffraction showed metallic silver as early as 200 C. After achieving a maximum specular reflectivity of 80–100% in the 275–300 C range for the silvered films. the reflectivity diminished modestly with further heating at 300 C. Starting with the soluble imide forms of 6FDA/4-BDAF and 6FDA/1. 3 (3)-APB gave films which were 25–40% less reflective than those beginning with the poly (amic acid).

1109131,Connections between climate sensitivity and large-scale extratropical dynamics,2019,Luke LB Davis,,,,,,The response of the extratropical storm tracks to anthropogenic forcing is one of the most important but poorly understood aspects of climate change. The direct. thermodynamic effects of climate change are relatively well understood. but their two-way interactions with large-scale extratropical dynamics are extremely difficult to predict. There is thus continued need for a robust understanding of how this coupling evolves in space and time. The dry dynamical core represents one of the simplest possible numerical models for studying the response of the extratropical storm tracks to climate change.

In this thesis. we systematically vary the damping rate and the equilibrium temperature field in a dry dynamical core in order to understand how the amplitude of the damping influences extratropical dynamics. Critically. we prove that the damping rate is a measure of the climate sensitivity of the dry atmosphere. The key finding is that the structure of the extratropical circulation is a function of the climate sensitivity. Larger damping timescales – which are equivalent to higher climate sensitivities – lead to a less dynamically active extratropical circulation. equatorward shifts in the jet. and a background state that is almost neutral to baroclinic instability. They also lead to increases in the serial …,True,ehtx__4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://mountainscholar.org/handle/10217/195373,,,,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/10217/195373/Davis_colostate_0053N_15418.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Here. it is demonstrated that PL spectra of typical CZTS absorbers on Mo/glass substrates can be heavily distorted by interference effects. One reason for the pronounced interference in CZTS is the low reabsorption of the PL emission that typically occurs below the band gap. A similar situation occurs in band gap graded CIGS where the PL emission originates predominantly from the band gap minimum located at the notch region.

In this report. we show that by sequential processing of the active components and by subsequent annealing a “pseudo-bilayer” can be formed which results in an enhanced nanomorphology for efficient charge generation and extraction. The enhanced nanomorphology arises from the inter-diffusion of the PCBM nanoparticles into a layer of pre-organised polymer P3HT instead of a phase separation that happens at the time of spin-coating and annealing in the case of conventional BHJ devices. To get a further insight into the inter-diffusion process.

A precise understanding of stacking fault annihilation mechanisms is therefore crucial for the development of effective deposition processes. During co-evaporation of Cu(In.Ga)Se2—a photovoltaic absorber material showing record efficiencies of up to 22.9% for thin film solar cells—a reduction of stacking faults occurs at the transition from a Cu-poor to a Cu-rich film composition. parallel to grain growth. which is suggesting that the two phenomena are coupled.

ZnSn N 2 is a ternary nitride of interest for photovoltaics. which forms in a wurtzite-derived crystal structure. In the ground state. every N anion is coordinated by two Zn and two Sn cations. thereby observing the octet rule locally. Using a motif-based model Hamiltonian. we performed Monte Carlo simulations that provide atomistic representations of ZnSn N 2 with varying degrees of cation disorder. Subsequent electronic structure calculations describe the evolution of band gaps. optical properties. and carrier localization effects as a function of the disorder. We find that octet-rule conserving disorder is practically impossible to avoid but perfectly benign. with hardly any effects on the electronic structure.

It is observed that polymer samples with lower regioregularity are capable of generating fullerene composites that exhibit superior thermal stability. The enhanced thermal stability of the composites is attributed to a lower driving force for polymer crystallization in the less regioregular polymer samples. which is supported with two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry measurements.

1109245,Atomic Layer Deposition of Thin Film Indium Oxysulfide-A Non-Toxic Electron Transport Layer for Chalcogenide Solar Cells,2018,Ashwin Jayaraman,,,,,,CZT(S.Se) (Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1-x)4) has emerged as an earth-abundant. non-toxic alternative to thin-film photovoltaic technologies based on CIG(S.Se) (Cu(In.Ga)(S.Se)2) and CdTe. Devices employing CZT(S.Se). however. suffer from poor voltage extraction. reaching only 60 % of the Shockley-Queisser limit.  The low photovoltage results primarily from interfacial recombination at the absorber-electron conductor junction. owing to mismatch in conduction band energies. lack of conformality. unpassivated defects. and elemental interdiffusion. The best existing heterojunction devices employ CdS as the electron transport layer.  We have explored In2(O.S)3 films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as an electron transport layer for CZT(S.Se). The motivation for this thesis was to tune the bands of In2(O.S)3  by controlling the S:O ratio. This would result in higher collection of photo-generated electrons and higher open circuit voltage on coupling In2(O.S)3  with CZT(S.Se).  We initially selected In2S3 on grounds that In3+ ion possibly has lower diffusivity than Cd2+ which should limit elemental interdiffusion. It has been previously established in literature by solution deposition that incorporation of oxygen into In2S3 allows us to obtain band positions at the p-n junction that should enable good minority carrier extraction. Oxygen incorporation also increases the band gap and therefore the optical transparence.  Unfortunately. solution-based methods leave a large number of uncontrollable hydroxyl groups in the film. which affords poor control over electrical properties of the film.

We describe the scaling behavior in amorphous InZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) with a significant decrease in the extracted field-effect mobility μFE with channel length L (from 39.3 to 9.9 cm2/V·s as L is reduced from 50 to 5 μm). Transmission line model measurements reveal that channel scaling leads to a significant μFE underestimation due to contact resistance (RC) at the metallization/channel interface. Therefore. we suggest a method of extracting correct μFE when the TFT performance is significantly affected by RC. The corrected μFE values are higher (45.4 cm2/V·s) and nearly independent of L.

The optoelectronic properties of SnS are largely dependent on its microstructure and deposition methods. First. we review the experimental and theoretical studies on SnS since the mid-20th century and evaluates the results with a focus on the deposition methods and microstructures; we also summarize the major challenges facing the SnS solar cells. To advance our understanding of the material fundamentals. we study the ALD growth behavior and mechanisms of SnS using a new and highly reactive liquid tin (II) precursor. Pure and stoichiometric SnS films can be obtained in the range of 65 – 180 °C. Mechanistic studies suggest higher probability of a double ligand-exchange process (“Sn-bridge” formation) in the Sn-precursor exposure step and dissociative or associative chemisorption of H2S in the following step. Solar cells fabricated using the SnS film deposited using this new precursor show comparable cell efficiency and improved device yield. We also study the crystallographic phases and orientations of the ALD-SnS thin films. which depend on the deposition temperature. film thickness. and choice of substrate. We confirm the presence of the metastable cubic π-SnS and find that it is more favorable at lower deposition temperatures. Relatively thick films grown on both silicon thermal oxide and NaCl (100) substrates contain mixed π and α phases and are textured. with the latter showing much higher degree of texturing and a different orientation.

The results show that PPME–CNG dual fuel operation is more effective than Diesel–CNG dual fuel operation in improving the performance and emission characteristics of the engine. CNG is found to share higher quantity of input energy with PPME pilot operation than pilot Diesel operation. Low amount of CNG injection also increases the brake thermal efficiency of the engine. PPME–CNG operations with low amount of CNG injections are also more instrumental in reducing CO (carbon monoxide) emission and smoke opacity than Diesel–CNG operations.

Most of these researches have focused on the combustion of natural gas in a dual fuel mode by using Diesel as the pilot fuel. However. the dual fuel operation of natural gas with pilot Diesel reduces the brake thermal efficiency and increases the hydrocarbon emission. The present experimental work explores the potential of using CNG under dual fuel operation by utilizing two different blends of Diesel–ethanol–biodiesel as the pilot fuel. The present study reveals that the increased percentages of ethanol and biodiesel in the pilot fuel triggers an increase in the brake thermal efficiency of the engine.

The model is second-order in its complexity and is shown to be more accurate to the standard “linear-by-volume” (LbV) model which is often used when no other information is available. Such observations are due to the existence of both synergistic and antagonistic blending of the octane numbers between the three components. In particular. antagonistic blending of toluene and iso-octane leads to a maximum in sensitivity that lies on the toluene/iso-octane line.

In practice. autoignition times are complex functions of fuel chemistry and burning velocity (which affects pressure-temperature history). residual gas concentration and content of species such as NO. As a result. autoignition expressions prove inadequate for engine conditions straying far from those under which they were derived. The currently reported study was designed to separate some of these effects. Experimental pressure crank-angle histories were derived for an engine operated in skip-fire mode to eliminate residuals.

1109393,Research on the Combustion Characteristics of a Free-piston Gasoline Engine Linear Generator during the Stable Generating Process,2016,Yuxi Miao and Zhengxing Zuo and Huihua Feng and Chendong Guo and Yu Song and Boru Jia and Yuyao Guo,,Energies,,,,The free-piston gasoline engine linear generator (FPGLG) is a new kind of power plant consisting of free-piston gasoline engines and a linear generator. Due to the elimination of the crankshaft mechanism. the piston motion process and the combustion heat release process affect each other significantly. In this paper. the combustion characteristics during the stable generating process of a FPGLG were presented using a numerical iteration method. which coupled a zero-dimensional piston dynamic model and a three-dimensional scavenging model with the combustion process simulation. The results indicated that. compared to the conventional engine (CE). the heat release process of the FPGLG lasted longer with a lower peak heat release rate. The indicated thermal efficiency of the engine was lower because less heat was released around the piston top dead centre (TDC). Very minimal difference was observed on the ignition delay duration between the FPGLG and the CE. while the post-combustion period of the FPGLG was significantly longer than that of the CE. Meanwhile. the FPGLG was found to operate more moderately due to lower peak in-cylinder gas pressure and a lower pressure rising rate. The potential advantage of the FPGLG in lower NO x emission was also proven with the simulation results presented in this paper.

Main components involved in the gas exchange process are discussed. The ambient conditions. the turbocharger performance. and the valve timing that affect the gas exchange process have been investigated. Experiments were conducted to simulate ambient conditions at different geographical locations and demonstrated a decrease in oxygen concentration in the exhaust as the humidity level in the air increased. Additionally. the effect of an inefficient turbocharger on an engine operating at part-load was also investigated. It was observed that an overly lean air/fuel mixture caused inefficient scavenging and the corresponding level of residual gas trapped in the cylinder increased. This resulted in partial combustion which could be observed as white smoke from the engine exhaust stack. therefore indicating the presence of unburnt fuel. Exhaust valve timing measurements showed that the cylinder with the highest wear rate had its valve closure timing 10 crank angle degrees after the cylinder with least wear rate. The exhaust valves were closed earlier than the designed condition which impaired the scavenging process and increased the level of residual gas trapped in the cylinder. This resulted in a reduction of the actual air-to-fuel ratio and high exhaust gas temperatures.

This paper seeks to address a major challenge in the development of new and complex technologies—how do we effectively communicate and understand the influence of key design parameters on its operating performance? In this paper. the FPEG is described using a simple numerical model. a model which is reduced to a forced mass-spring vibration system under external excitation. enabling all the major input parameters to be decoupled. It proved that the engine piston position as a function of time and output power could be predicted directly from the input parameters with acceptable accuracy. The influence of the key FPEG design parameters on the piston oscillation characteristics and electric power output can be characterised with respect to one another and summarised. Key design parameters include piston mass. compression stroke length. piston cross sectional area. and electric load. Compared with previous and more complex numerical models. the presented methods can be used to simply describe the sensitivity of key design parameters on the FPEG performance.

In the present study. the system performance of the designed TCFPEG system is predicted using a validated numerical model. A parametric analysis is undertaken based on the influence of the engine load. valve timing. the number of linear generators adopted. and different fuels on the system performance. It is found that when linear electric generators are connected with the free-piston gas turbine. the bottom dead centre. the peak piston velocity. and engine operation frequency are all reduced. Very minimal difference on the in-cylinder pressure and the compressor pressure is observed. while the peak pressure in the bounce chamber is reduced. When coupled with a linear electric generator. the system efficiency can be improved to nearly 50% by optimising engine load and the number of the linear generators adopted in the TCFPEG system. The system is able to be operated with different fuels as the piston is not limited by a mechanical system; the output power and system efficiency are highest when hydrogen is used as the fuel.

High-grade thermal energy is typically recovered within processes. However. lower grade heat is often rejected to the environment.The benefits of capturing and utilising low grade thermal energy are highly dependent on the qualities and properties of the heat in the waste streams. The temperature of the low grade heat stream is the most important parameter. as the effective use of the residual heat or the efficiency of energy recovery from the low grade heat sources will mainly depend on the temperature difference between the source and a suitable sink. e.g. another process or space heating/cooling.

Heat pipes can enhance the heat transfer capabilities without needing a significant temperature gradient between heat sources and heat sinks. The effectiveness of heat pipes is due to the latent heat of phase change of the working fluid within (i) condensation and (ii) evaporation stages. The latent heat of phase change greatly exceeds the sensible heat capacity.

The Miller cycle engine is compared to a standard Otto cycle engine using cycle analyses and multidimensional simulation. and basic engine design implications are discussed. It is found that the Miller cycle engine has a potential for improved fuel efficiency. but at the cost of a reduced power to weight ratio.

The experiments were conducted at a nominal load of 4.75 bar IMEPg. with low isooctane equivalence ratios. Two sets of experiments explored the effects of direct injection timing with single and double injections. and multi-dimensional CFD modeling was used to explore mixture preparation and timing effects. The findings were that if fuel-liner impingement is to be avoided. double injections provide a 40% reduction in CO and HC emissions. resulting in a 1% increase in thermal efficiency.

In-cylinder fuel blending using port-fuel-injection of gasoline and optimized direct-injection of diesel fuel was used to control combustion phasing and duration. In addition to injection and operating parameters. the study explored the effect of fuel properties by considering both gasoline-diesel dual fuel operation. and ethanol (E85)-diesel dual fuel operation. Remarkably. high gross indicated thermal efficiencies were achieved. reaching 59% and 56% for E85-diesel and gasoline-diesel. respectively.Multi-dimensional modelling. using the KIVA-CHEMKIN code. was used to select the operating conditions for the dual-fuel engine experiments over a range of loads from near idle to 16.5 bar IMEPg. The modelling results showed that as the engine load increased. the fuel reactivity requirements to achieve optimum combustion phasing decreased. Engine experiments were then performed on a heavy-duty test engine to validate the model predictions and the modelling was further used to explain the experimentally observed results. The experiments confirmed that by optimizing the fuel reactivity based on the specific operating conditions. combustion phasing can be optimized in order to minimize fuel consumption.

1109493,A comparison of Miller and Otto cycle natural gas engines for small scale CHP applications,2009,R Mikalsen and YD Wang and AP Roskilly,86,Applied Energy,6,922-927,Elsevier,This paper presents an investigation into the feasibility and potential advantages of a small scale Miller cycle natural gas engine for applications such as domestic combined heat and power systems. The Miller cycle engine is compared to a standard Otto cycle engine using cycle analyses and multidimensional simulation. and basic engine design implications are discussed. It is found that the Miller cycle engine has a potential for improved fuel efficiency. but at the cost of a reduced power to weight ratio. A fuel efficiency advantage of 5→ 10% compared to a standard Otto cycle engine appears possible. however it is stated that further investigations. in particular into the topic of engine friction. are required in order to validate the findings.,True,9aacjLUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,82,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261908002456,17893118841769503505,/scholar?cites=17893118841769503505,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326536598.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. friction mechanisms were reviewed and compared between a free-piston and crankshaft engine of similar size. The main friction mechanisms were identified to be the piston assembly including piston rings and piston skirt. valve train system. the crank and bearing system for the CSE. and the linear electric generator for the FPE.

The piston motion of a FPEG is not restricted by a crankshaft-connection rod mechanism. it must be controlled to overcome challenges in the starting process. risk of misfire. and unstable operation. In this paper. the global control structure for a FPEG prototype is presented. A Cascade control strategy is proposed for the piston stable operation level. and PID controllers are used for both of the outer loop and inner loop.

In-cylinder heat transfer. fuel efficiency. and nitrogen oxides (NO) emissions formation are studied. along with the suitability of the free-piston engine to use a low heat rejection combustion chamber design.

During the engine operation. there could be one disturbance taking place or several disturbances take place simultaneously. By identifying different types of system disturbance with specific occurring times. the influence on the system was characterised. It was found that a step change of electric load would induce a corresponding top dead centre (TDC) step change. Low variations on piston TDC are observed when cycle-to-cycle variations take place. When unsuccessful ignition occurs. the engine will stop after one oscillation cycle. Reducing the electric load after misfire would cause more oscillation cycles and require a restart of the engine.

In the present study. the system performance of the designed TCFPEG system is predicted using a validated numerical model. A parametric analysis is undertaken based on the influence of the engine load. valve timing. the number of linear generators adopted. and different fuels on the system performance. It is found that when linear electric generators are connected with the free-piston gas turbine. the bottom dead centre. the peak piston velocity. and engine operation frequency are all reduced. Very minimal difference on the in-cylinder pressure and the compressor pressure is observed. while the peak pressure in the bounce chamber is reduced. When coupled with a linear electric generator. the system efficiency can be improved to nearly 50% by optimising engine load and the number of the linear generators adopted in the TCFPEG system. The system is able to be operated with different fuels as the piston is not limited by a mechanical system; the output power and system efficiency are highest when hydrogen is used as the fuel.

A thorough background study and literature review was carried out covering previously reported experience with free-piston engines. particular features of this technology. and potential advantages and challenges associated with their design. A single piston free-piston engine generator was proposed as a result of the background study and a design strategy for this engine configuration was formulated.

The idea of using IBS in Malaysia was first mooted during the early sixties when the Minister of Housing and Local Government visited several European countries and evaluated their building systems performance. Then. in 1964. the government took a brave decision to try one pilot projects using IBS concept. The first pilot project was constructed on 22.7 acres of land along Jalan Pekeliling which included the construction of 7 blocks of 17 storey flats. and 4 blocks of 4-storey flats comprising about 3.000 units of low cost flats and 40 storey shop lots. The project was awarded to the Gammon/Larsen Nielsen using the Danish System of large panel industrialised prefabricated systems. The performance of the project was somewhat disappointed. which incurred 8.1% cost higher than the conventional building system. However. this did not stop the penetration and proliferation of IBS from other countries into the local construction market. It was reported that at least 21 of various manufacturers and suppliers of IBS are actively promoting their systems in Malaysia. The experiences of other countries in the adoption of IBS will also be discussed.,True,tTqOb9IAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,121,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Sapuan/publication/228469116_The_Experiences_of_Malaysia_and_other_countries_in_industrialised_building_system/links/564095b208aef2be8e054883/The-Experiences-of-Malaysia-and-other-countries-in-industrialised-building-system.pdf,15870092455481065896,/scholar?cites=15870092455481065896,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Sapuan/publication/228469116_The_Experiences_of_Malaysia_and_other_countries_in_industrialised_building_system/links/564095b208aef2be8e054883/The-Experiences-of-Malaysia-and-other-countries-in-industrialised-building-system.pdf,0,0,0

Despite its advantages. the adoption of industrialised building system has been low in gaining popularity. partly due to lack of awareness and coordination among the relevant parties. Indeed. the need to be competitive in the emerging global market has prompted the local construction players to be more open minded and receptive to novel building technology. In other word. the awareness of current trends and latest innovation in industrialised building system is essential in order to survive in the competitive market.

The combination and generalization of Hooke and Coulomb’s law is formulated in a plasticity framework and is known as Mohr-Coulomb model. However. it is well known that soils are not linearly elastic and perfectly platic for the entire range of loading. In fact. actual behaviour of soils is very complicated and it shows a great variety of behaviour when subjected to different conditions. Various constitutive models have been proposed by several researchers to describe various aspects of soil behaviour in details and also to apply such models in finite element modelling for geotechnical engineering applications. Recent published evolution of models used for soft soils and tunnels for the past 30 years was also presented. It must be emphasized here that no soil constitutive model available that can completely describe the complex behaviour of real soils under all conditions.

Although the EAC’s 1999 published manual listed the generic attributes for graduates. little effort was made to ensure engineering schools appreciate and implement it. The prescriptive mode of evaluation continued until recently where engineering schools are expected to describe their programmes according to the outcome-based mode. In 2000. the Malaysian Engineering Education Model (MEEM) also paved the way for engineering schools to adopt outcome-based education but the spirit of MEEM was not fully comprehended and there was no compulsion to adhere to the recommendations.

However. since engineers have been left out of top leadership positions. there is a perception that they have a marginal role in the country's progress. Lacking in the non-technical skills. which are necessary for top management or leadership positions. has been singled out as contributing to this dilemma. It is also cited that they have also yet to be active in research and development or to be involved in business on a global scale. A study on the engineering education models worldwide has shown that engineers need to have the interpersonal skills to deal with the public effectively as well as to be technically competent. There is a variation of emphasis and levels of technical competencies aimed in these models; stretching from a broad-based to specialised education. In facing the challenges of the future. it is envisaged that engineers must still possess the necessary technical competencies but should also be trained with a stronger emphasis in engineering science so that they are flexible enough to be involved in several engineering disciplines. To prepare engineers to be leaders in the development of a nation. they must be trained with various industrial skills such as communication. management. law. politics and environment. These engineers must also be trained in humanities. including ethics and professionalism. and be exposed to global scenarios and future trends.

Ltd.,Energy analysis of a fluidized‐bed drying system is undertaken to optimize the fluidized‐bed drying conditions for large wet particles (Group D) using energy models. Three critical factors; the inlet air temperature. the fluidization velocity. and the initial moisture contents of the material (e.g.. wheat) are studied to determine their effects on the overall energy efficiency to optimize the fluidized bed drying process. In order to verify the model. different experimental data sets for wheat material taken from the literature are used. The results show that the energy efficiencies of the fluidized‐bed dryer decrease with increasing drying time and become the lowest at the end of the drying process.

Intended as a text for advanced undergraduates and as a reference for practicing engineers. the book uses the physics of flows in porous materials to tie together a wide variety of important issues from such fields as biomedical engineering. energy conversion. civil engineering. electronics. chemical engineering. and environmental engineering. Thus. for example. flows of water and oil through porous ground play a central role in energy exploration and recovery (oil wells. geothermal fluids). energy conversion (effluents from refineries and power plants). and environmental engineering (leachates from waste repositories). Similarly. the demands of miniaturization in electronics and in biomedical applications are driving research into the flow of heat and fluids through small-scale porous media (heat exchangers. filters. gas exchangers). Filters. catalytic converters. the drying of stored grains. and a myriad of other applications involve flows through porous media. By providing a unified theoretical framework that includes not only the traditional homogeneous and isotropic media but also models in which the assumptions of representative elemental volumes or global thermal equilibrium fail. the book provides practicing engineers the tools they need to analyze complex situations that arise in practice.

The performance of conventional diesel fuel (CDF) and various percentages of diesel blended with palm oil-based biodiesel is also studied to evaluate their performance. The performance of the various fuels is evaluated based on the temperature profile of the combustor’s wall and emissions. such as nitrogen oxides (NO x) and carbon monoxide (CO). The combustion experiments were conducted using three different oil burner nozzles (1.25. 1.50 and 1.75 USgal/h) under lean (equivalence ratio (Φ)= 0.8). stoichiometric (Φ= 1) and rich fuel (Φ= 1.2) ratio conditions. The results show that the rate of emission formation decreases as the volume percent of palm biodiesel in a blend increases. PME combustion tests present a lower temperature inside the chamber compared to CDF combustion. High rates of NO x formation occur under lean mixture conditions with the presence of high nitrogen and sufficient temperature. whereas high CO occurs for rich mixtures with low oxygen presence.

Thus For this analysis first each part of gas Turbine Plant were modeled by thermodynamic approach then The effect of changing in the inlet turbine temperature on the exergy efficiency and exergy destruction in this plant was evaluated. The results show that the exergy efficiency of the combustion chamber is much lower than that of other plant components due to chemical reaction and the large temperature difference between the burners and working fluid.

Present research covers both energy and exergy analyses along with a multi-objective optimization. In order to determine the irreversibilities in each component of the CHP system and assess the system performance. a complete parametric study is performed to investigate the effects of major design parameters and operating conditions on the system’s performance. The main contribution of the current research study is to conduct both exergy and multi-objective optimization of a system using different working fluid for low-grade heat recovery. In order to conduct the evolutionary based optimization. two objective functions are considered in the optimization; namely the system exergy efficiency. and the total cost rate of the system. which is a combination of the cost associated with environmental impact and the purchase cost of each component. Therefore. in the optimization approach. the overall cycle exergy efficiency is maximized satisfying several constraints while the total cost rate of the system is minimized. To provide a better understanding of the system under study. the Pareto frontier is shown for multi-objective optimization and also an equation is derived to fit the optimized point. In addition. a closed form relationship between exergy efficiency and total cost rate is derived.

The side walls of the cavity are heated with different temperatures. the top and bottom walls are isolated. and a permanent magnet is located near the bottom wall. Thermal buoyancy-induced flow is neglected due to the nongravity condition on the plane of the cavity. Conditions for the different values of non-dimensional variables in a variety of ferrofluid properties and magnetic field parameters are studied.

The performance of conventional diesel fuel (CDF) and various percentages of diesel blended with palm oil-based biodiesel is also studied to evaluate their performance. The performance of the various fuels is evaluated based on the temperature profile of the combustor’s wall and emissions. such as nitrogen oxides (NO x) and carbon monoxide (CO). The combustion experiments were conducted using three different oil burner nozzles (1.25. 1.50 and 1.75 USgal/h) under lean (equivalence ratio (Φ)= 0.8). stoichiometric (Φ= 1) and rich fuel (Φ= 1.2) ratio conditions. The results show that the rate of emission formation decreases as the volume percent of palm biodiesel in a blend increases. PME combustion tests present a lower temperature inside the chamber compared to CDF combustion. High rates of NO x formation occur under lean mixture conditions with the presence of high nitrogen and sufficient temperature. whereas high CO occurs for rich mixtures with low oxygen presence.

The global flame appearance and emissions performance were examined for high (H2/CO = 3) and moderate (H2/CO = 1.2) H2-rich syngases. Results showed that higher H2 fractions in the syngases produce lower NOx emissions per kWh basis across all equivalence ratios tested. CO emissions are equivalence ratio dependent and are less affected by the H2 fraction in the syngas. Increasing CO2 diluent ratios result in the decrease of NOx. particularly for moderate H2-rich syngases.

1109658,Investigation of radial swirler effect on flow pattern inside a gas turbine combustor,2009,Yehia A Eldrainy and MF bin Ahmad and MNM Jaafar,3,Modern Applied Science,5,21,,A study was conducted to investigate the flow pattern in a gas turbine combustor using numerical and experimental approaches. The main function of a combustor is to burn the air-fuel mixture then to admit the high energy burnt gases. with uniform and limited temperature. to drive the turbine blades. The gas temperature must not exceed a certain allowable temperature to prevent any damage of the blades. Flow pattern within the combustor has a great effect on the self sustaining flame. mixing of fuel and air. combustion intensity and combustor exit temperature uniformity. For this reason. a radial vaned swirler was used in this study to demonstrate its effect on the flow pattern within the combustor. The radial swirler vanes had an aerodynamically curved profile to allow the incoming axial flow to turn gradually and hence to inhibit the flow separation on the suction side of the vane. Therefore. smooth flow turning. higher tangential and radial-velocity components can be generated at the swirler exit with lower pressure loss. Three swirler vane angles 40. 50 and 60 corresponding to swirl numbers of 0.35. 0.54 and 1.13 were used to evaluate their effect on the combustor aerodynamics. The results show that the swirl number has a direct proportion relationship with the size and shape of the central recirculation zone as well as the corner recirculation. It is concluded that with the use of 40. 50 and 60 vane angles swirler. the vortex breakdown phenomena occurs at different intensities and sizes.,True,RP_qp4UAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,26,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0a3b/a42999d72378e5db0558b5d161d723a2c267.pdf,12615249281774410703,/scholar?cites=12615249281774410703,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0a3b/a42999d72378e5db0558b5d161d723a2c267.pdf,0,0,0

1109661,A multiple inlet swirler for gas turbine combustors,2009,Yehia A Eldrainy and Hossam S Aly and Khalid M Saqr and Mohammad Nazri Mohd Jaafar,53,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology",,,,The central recirculation zone (CRZ) in a swirl stabilized gas turbine combustor has a dominant effect on the fuel air mixing process and flame stability. Most of state of the art swirlers share one disadvantage; the fixed swirl number for the same swirler configuration. Thus. in a mathematical sense. Reynolds number becomes the sole parameter for controlling the flow characteristics inside the combustor. As a result. at low load operation. the generated swirl is more likely to become feeble affecting the flame stabilization and mixing process. This paper introduces a new swirler concept which overcomes the mentioned weakness of the modern configurations. The new swirler introduces air tangentially and axially to the combustor through tangential vanes and an axial vanes respectively. Therefore. it provides different swirl numbers for the same configuration by regulating the ratio between the axial and tangential flow momenta. The swirler aerodynamic performance was investigated using four CFD simulations in order to demonstrate the impact of tangential to axial flow rate ratio on the CRZ. It was found that the length of the CRZ is directly proportional to the tangential to axial air flow rate ratio.,True,RP_qp4UAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,22,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.2363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6222930787892617051,/scholar?cites=6222930787892617051,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.2363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The central part of compressors is its blades. Blade aerodynamic has a significant effect on compressor performance. Because of the adverse pressure gradient in the compressor. any deviation in the blade profile has a significant influence on the flow field as well as the compressor performance. During the manufacturing and operation of a compressor. the blade profile may deviate from the nominal design. This deviation may happen within the manufacturing process. e.g.. changing in stagger angle of the blade. changing in the maximum thickness of the blade profile or may occur in an operation process. e.g.. increasing the blade surface roughness. By the way. these deviations affect the compressor performance. In this research. a numerical investigation is carried out to understand better the effects of geometry variability of the blades. including maximum thickness. blade surface roughness. and rotor blades stagger angle on the Transonic Axial compressor performance parameters. including the efficiency and pressure ratio. A CFD code. which solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. is employed to simulate the complicated 3D flow field of the axial compressor.

1109705,The Effect of the Degree of Reaction on the Leakage Loss in Steam Turbines,2012,Sungho Yoon,44724,,,627-636,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,The degree of reaction selected in designing steam turbines is of paramount importance. There has been competition between 50% reaction and impulse turbines over a century. It is therefore important to understand the effect of the degree of reaction on aerodynamic performance. In particular. a change in the degree of reaction affects the leakage flow substantially in both the stationary and rotating blades due to a change in the blade loading. The effect of the degree of reaction on the efficiency loss. due to leakage flows. is systematically investigated in this paper using analytical models.It is shown that the appropriate way to understand the efficiency loss. due to leakage flows. is to estimate the kinetic energy dissipation rather than the leakage mass flow rate. as demonstrated by Yoon et al. [1]. In order to estimate the efficiency loss due to leakage flows. the well-known Denton model [2] is extended by …,True,ov_4ExwAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,2,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-abstract/GT2012/627/241152,9224001484163333088,/scholar?cites=9224001484163333088,,,0,0,0

One of the most efficient and common modeling methods is zero D analysis using scaling method with constant coefficients. Although it is efficient in the vicinity of the design point. its results are not acceptable in the off design points due to the growing error by getting away from design points. In this research. a novel zero D analysis method is developed predict accurately the compressor performance not only in the design point but also in the off design pint.

Due to the reduction of their working life time. the turbine efficiency reduces and ultimately the heavy costs of periodic repairs are needed. and new replacements of their blades are unavoidable. The aim of this study is investigation of the effects of corrosion and blade damage on flow field and gas turbine performance. by numerical simulation. In this research. a two stage turbine is modeled in the form of three dimension and the results are validated with experimental data. To analyze of the behavior of entire flow. conservation of mass. momentum. and energy equations are solved. The numerical simulation of the turbine is done with ANSYS CFX software. Then the increased rotors tip clearance effects with decreasing thickness due to corrosion in both nozzles and blade leading edge and trailing edge were separately studied on turbine flow field and its performance in five actual different pressure ratios. The results showed that the most important factor in reducing the efficiency of gas turbine is due to rotor tip clearance increasing.

Resource Constraints to Supply a Fully Renewable Energy System,2019,Vincent Moreau and Piero Carlo Dos Reis and François Vuille,8,Resources,1,29,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The transition from a fossil fuel base to a renewable energy system relies on materials and. in particular. metals to manufacture and maintain energy conversion technologies. Supply constraints shift from fossil fuels to mineral resources. We assess the availability of metal reserves and resources to build an energy system based exclusively on renewable energy technologies. A mass balance of 29 metals embodied in renewable energy technologies is compiled in order to satisfy global energy demand. based on five authoritative energy scenarios for 2050. We expand upon these scenarios by modeling the storage capacity needed to support high shares of intermittent renewables (wind and solar). The metal requirements are then compared with the current demand and proven reserves and ultimate mineable resources. This allows us to distinguish between constraints related to renewable energy sources from those linked to technology mixes. The results show that proven reserves and. in specific cases. resources of several metals are insufficient to build a renewable energy system at the predicted level of global energy demand by 2050. The comparison between reserves and resources shows that scarcity relates sometimes more to techno economic supply than to raw material availability. Our results also highlight the importance of substitution among technologies and metals as well as the limited impact of recycling on the depletion of scarce metals.

1109727,On the assessment of the CO2 mitigation potential of woody biomass,2018,Víctor Codina Gironès and Emanuela Peduzzi and François Vuille and François Maréchal,5,Frontiers in Energy Research,,37,Frontiers,Woody biomass. a renewable energy resource. accumulates solar energy in form of carbon hydrates produced from atmospheric CO2 and H2O. It is therefore a means of CO2 mitigation for society as long as the biogenic carbon released to the atmosphere when delivering its energy content by oxidation can be accumulated again during growth of new woody biomass. Even when considering the complete life cycle. usually. only a small amount of fossil CO2 is emitted. However. woody biomass availability is limited by land requirement and therefore it is important to maximize its CO2 mitigation potential in the energy system. In this study. we consider woody biomass not only as a source of renewable energy but also as a source of carbon for seasonal storage of solar electricity. A first analysis is carried out based on the mitigation effect of woody biomass usage pathways. that is the avoided fossil CO2 emissions obtained by using one unit of woody biomass to provide energy services. as alternative to fossil fuels. Results show that woody biomass usage pathways can achieve up to 9.55 times the mitigation effect obtained through combustion of woody biomass. which is taken as a reference. Applying energy system modelling and multi-objective optimisation techniques. the role of woody biomass technological choices in the energy transition is then analysed at a country scale.

Evolution of the temporal spectrum,2000,François Vuille,313,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,1,170-178,The Royal Astronomical Society,An analysis of the evolution of the amplitude spectrum over many seasons of the DA pulsating white dwarf G29-38 has been performed. Neither beating nor resonant mode coupling can account for the observed appearance and disappearance of modes. although some of them clearly grow while others get damped.

Relative amplitudes of the cross-frequencies,2000,François Vuille and Pierre Brassard,313,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,1,185-192,The Royal Astronomical Society,In each season when the DA pulsating white dwarf G29–38 has been observed. its period spectrum appears very different. but it always contains a forest of harmonics and cross-frequencies. The ratio of the amplitude of these non-linear frequencies Ac to the product of the amplitudes of the corresponding parent modes A1A2 has been measured. The results are compared with the predictions given by three existing theoretical models. Our analysis shows that the non-linear frequencies present in the period spectrum of G29–38 owe their presence mostly to the inelastic response of the stellar medium to the perturbation travelling through it. rather than to the non-linear response of the emergent luminous flux to the surface temperature variation.

This complements a companion paper which analyses the evolution of the temporal spectrum of G29–38.We show that. with one exception. the relative phases of the harmonics and combination frequencies are all oscillating in phase with their parent modes. This not only suggests that these non-linear frequencies owe their presence to harmonic distortion and not to resonant mode coupling. but also explains the typical pulse shapes observed in the light curves of large-amplitude variable white dwarfs.The one exceptional cross-frequency that does not show a phasing with its parent modes is thought to be a resonance.,True,3odKksIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,9,https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/313/1/179/1073377,17556713389945302369,/scholar?cites=17556713389945302369,,https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/313/1/179/1073377,0,0,0

Furthermore. there is uncertainty over what the fuel industry can achieve in terms of sustainable biofuels supply and how this can best be integrated into the vehicle fleet. and a lack of a joint fuel and vehicle industry bottom-up vision of what biofuels could achieve in road transport. This study sets out to identify a pathway that is achievable for both the fuel and auto industries. and coherent with overall policy objectives. The study shows how a range of biofuels can make a significant contribution towards meeting the EU’ s renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets for 2020. and to further targets that may be set beyond that date. At the same time. it underlines the urgent need for specifications for new biofuel blends. compatible vehicles. and a framework that addresses biofuel sustainability issues including indirect land use change. The study also supports the development of advanced biofuels. Looking forward. it emphasises the need for a concerted auto-fuel effort to deliver effective biofuel-vehicle solutions. The study proposes a biofuels roadmap which. with appropriate investment by stakeholders. should deliver important GHG emissions savings by 2030. put the EU on a trajectory for greater savings beyond that date. assist in meeting other energy and environmental objectives. contribute to green growth and competitiveness of the EU. and meet the needs of the fuel and auto …,True,3odKksIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,6,https://trid.trb.org/view/1286257,15427894515240548114,/scholar?cites=15427894515240548114,,,0,0,0

We use a hybrid approach that combines national energy transition scenarios with input–output tables. adjusted for new energy and non-energy activities.

It consists in simultaneously observing numerous confocal volumes of a specimen. in lieu of scanning one confocal spot over the region of interest. The cross-talk between neighbouring parallel confocal systems is eliminated by capturing images using a sequence of linearly independent illumination and detection patterns which permit to de-correlate the confocal from the non-confocal image. In this paper. we compare the relative efficiency of parallel and conventional confocal microscopy. using a simple analytical approach. and show that this depends strongly upon the illumination configuration.

This work addresses this challenge by establishing a country-level. spatially explicit life cycle inventory (LCI). This study comprises three separate dimensions. The first dimension is spatial: processes and emissions are allocated to the country in which they take place and modeled to take into account local factors.

1109749,Industrial ecology: a new perspective on the future of the industrial system.,2001,Suren Erkman,131,,37-38,531-538,,"Industrial ecology? A surprising. intriguing expression that immediately draws our attention. The spontaneous reaction is that ""industrial ecology"" is a contradiction in terms. something of an oxymoron. like ""obscure clarity"" or ""burning ice"". Why this reflex? Probably because we are accustomed to considering the industrial system as isolated from the Biosphere. with factories and cities on one side and nature on the other. as well as the recurrent problem of trying to minimise th impact of the industrial system on what is ""beyond"" it: its surroundings. the ""environment"". As early as the 1950's. this end-of-pipe angle was the one adopted by ecologists. whose first serious studies focused on the consequences of the various forms of pollution on nature. In this perspective on the industrial system. human industrial activity as such remained outside the field of research. Industrial ecology explores the opposite assumption: The industrial system can be seen as a certain kind of ecosystem. After all. the industrial system. just as natural ecosystems. can be described as a particular distribution of materials. energy. and information flows. Furthermore. the entire industrial system relies on resources and services provided by the Biosphere. from which it cannot be dissociated. (It should be specified that ""industrial"". in the context of industrial ecology. refers to all human activities occurring within modern technological society. Thus. tourism. housing. medical services. transportation. agriculture. etc. are part of the industrial system.) Besides its rigorous scientific conceptual framework (scientific ecology). industrial ecology can also be seen as a practical approach to …",True,kdRThjMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,71,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_844776B3EED3.P001/REF.pdf,5253189557412063058,/scholar?cites=5253189557412063058,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_844776B3EED3.P001/REF.pdf,0,0,0

For instance. CO2 and hydrogen produced with renewable electricity can be combined to provide methane (power-to-gas). This strategy could store temporary surpluses of renewable electricity. but the lack of accurate carbon balance makes it difficult to establish the regulatory status of the final product. particularly when CO2 is derived from fossil resources.This article describes an adapted methodology assessing the carbon balance of power-to-gas. The emissions of greenhouse gases per unit of energy have been calculated for different scenarios. varying the source of electricity and the origin of carbon dioxide. The methodology allows accounting for the energy contained in the initial fuel that provides the carbon dioxide.

Experiences from three Italian clusters,2017,Raffaella Taddeo and Alberto Simboli and Anna Morgante and Suren Erkman,139,Ecological Economics,,55-67,Elsevier,It is acknowledged that Industrial Symbiosis (IS) is not only a technical phenomenon; socio-relational. organizational. and cultural issues come to light in its development as well. This is much more evident when an IS relies on existing contexts. Industrial networks and clusters have been proven to be one of the best models of local industrial development. and they can be considered also a favorable starting context for IS projects. The relations between traditional and symbiotic networks have been deeply investigated. but the complexity and the scientific and practical implications of the topic render the discussion still open. The present article contributes to this debate by clarifying the dynamics of the IS development in connection with the features of existing industrial clusters.

Intermittency generates spikes in production. which need to be curtailed when exceeding consumption. Dispersion means electricity has to be transported over long distances between production and consumption sites. In the Directive 2009/28/EC. the European Commission recommends sustainable and effective measures to prevent curtailments and facilitate transportation of renewable electricity. This article explores the material constraints of storing and transporting surplus renewable electricity by conversion into synthetic methane.

1109755,The recent history of industrial ecology,2002,Suren Erkman,27,A handbook of Industrial Ecology,,,Edward Elgar Publishing. Cheltenham. UK,Industrial ecology has been manifest intuitively for quite a long time. In the course of the past 30 years the several attempts made in that direction mostly remained marginal. The expression re-emerged in the early 1990s. at first among a number of industrial engineers connected with the National Academy of Engineering in the USA. So far. there is no standard definition of industrial ecology. and a number of authors do not make a clear difference between industrial metabolism and industrial ecology. The distinction. however. makes sense not only from a methodological point of view. but also in a historical perspective: the ‘industrial metabolism’analogy was currently in use during the 1980s. especially in relation to the pioneering work of Robert Ayres. first in the US. then at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA. Laxenburg. Austria) with William Stigliani and colleagues. and more recently at INSEAD (Fontainebleau. France)(Ayres and Kneese 1969; Ayres 1989a. 1989b. 1992b. 1993b; Ayres et al. 1989; Stigliani and Jaffé 1993; Stigliani and Anderberg 1994; Lohm et al. 1994). At about the same time. the metabolic metaphor was pursued independently by Peter Baccini. Paul Brunner and their colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ)(Baccini and Brunner 1991; Brunner et al. 1994). In parallel. it should be recalled that there is a long tradition of organic metaphors in the history of evolutionary economics (Hodgson 1993a. 1993b).,True,kdRThjMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,37,https://hsseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A-Handbook-of-Industrial-Ecology.pdf#page=48,16663930831169894282,/scholar?cites=16663930831169894282,,https://hsseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A-Handbook-of-Industrial-Ecology.pdf#page=48,0,0,0

However limiting their impacts on potential benefits for reducing climate change is shortsighted. Global sustainability assessments are necessary to determine the sustainability of supply chains. We propose a new global criterion based framework enabling a comprehensive international comparison of bioethanol supply chains. The interest of this framework is that the selection of the sustainability indicators is qualified on three criterions: relevance. reliability and adaptability to the local context. Sustainability issues have been handled along environmental. social and economical issues. This new framework has been applied for a specific issue: from a Swiss perspective. is locally produced bioethanol in Switzerland more sustainable than imported from Brazil?

1109759,Perspectives on industrial ecology,2017,Dominique Bourg and Suren Erkman,,,,,Routledge,Business-as-usual in terms of industrial and technological development–even if based on a growing fear of pollution and shortages of natural resources–will never deliver sustainable development. However. the growing interest in recent years in the new science of industrial ecology (IE). and the idea that industrial systems should mimic the quasi-cyclical functions of natural ecosystems in an'industrial food chain'. holds promise in addressing not only short-term environmental problems but also the long-term holistic evolution of industrial systems. This possibility requires a number of key conditions to be met. not least the restructuring of our manufacturing and consumer society to reduce the effects of material and energy flows at the very point in history when globalisation is rapidly increasing them. This book sets out to address the theoretical considerations that should be made implicit in future research as well as practical implementation options for industry. The systematic recovery of industrial wastes. the minimisation of losses caused by dispersion. the dematerialisation of the economy. the requirement to decrease our reliance on fuels derived from hydrocarbons and the need for management systems that help foster inter-industry collaboration and networks are among the topics covered. The book is split into four sections. First. the various definitions of IE are outlined. Here. important distinctions are made between industrial metabolism and IE.
