1270602,Genetic applications of an inverse polymerase chain reaction.,1988,Howard Ochman and Anne S Gerber and Daniel L Hartl,120,Genetics,3,621-623,Genetics,A method is presented for the rapid in vitro amplification of DNA sequences that flank a region of known sequence. The method uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). but it has the primers oriented in the reverse direction of the usual orientation. The template for the reverse primers is a restriction fragment that has been ligated upon itself to form a circle. This procedure of inverse PCR (IPCR) has many applications in molecular genetics. for example. the amplification and identification of sequences flanking transposable elements. In this paper we show the feasibility of IPCR by amplifying the sequences that flank an IS1 element in the genome of a natural isolate of Escherichia coli.,True,h_MOIUUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2302,https://www.genetics.org/content/120/3/621.short,17513886656642648410,/scholar?cites=17513886656642648410,,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/120/3/621.full.pdf,0,0,0

In principle. evolution to this high-resistance β-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However. we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization. because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the β-lactamase seems to be responsible. and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations. we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.,True,h_MOIUUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1194,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/312/5770/111.abstract,11358776892893163978,/scholar?cites=11358776892893163978,,,http://cdn.fraserlab.com/courses/amr_2019/2006_weinreich.pdf,0,0,0

Since the last review of these nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (Numts) in animals. Numts have been found in 53 of the species studied. The recent evidence suggests that Numts are not equally abundant in all species. for example they are more common in plants than in animals. and also more numerous in humans than in Drosophila. Methods for avoiding Numts have now been tested. and several recent studies demonstrate the potential utility of Numt DNA sequences in evolutionary studies. As relics of ancient mtDNA. these pseudogenes can be used to infer ancestral states or root mitochondrial phylogenies. Where they are numerous and selectively unconstrained.

As for most model-fitting functions in R. the model is described in an lmer call by a formula. in this case including both fixed-and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized. using one of the constrained optimization functions in R. to provide the parameter estimates.

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases. complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

Despite the widespread perception that parasites (in the broad sense. including microbial pathogens) threaten species with extinction. the simplest deterministic models of parasite dynamics (i.e. of specialist parasites with density‐dependent transmission) predict that parasites will always go extinct before their hosts. We review the primary theoretical mechanisms that allow disease‐induced extinction and compare them with the empirical literature on parasitic threats to populations to assess the importance of different mechanisms in threatening natural populations.

The mechanisms and consequences of this disruption are controversial. primarily because most organisms are difficult to track.

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes.

A near-universal property of primary and metastatic cancers is upregulation of glycolysis. resulting in increased glucose consumption. which can be observed with clinical tumour imaging. We propose that persistent metabolism of glucose to lactate even in aerobic conditions is an adaptation to intermittent hypoxia in pre-malignant lesions.

This limits the use of invasive biopsy based molecular assays but gives huge potential for medical imaging. which has the ability to capture intra-tumoural heterogeneity in a non-invasive way. During the past decades. medical imaging innovations with new hardware. new imaging agents and standardised protocols. allows the field to move towards quantitative imaging. Therefore. also the development of automated and reproducible analysis methodologies to extract more information from image-based features is a requirement. Radiomics – the high-throughput extraction of large amounts of image features from radiographic images – addresses this problem and is one of the approaches that hold great promises but need further validation in multi-centric settings and in the laboratory.,True,ayvBFWUAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC,2135,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804911009993,14095608601149859586,/scholar?cites=14095608601149859586,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804911009993,0,0,0

It has been hypothesized that acid pH promotes local invasive growth and metastasis. The hypothesis that acid mediates invasion proposes that H+ diffuses from the proximal tumor microenvironment into adjacent normal tissues where it causes tissue remodeling that permits local invasion. In the current work. tumor invasion and peritumoral pH were monitored over time using intravital microscopy. In every case. the peritumoral pH was acidic and heterogeneous and the regions of highest tumor invasion corresponded to areas of lowest pH. Tumor invasion did not occur into regions with normal or near-normal extracellular pH.

In this model. increased acid production due to altered glucose metabolism serves as a key intermediate by producing H+ flow along concentration gradients into adjacent normal tissue. This chronic exposure of peritumoral normal tissue to an acidic microenvironment produces toxicity by: (a) normal cell death caused by the collapse of the transmembrane H+ gradient inducing necrosis or apoptosis and (b) extracellular matrix degradation through the release of cathepsin B and other proteolytic enzymes.

Somatic evolution of invasive cancer can then be viewed as a sequence of phenotypical adaptations to these barriers. The genotypical and phenotypical heterogeneity of cancer populations is explained by an equivalence principle in which multiple strategies can successfully adapt to the same barrier.

However. the transgenic methods used for delivering reprogramming factors have raised concerns regarding the future utility of the resulting stem cells. These uncertainties could be overcome if each transgenic factor were replaced with a small molecule that either directly activated its expression from the somatic genome or in some way compensated for its activity. To this end. we have used high-content chemical screening to identify small molecules that can replace Sox2 in reprogramming. We show that one of these molecules functions in reprogramming by inhibiting Tgf-β signaling in a stable and trapped intermediate cell type that forms during the process.

1270700,The ecology of adaptive radiation,2000,Dolph Schluter,,,,,OUP Oxford,Adaptive radiation is the evolution of diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage. It can cause a single ancestral species to differentiate into an impressively vast array of species inhabiting a variety of environments. Much of life's diversity has arisen during adaptive radiations. Some of the most famous recent examples include the East African cichlid fishes. the Hawaiian silverswords. and of course. Darwin's Gal--aacute--; pagos finches.. This book evaluates the causes of adaptive radiation. It focuses on the'ecological'theory of adaptive radiation. a body of ideas that began with Darwin and was developed through the early part of the 20th Century. This theory proposes that phenotypic divergence and speciation in adaptive radiation are caused ultimately by divergent natural selection arising from differences in environment and competition between species. In The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation the author re-evaluates the ecological theory. along with its most significant extensions and challenges. in the light of all the recent evidence.

1270703,Adaptation from standing genetic variation,2008,Rowan DH Barrett and Dolph Schluter,23,,1,38-44,Elsevier Current Trends,Populations adapt to novel environments in two distinct ways: selection on pre-existing genetic variation and selection on new mutations. These alternative sources of beneficial alleles can result in different evolutionary dynamics and distinct genetic outcomes. Compared with new mutations. adaptation from standing genetic variation is likely to lead to faster evolution. the fixation of more alleles of small effect and the spread of more recessive alleles. There is potential to distinguish between adaptation from standing variation and that from new mutations by differences in the genomic signature of selection. Here we review these approaches and possible examples of adaptation from standing variation in natural populations.

This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than. and nested within. tropical taxa. and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions.

Mapping. sequencing. and transgenic studies show that the Ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway plays a key role in evolutionary change in natural populations and that parallel evolution of stickleback low-plated phenotypes at most freshwater locations around the world has occurred by repeated selection of Eda alleles derived from an ancestral low-plated haplotype that first appeared more than two million years ago.

Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation. divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments. whereas under mutation-order speciation. divergence occurs when different mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation. trait-based assortative mating. and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict.

To answer this question. I focus on gmax. the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations. Original data on threespine sticklebacks. together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates. show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of gmax for at least four million years. despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time.

An operational understanding of how these two different life forms coexist is essential for understanding savanna function and for predicting its response to future environmental change. 2 The existing model. which proposes that grasses and trees coexist by a separation of rooting niches. is not supported by recent empirical investigations. Our aim was to define an alternative mechanism of grass–tree coexistence in savanna ecosystems. The model we have built concentrates on life history–disturbance interactions between grasses and trees. 3 The model demonstrates coexistence for a wide range of environmental conditions. and exhibits long periods of slow decline in adult tree numbers interspersed with relatively infrequent recruitment events. Recruitment is controlled by rainfall. which limits seedling …,True,8vuc6rIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1084,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00435.x,13112676619956501058,/scholar?cites=13112676619956501058,,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00435.x,0,0,0

C4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated. polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire. herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important. especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors belowground. create highly flammable fuels. and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions.

1270730,The role of defeat and entrapment (arrested flight) in depression: an exploration of an evolutionary view,1998,Paul Gilbert and Steven Allan,28,,3,585-598,Cambridge University Press,Background. The social rank theory of psychopathology suggests that with the evolution of social hierarchies various psychobiological mechanisms became attuned to the success or failure in conflict situations. Specifically. subordinates and those who have lost status are at greater risk of pathology than winners and those of higher status. In this theory concepts of defeat and entrapment are seen to be of special relevance to the study of depression. We outline the role of defeat and entrapment within the social rank theory of depression.Methods. New self-report measures of entrapment and defeat were developed and used to test predictions of the social rank theory of depression. Both a sample of students and depressed patients were assessed with these new scales and other social rank measures (eg social comparison and submissive behaviour).Results. The entrapment and defeat measures were found to have good psychometric properties and significantly correlated with depression. They were also strongly associated with other rank variables. Defeat maintained a strong association with depression even after controlling for hopelessness (rl0n62). whereas the relationship between hopelessness and depression was substantially reduced when controlling for defeat. Entrapment and defeat added substantially to the explained variance of depression after controlling for the other social rank variables.Conclusions. Defeat and entrapment appear to be promising variables for the study of depression. These variables may also help to develop linkages between human and animal models of psychopathology.,True,OzD3PaoAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,837,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Gilbert2/publication/13657247_The_role_of_defeat_and_entrapment_arrested_flight_in_depression_An_exploration_of_an_evolutionary_view/links/5657f47c08aeafc2aac11998/The-role-of-defeat-and-entrapment-arrested-flight-in-depression-An-exploration-of-an-evolutionary-view.pdf,7120253651742937438,/scholar?cites=7120253651742937438,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Gilbert2/publication/13657247_The_role_of_defeat_and_entrapment_arrested_flight_in_depression_An_exploration_of_an_evolutionary_view/links/5657f47c08aeafc2aac11998/The-role-of-defeat-and-entrapment-arrested-flight-in-depression-An-exploration-of-an-evolutionary-view.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,This study explores the associations between shame. depression and social anxiety from the perspective of social rank theory (Price and Sloman. 1987; Gilbert. 1989. 1992). Social rank theory argues that emotions and moods are significantly influenced by the perceptions of one's social status/rank; that is the degree to which one feels inferior to others and looked down on. A common outcome of such perceptions is submissive behavior. It is suggested that shame. social anxiety and depression are all related to defensive submissive strategies when individuals find themselves placed in unwanted low status/rank positions.

1270735,Chromosomal rearrangements and speciation,2001,Loren H Rieseberg,16,,7,351-358,Elsevier Current Trends,Several authors have proposed that speciation frequently occurs when a population becomes fixed for one or more chromosomal rearrangements that reduce fitness when they are heterozygous. This hypothesis has little theoretical support because mutations that cause a large reduction in fitness can be fixed through drift only in small. inbred populations. Moreover. the effects of chromosomal rearrangements on fitness are unpredictable and vary significantly between plants and animals. I argue that rearrangements reduce gene flow more by suppressing recombination and extending the effects of linked isolation genes than by reducing fitness.

This possibility was tested through phenotypic and genomic comparisons of ancient and synthetic hybrids. Most trait differences in ancient hybrids could be recreated by complementary gene action in synthetic hybrids and were favored by selection. The same combinations of parental chromosomal segments required to generate extreme phenotypes in synthetic hybrids also occurred in ancient hybrids. Thus. hybridization facilitated ecological divergence in sunflowers.,True,XMYqW4oAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1158,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/301/5637/1211.abstract,140789636466072683,/scholar?cites=140789636466072683,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Rosenthal/publication/10622009_Major_Ecological_Transitions_in_Wild_Sunflowers_Facilitated_by_Hybridization/links/0fcfd508156d868458000000/Major-Ecological-Transitions-in-Wild-Sunflowers-Facilitated-by-Hybridization.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we assess the frequency of transgressive segregation in hybrid populations. describe its genetic basis and discuss the factors that best predict its occurrence. From a survey of 171 studies that report phenotypic variation in segregating hybrid populations. we show that transgression is the rule rather than the exception. In fact. 155 of the 171 studies (91%) report at least one transgressive trait. and 44% of 1229 traits examined were transgressive. Transgression occurred most frequently in intraspecific crosses involving inbred. domesticated plant populations. and least frequently in interspecific crosses between outbred. wild animal species.

1270738,Plant speciation,2007,Loren H Rieseberg and John H Willis,317,,5840,910-914,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Like the formation of animal species. plant speciation is characterized by the evolution of barriers to genetic exchange between previously interbreeding populations. Prezygotic barriers. which impede mating or fertilization between species. typically contribute more to total reproductive isolation in plants than do postzygotic barriers. in which hybrid offspring are selected against. Adaptive divergence in response to ecological factors such as pollinators and habitat commonly drives the evolution of prezygotic barriers. but the evolutionary forces responsible for the development of intrinsic postzygotic barriers are virtually unknown and frequently result in polymorphism of incompatibility factors within species.

However. previous estimates of the frequency of polyploid speciation suggest that the formation and establishment of neopolyploid species is rare. By combining information from the botanical community9s vast cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases. we establish that 15% of angiosperm and 31% of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase. These frequency estimates are higher by a factor of four than earlier estimates and lead to a standing incidence of polyploid species within genera of 35% (n = 1.506). Despite this high incidence. we find no direct evidence that polyploid lines. once established. enjoy greater net species diversification.

1270741,Phylogenetic consequences of cytoplasmic gene flow in plants,1991,Loren Henry Rieseberg and DE Soltis,,,,,Evolutionary Trends in Plants,Despite the potential power and extensive use of DNA variation for phylogenetic reconstruction. it has become increasingly apparent that DNA phylogenies are often discordant with organismal phylogenies. Factors responsible for discordance include sampling error. convergence. evolutionary rate heterogeneity. lineage sorting. and reticulation. Of these five factors. reticulation is perhaps the most likely to lead to faulty phylogenetic conclusions in plants due to their high potential for interspecific gene now. This problem is particularly acute for the clonally inherited cytoplasmic genomes (mitochondrial and chloroplast). where evidence of reticulation would be most easily missed. We found evidence for over 36 examples of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) capture through hybridization/introgression. many of which were unexpected. In many instances. cytoplasmic exchange appears to have occurred in the absence of significant nuclear gene now and sometimes the native cytoplasm has been completely displaced by an alien one. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that differential cytoplasmic exchange can occur by a variety of processes and with remarkable speed. Unfortunately. it is difficult to demarcate a taxonomic zone of safety because unexpected events of chloroplast capture can occur at a variety of taxonomic levels: among closely related. species. at the sectional level within a genus. and at the generic level. In addition. cytoplasmic transfer between major evolutionary lines during early stages of their divergence has the potential to impact cpDNA phylogenetic reconstruction at all taxonomic levels in angiosperms.Several approaches …,True,XMYqW4oAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,741,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Soltis/publication/262005952_Phylogenetic_consequences_of_cytoplasmic_gene_flow_in_plants/links/5555fde908ae980ca60c7f67/Phylogenetic-consequences-of-cytoplasmic-gene-flow-in-plants.pdf,3320384917809261079,/scholar?cites=3320384917809261079,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Soltis/publication/262005952_Phylogenetic_consequences_of_cytoplasmic_gene_flow_in_plants/links/5555fde908ae980ca60c7f67/Phylogenetic-consequences-of-cytoplasmic-gene-flow-in-plants.pdf,0,0,0

Among Passerea. we infer the common ancestor of core landbirds to have been an apex predator and confirm independent gains of vocal learning. Among Columbea. we identify pigeons and flamingoes as belonging to sister clades. Even with whole genomes. some of the earliest branches in Neoaves proved challenging to resolve. which was best explained by massive protein-coding sequence …,True,SLVtfioAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC,1379,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1320.summary,10429450800446783351,/scholar?cites=10429450800446783351,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4405904/,0,0,0

However. there is debate about whether these changes resulted from the circulation of ideas or from human migrations. potentially also facilitating the spread of languages and certain phenotypic traits. We investigated this by using new. improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacements. responsible for shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia.

DNA metabarcoding refers to the automated identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample containing entire organisms or from a single environmental sample containing degraded DNA (soil. water. faeces. etc.). It can be implemented for both modern and ancient environmental samples. The availability of next‐generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists’ need for high‐throughput taxon identification have facilitated the emergence of DNA metabarcoding. The potential power of DNA metabarcoding as it is implemented today is limited mainly by its dependency on PCR and by the considerable investment needed to build comprehensive taxonomic reference libraries.

1270758,Environmental DNA–An emerging tool in conservation for monitoring past and present biodiversity,2015,Philip Francis Thomsen and Eske Willerslev,183,,,4-18,Elsevier,The continuous decline in Earth’s biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century. and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity – especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However. traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages. a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise. non-standardized sampling. and the invasive …,True,SLVtfioAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC,972,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320714004443,10928950766928656119,/scholar?cites=10928950766928656119,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320714004443,0,0,0

We explored bird macroevolution using full genomes from 48 avian species representing all major extant clades. The avian genome is principally characterized by its constrained size. which predominantly arose because of lineage-specific erosion of repetitive elements. large segmental deletions. and gene loss. Avian genomes furthermore show a remarkably high degree of evolutionary stasis at the levels of nucleotide sequence. gene synteny. and chromosomal structure.

It is also the world in which you and all of us live. but that can be true in one sense and not in another. Everyone lives in two worlds. one public and one private. The public world is the objective. material. outer world that exists around us re-gardless of what we know or think about it. The private world is just what we do know and think about that public world; it is the world as it seems to us. as we perceive and conceive it. This is the inner world of our individual consciousness. and in that sense. it is the world in which we most truly live. It cannot possibly embrace the whole of the public world. and it cannot be quite the same for any two people. The inner and outer worlds must correspond to some extent. because sanity and life itself require private recognition of such public facts as those of gravity. sunshine. air. food. and drink.

Frequently. these interactions are interpreted in terms of communication to mediate coordinated. multicellular behaviour. We show that the nature of interactions through quorum-sensing chemicals does not simply involve cooperative signals. but entails other interactions such as cues and chemical manipulations. These signals might have a role in conflicts within and between species.

1270867,The evolution of cooperation and altruism–a general framework and a classification of models,2006,Laurent Lehmann and Laurent Keller,19,,5,1365-1376,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,One of the enduring puzzles in biology and the social sciences is the origin and persistence of intraspecific cooperation and altruism in humans and other species. Hundreds of theoretical models have been proposed and there is much confusion about the relationship between these models. To clarify the situation. we developed a synthetic conceptual framework that delineates the conditions necessary for the evolution of altruism and cooperation. We show that at least one of the four following conditions needs to be fulfilled: direct benefits to the focal individual performing a cooperative act; direct or indirect information allowing a better than random guess about whether a given individual will behave cooperatively in repeated reciprocal interactions; preferential interactions between related individuals; and genetic correlation between genes coding for altruism and phenotypic traits that can be identified.

We propose that this association stems from pleiotropic effects of the genes regulating the synthesis of brown to black eumelanin. The most important regulators are the melanocortin 1 receptor and its ligands. the melanocortin agonists and the agouti-signalling protein antagonist. On the basis of the physiological and behavioural functions of the melanocortins. we predict five categories of traits correlated with melanin-based coloration. A review of the literature indeed reveals that. as predicted. darker wild vertebrates are more aggressive. sexually active and resistant to stress than lighter individuals. Pleiotropic effects of the melanocortins might thus account for the widespread covariance between melanin-based coloration and other phenotypic traits in vertebrates.,True,MGzRFIoAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,686,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534708002218,4184812234493379689,/scholar?cites=4184812234493379689,,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_2EC1D375BAD5.P001/REF.pdf,0,0,0

This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants. but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers. indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck.

1270871,The role of queen pheromones in social insects: queen control or queen signal?,1993,Laurent Keller and Peter Nonacs,45,Animal Behaviour,4,787-794,Academic Press, Queens and workers in social insect colonies can differ in reproductive goals such as colony-level sex allocation and production of males by workers. That the presence of queen(s) often seems to affect worker behaviour in situations of potential conflict has given rise to the idea of queen control over reproduction. In small colonies queen control is possible via direct aggression against workers. but in large colonies queens cannot be effectively aggressive towards all the workers. This. plus evidence that queen-produced chemicals affect worker behaviour. has led to the conclusion that physical intimidation has been replaced by pheromonal queen control. whereby queen(s) chemically manipulate workers into behaving in ways that increase the queen's fitness at the worker's expense. It is argued in this paper. however. that pheromonal queen control has never conclusively been demonstrated and is evolutionarily …,True,MGzRFIoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,516,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347283710924,236853002481227475,/scholar?cites=236853002481227475,,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_33D007041E33.P001/REF.pdf,0,0,0
1270872,Levels of selection in evolution,1999,Laurent Keller,66,,,,Princeton University Press,Ever since the groundbreaking work of George Williams. WD Hamilton. and Richard Dawkins. evolutionary biologists have recognized that natural selection generally does not operate for the good of the group. but rather for the good of lower-level units such as the individual. the cell. even the gene. One of the fundamental problems of biology is: what keeps competition between these various levels of natural selection from destroying the common interests to be gained from cooperation? In this volume twelve prominent scientists explore this question. presenting a comprehensive survey of the current theoretical and empirical research in evolutionary biology. Recent studies show that at many levels of biological organization. mechanisms have evolved to prevent potential conflict in natural selection. Editor Laurent Keller's aim in this book is to bring together leading researchers from all biological disciplines to outline these potential conflicts and discuss how they are resolved. A multi-level approach of this kind allows important insights into the evolution of life. as well as bridging the long-standing conceptual chasm between molecular and organismal biologists.

Evolutionary hypotheses propose that ageing evolves as the necessary cost of processes increasing early reproductive success 1. 2. or because of weaker selection against late-acting mutations 3.

Alternatively. non-adaptive. purely mechanistic hypotheses invoke damage to DNA. cells. tissues and organs as being the unique cause of senescence and ineluctable death of organisms 8.

The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes. namely gluon fusion. vector boson fusion. and associated production with a  or a  boson or a pair of top quarks. and of the six decay modes . . and . All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass. the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012. corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb  at  TeV and 20 fb  at  TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions. and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.090.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the  decay of  and  standard deviations. respectively.

1270881,Performance of missing transverse momentum reconstruction with the ATLAS detector using proton–proton collisions at√ s= 13TeV,2018,Atlas Collaboration,78,European Physical Journal C,11,903,Springer New York,The performance of the missing transverse momentum (ETmiss) reconstruction with the ATLAS detector is evaluated using data collected in proton–proton collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015. To reconstruct ETmiss. fully calibrated electrons. muons. photons. hadronically decaying τ-leptons. and jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and charged-particle tracks are used. These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector. energy deposits in the calorimeter. and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various ETmiss contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall reconstructed ETmiss are evaluated with various performance metrics for scale (linearity). resolution. and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions. The method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the ETmiss scale and resolution is discussed.

1270887,Quantifying biodiversity: procedures and pitfalls in the measurement and comparison of species richness,2001,Nicholas J Gotelli and Robert K Colwell,4,,4,379-391,Blackwell Science Ltd,Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity. and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance. ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves. which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons. including category–subcategory ratios (species‐to‐genus and species‐to‐individual ratios). Rarefaction methods – both sample‐based and individual‐based – allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets.

In this paper. I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co‐occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums. equiprobable. or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Connor and D. Simberloff.

Moreover. comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. For individual-based data. we treat a single. empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (Poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area …,True,DgJL-y4AAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC,1568,https://academic.oup.com/jpe/article-abstract/5/1/3/1296712,9542437632534188343,/scholar?cites=9542437632534188343,,,https://academic.oup.com/jpe/article/5/1/3/1296712,0,0,0

Hill numbers. or the effective number of species. are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic. phylogenetic. or functional diversity of an assemblage. However. empirical estimates of Hill numbers. including species richness. tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and. thus. tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data.

1270894,Estimating species richness,2011,Nicholas J Gotelli and Robert K Colwell,12,Biological diversity: frontiers in measurement and assessment,,39-54,,Measuring species richness is an essential objective for many community ecologists and conservation biologists. The number of species in a local assemblage is an intuitive and natural index of community structure. and patterns of species richness have been measured at both small (eg Blake & Loiselle 2000) and large (eg Rahbek & Graves 2001) spatial scales. Many classic models in community ecology. such as the MacArthur–Wilson equilibrium model (MacArthur & Wilson 1967) and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978). as well as more recent models of neutral theory (Hubbell 2001). metacommunity structure (Holyoak et al. 2005). and biogeography (Gotelli et al. 2009) generate quantitative predictions of the number of coexisting species. To make progress in modelling species richness. these predictions need to be compared with empirical data. In applied ecology and conservation biology. the number of species that remain in a community represents the ultimate ‘scorecard’in the fight to preserve and restore perturbed communities (eg Brook et al. 2003).Yet. in spite of our familiarity with species richness. it is a surprisingly difficult variable to measure. Almost without exception. species richness can be neither accurately measured nor directly estimated by observation because the observed number of species is a downward-biased estimator for the complete (total) species richness of a local assemblage. Hundreds of papers describe statistical methods for correcting this bias in the estimation of species richness (see also Chapter 3). and special protocols and methods have been developed for estimating species richness …,True,DgJL-y4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,1201,http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/manuscriptpdfs/Chapter%204.pdf,4050702693936419583,/scholar?cites=4050702693936419583,,,http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/manuscriptpdfs/Chapter%204.pdf,0,0,0

Diamond's assembly rules model predicts that competitive interactions between species lead to nonrandom co‐occurrence patterns. We conducted a meta‐analysis of 96 published presence–absence matrices and used a realistic “null model” to generate patterns expected in the absence of species interactions. Published matrices were highly nonrandom and matched the predictions of Diamond's model: there were fewer species combinations. more checkerboard species pairs. and less co‐occurrence in real matrices than expected by chance. Moreover. nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model. they do establish that observed co‐occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance.

We report here on a global empirical study relating plant species richness and abiotic factors to multifunctionality in drylands. which collectively cover 41% of Earth’s land surface and support over 38% of the human population. Multifunctionality was positively and significantly related to species richness.

1270907,The bacterial RecA protein and the recombinational DNA repair of stalled replication forks,2002,Shelley L Lusetti and Michael M Cox,71,,1,71-100,Annual Reviews,The primary function of bacterial recombination systems is the nonmutagenic repair of stalled or collapsed replication forks. The RecA protein plays a central role in these repair pathways. and its biochemistry must be considered in this context. RecA protein promotes DNA strand exchange. a reaction that contributes to fork regression and DNA end invasion steps. RecA protein activities. especially formation and disassembly of its filaments. affect many additional steps. So far. Escherichia coli RecA appears to be unique among its nearly ubiquitous family of homologous proteins in that it possesses a motorlike activity that can couple the branch movement in DNA strand exchange to ATP hydrolysis.

However. little is known about the genome-scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly. how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology. in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes co-circulate. is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1.302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres. we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics. with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1. indicative of weaker antigenic drift.

Here we develop and use new statistical methods to infer past patterns of speciation and extinction from molecular phylogenies.

Rejection of this hypothesis may provide evidence for evolutionary events such as adaptive radiations or key adaptations. In contrast to previous approaches. our methods are robust to incomplete taxon sampling and are conservative with respect to extinction. Using simulation we investigate. first. the adverse effects of failing to take incomplete sampling into account and. second. the power and reliability of our tests.

Today it is widely accepted that land plants (embryophytes) evolved from streptophyte algae. also referred to as charophycean algae. The streptophyte algae are a paraphyletic group of green algae. ranging from unicellular flagellates to morphologically complex forms such as the stoneworts (Charales). For a better understanding of the evolution of land plants. it is of prime importance to identify the streptophyte algae that are the sister-group to the embryophytes. The Charales. the Coleochaetales or more recently the Zygnematales have been considered to be the sister group of the embryophytes However. despite many years of phylogenetic studies. this question has not been resolved and remains controversial. Here. we use a large data set of nuclear-encoded genes (129 proteins) from 40 green plant taxa (Viridiplantae) including 21 embryophytes and six streptophyte algae. representing all major streptophyte algal lineages. to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of streptophyte algae and embryophytes. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that either the Zygnematales or a clade consisting of the Zygnematales and the Coleochaetales are the sister group to embryophytes. Our analyses support the notion that the Charales are not the closest living relatives of embryophytes.

1270941,A comprehensive transcriptome and immune-gene repertoire of the lepidopteran model host Galleria mellonella,2011,Heiko Vogel and Boran Altincicek and Gernot Glöckner and Andreas Vilcinskas,12,BMC genomics,1,1-19,BioMed Central,The larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella are increasingly used (i) as mini-hosts to study pathogenesis and virulence factors of prominent bacterial and fungal human pathogens. (ii) as a whole-animal high throughput infection system for testing pathogen mutant libraries. and (iii) as a reliable host model to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics against human pathogens. In order to compensate for the lack of genomic information in Galleria. we subjected the transcriptome of different developmental stages and immune-challenged larvae to next generation sequencing. We performed a Galleria transcriptome characterization on the Roche 454-FLX platform combined with traditional Sanger sequencing to obtain a comprehensive transcriptome. To maximize sequence diversity. we pooled RNA extracted from different developmental stages. larval tissues including hemocytes. and from immune-challenged larvae and normalized the cDNA pool. We generated a total of 789.105 pyrosequencing and 12.032 high-quality Sanger EST sequences which clustered into 18.690 contigs with an average length of 1.132 bases. Approximately 40% of the ESTs were significantly similar (E ≤ e-03) to proteins of other insects. of which 45% have a reported function. We identified a large number of genes encoding proteins with established functions in immunity related sensing of microbial signatures and signaling. as well as effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and inhibitors of microbial proteinases. In addition. we found genes known as mediators of melanization or contributing to stress responses. Using the transcriptomic data. we identified …,True,MmELJFEAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,240,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-308,15680422624768497656,/scholar?cites=15680422624768497656,,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-308,0,0,0

This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago). when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized leastsquares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data. and the clock gave dates of 92.3±11.7. 13.3±1.5. 10.9±1.2. 3.7±0.6. and 2.7±0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse. gibbon. orangutan. gorilla. and chimpanzee. respectively. from the line leading to humans.
