112033,Pore-forming protein toxins: from structure to function,2005,Michael W Parker and Susanne C Feil,88,,1,91-142,Pergamon,Pore-forming protein toxins (PFTs) are one of Nature's most potent biological weapons. An essential feature of their toxicity is the remarkable property that PFTs can exist either in a stable water-soluble state or as an integral membrane pore. In order to convert from the water-soluble to the membrane state. the toxin must undergo large conformational changes. There are now more than a dozen PFTs for which crystal structures have been determined and the nature of the conformational changes they must undergo is beginning to be understood. Although they differ markedly in their primary. secondary. tertiary and quaternary structures. nearly all can be classified into one of two families based on the types of pores they are thought to form: α-PFTs or β-PFTs.

This inhibitory structure is called a pseudosubstrate and specific regulators are required to remove it from the active site to allow substrates access. Removal of the pseudosubstrate sequence from members of the myosin light-chain kinase subfamily 1. including twitchin kinase. activates them but it is not known whether the pseudosubstrate sequence binds to the active site. Native twitchin is a 753K protein (6.839 residues) located in muscle A-bands of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 3. 4 and because of its size has not been easy to study.

While this residue appears to be conserved in many Theta-class GSTs. its absence in some suggested that the Theta-class GSTs may have a significantly different structure or catalytic mechanism. The elucidation of the crystal structure of the Theta-class GST from the Australian sheep blowfly. Lucilia cuprina. has indicated that a serine residue rather than a tyrosine residue can form a hydrogen bond with the glutathionyl sulphur atom. The present studies show that mutation of Ser-9 to alanine substantially inactivates the L. cuprina GST. confirming its importance in the reaction mechanism. As this serine is conserved in all Theta-class enzymes reported so far. it seems that an active-site serine is a significant factor that distinguishes …,True,ZrUEdmcAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,152,https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article/311/1/247/31923,2200828972567062735,/scholar?cites=2200828972567062735,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1136145/pdf/biochemj00054-0241.pdf,0,0,0

We have determined the crystal structure of the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of murine Siah1a to 2.6 Å resolution. The structure reveals that Siah is a dimeric protein and that the SBD adopts an eight-stranded β-sandwich fold that is highly similar to the TRAF-C region of TRAF (TNF-receptor associated factor) proteins. The TRAF-C region interacts with TNF-α receptors and TNF-receptor associated death-domain (TRADD) proteins; however. our findings indicate that these interactions are unlikely to be mimicked by Siah.

The high genetic variability of HCV and the rapid development of drug-resistant strains are driving the urgent search for new direct-acting antiviral agents. A new class of agents has recently been developed that are believed to target the HCV protein NS5A although precisely where they interact and how they affect function is unknown. Here we describe an in vitro assay based on microscale thermophoresis and demonstrate that two clinically relevant inhibitors bind tightly to NS5A domain 1 and inhibit RNA binding. Conversely. RNA binding inhibits compound binding. The compounds bind more weakly to known resistance mutants L31V and Y93H. The compounds do not affect NS5A dimerisation.

In the presence of ethacrynic acid. the enzyme follows a rapid equilibrium random bi−bi mechanism with a rate-limiting step which occurs after the addition of the substrates and before the release of products. The replacement of Tyr 108 with Phe yields a 14-fold decrease of kcat. while it does not change appreciably the affinity of the H site for the substrate.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in the development of the disease. through the generation of a peptide called Aβ by proteolysis of the precursor protein. APP can function as a metalloprotein and modulate copper transport via its extracellular copper binding domain (CuBD). Copper binding to this domain has been shown to reduce Aβ levels and hence a molecular understanding of the interaction between metal and protein could lead to the development of novel therapeutics to treat the disease. We have recently determined the three-dimensional structures of apo and copper bound forms of CuBD. The structures provide a mechanism by which CuBD could readily transfer copper ions to other proteins.

Many frog species produce amphipathic α-helical peptides with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in the skin but their therapeutic potential is limited by varying degrees of cytolytic activity towards eukaryotic cells. Methods for development of such peptides into anti-infective drugs are illustrated by the example of temporin-1DRa (HFLGTLVNLAK KIL.NH2).

Xenopus laevis. Since that time more than 200 such peptides have been isolated from the skins of other frogs belonging to different families. With very few exceptions. the frog skin antimicrobial peptides are cationic. relatively hydrophobic and have the propensity to form an amphipathic α-helix in a membrane-mimetic environment. By making selective changes to the molecular charge. hydrophobicity and secondary structure of the naturally occurring peptides. analogues have been developed that show increased potency against microorganisms but reduced toxicity towards mammalian cells.

Ltd,Our group recently described recurrent somatic mutations of the miRNA processing gene DICER1 in non‐epithelial ovarian cancer. Mutations appeared to be clustered around each of four critical metal‐binding residues in the RNase IIIB domain of DICER1. This domain is responsible for cleavage of the 3′ end of the 5p miRNA strand of a pre‐mRNA hairpin. To investigate the effects of these cancer‐associated 'hotspot' mutations. we engineered mouse DICER1‐deficient ES cells to express wild‐type and an allelic series of the mutant DICER1 variants. Global miRNA and mRNA profiles from cells carrying the metal‐binding site mutations were compared to each other and to wild‐type DICER1.

All the strains have variable numbers of a tandemly repeated DNA sequence. 31 bp to 53 bp in size. at their mtDNA termini. Based upon the size and nucleotide sequence of the terminal repeats. the telomeres can be separated into four classes. T. pigmentosa. hyperangularis. and hegewischi have different telomeric repeats on the two ends of their mtDNAs. The only conserved feature of the mtDNA termini is the presence of tandem repeats.

The mtDNA telomeres consist of a 53 bp sequence tandemly repeated from 4 to 30 times. with most molecules having 15 ± 4 repetitions.

In the Creator system. an ORF introduced into a donor vector can be transferred with Cre recombinase to a library of acceptor vectors optimized for different applications. Usability of the Creator system is impacted by the ability to easily manipulate DNA. the number of acceptor vectors for downstream applications. and the level of protein expression from Creator vectors. To date. we have developed over 20 novel acceptor vectors that employ a variety of promoters and epitope tags commonly employed for proteomics applications and gene function analysis. We also made several enhancements to the donor vectors including addition of different multiple cloning sites to allow shuttling from pre-existing vectors and introduction of the lacZ alpha reporter gene to allow for selection. Importantly. in order to ameliorate any effects on protein expression of the loxP site between a 5' tag and ORF. we introduced a splicing event into our expression vectors.

It has long been known that normal human cells have a finite lifespan when placed in cell culture. and their lifespan is dependent on the age of the individual donor. The mechanism of the genetic program that times this process has been elusive. The telomere hypothesis of cell aging proposes that the length of the telomeric repeat array at chromosomal termini can time replication number and signal cell cycle arrest when critical telomere lengths are obtained.

Design: We generated a prototype human microarray design and used it to profile alternative isoforms expressed in RNA samples extracted from 5-FU sensitive and resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. To assess the performance of our approach. we profiled the same RNAs with Affymetrix Human Exon arrays and compared the results between platforms. Methods: Creation of ALEXA arrays involved extracting. scoring. filtering and annotating oligonucleotide probes that corresponded to the exons. introns. exon boundaries and exonexon junctions of EnsEMBL genes. Prototype arrays created with the ALEXA platform were synthesized by NimbleGen. RNA samples were isolated in triplicate from colorectal cancer cell lines and profiled on the NimbleGen and Affymetrix array platforms according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting data were analyzed to identify isoforms differentially expressed between 5-FU sensitive and resistant samples.

Tpt1 depletion caused a rapid growth arrest and telomere elongation in the absence of cell division. The phenotype was similar to that seen after Pot1a depletion suggesting that Tpt1 and Pot1a function together to regulate telomere length and prevent telomere deprotection. In contrast.

The mtDNA has a multimodal distribution of telomeres. Different groups in the distribution have different numbers of telomeric repeats. The standard deviation of the size of each end group is independent of the mean size of the end group. The two sides of the mtDNA have different multimodal distributions of repeats. Cloned cell lines have multimodal distributions of mtDNA telomeres distinct from that of the original cell line. The number of telomere end groups and the average size of the end groups change in an erratic fashion as the cells are passaged and do not reach a stable equilibrium distribution in 185 generations. We propose that the mean size of a telomere end group and the size distribution of an end group are independently regulated.

CIC alterations and/or loss of CIC activity have been associated with poorer outcomes and more aggressive phenotypes across cancer types. which is consistent with the notion that CIC functions as a tumour suppressor across a wide range of contexts.Using mammalian cells lacking functional CIC. we found that CIC deficiency was associated with chromosome segregation (CS) defects. resulting in chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. These CS defects were associated with transcriptional dysregulation of spindle assembly checkpoint and cell cycle regulators. We also identified novel CIC interacting proteins. including core members of the SWI/SNF complex. and showed that they cooperatively regulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Finally. we showed that loss of CIC and ARID1A cooperatively increased CS defects and reduced cell viability.Our study ascribes a novel role to CIC as an important regulator of the cell cycle and demonstrates that loss of CIC can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in human and murine cells through defects in CS. providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of CIC’s increasingly apparent role as a “pan-cancer” tumour suppressor.,True,tqrzIQgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/533323v1.abstract,5886259011721729563,/scholar?cites=5886259011721729563,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/29/533323.full.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. they have demonstrated that PP2A is functionally inactivated in blast crisis (BC) CML. the late stage of CML. through the inhibitory activity of the BCR-ABL–regulated SET protein (2). They have explored SET-sequestering and PP2A-interacting activating drugs as potential therapeutics in CML (3). In our study. we have clearly acknowledged the importance of PP2A and its network in regulating multiple biological processes in cancer development and progression. including CML (4). We highlighted the complexity of PP2A’s structure and its multiple substrates that can either negatively or positively regulate numerous signaling cascades involved in proliferation. cell cycle control. adhesion/migration. etc. Its activity can also be moderated by posttranslational modifications. multiple protein-protein interactions. and altered subcellular localization. which make its roles even more complicated.

SCCOHT tumors have inactivating mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1). one of the two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. To address the role that BRG1 loss plays in SCCOHT tumorigenesis. we performed integrative multi-omic analyses in SCCOHT cell lines +/- BRG1 reexpression. BRG1 reexpression induced a gene and protein signature similar to an epithelial cell and gained chromatin accessibility sites correlated with other epithelial originating TCGA tumors. Gained chromatin accessibility and BRG1 recruited sites were strongly enriched for transcription-factor-binding motifs of AP-1 family members. Furthermore. AP-1 motifs were enriched at the promoters of highly upregulated epithelial genes. Using a dominant-negative AP-1 cell line. we found that both AP-1 DNA-binding activity and BRG1 reexpression are necessary for the gene and protein expression of epithelial genes. Our study demonstrates that BRG1 reexpression drives an epithelial-like gene and protein signature in SCCOHT cells that depends upon by AP-1 activity.,True,tqrzIQgAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC,0,https://elifesciences.org/articles/59073,,,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/59073.pdf,0,0,0

The most rapid and dramatic changes were found in a form of NR which was sensitive to inhibition by millimolar concentrations of magnesium. This form of NR predominated in leaves in the dark. but was almost completely absent from leaves incubated in the light for only 30 min. When the leaves were returned to darkness. the NR rapidly became sensitive to Mg2+ inhibition. Modulation of the overall reaction involving NADH as electron donor was also found when reduced methyl viologen was the donor (MV:NR). indicating that electron transfer had been blocked. at least in part. at or near the terminal molybdenum cofactor site.

112348,Posttranslational regulation of nitrate reductase in higher plants.,1994,Werner M Kaiser and Steven C Huber,106,Plant Physiology,3,817,American Society of Plant Biologists,In many plants. nitrogen represents 2 to 6% of dry matter. most of it being present in the form of amino acids. proteins. or nucleic acids. In these organic compounds. nitrogen exists in its most reduced state (oxidation state-3). It is taken up from the soil primarily in the form of nitrate (oxidation state+ 5). Thus. nitrate has to be reduced by plants at the expense of reductants such as NADH or NADPH. requiring 8 mo1 of electrons [or 4 mo1 of NAD (P) H] per mo1 of nitrate. Reduction is a two-step mechanism. The first step. reduction of nitrate to nitrite (+ 3 oxidation state). is catalyzed by assimilatory NR. which is an NAD (P) H-dependent cytosolic enzyme. Nitrite is further reduced to ammonia (-3 oxidation state) in the plastids of leaves or roots by NiR. There are at least two important reasons why plants must exert control on the velocity of nitrate reduction. First. it is an energy-consuming process.

112354,Control of photosynthetic sucrose formation,1987,MARK STITT and STEVE HUBER and PHIL KERR,,,,327-409,Academic Press,This chapter discusses the control of photosynthetic sucrose formation. In most species. starch and sucrose are the principal end products of photosynthesis. It is clear that the formation of both carbohydrates is highly regulated biochemically. The interdependence of chloroplast and cytosolic metabolism implies that coordination of the fluxes and conditions in these compartments is a precondition for rapid photosynthesis. This interaction is defined by the stoichiometry of carbon and phosphate flow during steady-state photosynthesis. Chloroplasts convert three CO2 and one Pi to one molecule of triose-P. and a continuation of photosynthesis depends on the triose-P being removed and more Pi becoming available. This is achieved by exporting triose-P from the chloroplast. in exchange for Pi. However. the rate of this exchange must be coordinated with the rate of CO2 fixation. because only one …,True,yISZlqAAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC,216,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126754100500129,10583407602633029790,/scholar?cites=10583407602633029790,,,0,0,0

The 14‐3‐3‐dependent inactivation of phospho‐NR is known to require millimolar concentrations of a divalent cation such as Mg2+ at pH 7.5. We now report that micromolar concentrations of the polyamines. spermidine4+ and spermine3+. can substitute for divalent cations in modulating 14‐3‐3 action.

To identify sites within NR protein that play a role in this post-translational regulation. a heterologous expression system and an in vitro inactivation assay for Arabidopsis NR were developed. Protein extracts containing NR kinases and inhibitor proteins were prepared from an NR-defective mutant that had lesions in both the NIA1 and NIA2 NR genes of Arabidopsis. Active NR protein was produced in a Pichia pastoris expression system. Incubation of these two preparations resulted in a Mg-ATP-dependent inactivation of NR that was reversed with EDTA.

Rapidly growing and fully heterotrophic cells in the basal part of the young leaf showed a high sucrose synthase (SS) activity. Leaf SS has been purified to homogeneity. By comparison with purified kernel SS isozymes. the leaf SS has been identified as SS2. SS1 protein and SS2 protein were clearly separated by electrophoresis and the two monomers differed in size by 6 kilodaltons. Nevertheless. kinetic parameters of both enzymes were very similar. Immunodetection of SS protein showed that in young heterotrophic tissues SS2 was a major protein accounting for 3% of the total protein. Concurrent with greening.

The influence of canopy photosynthesis on sucrose' accumulation within muskmelon fruit mesocarp was examined. Canopy photosynthetic activities were estimated in a sweet and a nonsweet genotype. Photosynthetic rate of the nonsweet genotype. on a per-plant basis. was only 56% of that of the sweet genotype. The effect of limiting leaf area of the sweet genotype on carbohydrate concentrations and sucrose metabolizing enzymes within the fruit was evaluated. A 50% reduction of leaf area 8 days before initiation of fruit sucrose accumulation resulted in canopy photosynthesis similar to that of the nonsweet genotype. Reduced photosynthetic activity resulted in slightly lower soluble-carbohydrate concentration in the fruit; however. fruit sucrose concentration was three times higher than that reported previously for the nonsweet genotype. The extent to which `fruit sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity increased during maturation was diminished by leaf removal. Acid invertase activity declined in all fruit in a similar manner irrespective of defoliation. A reduction of leaf area of a sweet genotype reduced sucrose accumulation within the fruit. Lower fruit sucrose concentration was associated with lower concentration of raffinose saccharides and lower SPS activity within the fruit.

Influence of proline and basic amino acid residues at selected positions,2001,Jian-Zhong Huang and Steven C Huber,42,Plant and Cell Physiology,10,1079-1087,Oxford University Press,Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaf sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) can be inactivated by phosphorylation of Ser-158 by calmodulin-like domain protein kinases (CDPKs) or SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK1) in vitro. While the phosphorylation site sequence is relatively conserved. most of the deduced sequences of SPS from dicot species surrounding the Ser-158 regulatory phosphorylation site contain a Pro residue at P–4 (where P is the phosphorylated Ser); spinach is the exception and contains an Arg at P–4. We show that a Pro at P–4 selectively inhibits phosphorylation of the peptide by a CDPK relative to a SnRK1. The presence of a Pro at P–4. by allowing a tight turn in the peptide substrate. may interfere with proper binding of residues at P–5 and beyond.

Supplying exogenous inorganic phosphate (Pi) with mannose reduced sequestration of cellular Pi (as evidenced by mannose-6-P accumulation without depletion of hexose-P) and substantially reduced mannose activation of SPS.

Characterization of the pyruvate carrier,1977,Steven C Huber and Gerald E Edwards,462,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Bioenergetics,3,583-602,Elsevier,1. Evidence is presented for high rates of carrier-mediated uptake of pyruvate into the stroma of intact mesophyll chloroplasts of the C4 plant Digitaria sanguinalis. but not the chloroplasts of the C3 plant Spinacea oleracea. Uptake of pyruvate in the dark with the C4 mesophyll chloroplasts was followed using two techniques: uptake of [14C]pyruvate as determined by silicon oil centrifugal filtration and uptake as indicated by absorbance changes at 535 nm (shrinkage/swelling) after addition of 0.1 M pyruvate salts.2. Uptake of the pyruvate anion by an electrogenic carrier is suggested to be the major mode of transport. Chloroplast swelling was observed in potassium pyruvate plus valinomycin and uptake of [14C]pyruvate was inhibited by membrane-permeant anions. Valinomycin reduced uptake in the absence of external potassium and the inhibition could be reversed by addition of external potassium.3.

This reaction product coordinates to three Mg2+ ions near the mouth of the active site cleft. A comparison of the liganded and unliganded structures reveals a ligand-induced conformational change that closes the mouth of the active site cleft.

Both an increase in reactive oxygen species production and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability contribute to the endothelial dysfunction that underlies this vascular stiffness. independent of other age-related vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis. The activation/upregulation of arginase appears to be an important contributor to age-related endothelial dysfunction by a mechanism that involves substrate (l-arginine) limitation for NO synthase (NOS) 3 and therefore NO synthesis. Not only does this lead to impaired NO production but also it contributes to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species by NOS.

The flux of substrate through this step is considerable. since the average adult excretes about 10 kg of urea per year. In addition to its presence in liver. arginase activity has been detected in a number of extrahepatic tissues that lack a complete urea cycle. such as lactating mammary gland [2. 3]. kidney [4–7). prostate [6]. and activated macrophages [5]. In most of these tissues. the arginase present represents a second isozyme (arginase II) that is distinct in immunological properties. amino acid sequence. and subcellular location from the more abundant liver isozyme (arginase I). The biological function of arginase II has been the subject of considerable interest; current thinking is that this isozyme provides a supply of L-ornithine for proline and polyamine biosynthesis. and along with arginase I it also serves to regulate the levels of L-arginine available for nitric oxide production. The comparative properties of the two arginase isozymes are discussed in a number of recent reviews [8–10]. Arginase I is the more abundant isozyme of the two. and it has been extensively characterized in terms of its biochemistry. enzymology. and three-dimensional structure.

As free Chtr is stable both to self-digestion and to digestion by HNE. these results are indicative of a stability and/or conformational change in Chtr that accompanies complex formation. As determined by both N-terminal sequence analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS). the major initial sites of HNE cleavage of complexed Chtr are between γ-chain residues A158/S159 and V188/S189. Significantly. this latter site is at the base of the S1 site that recognizes the P1 position of the serpin. A slower cleavage in the β-chain between T139/G140 is also found.

Understanding how these are encoded in amino-acid sequences is complicated by energetically unfavourable non-ideal features—for example kinked α-helices. bulged β-strands. strained loops and buried polar groups—that arise in proteins from evolutionary selection for biological function or from neutral drift. Here we describe an approach to designing ideal protein structures stabilized by completely consistent local and non-local interactions. The approach is based on a set of rules relating secondary structure patterns to protein tertiary motifs. which make possible the design of funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading into the target folded state.

To elucidate the mode of RNA binding. we introduced single alanine replacements into the NS1 RNA-binding domain at specific positions in the three-dimensional structure.

Today. typical sets of conformational constraints for protein structures consist of a large number of NOE constraints and a small number of dihedral angle constraints on C# J and x’obtained from homonuclear proton-proton coupling constants. The resultant structures show well-defined overall polypeptide folds. However. local backbone structures are not determined as precisely as may be possible with additional data. Furthermore. many side chains are less well defined than the backbone. While amino acid side chains may often adopt multiple conformations. there are no good approaches for characterizing their distributions in proteins.Measurements of heteronuclear coupling constants would provide a whole new class of constraints that could significantly improve protein structures at the local level. where improvement is needed most. The most promising approach is to measure “N-‘H vicinal coupling constants. This would lead to the following achievements.(i) Measurements of the coupling constants between the peptide nitrogen and the P-protons. combined with measurements of homonuclear coupling constants between CY-and P-protons. can provide a characterization of the side-chain dihedral angle x1 and stereospecific assignments of@-methylene protons.

Two kinds of ‘crankshaft motions’ of the polypeptide backbone are observed in this MD trajectory. The first involves small-amplitude rocking of the rigid peptide bond due to correlated changes in the backbone dihedral angles ψi−1 and φi. These high-frequency ‘librational crankshaft’ motions are correlated with systematically smaller values of motional order parameters for backbone N−H bond vectors compared to Cα−H bond vectors. In addition. infrequent ‘crankshaft flips’ of the peptide bond from one local minimum to another are observed for several amino acid residues. These MD simulations demonstrate that comparisons of N−H and Cα−H order parameters provide a useful approach for identifying crank …,True,mrtpF44AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,68,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00211787.pdf,11829671606133249303,/scholar?cites=11829671606133249303,,,0,0,0

The mobilization was performed in different ways. for instance electrophoretically by exchanging the anolyte for the catholyte or vice versa. In this paper we treat the electrophoretic mobilization theoretically. originating from the conditions of electroneutrality. The information thus gained was used to design anolytes and catholytes of appropriate compositions for mobilization of focused proteins. The usefulness of these electrode solutions is illustrated by focusing-mobilization experiments performed in free solution in a glass tube of length 110 mm. Since the inside diameter of the tube and its wall thickness were only 0.05 mm. the Joule heat was efficiently removed. which allowed the use of high field strengths (270 V/cm).

The genetic variations in different populations increase the number of combinations of the different forms of transferrin. To resolve the many components in transferrin preparations. the new high performance capillary technique was employed for isoelectric focusing. Iron‐free transferrin and transferrin samples of known iron content were examined.

Using this definition. we found a large number of strains isolated from various infections to be very hydrophobic: 123 of 135 strains from patients with septicemia (91%). 54 of 60 strains from wound infections (90%). and 12 of 14 strains from urinary tract infections (86%).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Capillary electrophoresis in conventional buffers and in 50 μ capillaries permits field strengths as high as 300–500 V/cm with acceptably low thermal zone deformation. However. still higher field strengths (up to at least 2000 V/cm) can be applied without a decrease in resolution if the experiments are performed in the buffers described in this paper. Characteristic of these buffers is their low electrical conductivity and yet satisfactory buffering capacity accomplished either (i) by selecting buffer constituents of relatively high molecular weight and small net charge or (ii) by fractionation of carrier ampholytes (originally introduced for isoelectric focusing experiments) into a series of narrow pH range fractions and using these fractions as buffers. or (iii) by selecting an ampholyte with two acidic groups and one basic group (or one acidic group and two basic groups) and with a pI value close to two of its pK values.

In most of these methods the sample is depleted (partially) of strong electrolytes concomitantly with the concentration. The methods are based on the fact that electrophoretic migration velocities decrease upon decreasing the absolute value of the zeta potential of a solute and the pore size of the electrophoresis medium and upon increasing the cross section of the electrophoresis chamber. the viscosity and the electrical conductivity of the electrophoresis medium. We have also utilized the zone-sharpening properties of displacement electrophoresis in combination with a hydrodynamic counter flow to create a stationary zone where the sample solutes can be collected continuously.In practice. the whole electrophoresis tube is filled with the sample solution to be concentrated.

Recent studies on different pathogens such as the gonococci and enterotoxigenic Escheriehia coli indicate that specific surface structures are involved in these interactions [1. 2]. Ultrastructural studies comparing M proteinpositive (M+) and M protein-negative (M-) strains of Streptococcus pyogenes suggest that both M protein and other surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) could be important in binding of bacteria to host cells [3-5]. Recent data on several bacterial pathogens indicate that different surface antigens confer hydrophobic characteristics which are probably important for cell to cell interactions through displacement of ordered water molecules located at the interacting surfaces attending formation of adhesive bonds [6].

When active transport can be neglected the equation might also give a qualitative picture of the factors that determine the distribution of solutes between the internal space of a living cell and its surroundings. Introduction of a series of assumptions. which are all discussed. leads to simplified formulae (eqns. 14 and 15). which. in spite of their approximate nature. seem to be applicable in most experiments.

Uppsala University. Several methods for on-and off-tube concentration of solutes have been developed. These methods also permit desalting of the sample. which is necessary for the creation of narrow starting zones in zone electrophoresis and to reduce the risk of precipitation and narrowing of the separation window in isoelectric focusing (IEF). A unique method designed particularly for desalting of samples for IEF is also discussed. To obtain high resolution the adsorption of solutes to the capillary wall must be eliminated. A pH stable. hydrophilic polymer coating has. therefore. been developed. Although polymer solutions give lower resolution than do gels they are often used as molecular-sieving media because they are replaceable and thus permit repetitive automated analyses in the same capillary. We have shown that low-melting methoxylated agarose gels are also replaceable and give the same high resolution as do polyacrylamide and dextran gels. Following an electrophoresis the methoxylated agarose gels can be displaced in the stationary capillary past the detection window. This scanning technique has several advantages. A capillary with strong electroendosmosis permits. in principle. separation of both acidic and basic proteins in one run. However. depending on whether the capillary wall is negatively or positively charged either the basic or the acidic proteins most often migrate with strong tailing caused by the electrostatic interaction with the capillary wall.

The M+ strain had a more hydrophobic and a more negatively charged surface than the M- strain. When the M+ strain was cultivated in the presence of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics. its hydrophobicity either decreased or did not change. The M+ organisms adhered to pharyngeal epithelial cells more avidly than M+; however. cultivation of both strains with sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin and rifampin led to the decrease in adhesion.

KaiA. KaiB. and KaiC are essential proteins for the generation of a circadian rhythm. KaiC is proposed as a negative regulator of the circadian expression of all genes in the genome. and its phosphorylation is regulated positively by KaiA and negatively by KaiB and shows a circadian rhythm in vivo. To study the functions of KaiC phosphorylation in the circadian clock system. we identified two autophosphorylation sites. Ser-431 and Thr-432. by using mass spectrometry (MS). We generated Synechococcus mutants in which these residues were substituted for alanine by using site-directed mutagenesis. Phosphorylation of KaiC was reduced in the single mutants and was completely abolished in the double mutant. indicating that KaiC is also phosphorylated at these sites in vivo.

The γ subunit of retinal transducin (Tα/Tβγ) is selectively farnesylated. and the farnesylation is required for light signaling mediated by transducin in rod cells. However. whether and how this selective isoprenylation regulates cellular functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that knockin mice expressing geranylgeranylated Tγ showed normal rod responses to dim flashes under dark-adapted conditions but exhibited impaired properties in light adaptation. Of note. geranylgeranylation of Tγ suppressed light-induced transition of Tβγ from membrane to cytosol. and also attenuated its light-dependent translocation from the outer segment to the inner region. an event contributing to retinal light adaptation.

112849,Loops. linkages. rings. catenanes. cages. and crowders: entropy-based strategies for stabilizing proteins,2004,Huan-Xiang Zhou,37,,2,123-130,American Chemical Society,A protein molecule exists in either a compact folded state or a variable and open unfolded state. Since the unfolded state is favored by chain entropy. restricting its entropy is an attractive mechanism for shifting the equilibrium toward the folded state. A number of entropy-based strategies have been engineered or used by natural proteins to increase the folding stability:  (a) shortening of loop lengths. (b) covalent linkage of dimeric proteins. (c) backbone cyclization. (d) catenation. (e) spatial confinement. and (f) macromolecular crowding. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the importance of accounting for consequences on the folded as well as the unfolded state and provide guidance for further exploitation of these stabilization strategies. ,True,H4qd72AAAAAJ:HfY9tUF4VgMC,145,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar0302282,7655147750256994404,/scholar?cites=7655147750256994404,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.542.3473&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. methods have yet to be developed to decontaminate the environment from residues of pesticides. Pesticidal degradative genes in microbes have been found to be located on plasmids. transposons. and/or on chromosomes. Recent studies have provided clues to the evolution of degradative pathways and the organization of catabolic genes. thus making it much easier to develop genetically engineered microbes for the purpose of decontamination.Genetic manipulation offers a way of engineering microorganisms to deal with a pollutant. including pesticides that may be present in the contaminated sites.

This paper presents a mathematical model for correlating the interactions of some drilling control parameters such as speed. feed rate and drill diameter and their effects on some responses such as axial force and torque acting on the cutting tool during drilling by means of response surface methodology. For this exercise. a three-level full factorial design was chosen for experimentation using a PC-based computer numerically controlled drilling machine built in-house.

112876,Quantum corrections to classical time-correlation functions: Hydrogen bonding and anharmonic floppy modes,2004,Padma Kumar and Dominik Marx,121,J. Chem. Phys,,9,,Fluxional or floppy molecules are characterized by largeamplitude motion on strongly anharmonic potential energy landscapes including many nonseparable degrees of freedom which results in ‘‘floppy modes.’’1. 2 Typical examples are molecules such as. eg. protonated methane CH5 Ref. 3 and acetylene C2H3 Ref. 4 or the microsolvated clusters OH•(H2O) n Refs. 5 and 6 including the famous Zundel H5O2. 6. 7 and Eigen H3O•(H2O) 3 Ref. 8 proton-water complexes in the gas phase. Here. infrared IR spectroscopy is currently the prime experimental technique in order to probe their complex dynamics. which cannot be analyzed and thus understood in terms of harmonic frequencies; 1. 2 Coulomb explosion imaging is a much more recently developed real-space approach. see. eg. Refs. 9. 10 and work cited therein for such investigations. Another important class are hydrogen-bonded systems where the donor-acceptor distance. or hydrogen bond length. couples strongly to the proton motion within the hydrogen bond. 11 At large donor/acceptor separations. the proton moves in a double-well potential with a pronounced barrier. eg. in the protonated water dimer H2OHOH2 when stretched far beyond the equilibrium distance. At short donor/acceptor distances a single-well potential is stabilized. where the proton resides preferentially midway between the two oxygens. leading to ‘‘centered’’hydrogen bonds. Most interesting is the so-called ‘‘low-barrier hydrogen bond’’regime6 which is characterized by a shallow barrier such that small variations in the donor/acceptor distance result in significant changes of the dynamics and thus of the IR spectra …,True,H4qd72AAAAAJ:ybfzIt2tCtgC,67,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Padmanabhan_Kumar/publication/8379335_Quantum_corrections_to_classical_time-correlation_functions_Hydrogen_bonding_and_anharmonic_floppy_modes/links/57d3a85c08ae0c0081e27afc.pdf,10433257873442041087,/scholar?cites=10433257873442041087,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Padmanabhan_Kumar/publication/8379335_Quantum_corrections_to_classical_time-correlation_functions_Hydrogen_bonding_and_anharmonic_floppy_modes/links/57d3a85c08ae0c0081e27afc.pdf,0,0,0

The [7/5-C5 (CH3) 5] 3Co3B4H4 molecule is. to our knowledge. the only structurally characterized species con-taining three mutually bonded M [7j5-C5 (CH3) 5] groups. As we note in the Introduction. prior to the crystal structure determination it was questionable whether such an arrange-ment would be viable. given the unavoidably severe interligand steric crowding. The fact that this structure is nonetheless adopted even at the expense of cobalt-cobalt bond lengthening and considerable bending of the methyl groups out of the C5 ring planes implies strong thermodynamic preference for this particular cluster geometry as opposed to other. less sterically crowded arrangements.

Adiponectin is known to possess anti-fibrotic properties; however a high physiological concentration and multiple forms circulating in blood prohibit clinical use. Recently. an adiponectin-like small synthetic peptide agonist (ADP355: H-DAsn-Ile-Pro-Nva-Leu-Tyr-DSer-Phe-Ala-DSer-NH2) was synthesized for the treatment of murine breast cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of ADP355 as an anti-fibrotic agent in the in vivo carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis model. Liver fibrosis was induced in eight-week old male C57BL/6J mice by CCl4-gavage every other day for four weeks before injection of a nanoparticle-conjugated with ADP355 (nano-ADP355). Control gold nanoparticles and nano-ADP355 were administered by intraperitoneal injection for two weeks along with CCl4-gavage. All mice were sacrificed after 6 weeks. and serum and liver tissue were collected for biochemical. histopathologic and molecular analyses. Biochemical studies suggested ADP355 treatment attenuates liver fibrosis. determined by reduction of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST). alanine aminotransferase ALT) and hydroxyproline.

The successful 1978 Oxford Symposium on nonlinear (soliton) struc ture and dynamics in condensed matter (Springer Ser. Solid-State Sci.. Vol. 8) was held at a time when the ubiquity of solitons was just begin ning to be appreciated by the condensed matter community; in subsequent years the soliton paradigm has provided a rather useful framework for in vestigating a large number of phenomena. particularly in low-dimensional systems. Nevertheless. we felt that the importance of nonlinearity in wider arenas than"" solitonics"" merited a significant expansion in the scope of the conference over that of the 1978 symposium. Indeed. many of the lessons are quite general and their potential for cross-fertilization of otherwise poorly connected disciplines was certainly one of the prime motivations for this conference.

Hence. an approximate response surface method (RSM) is utilized to analyze the effects of design and operating parameters on the vibration signature of a rotor-bearing system. This paper focuses on accurate performance prediction. which is essential to the design of high performance rotor bearing system. It considers distributed defects such as internal radial clearance and surface waviness of the bearing components. In the mathematical formulation the contacts between the rolling elements and the races are considered as nonlinear springs. whose stiffnesses are obtained by using Hertzian elastic contact deformation theory.

To our knowledge. this is the first time single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has been used to extract structural information from solution-phase fluorescence measurements. We find that production of oriented species is strongly favored in “poorer” solvents. where the polymer chains have more compact solution-phase structures.

The J/ψ is detected via its dimuon decay in the forward rapidity region (− 4.0< y<− 2.5) for events where the hadronic activity is required to be minimal. The analysis is based on an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 750 μb− 1. The cross section for coherent J/ψ production is presented in six rapidity bins. The results are compared with theoretical models for coherent J/ψ photoproduction. These comparisons indicate that gluon shadowing effects play a role in the photoproduction process.

These barriers are measured using human genetic distance from the technology frontier. The results based on cross-sectional data for 123 countries suggest that genetic distance to the global frontier has an economically and statistically significant effect on financial development. in that countries that are genetically far from the technology leader tend to have lower levels of financial development. Genetic distance is found to have the largest effect. even after controlling for other determinants of financial development established in the literature.

The technique uses a laser-induced shock wave to drive a liquid microjet at a very high speed such that the jet has sufficient momentum to penetrate soft targets. The method can be used to deliver liquid drugs into soft tissues in the human body. The liquid to be delivered is sandwiched between 200 μm thick aluminum foil and a base plate with a perforation of 100 μm diameter. The aluminum foil is ablated using an Nd:YAG laser beam in order to launch a shock wave through it.

Methyltransferases are involved in the third step of the process. transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to N7-guanine (cap 0) and to the ribose 2′OH group (cap 1) of the first RNA nucleotide; capping is essential for mRNA stability and proper replication.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of human tuberculosis. one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Its genome hosts the glbN and glbO genes coding for two proteins. truncated hemoglobin N (trHbN) and truncated hemoglobin O (trHbO). that belong to different groups (I and II. respectively) of the recently discovered trHb family of hemeproteins. The different expression pattern and kinetics rates constants for ligand association and NO oxidation rate suggest different functions for these proteins. Previous experimental and theoretical studies showed that. in trHbs. ligand migration along the internal tunnel cavity system is a key issue in determining the ligand‐binding characteristics. The X‐ray structure of trHbO has been solved and shows several internal cavities and secondary‐docking sites.

In the case of human neuroglobin. cysteines at positions CD7 and D5 are sufficiently close to form an internal disulfide bond. For cytoglobin. the cysteine residues at positions A7 and GH4 may also form a disulfide bond. Mass spectrometry. ligand binding. and thiol accessibility studies were used to study the role influence of these disulfide bonds.

Different chemical aspects of the cofactor are exploited during catalysis by the isomerases and the methyltransferases. Thus. the cobalt-carbon bond ruptures homolytically in the isomerases. whereas it is cleaved heterolytically in the methyltransferases. The reaction mechanism of the dehalogenases. the most recently discovered class of B 12 enzymes. is poorly understood.

The dominant candidate mechanism for sulfide signaling is persulfidation of target proteins. However. the relatively poor reactivity of H 2 S toward oxidized thiols. such as disulfides. the low concentration of disulfides in the reducing milieu of the cell and the low steady-state concentration of H 2 S raise questions about the plausibility of persulfide formation via reaction between an oxidized thiol and a sulfide anion or a reduced thiol and oxidized hydrogen disulfide.

Inc.,Significance: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S). produced by the desulfuration of cysteine or homocysteine. functions as a signaling molecule in an array of physiological processes including regulation of vascular tone. the cellular stress response. apoptosis. and inflammation. Recent Advances: The low steady-state levels of H2S in mammalian cells have been recently shown to reflect a balance between its synthesis and its clearance. The subversion of enzymes in the cytoplasmic trans-sulfuration pathway for producing H2S from cysteine and/or homocysteine versus producing cysteine from homocysteine. presents an interesting regulatory problem.

A particularly puzzling aspect of hATR function is that the midpoint potential for Co2+Cbl → Co1+Cbl reduction is below that of readily available biological reductants. Our magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic studies reported here reveal that. in the absence of ATP. the interaction between Co2+Cbl and hATR promotes partial conversion of the cofactor to its “base-off” form in which a water molecule occupies the lower axial position. This interaction becomes much stronger in the presence of ATP. leading to the formation of an unprecedented Co2+Cbl species with spectroscopic signatures consistent with an essentially four-coordinate. square-planar Co2+ center.

We have shown that it is a stepwise process in which conformational changes in the 5‘-deoxyadenosine moiety precede the actual homolysis step. In the transition state structure for homolysis. the Co−C5‘ bond elongates by ∼0.5 Å from the value found in the substrate-bound reactant complex. The overall barrier to homolysis is ∼10 kcal/mol. and the radical products are ∼2.5 kcal/mol less stable than the initial ternary complex of enzyme. substrate. and cofactor.

FoxP3 is a master regulator of Treg function. and its expression is under control of several epigenetically labile promoters and enhancers. Demethylation of CpG sites within these regions is associated with increased FoxP3 expression and development of a suppressive phenotype. We examined differences in FoxP3 expression between young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months) C57BL/6 mice.

Analysis of the model has shown that AdoMet metabolism can operate under two different modes. The first. with low metabolic rate and low AdoMet concentration. serves predominantly to supply the cell with AdoMet. the substrate for various cellular methylation reactions. The second. with high metabolic rate and high AdoMet concentration. provides an avenue for cleavage of excess methionine and can serve as a source of cysteine when its increased synthesis is necessary. The switch that triggers interconversion between the “low” and “high” modes is methionine concentration. Under a certain set of parameters both modes may coexist.

Here. we report the discovery that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse. which affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. We present evidence that this redox collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants as would have been postulated by the free radical theory of aging. Instead it appears to be instigated by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH. which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that is predicted to down-regulate most cellular processes. Caloric restriction. a near-universal lifespan extending measure. increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade.

While the role of PLP in the reaction is suggested by the beta replacement reaction that is catalyzed. the role of the heme is not yet well established. Spectroscopic studies reveal that the heme iron is coordinately saturated in the ferric and ferrous states and is relatively inert to ligand exchange in the oxidized state.

We generated monoclonal antibodies (9A2 and 15H8) against the human fXII heavy chain that interfere with fXII conversion to the protease factor XIIa (fXIIa). The anti-fXII antibodies were tested in models in which anti-fXI antibodies are known to have antithrombotic effects. Both anti-fXII antibodies reduced fibrin formation in human blood perfused through collagen-coated tubes. fXII-deficient mice are resistant to ferric chloride–induced arterial thrombosis. and this resistance can be reversed by infusion of human fXII. 9A2 …,True,ONC4UxYAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,170,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/123/11/1739/105748,5675206673055173925,/scholar?cites=5675206673055173925,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120358973,0,0,0

113390,Tissue factor as a proinflammatory agent,2002,Maria I Bokarewa and James H Morrissey and Andrej Tarkowski,4,,3,1-6,BioMed Central,Tissue factor (TF) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and the main triggering element of blood coagulation. TF expression on monocytes and endothelial cells is induced by exposure to endotoxin. tumor necrosis factor. and IL-1 and is considered to appear in consequence of inflammation. In order to assess the proinflammatory capacity of TF itself. the recombinant extracellular domain of TF was injected intra-articularly into healthy mice. To characterize the role of immune cells in the TF-induced arthritis. mice deprived of lymphocytes. neutrophils and monocytes were used. Histomorphological analysis of the joints with respect to inflammatory cell infiltration. pannus formation and erosion formation revealed development of arthritis in 80% of animals injected with TF. In most of the cases synovial proliferation was accompanied by pannus formation and cartilage destruction. Inflammatory cell infiltrate consisted of CD4-Mac1+ macrophages. Depletion of monocytes was. however. not enough to abolish inflammation. Indeed. combined deficiency of monocytes and lymphocytes was required to prevent inflammation following the injection of TF. We observed that TF induced chemokine production (MIP-1α and RANTES). but did not induce a proliferative response nor cytokine release by mouse spleen cells. TF has strong inflammatogenic properties mediated predominantly by monocytes and their release of chemokines. Our study shows that TF can simultaneously trigger the immune and coagulation systems.,True,ONC4UxYAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC,86,https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar405,12440770815268199430,/scholar?cites=12440770815268199430,,https://arthritis-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/ar405,0,0,0

113428,Polyphosphate: a link between platelets. coagulation and inflammation,2012,James H Morrissey,95,,4,346-352,Springer Japan,Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is abundant in biological organisms. PolyP is a major component of dense granules of human platelets and is secreted upon platelet activation. Studies from our lab and others have shown that polyP is a potent modulator of the blood clotting cascade. acting as a pro-hemostatic. prothrombotic and proinflammatory agent depending on its polymer size and location. PolyP may represent at least one of the long-sought (patho)physiologic activators of the contact pathway of blood clotting. and its actions may also help to explain previously unexplained abilities of activated platelets to enhance plasma clotting reactions.

Indeed. certain epidemiologic studies have found elevated FVII coagulant activity to be an independent risk factor for heart disease. However.

SNPs initiate the contact pathway of the blood‐clotting system; short‐chain polyP accelerates the common pathway by the rapid formation of thrombin. which enhances the overall blood‐clotting system. both by accelerating fibrin generation and by facilitating the regulatory anticoagulation mechanisms essential for hemostasis. Analysis of the clotting properties of bare SNPs. bare polyP. and polyP‐functionalized SNPs in plasma demonstrated that the attachment of polyP to SNPs to form polyP‐SNPs creates a substantially enhanced synergistic effect that lowers clotting time and increases thrombin production at low concentrations.

Although it is well established that the in utero exposure to MeHg causes neurological deficits in animals and humans. there is no evidence of the exclusive contribution of lactational exposure to MeHg as a possible cause of neurotoxicity in the offspring. In this study. we investigated the exclusive contribution of MeHg exposure through maternal milk on biochemical parameters related to the glutamatergic homeostasis (glutamate uptake by slices) and to the oxidative stress (total and nonprotein sulfhydryl groups. nonprotein hydroperoxides. glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities) in the cerebellum of suckling mice (Swiss albino).

113500,Methylmercury increases glutamate release from brain synaptosomes and glutamate uptake by cortical slices from suckling rat pups: modulatory effect of ebselen,2003,M Farina and KCS Dahm and FD Schwalm and AM Brusque and MES Frizzo and G Zeni and DO Souza and JBT Rocha,73,Toxicological Sciences,1,135-140,Oxford University Press,During the early postnatal period the brain is extremely sensitive to external agents. Here. we examined the effect of subcutaneous injections of methylmercury (MeHg; 2 mg/kg) during the suckling period (postnatal days [PND] 3–10. 3–17. or 3–24) on glutamate release from brain synaptosomal preparations and on glutamate uptake by brain cortical slices of rat pups. The possible antagonist effect of ebselen against MeHg effect was also examined at PND 24. MeHg increased the basal (but not K+-stimulated) glutamate release and glutamate uptake at PND 24.

Resveratrol. a polyphenol found in grapes and red wines. exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and modulates glial functions. such as glutamate metabolism. We investigated the effect of resveratrol on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GS activity. S100B secretion. TNF-α. IL-1β and IL-6 levels in astroglial cells exposed to ammonia. Ammonia induced oxidative stress. decreased GS activity and increased cytokines release. probably by a mechanism dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Resveratrol prevented ammonia toxicity by modulating oxidative stress. glial and inflammatory responses. The ERK and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) are involved in the protective effect of resveratrol on cytokines proinflammatory release. In contrast. other antioxidants (e.g.. ascorbic acid and trolox) were not effective against hyperammonemia. Thus. resveratrol could be used to protect against ammonia-induced neurotoxicity.,True,Sq__FyoAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,73,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052164,10686650160666866187,/scholar?cites=10686650160666866187,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052164,0,0,0

113521,The role of opioid peptides in memory and learning,1980,Iván Izquierdo and Renato D Dias and Diogo O Souza and María A Carrasco and Elaine Elisabetsky and Marcos L Perry,1,,6,451-468,Elsevier,Evidence is discussed which points to the existence of a physiologic amnestic mechanism mediated by beta-endorphin and perhaps by other opioid peptides as well. This mechanism is triggered by various forms of training and by either painful or painless stimulation. It may operate through the inhibition of central dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic systems that modulate the memory consolidation process. This amnestic mechanism is unrelated to the regulation of pain perception. and operates at opioid peptide levels several orders of magnitude below those that are needed to cause analgesia or other effects. In addition. shuttle avoidance and habituation learning seem to be dependent on a state induced by the release of beta-endorphin. It is possible that this may be related to the amnestic properties of this substance.

Astrocyte cultures derived from rodent brains have been extensively used to characterize astrocytes' biochemical. pharmacological and morphological properties. The aims of this study were to develop a protocol for routine preparation and to characterize a primary astrocyte culture from the brains of adult (90 days old) Wistar rats. For this we used enzymatic digestion (trypsin and papain) and mechanical dissociation. Medium exchange occurred from 24 h after obtaining a culture and after. twice a week up to reach the confluence (around the 4th to 5th week). Under basal conditions. adult astrocytes presented a polygonal to fusiform and flat morphology. Furthermore. approximately 95% the cells were positive for the main glial markers. including GFAP. glutamate transporters. glutamine synthetase and S100B. Moreover. the astrocytes were able to take up glucose and glutamate. Adult astrocytes were also able to respond to acute H2O2 exposure. which led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and a decrease in glutamate uptake. The antioxidant compound resveratrol was able to protect adult astrocytes from oxidative damage. A response of adult astrocytes to an inflammatory stimulus with LPS was also observed.

To further investigate this requirement. L-arginine metabolism by macrophages was measured under conditions where fungistasis either succeeded or failed. Macrophage fungistasis correlated with metabolism of L-arginine to citrulline. nitrite. and nitrate. The metabolic rate was dependent on extracellular L-arginine concentration. reaching a maximum of 67 nmol nitrite/h per mg protein. It accounted for one-third of arginine consumed by fungistatic macrophages. Equimolar amounts of citrulline and total nitrite plus nitrate accumulated in medium. This was consistent with the hypothesis that one of the equivalent guanidino nitrogens of L-arginine was oxidized to both nitrite and nitrate leaving L-citrulline as the amino acid reaction product.

Aconitases are monorneric [Fe-S] proteins that catalyze the stereospecific interconversion of citrate and isocitrate by the intermediate cis-aconitate. The reaction of NO with the [Fe-S] centers of m-aconitase and c-aconitase has important functional consequences. Mitochondrial aconitase is measured after treating cells with digitonin. This technique is based on the fact that digitonin selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane and leaves inner mitochondrial membrane intact.

Interferon-γ primes neutrophils and macrophages for both O2− and nitric oxide synthesis. However. NADPH oxidase and immune/inflammatory nitric oxide synthase are differentially regulated such that their activities are not simultaneously induced.,True,OCnN3TAAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,136,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0952791594900442,18215498782464471362,/scholar?cites=18215498782464471362,,,0,0,0

More recently. similar but nonimmunologic destruction of tumor target cells by activated macrophages has been described (1. 3). The present study demonstrates that activated macrophages from mice pretreated with CFA 7 weeks previously are cytotoxic to cells with abnormal growth characteristics in vitro. The results parallel those obtained with another system. activated macrophages from mice chronically infected with T. gondii (3).The following points characterize the activated macrophage mediated cytotoxic reaction as we have observed it in this and other studies:(1) The effector cell appears to be the activated macrophage.

We propose that host resistance to intracellular infectious agents and neoplasia is related in a fundamental way and the activated macrophage is a common effector arm for expression of this resistance.

113604,Modulation of immunity and host resistance by micro-organisms,1980,John B Hibbs Jr and Jack S Remington and Carleton C Stewart,8,,1,37-69,Pergamon,Suter (1956) classified microbial pathogens into three groups based on whether their proliferation in the tissues of the infected host was extracellular or intracellular. The first group. the obligate extracellular pathogens. parasitize the extracellular environment. This group of pathogens do not have the biochemical know-how to escape lytic mechanisms present within the vacuolar system of phagocytic cells. Their proliferation rapidly ceases once they have been incorporated into secondary lysosomes of polymorphonuclear leukoytes (PMNs) or mononuclear phagocytes. Therefore. virulence of this group of pathogens depends largely on their ability to evade phagocytosis. For the host to recover from infection with this group of pathogens. certain critical events must occur; for example. specific opsonizing and complement fixing immunoglobulin must appear in the extracellular fluids and Fc and C3 receptor bearing …,True,OCnN3TAAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0163725880900595,12568651571216413998,/scholar?cites=12568651571216413998,,,0,0,0

The susceptibility of mice correlates with intrinsic NO production after infection. We have previously shown that blocking of systemic NO production with oral N-ω-monomethyl-L-arginine results in decreased NO and exacerbated infection. The C3H mice also synthesize markedly more NO than BALB/c mice shortly after initial infection. We now show that late in infection. as the lesion size is increasing. the BALB/c NO production actually exceeds that seen during the curative stages of the C3H infection. In addition. treatment with meglumine antimoniate. which ameliorates but does not cure the BALB/c mouse. results in decreased systemic parasite load with a concomitant decrease in NO production.

Conversely. a 40- to 90-kilodalton serine esterase (Fr-3) also found in normal human serum and endotoxin enhanced tumoricidal potential and suppressed the supernatant plasminogen activator activity. Inactivation of either Fr-1 or Fr-3 by 2-mercaptoethanol or diisopropyl fluorophosphate. respectively. abolished both biologic effects. Examination of cell-associated and culture medium plasminogen activator activity before and after acidification to inactivate proteinase inhibitors indicated that suppression of plasminogen activator activity by Fr-3 or endotoxin most likely represents modulation of macrophage plasminogen activator secretion.

We wished to determine whether this effect of trypan blue could be due to a selective inhibition of certain macrophage functions or whether it reflected a broader form of immunosuppression. We therefore tested the effects of trypan blue on a variety of immunological responses. Treatment of mice with trypan blue delayed their rejection of skin allografts and transplants of a highly antigenic syngeneic ultraviolet light-induced tumor. Trypan blue treatment of either donor or recipient decreased the local graft-versus-host reaction.

For macrophages to induce a cytotoxic effect on target cells. they must undergo functional change. This functional change is described as “activation.” Macrophage activation is a process of differentiation resulting from a complex interaction of environmental chemical signals that either increase or decrease the probability of expression of macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity for target cells. Cytotoxic activated macrophages do not cause rapid or global metabolic disorganization in tumor target cells. The target cells of cytotoxic activated macrophages slowly develop metabolic inhibition. and the metabolic inhibition in many tumor cell lines is completely reversible.

It is a product of the cell-mediated immune response and probably has multiple functional roles. Current experimental results suggest that cytokine induced synthesis of nitric oxide from L-arginine has a role in the defense of the intracellular environment against intracellular microbes. Nitrosylation of intracellular iron. particularly nonheme iron. appears to be a major biochemical fate of nitric oxide synthesized by the cytokine inducible nitric oxide synthase. This results in inhibition of redox enzymes that have nonheme iron essential for catalytic activity.

MA,Biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by mammalian cells has recently been demonstrated (Hibbs et al.. 1987a; Iyengar et al.. 1987; Hibbs et al.. 1988; Marietta et al.. 1988). NO synthesis is induced during a cell-mediated immune response to infection or tumor development. NO is biologically produced by the enzyme immune/inflammatory NO synthase (iNOS). which utilizes molecular oxygen to oxidatively deiminate a guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine with formation of L-citrulline and NO as the products (Hibbs et al.. 1988; Marietta et al.. 1988. Tayeh et al.. 1989). iNOS is competitively inhibited by N-substituted L-arginine derivatives. including NG -monomethyl-L-arginine (MLA) (Hibbs et al.. 1987a. 1987b; Granger et al.. 1990. 1991).

Eds., JJ Oppenheim &D. M. Jacobs",,269-274,,The ways macrophages exert antitumor activity are not well defined. Much attention has been focused on the search for effector molecules but so far. little has been concluded about basic mechanisms leading to target cell alteration. A complementary approach is to analyze at a biochemical level. the metabolic changes that occur in tumor target cells as a result of macrophage-mediated injury. From previous studies. it is known that cytotoxic activated macrophage-injured tumor cells develop cytostasis as well as inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (Granger et al.. 1980). Also. it was observed that two non heme iron-containing enzymes of the respiratory chain. namely NADH-coenzyme Q reductase (Complex I) and succinate-coenzyme Q reductase (Complex II) were strongly inhibited in mouse L1210 leukemia cells cocultivated with cytotoxic activated macrophages (Granger and Lehninger. 1982) and in mouse EMT-6 adenocarcinoma cells cultivated in the presence of cytotoxic activated macrophage conditioned medium (Kilbourn et al.. 1984). Recent experiments show that L1210 cells and Lio guinea pig hepatoma cells cocultivated with cytotoxic activated macrophages lose a portion of their iron-59 label (Hibbs et al. 1984). This observation suggested that removal of iron from enzymes that require iron for catalytic activity could be responsible for the pattern of metabolic inhibition caused in target cells by cytotoxic activated1 supported by the Veterans Administration.

Here we report that diluted enzymes from lysed human leukocytes produce extracellular energy. Our findings involve two pathways: the purine nucleotide catabolic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway. which function together to generate energy as NADPH. Glucose6P fuel for NADPH production is generated from structural ribose of purine ribonucleoside monophosphates. ADP. and ADP-ribose. NADPH drives glutathione reductase to reduce an oxidized glutathione disulfide-glutathione redox couple. Acid phosphatases initiate ribose5P salvage from purine ribonucleoside monophosphates. and transaldolase controls the direction of carbon chain flow through the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.

The cytotoxic effect of macrophages for neoplastic cells has been successfully studied in vitro using cell culture techniques. There are several important features of macrophage-mediated injury of neo-plastic cells that have been demonstrated in a number of laboratories:1. In order to injure neoplastic cells macrophages must undergo a differenti-ation process called activation (Hibbs et al.. 1977). Activation occurs upon sequential signaling of macrophages by first. a secreted T lympho-cyte product called gamma interferon. and second. exposure of macro-phages to bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide from gram,True,OCnN3TAAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3706820920439364216&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3706820920439364216,/scholar?cites=3706820920439364216,,,0,0,0

Boston. MA,Murine lymphocytes incubated for three to four days with Interleukin-2 (IL-2) have enhanced tumoricidal activity and are called lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cells (Lotze et al.. 1981; Rosenstein & Rosenberg. 1984). When IL-2 has been administered to tumor-bearing mice or humans. dramatic anticancer responses were occasionally observed. The exact mechanism by which IL-2 mediates these in vivo responses is not yet clear. since LAK cells are not observed within tumors following IL-2 therapy. IL-2 treatment is also known to increase serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-g (IFN-g). interleukin-1 (IL-1). and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (Boldt et al.. 1988; Gemlo et al.. 1988).

Thus the three-dimensional structure has now been solved for a prokaryotic example of the aldo–keto reductase superfamily. The details of the binding of the NADPH cofactor help to explain why 2.5-DKGR exhibits lower binding affinity for cofactor than the related human aldose reductase does. Furthermore. changes in the local loop structure near the cofactor suggest that 2.5-DKGR will not exhibit the biphasic cofactor binding characteristics observed in aldose reductase.

RNA-DNA covalent linkages were found to copurify with SV40 replicating DNA.

Alkaline hydrolysis also exposed 5′ terminal hydroxyl groups in the nascent DNA which were detected as nucleosides after digestion with P1 nuclease. The RNA-DNA covalent linkages resulted from a population of Okazaki pieces containing uniquely sized oligoribonucleotides covalently attached to their 5′ termini (RNA primers).

Replicating intermediates [SV40(RI) DNA] were purified to avoid contamination by molecules broken at their replication forks. and the distribution of SV40(RI) DNA as a function of its extent of replication was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. With virus-infected CV-1 cells. SV40(RI) DNA accumulated only when replication was 85 to 95% completed. These molecules [SV40(RI*) DNA] were two to three times more prevalent than an equivalent sample of early replicating DNA. consistent with a rate-limiting step in the separation of sibling chromosomes.

Theoretical approaches seem the best manner of transferring information from one system to another. but their accuracy in the model systems must first be tested with results from experiment. Since bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) is a model system for the evaluation of energy minimization and molecular dynamics routines. we can use folding and stability measurements to examine the reliability of these methods. All two-disulfide mutants of BPTI investigated thus far have two very slow folding reactions which have characteristics of proline isomerization. These reactions may occur because the non-native cis form of two of the four prolines in BPTI significantly destabilizes the folded state of the protein.

As is well known. the chief buffer system of the extracellular fluid is the NaHC03: H. HCO. system. The concentration of carbonic acid in extracellular fluid is directly related to the CO2 content of the alveolar air which in turn is determined by respiratory minute volume. Thus by changing the rate and depth of respiration the amount of buffer acid in body fluids can be rapidly altered. The respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are familiar examples of the homeostatic function of the lungs in maintaining the constancy of the pH of extracellular fluid.The chief role of the kidney in acid-base balance is to regulate the relative amount of fixed cation in extracellular fluid that is in combination with bicarbonate anion.

The aim of the present investigation was to demonstrate the effect of Rapamycin. a clinically relevant macrolide antibiotic with potent immunosuppressive properties. on human Tenon fibroblast proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. METHODS: Primary Tenon fibroblast cultures were derived from patients undergoing trabeculectomies or routine cataract extractions. Rapamycin was added in concentrations of 0.1-100 ng/ml with or without 3-30 ng/ml of porcine platelet-derived growth factor or of human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor. Two days after treatment. the cells were examined and counted. The results were expressed as the percent of cell growth in treated culture relative to its untreated control. RESULTS: Rapamycin was not cytotoxic at any of the concentrations tested. Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-induced Tenon fibroblast proliferation occurred with all doses of Rapamycin. the most marked effect being observed with 30 ng/ml (60% inhibition. p< 0.001). In contrast. optimal inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced proliferation was only 37%(p< 0.01). achieved with 10 ng/ml of the peptide.

The cyclooxygenases (COXs) are a family of enzymes. which catalyze the rate-limiting step of prostaglandin biosynthesis. This family contains three members: ubiquitously expressed COX-1. which is involved in homeostasis; the inducible COX-2 isoform. which is upregulated during both inflammation and cancer; and COX-3. expressed in brain and spinal cord. whose functions remain to be elucidated. COX-2 was described to modulate cell proliferation and apoptosis mainly in solid tumors. that is. colorectal. breast. and prostate cancers. and. more recently. in hematological malignancies. These findings prompt us to analyze here the effects of a combination of COX-2 inhibitors together with different clinically used therapeutic strategies in order to further improve the efficiency of future anticancer treatments.

We summarize here how curcumin is able to modulate many components of intracellular signaling pathways implicated in inflammation. cell proliferation and invasion and to induce genetic modulations eventually leading to tumor cell death. Clinical applications of this natural compound were initially limited by its low solubility and bioavailability in both plasma and tissues but combination with adjuvant and delivery vehicles was reported to largely improve bio-availability of curcumin. Moreover. curcumin was reported to act in synergism with several natural compounds or synthetic agents commonly used in chemotherapy.

Some recent publications have demonstrated the direct effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell differentiation towards erythroid pathway. without erythropoietin defect. This suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated signaling pathways affect erythropoietin activity. They could interfere with erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathways. inducing early apoptosis and perturbing the expression and regulation of specific transcription factors involved in the control of erythroid differentiation.

However. several preclinical studies as well as two phase I studies have shown that cardenolides may also possess anticancer effects. The mechanisms of these anticancer effects may include intracellular decrease of K+ and increase of Na+ and Ca2+; intracellular acidification; inhibition of IL-8 production and of the TNF-α/NF-κB pathway; inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II and activation of the Src kinase pathway. To date three cardiac glycosides have been developed for treatment of cancer and were tested in a phase 1 clinical trial to determine dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose.

This enzyme is zinc-dependent and mainly localized in the cytoplasm. HDAC6 is a unique isoenzyme with two functional catalytic domains and specific physiological roles. Indeed. HDAC6 deacetylates various substrates including α-tubulin and HSP90α. and is involved in protein trafficking and degradation. cell shape and migration. Consequently. deregulation of HDAC6 activity was associated to a variety of diseases including cancer. neurodegenerative diseases and pathological autoimmune response. Therefore. HDAC6 represents an interesting potential therapeutic target.

The natural compound. curcumin. was already described as a promising anticancer agent due to its multipotent properties and huge amount of molecular targets in vitro. Its translation to the clinic is. however. limited by its reduced solubility and bioavailability in patients. In order to overcome these pharmacokinetic deficits of curcumin. several strategies. such as the design of synthetic analogs. the combination with specific adjuvants or nano-formulations. have been developed. By taking into account the risk-benefit profile of drug combinations. as well as the knowledge about curcumin’s structure-activity relationship. a new concept for the combination of curcumin with scaffolds from different natural products or components has emerged. The concept of a hybrid curcumin molecule is based on the incorporation or combination of curcumin with specific antibodies. adjuvants or other natural products already used or not in conventional chemotherapy. in one single molecule. The high diversity of such conjugations enhances the selectivity and inherent biological activities and properties. as well as the efficacy of the parental compound. with particular emphasis on improving the efficacy of curcumin for future clinical treatments.

GSTP1. the gene encoding the piclass GST is frequently inactivated by acquired somatic CpG island promoter hypermethylation in multiple cancer subtypes including prostate. breast. liver and blood cancers. Epigenetically mediated GSTP1 silencing is associated with enhanced cancer susceptibility by decreasing its “caretaker” gene function. which tends to promote neoplastic transformation allowing the cell to acquire additional alterations. Thus. this epigenetic alteration is now considered as a cancer biomarker but could as well play a driving role in multistep cancer development especially well documented in prostate cancer development.

In this respect. diallyl tri- and tetrasulfide are reported as strong inducers of an early mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis. but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the link between these two events are not yet fully elucidated. Our data revealed that diallyl tetrasulfide acts independently of reactive oxygen species and tubulin represents one of its major cellular targets.

114023,Natural compounds as regulators of the cancer cell metabolism,2013,Claudia Cerella and Flavia Radogna and Mario Dicato and Marc Diederich,2013,,,,Hindawi,Even though altered metabolism is an “old” physiological mechanism. only recently its targeting became a therapeutically interesting strategy and by now it is considered an emerging hallmark of cancer. Nevertheless. a very poor number of compounds are under investigation as potential modulators of cell metabolism. Candidate agents should display selectivity of action towards cancer cells without side effects. This ideal favorable profile would perfectly overlap the requisites of new anticancer therapies and chemopreventive strategies as well. Nature represents a still largely unexplored source of bioactive molecules with a therapeutic potential. Many of these compounds have already been characterized for their multiple anticancer activities. Many of them are absorbed with the diet and therefore possess a known profile in terms of tolerability and bioavailability compared to newly synthetized chemical compounds. The discovery of important cross-talks between mediators of the most therapeutically targeted aberrancies in cancer (i.e.. cell proliferation. survival. and migration) and the metabolic machinery allows to predict the possibility that many anticancer activities ascribed to a number of natural compounds may be due. in part. to their ability of modulating metabolic pathways. In this review. we attempt an overview of what is currently known about the potential of natural compounds as modulators of cancer cell metabolism.,True,6lMbxyEAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC,62,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2013/639401/abs/,15366071328651987874,/scholar?cites=15366071328651987874,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2013/639401/abs/,0,0,0

But. the outcomes of the p53 response go beyond its role as a nuclear transcription factor. Sirtuin (SIRT1) regulates p53 functions as transcription factor. At the same time. SIRT1 protects the genome under stress conditions. The link between p53 and SIRT1 responses is unique. Both regulate metabolism. stress signaling. cell survival. cell cycle control and genome stability. Recent studies have proposed cancer as a metabolic disease. This is due to the switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism during tumor development. Yet. the complex molecular circuits (in and out of the nucleus) of tumor progression remain elusive.

These characteristic hallmarks include the abilities to sustain proliferative signaling. evade growth suppressors. resist cell death. enable replicative immortality. induce angiogenesis. activate invasion and metastasis. avoid immune destruction. and deregulate cellular energetics. Furthermore. two important characteristics of tumor cells that facilitate the acquisition of emerging hallmarks are tumor-promoting inflammation and genome instability. To treat a multifactorial disease such as cancer. a combination treatment strategy seems to be the best approach. Here we focus on natural histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). their clinical uses as well as synergies with modulators of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor signaling pathways.

Apoptosis and senescence are two types of cellular response to damages that are altered in both cancer and aging. albeit through different mechanisms. Carcinogenesis is associated with a progressive reduction in the ability of the cells to trigger apoptosis and senescence. In contrast. in aging tissues. there is an increased accumulation of senescent cells. and the nature of apoptosis deregulation varies depending on the tissue. Thus. the prevailing model suggests that apoptosis and cellular senescence function as two essential tumor-suppressor mechanisms. ensuring the health of the individual during early and reproductive stages of life. but become detrimental and promote aging later in life.

Upon Wnt receptor activation. the canonical “Wnt/beta-catenin” as well as the non canonical “Wnt/planar cell polarity. Wnt/Ca2+” pathways are activated. This offers multiple possibilities to target the aberrant regulation of this signaling pathway in order to counteract cancer proliferation. During the last decade. natural compounds from both marine and terrestrial origins were tested for their potential to modulate the expression of specific genes related to the Wnt signaling cascade but also for their anti-carcinogenic properties.

They regulate the permeability and polarity of cell layers and create compartments in cell membranes. Claudins are structural molecules of tight junctions. There are 27 claudins known. and expression of different claudins is responsible for changes in the electrolyte and solute permeability in cells layers. Studies have shown that claudins and tight junctions also protect multicellular organisms from infections and that some infectious agents may use claudins as targets to invade and weaken the host's defense. In neoplastic diseases. claudin expression may be up- or downregulated. Since their expression is associated with specific tumor types or with specific locations of tumors to a certain degree. they can. in a restricted sense. also be used as tumor markers.

This study introduces a simple histopathological model for the prognostication of survival in patients with early OTSCC. A total of 311 cases (from Finland and Brazil) with clinically evaluated early stage OTSCC (cT1–T2cN0cM0) were included in this multicentre retrospective study. Tumour budding (B) and depth of invasion (D) were scored on haematoxylin–eosin-stained cancer slides. The cut-off point for tumour budding was set at 5 buds (low <5; high ≥5) and for depth of invasion at 4 mm (low <4 mm; high ≥4 mm). The scores of B and D were combined into one model: the BD predictive model.

To date. the best clinical approach for treatment is based on administration of temozolomide (TMZ) in combination with radiotherapy. Much evidence suggests that the intracellular level of the alkylating enzyme O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) impacts response to TMZ in GBM patients. MGMT expression is regulated by the methylation of its promoter. However. evidence indicates that this is not the only regulatory mechanism present. Here. we describe a hitherto unknown microRNA-mediated mechanism of MGMT expression regulation. We show that miR-221 and miR-222 are upregulated in GMB patients and that these paralogues target MGMT mRNA. inducing greater TMZ-mediated cell death. However. miR-221/miR-222 also increase DNA damage and. thus. chromosomal rearrangements. Indeed. miR-221 overexpression in glioma cells led to an increase in markers of DNA damage. an effect rescued by re-expression of MGMT. Thus. chronic miR-221/222-mediated MGMT downregulation may render cells unable to repair genetic damage. This. associated also to miR-221/222 oncogenic potential. may poor GBM prognosis.,True,wjVZRdsAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC,90,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0074466,11347992413322891622,/scholar?cites=11347992413322891622,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0074466,0,0,0

METHODS AND RESULTS: Apoptosis was detected in histological sections by the 3'-end DNA labelling method. bcl-2 and bax protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. The frequency of apoptosis was clearly higher in malignant than in benign tumours. In pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin's tumours the average apoptotic index was 0.01%(range 0.00-0.07%) while in the malignant salivary gland tumours it was 0.42%(range 0.00-1.75%). Immunohistochemical bcl-2 expression was observed in all pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin's tumours and in most cases the expression was strong. In malignant tumours. 9/25 cases showed no expression and in the rest of the cases. apart from adenoid cystic carcinomas. the bcl-2 expression was often weak. There were significantly more cases with no or weak bcl-2 positivity in malignant than in benign salivary gland tumours (P= 0.001). There was a statistically significant association between a weak bcl-2 expression and a high frequency of apoptosis (P= 0.02). In contrast to bcl-2. strong bax expression was found in both benign and malignant tumours and was not associated with the frequency of apoptosis.

FRAP has serine/threonine kinase activity and mediates the cellular response to mitogens through signaling to p70s6 kinase (p70s6k) and 4E-BP1. resulting in an increase in translation of subsets of cellular mRNAs. Translational up-regulation is blocked by inactivation of FRAP signaling by rapamycin. resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest. Rapamycin is used as an immunosuppressant for kidney transplants and is currently under investigation as an antiproliferative agent in tumors because of its ability to block FRAP activity. Although the role of FRAP has been extensively studied in vitro. characterization of mammalian FRAP function in vivo has been limited to the immune system and tumor models.

The breakdown of reserved starch in the endosperm into simple sugars is essential for seed germination and subsequent seedling growth. At the early stage of germination. gibberellic acid (GA) activates transcription factor GAMYB to promote de novo synthesis of isoforms of α‐amylase in the aleurone layer and scutellar epithelium of the embryo. Here. we demonstrate that wheat germination is regulated by plant target of rapamycin signaling. TOR is a central component of the essential-nutrient–dependent pathway controlling cell growth in all eukaryotes. It is known that rapamycin. a highly specific allosteric inhibitor of TOR. is effective in yeast and animal cells but ineffective in most of higher plants likely owing to structural differences in ubiquitous rapamycin receptor FKBP12. The action of rapamycin on wheat growth has not been studied. Our data show that rapamycin inhibits germination of wheat seeds and of their isolated embryos in a dose-dependent manner. The involvement of Triticum aestivum TOR (TaTOR) in wheat germination was consistent with the suppression of wheat embryo growth by specific inhibitors of the TOR kinase: pp242 or torin1. Rapamycin or torin1 interfered with GA function in germination because of a potent inhibitory effect on α-amylase and GAMYB gene expression. The TOR inhibitors selectively targeted the GA-dependent gene expression. whereas expression of the abscisic acid-dependent ABI5 gene was not affected by either rapamycin or torin1.

Deregulation of this signaling pathway is common in human diseases including cancer and metabolic disorders. Growth factors by binding to their specific receptor tyrosine kinases located on the plasma membrane recruit and activate the signaling factors including the key component identified as the PI3K lipid kinase. A crucial downstream effector of PI3K is the Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt or also known as PKB. Akt transduces the myriad of cellular signals by phosphorylating a wide spectrum of substrates and its activity is strictly controlled by PI3K. The translocation step of Akt to the plasma membrane is a primary step in its activation leading to phosphorylation of Akt on the kinase domain and the regulatory hydrophobic motif.

Lancet published a paper by Randle et al. that proposed a “glucose-fatty acid cycle” to describe fuel flux between and fuel selection by tissues. The original biochemical mechanism explained the inhibition of glucose oxidation by fatty acids. Since then. the principle has been confirmed by many investigators.

114197,Gluconeogenesis and related aspects of glycolysis,1983,HG Hers and Louis Hue,52,,1,617-653,Annual Reviews,Glycolysis is the metabolic sequence that converts glucose to pyruvate and lactate (ethanol and CO2 in yeast) and provides energy under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the liver and other lipogenic tissues. pyruvate formed by glycolysis is in great part used for the synthesis offatty acids (1). Gluconeogenesis is the reverse of glycolysis; it consumes energy and provides glucose to fasted animals. as well as glucose 6-phosphate to microorganisms grown in the absence of glucose. It is thus essential for survival. because all cells require glucose derivatives for the synthesis of glycolipids. glycoproteins and structural polysaccharides. which are normal constituents of their membranes. Furthermore. glucose is the main fuel of the brain and is also the only energy source for the mammalian erythrocytes and avian retina (1).

In this review. we focus on recent findings showing that AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a major role in the control of hepatic metabolism. AMPK integrates nutritional and hormonal signals to promote energy balance by switching on catabolic pathways and switching off ATP‐consuming pathways. both by short‐term effects on phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and by long‐term effects on gene expression. Activation of AMPK in the liver leads to the stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and inhibition of lipogenesis. glucose production and protein synthesis. Medical interest in the AMPK system has recently increased with the demonstration that AMPK could mediate some of the effects of the fat cell‐derived adiponectin and the antidiabetic drugs metformin and thiazolidinediones.

In addition to its catabolic role. glycolysis also serves an anabolic function by providing C3 precursors for the synthesis of fatty acids. cholesterol and amino acids. It is therefore an amphibolic pathway. The difference in metabolic orientation is tissue-specific and depends on the hormonal and nutritional state. Therefore. it is not surprising that different and specific regulatory mechanisms exist to control glycolysis under these various conditions. Cancer cells are a special case in which glycolysis is abnormally high. Qualitative and quantitative approaches have been developed to elucidate the control mechanisms of glycolysis. On the one hand. so-called'rate-limiting'steps in the pathway have been identified by qualitative analysis.

The ligand-bound receptors activate effector systems such as adenylate cyclase. cyclic nueleotide phosphodiesterase. ion channels. and phospholipases via membrane-associated transducing systems to generate second messengers. Receptors activate effector systems via signal transducing elements called GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) which are heterotrimers composed of a-. B-and y-subunits. When a receptor binds ligands. the G-protein disassociates into the a-and Bysubunits [11. The disassociation of subunits is caused by the exchange of GTP for GDP which is bound to the a-subunit. Specific a-subunits are associated with the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. voltage-sensitive ion channels. adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C.

The activity at 0.5mm-glucose was only 1–2% of Vmax.. indicating a virtual absence of low-Km hexokinase in the preparation. The radiochemical method was also used for the determination of glucose phosphorylation by intact hepatocytes. The glucose-saturation curve was also markedly sigmoidal. but the s0.5 (substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity) and the Hill coefficient were larger than in extracts of hepatocytes.

The present study demonstrates that this is also the case in the MIN6 β-cell line. which was used to investigate the underlying mechanism. Sustained activation of AMPK was induced by culture with the adenosine analogue AICA-riboside or at low glucose concentrations. Both conditions induced a sequential activation of AMPK. c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-3. The effects of AMPK on JNK activation and apoptosis were demonstrated by adenoviral expression of constitutively active AMPK. a condition which reproduced the earlier-described AMPK-dependent effects on pyruvate kinase and acetyl-coA-carboxylase. The effects of JNK activation on apoptosis were demonstrated by the observations that (i) its inhibition by dicumarol prevented caspase-3 activation and apoptosis.(ii) adenoviral expression of the JNK-interacting scaffold protein JIP-1/IB-1 increased AICA-riboside-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. In primary β-cells. AMPK activation was also found to activate JNK. involving primarily the JNK 2 (p54) isoform.

The initial effect is a 30-40% increase in the rate of glutamate/malate oxidation after 10 min of ischaemia. owing to an increase in the capacity for NADH oxidation. This effect is followed by a progressive decrease in these oxidative activities as the ischaemia is prolonged. apparently owing to damage to Complex I at a site subsequent to the NADH dehydrogenase component. This damage is exacerbated by reperfusion. which causes a further decrease in Complex I activity and also decreases the activities of the other complexes. most notably of Complex III.

The aim of the present work was therefore to study whether ischaemia activated NO synthase. Methods: NO synthase activity was measured by the conversion of radioactive arginine into citrulline in extracts of isolated perfused rabbit hearts submitted to low-flow ischaemia and reperfusion.

114253,The AMP-activated protein kinase: more than an energy sensor,2007,Chris Peers and Louis Hue and Mark H Rider,43,,,121-138,Portland Press,The AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein serine/threonine kinase. It mediates a nutrient signalling pathway that senses cellular energy status and was appropriately called the fuel gauge of the cell. At the cellular level. AMPK controls energy homoeostasis by switching on catabolic ATP-generating pathways. while switching off anabolic ATP-consuming processes. Its effect on energy balance extends to whole-body energy homoeostasis. because. in the hypothalamus. it integrates nutritional and hormonal signals that control food intake and body weight. The interest in AMPK also stems from the demonstration of its insulin-independent stimulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle during exercise. Moreover. the potential importance of AMPK in metabolic diseases is supported by the notion that AMPK mediates the anti-diabetic action of biguanides and thiazolidinediones …,True,ANeIie8AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,95,https://portlandpress.com/essaysbiochem/article-abstract/doi/10.1042/bse0430121/88040,10442418214491923725,/scholar?cites=10442418214491923725,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e723/3fa918097190f4a27bb2c6ee12c32d182491.pdf,0,0,0

It was inhibited by physiological concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate and by micromolar concentrations of fructose bisphosphate and these inhibitory effects were counteracted by Mg‐ATP and by several l‐form amino acids such as cysteine. alanine. serine. phenylalanine. which are also ligands of pyruvate kinase.

The characterization of this system and of its regulation is a prerequisite for understanding of how fluctuations in Fru-2.6-P2 concentration integrate the hormonal and metabolic signals that control glycolysis. The first committed step of glycolysis is the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) and ATP into fructose l.6-bisphosphate catalyzed by 6-phosphofructo-l-kinase (PFK-1). The most potent stimulator of PFK-1 is fructose 2.6-bisphosphate (Fru-2.6-P2). present in all eukaryotes. Unlike other regulatory ligands of PFK-1 that act at millimolar concentrations. Fru-2.6-P. stimulates PFK-1 as an allosteric effector active in the micromolar (physiological) range.

The administration of glucagon caused a 3-fold increase in the intrahepatic concentration of glucose 6-phosphate. The effect of the administration of glucose on the level of glucose 6-phosphate varied according to whether glycogen synthetase had or not been activated. being slightly elevated in the absence of activation and being lowered (40%) when an important activation had occurred. These observations are discussed with regard to the recycling of glucose and glucose 6-phosphate in the liver.

We discuss pathways of myocardial fuel toxicity. as well as several layers of defense against fuel overload. Our reassessment of the literature suggests that in the heart. insulin-sensitizing agents result in an elimination of some of the defenses. leading to cytotoxic damage.

They have been implicated recently in the aggravation. or even the induction. of parkinsonism in elderly patients. Because the aetiology of parkinsonism has been suggested as having a mitochondrial component. we have investigated the effects of both compounds on mitochondnal respiration and on the activities of the individual respiratory chain complexes. In intact mitochondria from rat liver. both drugs inhibited respiration rates. with substrates entering at Complex I (glutamate/malate) and Complex II (succinate).These effects could be explained by potent inhibitions(K1 3-10 zM) of both complexes. Complex I is inhibited at a site near the ubiquinone-binding site. which is not competitive with respect to ubiquinone. whereas the mnhibmtmonof Complex II isapparently caused by competition with ubiquinone. Furthermore. the inhibi-tion of NADH oxidation by flunarizine in submitochondnal parti-des caused an NADH-dependent generation of superoxide.

This polypeptide is phosphorylated on serine 32 by cyclic‐AMP‐dependent protein kinase. Clone 4c (2681 bp) had a coding region identical to that of clone 22c but it included a putative intron of 959 bp. In clone 5c (1750 bp). the sequence upstream from amino acid 33 differed from that in clone 22c and coded for a unique N‐terminal portion of 10 amino acids.Poly(A)‐rich RNA from rat tissues was hybridized with cDNA probes corresponding to the unique N‐terminal portions of clones 22c and 5c.

However. there is no genetic evidence to confirm this hypothesis. We investigated the contribution of AMPKα2 in the control of cardiac hypertrophy by using AMPKα2−/− mice submitted to isoproterenol. The isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. measured by left ventricular mass and histological examination. was significantly higher in AMPKα2−/− than in WT animals. Moreover. the intensification of cardiac hypertrophy found in AMPKα2−/− mice can be linked to the abnormal basal overstimulation of the p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase. an enzyme known to regulate protein translation and cell growth.

Using oligonucleotides as sequence-specific ligands to form triple helical structures offers a particularly attractive approach due to their availability and their simple recognition code based mainly on directional hydrogen bond contacts. However. the recognition code is limited to only two out of four Watson-Crick base pairs in DNA and only homopurine sequences can be effectively targeted by triplex-forming oligonucleotides at present.

Thus on its applications can be used in the development of a new drug that specifically target a DNA sequence. Covalent attachment of the MB to the DNA through a flexible heptamethylene linker has been accomplished. enabling the defined positioning of the dye moiety at specific sites of the DNA strands by forming a triple helix. The structure of MB itself does not provide a suitable functional group for a direct attachment to an oligonucleotide. Thus. the MB derivative. 3 - N - (4 - carboxybutyl) - methylamino - 7 - dimethylaminophenaza - thionum chloride was synthesized. The attachment of the MB derivative to a 3’ - aminoalkylated oligonucleotide was accomplished by the activation of the carboxyl group with a yield from 40% - 70%. A precipitation step using n - butanol was performed before HPLC purification in order to remove the excess of activated MB ester. Unreacted oligonucleotide was identified in the chromatogram from its absorbance at the typical wavelength for nucleic acids and its lack of absorbance at 660 nm. The conjugate products bearing the MB moiety were recognized from the additional absorbance at around 660 nm. Another confirmation comes from the MS data. 1D 1H NMR spectra of the MB - oligonucleotide conjugates as well as the non - conjugated 3’ - aminoalkyl - oligonucleotide in H2O are acquired to compare the oligonucleotide before and after conjugation with MB.,True,YuCatNQAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,1,http://repository.ubaya.ac.id/26574/,6185318185283088261,/scholar?cites=6185318185283088261,,http://repository.ubaya.ac.id/26574/1/Purwanto_Synthesis%20and%20Covalent_2015.pdf,0,0,0

Food sources must also provide daily nutrition; therefore. this study aims to compare the nutrition of edible insects in Indonesia. namely teak grasshopper (Valanga nigricornis Burmeister). cricket (Brachytrupes portentosus L.). and mealworm (Tenebrio molitor). with cork fish (Chana striata) that has been commonly consumed by the Indonesian people. The highest total protein content (Kjeldahl method) was found for fish (82.69%). while the lower ones were found for grasshopper (72.50%). cricket (59.00%) and mealworm (53.08%). This result was also in line with the total protein content found for fish (11984.00 ppm as the highest) and grasshopper (1016.33 ppm as the lowest). SDS-PAGE result also confirmed the highest protein content for fish where it showed the thickest band intensity for fish sample. Although cricket and mealworm were found to have lower total protein content (proximate assay). their fat and calorie levels were higher with calorie from fat values of 235.35 kcal/100 g for cricket and 195.93 kcal/100 g for mealworm. Proteolytic assay was carried out using papain to compare protein digestibility. The absorbance values from the proteolytic assay of cork fish and mealworm were higher than grasshopper and cricket. indicating that proteins of fish and mealworm were easier to hydrolyze. This could be explained so. that adult insects have a chitin structure that limits the hydrolysis process. or that papain might have a specific recognition sites and it fitted better to the fish and mealworm protein.

It can help improve someone’s health and/or decrease the risk of disease. The awareness in the community of the importance of health encourages the development of functional food. One of the functional food that has been developed in Indonesia is the artificial rice. Artificial rice. an alternative paddy rice substitute. has a minimally equal value to paddy rice. Artificial rice is made to reduce people’s dependence on paddy rice and to support food diversification program to achieve food security in Indonesia. Artificial rice is made from a non-paddy rice flour with a certain compositions. so that it can be used as a vehichle to make a functional food and can be fortified with ingredients that contain functional active compounds. Indonesian researchers have developed artificial rice products by utilizing local resources. such as corn. sorghum. spices. tubers. and others. to obtain an artificial rice with improved nutritional and functional characters that have some health benefits such as antidiabetic. antioxidant. antihypertensive. and anticancer. Such development has resulted in the observation that artificial rice can be used as a functional food for rice substitute with an equal or better nutritional value than paddy rice.

Protein and albumin content in the snakehead fish as reported is considered as high and thus. can provide health function to help in the treatment of wound healing patients. children with malnutrition and some other medical cases. Protein. as biomolecule. is very sensitive to the external condition and thus. requires adequate treatment during extraction and dying processes in order to get a biologically active albumin concentrate. In this work we varied the extraction and drying methods (temperature. maceration time. and steps of extraction and drying procesess) from sample of snakehead fish from Kalimantan. It was found that maceration temperature and drying methods gave significant effect to both yield and quality of albumin concentrate from the snakehead fish.

Up till now. potato is the only substrate media used for growing spawn of F0-mycelial growth phase. while corn seeds are the only substrate media used for the F1-mycelial growth phase. Both of the substrate materials are quite costly and their availability is quite rare in some parts of Indonesia. Hence this study proposed an alternative substrate using lower price materials abundantly available in Indonesia. such as sweet potato and cassava for growing spawn of F0-mycelial and F1-mycelial growth phase for Shiitake and Lingzhi. The results showed the utilization of sweet potato and cassava as substrates gave no different result on F0-mycelial growth of both mushroom species compared to potato medium (P> 0.05). On the other hand. the mixture of 40% sweet potato and 60% corn seeds as substrate gave a significantly higher F1-mycelial growth rate compared to 100% corn seeds medium (P< 0.05). It was concluded that sweet potato and cassava can be used as alternative substrates for F0 and F1-mycelial growth of Shiitake and Lingzhi cultures.,True,YuCatNQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://li01.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/sci_ubu/article/view/86596,,,,https://li01.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/sci_ubu/article/download/86596/68674,0,0,0

Modification of bentonite was conducted by the adding of 4-6% (v/v) HDTMA-Br and TMAOH respectively. The obtained immobilized lipases then were characterized to observe the optimum pH and temperature as well as their stability during reuse application. The observed results show that there is no significant difference between the variations of HDTMA-Br concentrations to the percentage of immobilized enzyme which can immobilize lipase up to 75-78%. However. the best concentration of TMAOH is 4% (v/v) which can immobilize lipase up to 97.95%. The obtained immobilized lipases on HDTMA-Br-modified bentonite show the optimum catalytic activity on reaction temperature of 35-40 oC and pH of 7.5. In other hand. the optimum catalytic activity of immobilized lipases on TMAOH-modified bentonite is 40oC of incubation temperature and pH of 7.

Covalent attachment of the MB to the DNA through a flexible heptamethylene linker has been accomplished. enabling the defined positioning of the dye moiety at specific sites of the DNA strands by forming a triple helix. The structure of MB itself does not provide a suitable functional group for a direct attachment to an oligonucleotide. Thus. the MB derivative. 3-N-(4-carboxybutyl)-ethylamino-7-dimethylaminophenaza-thionumchloride was synthesized. The attachment of the MB derivative to a 3'-aminoalkylated oligonucleotide was accomplished by the activation of the carboxyl group with a yield from 40%-70%. A precipitation step using n-butanol was performed before HPLC purification in order to remove the excess of activated MB ester. Unreacted oligonucleotide was identified in the chromatogram from its absorbance at the typical wave length for nucleic acids and its lack of absorbance at 660 nm.

The genetic basis of blood pressure variation is largely unknown but is likely to involve genes that influence renal salt handling and arterial vessel tone. Here we argue that susceptibility to hypertension is ancestral and that differential susceptibility to hypertension is due to differential exposure to selection pressures during the out-of-Africa expansion. The most important selection pressure was climate. which produced a latitudinal cline in heat adaptation and. therefore. hypertension susceptibility. Consistent with this hypothesis. we show that ecological variables. such as latitude. temperature. and rainfall. explain worldwide variation in heat adaptation as defined by seven functional alleles in five genes involved in blood pressure regulation. The latitudinal cline in heat adaptation is consistent worldwide and is largely unmatched by latitudinal clines in short tandem repeat markers. control single nucleotide polymorphisms. or non-functional single nucleotide polymorphisms within the five genes. In addition. we show that latitude and one of these alleles. GNB3 (G protein β3 subunit) 825T. account for a major portion of worldwide variation in blood pressure. These results suggest that the current epidemic of hypertension is due to exposures of the modern period interacting with ancestral susceptibility. Modern populations differ in susceptibility to these new exposures. however. such that those from hot environments are more susceptible to hypertension than populations from cold environments.

The molecular basis of McCune-Albright syndrome and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.,1996,Matthew D Ringel and William F Schwindinger and Michael A Levine,75,,4,171-184,,Inactivating and activating mutations in the gene encoding G alpha s (GNAS1) are known to be the basis for 2 well-described contrasting clinical disorders. Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). AHO is an autosomal dominant disorder due to germline mutations in GNAS1 that decrease expression or function of G alpha s protein. Loss of G alpha s function leads to tissue resistance to multiple hormones whose receptors couple to G alpha s. By contrast. MAS results from postzygotic somatic mutations in GNAS1 that lead to enhanced function of G alpha s protein. Acquisition of the activating mutation early in life leads to a more generalized distribution of the mosaicism and is associated with the classic clinical triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. endocrine hyperfunction. and café au lait skin lesions described in MAS. Acquisition of a similar activating mutation in GNAS1 later in life presumably accounts for the restricted distribution of the gsp oncogene. and is associated with the development of isolated lesions (for example. fibrous dysplasia. pituitary or thyroid tumors) without other manifestations of MAS. Tissues that are affected by loss of G alpha s function in AHO are also affected by gain of G alpha s function in MAS. thus identifying specific tissues in which the second messenger cAMP plays a dominant role in cell growth. proliferation. or function.

Approximately two-thirds of the affected patients exhibit one or more symptoms attributable to hypercalcaemia. The commonest symptoms are muscular fatigue; sleepiness; mental disturbances. such as forgetfulness or difficulty concentrating; headaches; and arthralgia. The renal clearance of filtered calcium and magnesium is lower than in patients with comparable hypercalcaemia from typical primary hyperparathyroidism.

These binding proteins are called G proteins and have been linked to such critical intracellular functions as protein synthesis.1 In the past decade three new G proteins have been discovered that reside in the plasma membrane and transmit information from the outside to the inside of the cell.

In the group with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. the duration of hypercalcemia was probably greater. because it commences during infancy; the urinary excretion ratefor calcium was lower [6.6 ± 5.4 (mean ±1 SD) vs. 14.8 ± 7.5 meq/day; P < 0.005].

Porcine chromogranin-A contains a sequence identical to pancreastatin. a 49-amino acid. C-terminally amidated peptide that has been isolated from porcine pancreas. suggesting that chromogranin- A is the precursor of pancreastatin. Pancreastatin has been found to be a potent inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin release. As it is possible that pancreastatin inhibits secretion from other chromogranin-A-containing tissues in which it may be formed. we tested its action on dispersed porcine parathyroid cells in culture. Secretion of chromogranin-A and PTH was up to 6-fold greater at 0.5 mM Ca2+ than at 3.0 mM Ca2+.

In many cases these disturbances are thought to be exaggerated responses to the normal physiological transition from the intrauterine environment to neonatal independence. By contrast. some disturbances in calcium homeostasis are the result of genetic defects. which in many instances can now be identified at the molecular level. In other cases hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia may result from pathological intrauterine conditions. birth trauma or stress. or fetal immaturity. Diagnosis and management of hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia in the neonate and infant requires specific knowledge of perinatal mineral physiology and the unique clinical and biochemical features of newborn mineral metabolism.

We found that in none of the 23 affected individuals was there absence of the parathyroid hormone gene or abnormal restriction patterns to suggest recognizable deletions. insertions. or rearrangements. To determine if subtle mutations within the PTH gene were associated with hypoparathyroidism in these families. we used the Pst I and Taq I restriction-site polymorphisms in linkage analysis as markers to differentiate between PTH alleles. In 4 families. affected sibs inherited different PTH gene alleles. implying that hypoparathyroidism was not due to an abnormality in the PTH gene. In 2 other families. linkage analysis was uninformative because of inability to differentiate between PTH alleles. In 2 families. concordance was found between the inheritance of hypoparathyroidism and specific PTH alleles in affected members. suggesting that in these families. hypoparathyroidism may be due to an alteration in or near the PTH structural gene. We conclude that FIH is a diverse group of disorders and is characterized by genetic and molecular heterogeneity. In some forms of FIH the mutation that leads to PTH deficiency does not lie within the region of the structural gene for PTH. Linkage analysis using DNA polymorphisms within the PTH gene is of benefit in identifying individuals with disorders of PTH secretion or synthesis in whom DNA sequencing and expression studies of the PTH …,True,UfMWy-oAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,95,https://europepmc.org/article/med/3005800,9915332635550307308,/scholar?cites=9915332635550307308,,,0,0,0

In this population. however. the diagnosis of hypocalcemia is complicated by limitations in the interpretation of the total plasma calcium concentration. These limitations are principally the result of the effects of hypoalbuminemia and disorders of acid-base balance on the total calcium concentration. Thus. measurement of ionized calcium can be critical in determining an individual’s true serum calcium status. In this review. we first describe the regulation of normal calcium metabolism and then focus on the various etiologies of hypocalcemia. including congenital and acquired disorders of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. which are encountered in the neonatal. pediatric. and adult critical care settings.

Bone lesions are filled with soft fibrous giant cell-rich tissue that can expand and cause severe facial deformity. The disorder typically begins in children at ages of 2-5 years and the bone resorption and facial swelling continues until puberty; in most cases the lesions regress spontaneously thereafter. Most patients with cherubism have germline mutations in the gene encoding SH3BP2. an adapter protein involved in adaptive and innate immune response signaling. A mouse model carrying a Pro416Arg mutation in SH3BP2 develops osteopenia and expansile lytic lesions in bone and some soft tissue organs. In this review we discuss the genetics of cherubism. the biological functions of SH3BP2 and the analysis of the mouse model.

Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of Paget’s disease. In some families. the disease has been found to be linked to a susceptibility locus on chromosome 18q21-22. which also contains the gene responsible for familial expansile osteolysis (FEO)—a rare bone dysplasia with many similarities to Paget’s disease.

G proteins are comprised of three subunits (α. β. γ). each encoded by many different genes. The multiplicity of G protein subunits facilitates great combinatorial variability. which. in part. accounts for the ability of G proteins to interact with many different receptor and effector proteins. Hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors have been identified. and their unique patterns of expression among a restricted number of cell types contributes greatly to the apparent specificity of hormone action. Mutations that either activate or inactivate some of these receptors account for a number of highly specific syndromes. which affect a limited number of target tissues.

A variety of point mutations in this enzyme result in a severe human immunodeficiency known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Btk contains a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain that specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3. 4. 5-trisphosphate and. hence. responds to signalling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Point mutations in the PH domain might abolish membrane binding. preventing signalling via Btk. Results: We have determined the crystal structures of the wild-type PH domain and a gain-of-function mutant E41K in complex with D-myo-inositol 1. 3. 4. 5-tetra-kisphosphate (Ins (1. 3. 4. 5) P 4).

However. the global regulation of RIG-I signaling is only partially understood. Using a human genome-wide RNAi-screen. we identified 226 novel regulatory proteins of RIG-I mediated interferon-β production. Furthermore. the screen identified a metabolic pathway that synthesizes the inositol pyrophosphate 1-IP7 as a previously unrecognized positive regulator of interferon production. Detailed genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrated that the kinase activities of IPPK. PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 (which convert IP5 to1-IP7) were critical for both interferon induction. and the control of cellular infection by Sendai and influenza A viruses. Conversely. ectopically expressed inositol pyrophosphate-hydrolases DIPPs attenuated interferon transcription. Mechanistic experiments in intact cells revealed that the expression of IPPK. PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 was needed for the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3. a transcription factor for interferon. The addition of purified individual inositol pyrophosphates to a cell free reconstituted RIG-I signaling assay further identified 1-IP7 as an essential component required for IRF3 activation. The inositol pyrophosphate may act by β-phosphoryl transfer. since its action was not recapitulated by a synthetic phosphonoacetate analogue of 1-IP7. This study thus identified several novel regulators of RIG-I. and a new role for inositol pyrophosphates in augmenting innate immune responses to viral infection that may have therapeutic applications.,True,0XhDZiIAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC,55,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003981,14818853205096172736,/scholar?cites=14818853205096172736,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003981,0,0,0

Attempts to design nonsteroidal STS inhibitors. because of the oestrogenicity of the original lead oestrone 3-O-sulfamate in rodents. have led to the discovery of benzophenone-4.4′-O.O-bis-sulfamate (BENZOMATE. 3).

The portion of the sequence reported here (51 residues) represents a unique region of glycophorin that. on the basis of labeling experiments reported elsewhere. is probably associated with the hydrophobic interior of the red cell membrane. This sequence has the anticipated hydrophobic characteristics for interaction with the hydrocarbon interior of a membrane and. as far as we are aware. represents the first reported sequence from a hydrophobic region of an integral membrane protein. There is a distribution of charged and hydrophobic residues topographically similar to a cross-section of a phospholipid bilayer. a structure many now accept as the basic feature of a biological membrane.

A relatively sample and reproducible analytical procedure has been devised to measure the levels of these glycosides in human urine.

Urinary glycoside levels appear to be highest in children. roughly paralleling collagen turnover as indicated by urinary hydroxyproline levels. Collagen turnover equivalents calculated from urinary hydroxylysyl glycoside levels were found to be significantly larger than collagen turnover equivalents calculated from urinary hydroxyproline levels.

114626,Amphipathic helixes and plasma lipoproteins: thermodynamic and geometric considerations,1977,Jere P Segrest,18,Chemistry and physics of lipids,1,7-22,Elsevier,In this paper analyses are made of the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the predicted association between amphipathic helixes and phospholipid vesicles. From thermodynamic considerations it is proposed that a major driving force for such an association is the negative free energy gained by the transfer of a number of hydrophobic residues (contained within the non-polar faces of amphipathic helixes). from water to the interior of a phospholipid bilayer. The mechanism proposed is that in the aqueous state a potentially amphipathic sequence forms a non-helical hydrophobic patch on the surface of the apolipoprotein. Formation of an amphipathic helix and simultaneous burial of the hydrophobic residues in the surface of a phospholipid bilayer provides the driving force for lipid association. From this model an estimate of the upperlimit for the hydrophobically driven free energy of lipid association (−40−65 …,True,swTeA6wAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,144,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0009308477900238,5131814617587966568,/scholar?cites=5131814617587966568,,,0,0,0

The rank order of the ability of the four peptide analogs to displace apo-A-I from intact HDL was 18A-Pro-18A greater than 18A greater than des-Val10-18A greater than reverse-18A. the same order suggested in the preceding paper for relative lipid affinities. Modified HDL from which 40% of the apo-A-I had been displaced by 18A was indistinguishable from unmodified HDL in its ability to act as a lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase substrate.

The validity of the apoB model was supported by conservation of disulfide bonds. location of all proline residues in turns and loops. and conservation of the hydrophobic faces of the two C-terminal amphipathic β-sheets. βA (residues 600–763) and βB (residues 780–1000). This model suggests a lipid-pocket mechanism for initiation of lipoprotein particle assembly.

The novel concept of membrane protein crystallization from lipidic cubic phases. “in cubo”. has yielded well-ordered crystals and high-resolution structures of several membrane proteins. yet progress has been slow due to the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein transport. crystal nucleation. growth. and defect formation in cubo. Here. we examine at molecular and mesoscopic resolution with atomic force microscopy the morphology of in cubo grown bacteriorhodopsin crystals in inert buffers and during etching by detergent.

As the human proteome is not a static entity. it seems necessary to estimate the number of different protein species (proteoforms) and measure the number of copies of the same protein in a specific tissue. Here. meta-analysis of neXtProt knowledge base is proposed for theoretical prediction of the number of different proteoforms that arise from alternative splicing (AS). single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs). and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Three possible cases are considered:  PTMs and SAPs appear exclusively in the canonical sequences of proteins. but not in splice variants;  PTMs and SAPs can occur in both proteins encoded by canonical sequences and in splice variants;  all modification types (AS. SAP. and PTM) occur as independent events. Experimental validation of proteoforms is limited by the analytical sensitivity of proteomic technology.

114719,The oxidative inactivation of cytochrome P450 in monooxygenase reactions,1994,Irina I Karuzina and Alexander I Archakov,16,,1,73-97,Pergamon,Possible mechanisms of cytochrome P450 self-inactivation during catalytic turnover have been considered. Two ways of hemoprotein inactivation are so far known. The firts. studied extensively by many authors. is the formation of active substrate intermediates. capable of modifying heme and apoenzyme. The second way. revealed quite recently and resulting from uncoupled cytochrome P450-catalyzed monooxygenase reactions. is yet to be clarified. Briefly. it involves formation of hydrogen peroxide in the hemoprotein active center. which interacts with the enzyme associated Fe2+. thereby generating hydroxyl radicals that bleach the heme and modify the apoenzyme. This mechanism operates with substrates and cytochrome P450 forms with partially coupled monooxygenase reactions. thus causing the formation of hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct.,True,4P5c1wEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,121,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584994902453,1845267068143479153,/scholar?cites=1845267068143479153,,,0,0,0

The concentration sensitivity limit (CSL) of currently used approaches. like 2‐DE/LC separation coupled with MS detection. etc.. varies from 10−9 to 10−12 M. Therefore. proteomic technologies enable detection of up to 20% of the protein species present in the plasma. New technologies. like atomic force microscopy (AFM molecular detector). enable the counting of single molecules. whereas biospecific fishing can be used to capture these molecules from the biomaterial. At the same time. fishing also has thermodynamic limitations due to the reversibility of the binding.

Application of factor analysis to the spectral changes in the Soret region allowed us to resolve two particular pressure-induced processes in 2B4 oligomers. The first process was identified as the conversion of the low-spin P450 into the P420 state. At 25° C it was followed by decay (bleaching) about 50% of the newly formed P420. The second process was a pressure-induced high-to low-spin shift. Both transitions were reversible. except the hemoprotein bleaching. The applitude of the P450→ P420 transition accounted for 67±5% of the total hemoprotein content.

Лтд),Amides of fatty acids are lipid bioregulators formed from long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids via amidation by the corresponding amines. Ethanolamides of fatty acids are the most well-studied species of this group; an alternative pathway for their biosynthesis includes hydrolysis of N-acylated phosphatidylethanolamines by phospholipase D. Ethanolamides of fatty acids bind to the cannabinoid receptors of the central nervous system (CB1) or peripheral tissues (CB2) and can be considered as endogenous ligands of these receptors.

The P450 heme modification involves the heme release from the enzyme under the action of H2O2 formed within P450s active center via the peroxycomplex decay. Additionally. the heme lost is destroyed by H2O2 localized outside of enzyme’s active center.

This review provides examples of compounds known to be toxic to humans that have been demonstrated to functional similarly in zebrafish. Major advantages of zebrafish embryons are that they are readily permeable to small molecules added to their incubation medium and the transparent chorion enables the easy observation of development. Assay of acute toxicity (LC50 estimation) in embryos can also include the screening for developmental disorders as an indicator of teratogenic effects.

The monooxygenase and oxidase activities of liver microsomes from phenobarbital (PB)-treated rabbits were investigated for their dependence on the high spin shift (Δα) of the ferric cytochrome P-450 induced by a series of benzphetamine analogues.2. The spin shift activity of the substrate determines. via the first electron transfer kinetics. the steady-state level of the reaction intermediate oxycytochrome P-450. Correlation of the amount or oxycytochrome P-450 with Δα can be experimentally proved.3. The spin-state-dependent formation of oxycytochrome P-450 regulates quantitatively the rates of NADPH oxidation and substrate N-demethylation. Both activities correlate with Δα. Oxycytochrome P-450 is substrate-stabilized towards decay with the formation of O2− which. upon dismutation. gives rise to H2O2.4. The ratio of N-demethylase to NADPH oxidase activity (coupling ratio) also increases with the spin shift …,True,4P5c1wEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,50,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00498259109039456,10991267255266528810,/scholar?cites=10991267255266528810,,,0,0,0

Australia. In accordance with the gene-centric approach. the goals of the HPP are to prepare an inventory of all human proteins and decipher the network of cellular protein interactions. The greater complexity of the proteome in comparison to the genome gives rise to three bottlenecks in the implementation of the HPP. The main bottleneck is the insufficient sensitivity of proteomic technologies. hampering the detection of proteins with low- and ultra-low copy numbers. The second bottleneck is related to poor reproducibility of proteomic methods and the lack of a so-called ‘gold’ standard. The last bottleneck is the dynamic nature of the proteome: its instability over time.

This method is based on continuous monitoring of changes of optical characteristics that accompany complex formation between a ligand (immobilized on dextran bed of IAsys biosensor cell) and its soluble receptor. Solubilisation of tissue preparations and subcellular fractions with detergent (1% Triton X-100) is the important preconditions for the applicability of this method. The immobilisation of 5-aminoisatin was achieved by peptide bond formation between amino group of this isatin analogue and carboxyl group of the dextran bed of the biosensor cell. Addition of Triton X-100 treated preparations of membrane and soluble fractions of rat brain. liver. heart. and kidneys to the biosensor cell resulted in appearance of the characteristic response. indicating complex formation with the immobilised isatin analogue.

Analysis of the alignment identified regions with different sequence variability. It was found that 33% and 50% of positions within E1 and E2. respectively. were highly conservative. Such conservation can be considered as the minimum for maintaining stability of the three-dimensional structure and function of these proteins. Conserved cysteines in E1 and E2 (eight and 18 residues. respectively) were presumed to form intramolecular disulphide bonds. Both envelope proteins were predicted to contain 14 conservative glycosylation sites. Two additional glycosylation sites were predicted in 58% of E1 and 30% of E2 sequences within the corresponding regions. We describe the positions of six conservative regions in E1 and E2. which have several charged and aromatic residues known to participate frequently in protein±protein recognition.

114795,Mass spectrometry methods in metabolomics,2009,PG Lokhov and AI Archakov,3,,1,1-9,SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodica,The review is devoted to metabolomics. a new and rapidly growing area directed to the comprehensive analysis of metabolites of biological objects. Metabolites are characterized by various physical and chemical properties. traditionally studied by methods of analytical chemistry focused on certain groups of chemical substances. However current progress of mass spectrometry has led to the formation of unified methods. such as metabolic fingerprinting and metabolomic profiling. which allow defining thousands of metabolites in one probe. The current review describes basic characteristics of these methods. ways of metabolite separation. and the analysis of metabolites by mass spectrometry. The examples shown in this review. allow to estimate these methods and to compare their advantages and disadvantages. Besides that. authors show the methods most frequently used in metabolomics for data processing and the required resources. such as software for mass spectra processing and metabolite search database. In the conclusion. general suggestions for successful metabolomic experiments are given.,True,4P5c1wEAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,38,https://europepmc.org/article/med/19105394,16106806392757964114,/scholar?cites=16106806392757964114,,,0,0,0

114822,Cell phones and their impact on male fertility: fact or fiction,2011,Alaa J Hamada and Aspinder Singh and Ashok Agarwal,3,The Open Reproductive Science Journal,1,,,Today. cell phone technology is an integral part of everyday life and its use is not only restricted to voice conversations but also conveying news. high resolution pictures and internet. However. these advances in technology are accompanied by progressive boost in the intensity and frequency of the emitted electromagnetic waves without consideration of their health consequences. Our bodies act as parasitic antennas that receive these waves and convert them into electric and magnetic fields. While thermal effects at the present level of cell phone radiation are negligible. most of the biological interactions are attributed to non-thermal effects. Male reproductive system is highly compartmentalized and sensitive biological system that requires the integration of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to properly function. The generated electrical currents may alter the hormonal milieu and testicular microenvironment. necessary for sperm production. Additionally. sperm are electrically active cells and their exposure to cell phone electromagnetic waves and currents may affect their motility. morphology and even their count. Leaky plasma membranes. calcium depletion and oxidative stress are the postulated cellular mechanisms mediating the harmful effects of cell phones radiation on sperm and male fertility potentials. Evidences for such impacts come from designed animal and in vitro studies which may be different from in vivo human exposure. Nevertheless. the important advice is to apply strict regulations on further increase in the power density of the emitted cell phone radiation and to conduct in vivo human research to study its negative effects on fertility.,True,U9NsECwAAAAJ:xii_ZKWM4-0C,100,https://benthamopen.com/ABSTRACT/TORSJ-3-125,932204476064615250,/scholar?cites=932204476064615250,,https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TORSJ/TORSJ-3-125.pdf,0,0,0

Sampling was conducted at ground level at an urban-rural pair of sites during January–March 2009 in eastern Wisconsin. toward the western edge of the US Great Lakes region. Areas surrounding these sites experience multiday episodes of wintertime PM2.5 pollution characterized by high fractions of ammonium nitrate in PM. low wind speeds. and air mass stagnation. Hourly surface monitoring of inorganic gases and aerosols supplemented long-term 24-h aerosol chemistry monitoring at these locations. The urban site (Milwaukee. WI) experienced 13 PM2.5 episodes. defined as periods where the seven-hour moving average PM2.5 concentration exceeded 27 μg m−3 for at least four consecutive hours. The rural site experienced seven episodes by the same metric. and all rural episodes coincided with urban episodes. Episodes were characterized by low pressure systems. shallow/stable boundary layer. light winds. and increased temperature and relative humidity relative to climatological mean conditions. They often occurred in the presence of regional snow cover at temperatures near freezing. when snow melt and sublimation could generate fog and strengthen the boundary layer inversion. Substantial contribution to nitrate production from nighttime chemistry of ozone and NO2 to N2O5 and nitric acid is likely and requires further investigation. Pollutant-specific urban excess during episode and non-episode conditions is presented.

The favorable climate and the landscape of the region have attracted the local people towards domestication of plants and animals. It led to evolution of settled agriculture from a nomadic pastoral life. The archaeological and literary (Vedic) evidences suggest it to be one of the regions where rice was first brought into cultivation from the wild. and where wheat was introduced through interactions with the Harappan civilization. followed with the domestication and introduction of a number of cereals. grain legumes. oilseed and other crops from other parts of the world involving most people from the early days. These crops were better exploited with improved cultivation practices. including the introduction of the plow. For these reasons. this region made faster economic progress compared with other regions. and evolved valuable genetic diversity in a wide range of crops. With increasing population. it expanded to other parts with new settlements and/or by sharing the knowledge gained and the products with other parts of the region. making India principally an agriculture-based economy.

114881,Unilateral epidural analgesia,1967,AJEET SINGH,22,Anaesthesia,1,147-149,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,DISCUSSIONThree causes of unilateral epidural analgesia have previously been suggested. Thornton1 reports that. in the continuous technique the tip of the catheter may pass into the paravertebral space and result in incomplete unilateral analgesia or that the spread of the drug may be prevented by the presence of fibrous septa or strands in the epidural space. Vandam2 believes that a congenital midline tissue membrane barrier may be present. In this case the radiograph showed that the catheter had not gone into the paravertebral space (figure 1). The possibility of a congenital midline tissue membrane can also be excluded because some of the dye has actually gone into the left side of the epidural space (indicated by the arrow). which indicates that the adhesions are irregular. In view of the history of previous herniorrhaphy under spinal analgesia. it is probable that a post-spinal adhesion had formed in the epidural space which prevented the spread of the lignocaine to the left side.Before the surgical incision was made abdominal muscle relaxation was checked by asking the patient to cough. In retrospect. we feel that there was bulging of the right side of the lower abdomen only which should have suggested the unilateral effect. but. as we had not previously encountered a case of unilateral analgesia. the importance of this sign was not appreciated.,True,U9NsECwAAAAJ:_WP0DvM6eX8C,35,https://www.academia.edu/download/47564301/j.1365-2044.1967.tb02703.x20160727-5252-1x23s5w.pdf,8499629462815485663,/scholar?cites=8499629462815485663,,,0,0,0

This chiasma is located in the short arms of the X and Y. both of which show partial C-banding at meiosis. The in vitro incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine/tritiated thymidine during late S reveals that the non-C-band region of the Y finishes replication later than the C-band positive heterochromatin. During meiosis. the sex bivalent opens out early in pachytene to reveal a single chiasma which persists until late metaphase-I. In surface-spread. silver-stained meiocytes. the sex bivalent morphology changes from a phase of extensive pairing to one which includes a visible chiasma through a brief diffuse stage.

Research into the characteristics of both P- and S-wave Q with reference to gas-hydrates exploration remains in its infancy. Presence of gas-hydrates increases the Q. and this again depends on the nature of distribution and amount of hydrates within the sediments. Thus. estimation of Q provides useful input for both the detection and quantitative assessment of gas-hydrates.

It plays a role in cell proliferation through activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. Curcumin. a diferuloylmethane. is a chemopreventive agent known to inhibit the proliferation of several breast and prostate cancer cell lines. It is possible that the effect of curcumin is mediated through the regulation of cyclin D1. In the present report we show that inhibition of the proliferation of various prostate. breast and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines by curcumin correlated with the down-regulation of the expression of cyclin D1 protein. In comparison. the down-regulation by curcumin of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 was found only in selective cell lines. The suppression of cyclin D1 by curcumin led to inhibition of CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein.

Study of the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-activated cation channel. which is modulated by calcium-calmodulin. indicates that calcium-calmodulin directly binds to a specific domain on the amino terminus of the channel. This binding reduces the effective affinity of the channel for cyclic nucleotides. apparently by acting on channel gating. which is tightly coupled to ligand binding. The data reveal a control mechanism that resembles those underlying the regulation of enzymes by calmodulin.

Recently. alternative splicing. a critical posttranscriptional event. has been shown to regulate HS-inducible expression of HsfA2; however. the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here. we demonstrate a new heat stress-induced splice variant. HsfA2-III. is involved in the self-regulation of HsfA2 transcription in Arabidopsis. HsfA2-III is generated through a cryptic 5′ splice site in the intron. which is activated by severe heat (42°C–45°C). We confirmed that HsfA2-III encodes a small truncated HsfA2 isoform (S-HsfA2) by an immunoblot assay with anti-S-HsfA2 antiserum.

Through the injection of Cas9 protein instead of mRNA into embryos. we observed fewer off-target effects of Cas9 and increased point mutation knock-in efficiency. Large genomic DNA fragment (up to 95 kb) deletion mice were generated for in vivo study of lncRNAs and gene clusters. Site-specific insertion of a 2.7 kb CreERT2 cassette into the mouse Nfatc1 locus allowed labeling and tracing of hair follicle stem cells.

Three flow conditions are considered: a predominantly regular system. a predominantly chaotic system with a few regular islands. and a globally chaotic system devoid of noticeable islands. Chaotic mixing has a strong impact on systems undergoing a single bimolecular reaction A + B → C. Maximum concentration of C occurs in well-mixed chaotic regions; in comparison. little reaction takes place inside poorly mixed non-chaotic islands. Chaotic mixing also has a significant impact on competitive-consecutive reactions A + B → P. B + P → W. The relative amounts of P and W generated by the reactions are strongly affected by the presence of islands.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Ninety percent of cancer‐mediated deaths are due to metastasis of the tumor; however. the mechanisms controlling metastasis remain poorly understood. Thus. no therapy targeting this process has yet been approved. Chemokines and their receptors are mediators of chronic inflammation and have been linked to the metastasis of numerous cancers. More recently. the Cysteine X Cysteine (CXC) chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has emerged as a key mediator of tumor metastasis; therefore. identification of inhibitors of this receptor has the potential to abrogate metastasis. In this report. we demonstrate that acetyl‐11‐keto‐β‐boswellic acid (AKBA). a component of the therapeutic plant Boswellia serrata. can downregulate CXCR4 expression in pancreatic cancer cells.

Dilatation of cerebral arterioles to the endothelium-dependent dilator. acetylcholine (10 μmol/L) was blunted in Mtr/mice compared with Mtr/mice fed the control diet (214 versus 324%; P 0.05). Both Mtr/and Mtr/mice exhibited impaired dilatation of cerebral arterioles to acetylcholine when they were fed the LF diet (122 and 142%. respectively; P 0.01 versus Mtr/mice fed the control diet). Elevated levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide were detected by confocal microscopy in cerebral arterioles of Mtr/mice fed the control diet and in both Mtr/and Mtr/mice fed the LF diet.

In order to molecularly characterize this regenerative effect. we extrapolate the mechanism of action by examining the consequence of GEFT expression in multipotent cell lines capable of differentiating into a number of cell types. including muscle …,True,pUqtLRsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,68,https://mcb.asm.org/content/25/24/11089.short,324357456269041797,/scholar?cites=324357456269041797,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/25/24/11089.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here we develop a synthetic lethal chemical screen in isogenic KRAS-mutant and wild-type cells to identify clinical drug pairs. Our results show that dual inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 and RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) leads to the synergistic effects in KRAS-mutant cancers.

In uncoupled rat heart mitochondria. the kinetic parameters for oxoglutarate oxidation were very close to those found for oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity in extracts of the mitochondria. In particular. Ca2+ greatly diminished the Km for oxoglutarate and the k0.5 value (concentration required for half-maximal effect) for this effect of Ca2+ was close to 1 microM. 2.

115018,Molecular mechanisms for the control of translation by insulin,1997,G Christopher PROUD and M Richard DENTON,328,,2,329-341,Portland Press,Insulin acutely stimulates protein synthesis in mammalian cells. and this involves activation of the process of mRNA translation. mRNA translation is a complex multi-step process mediated by proteins termed translation factors. Several translation factors are regulated in response to insulin. often as a consequence of changes in their states of phosphorylation. The initiation factor eIF4E binds to the cap structure at the 5ʹ-end of the mRNA and mediates assembly of an initiation-factor complex termed eIF4F. Assembly of this complex can be regulated by eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). which inhibit eIF4F complex assembly. Insulin induces phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs. resulting in alleviation of the inhibition. This regulatory mechanism is likely to be especially important for the control of the translation of specific mRNAs whose 5ʹ-untranslated regions (5ʹ-UTRs) are rich in secondary structure.

115062,Multiple signaling pathways involved in the metabolic effects of insulin,1997,S Kelly Moule and Richard M Denton,80,,3,41A-49A,Excerpta Medica,The metabolic effects of insulin are initiated by the binding of insulin to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor within the plasma membrane of muscle and adipose and liver cells. The subsequent activation of the intracellular tyrosine protein kinase activity of the receptor leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins. This gives rise to the activation of Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and hence to the activation of a number of serine/threonine protein kinases. Many of these kinases appear to be arranged in cascades. including a cascade that results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and another that may result in the activation of protein kinase B. leading to the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and the activation of the 70 kiloDalton ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70 S6 kinase).

Most of the cyclic-nucleotide-independent acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase activity in an extract of rat epididymal adipose tissue was evaluated from a Mono Q column by 0.175 M-NaCl at pH 7.4. The activity of the kinase in this fraction (fraction 1) was increased after exposure of intact tissue to insulin. 2.

Evidence is summarized that when hormones and other extracellular stimuli increase the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+. then this results in an increase in the intramitochondrial concentration of Ca2+. In this way. rates of pyruvate oxidation and citric acid cycle flux are increased. and hence there is an increase in NADH supply for the respiratory chain under conditions where there is an enhanced demand for ATP.

Functional regions of DNA. RNA. and protein sequences often exhibit characteristic but subtle motifs; thus. computational discovery of motifs in sequences is a fundamental and much-studied problem. However. most current algorithms do not allow for insertions or deletions (indels) within motifs. and the few that do have other limitations. We present a method. GLAM2 (Gapped Local Alignment of Motifs). for discovering motifs allowing indels in a fully general manner. and a companion method GLAM2SCAN for searching sequence databases using such motifs. glam2 is a generalization of the gapless Gibbs sampling algorithm. It re-discovers variable-width protein motifs from the PROSITE database significantly more accurately than the alternative methods PRATT and SAM-T2K. Furthermore. it usefully refines protein motifs from the ELM database: in some cases. the refined motifs make orders of magnitude fewer overpredictions than the original ELM regular expressions. GLAM2 performs respectably on the BAliBASE multiple alignment benchmark. and may be superior to leading multiple alignment methods for “motif-like” alignments with N- and C-terminal extensions. Finally. we demonstrate the use of GLAM2 to discover protein kinase substrate motifs and a gapped DNA motif for the LIM-only transcriptional regulatory complex: using GLAM2SCAN. we identify promising targets for the latter.

Zinc in excess has significant toxicity to bacteria. and host release of Zn(II) at mucosal surfaces is an important innate defence mechanism. However. the molecular mechanisms by which Zn(II) affords protection have not been defined. We show that in Streptococcus pneumoniae extracellular Zn(II) inhibits the acquisition of the essential metal Mn(II) by competing for binding to the solute binding protein PsaA. We show that. although Mn(II) is the high-affinity substrate for PsaA. Zn(II) can still bind. albeit with a difference in affinity of nearly two orders of magnitude. Despite the difference in metal ion affinities. high-resolution structures of PsaA in complex with Mn(II) or Zn(II) showed almost no difference. However. Zn(II)-PsaA is significantly more thermally stable than Mn(II)-PsaA. suggesting that Zn(II) binding may be irreversible. In vitro growth analyses show that extracellular Zn(II) is able to inhibit Mn(II) intracellular accumulation with little effect on intracellular Zn(II). The phenotype of S. pneumoniae grown at high Zn(II):Mn(II) ratios. i.e. induced Mn(II) starvation. closely mimicked a ΔpsaA mutant. which is unable to accumulate Mn(II).

The structural models have been produced based on very limited sequence similarity. which. in general. cannot yield trustworthy predictions. Recently. the protein structures from three of these five families have been determined. In this report we estimate the quality of the modeling approach by comparing the models with the experimentally determined structures.

Because pH is one of the few consistently reported parameters in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). the isoelectric point (pI) of a protein has been explored as a useful indirect predictor for the optimal choice of range and distribution of the pH sampling in crystallization trials. Results: We have analyzed 9596 unique protein crystal forms from the August 2003 PDB and have found a significant relationship between the calculated pI of successfully crystallized proteins and the difference between pI and reported pH at which they were crystallized.

Appreciating the basis for this substrate specificity is essential for understanding the role of an individual protein kinase in a particular cellular process. The specificity in the cell is determined by a combination of “peptide specificity” of the kinase (the molecular recognition of the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site). substrate recruitment and phosphatase activity. Peptide specificity plays a crucial role and depends on the complementarity between the kinase and the substrate and therefore on their three-dimensional structures.

Melampsora lini. L5 and L6 are two alleles of the L locus that directly recognize variants of the fungal effector AvrL567. In this study. we have investigated the molecular details of this recognition by site-directed mutagenesis of AvrL567 and construction of chimeric L proteins. Single. double and triple mutations of polymorphic residues in a variety of AvrL567 variants showed additive effects on recognition strength. suggesting that multiple contact points are involved in recognition. Domain-swap experiments between L5 and L6 show that specificity differences are determined by their corresponding LRR regions. Most positively selected amino acid sites occur in the N- and C-terminal LRR units. and polymorphisms in the first seven and last four LRR units contribute to recognition specificity of L5 and L6 respectively.

Various pathogens target the signaling molecules and transcriptional regulators acting in the TRIF pathway. thus demonstrating the importance of this pathway in host defense. Indeed. the TRIF pathway contributes to control of both viral and bacterial pathogens through promotion of inflammatory mediators and activation of antimicrobial responses. TRIF signaling also has both protective and pathologic roles in several chronic inflammatory disease conditions. as well as an essential function in wound‐repair processes.

NB-LRR proteins structurally and functionally resemble mammalian Nod-like receptors (NLRs). How NB-LRR and NLR proteins activate defense is poorly understood. The divergently transcribed Arabidopsis R genes. RPS4 (resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 4) and RRS1 (resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum 1). function together to confer recognition of Pseudomonas AvrRps4 and Ralstonia PopP2. RRS1 is the only known recessive NB-LRR R gene and encodes a WRKY DNA binding domain. prompting suggestions that it acts downstream of RPS4 for transcriptional activation of defense genes. We define here the early RRS1-dependent transcriptional changes upon delivery of PopP2 via Pseudomonas type III secretion. The Arabidopsis slh1 (sensitive to low humidity 1) mutant encodes an RRS1 allele (RRS1SLH1) with a single amino acid (leucine) insertion in the WRKY DNA-binding domain. Its poor growth due to constitutive defense activation is rescued at higher temperature. Transcription profiling data indicate that RRS1SLH1-mediated defense activation overlaps substantially with AvrRps4- and PopP2-regulated responses. To better understand the genetic basis of RPS4/RRS1-dependent immunity. we performed a genetic screen to identify suppressor of slh1 immunity (sushi) mutants. We show that many sushi mutants carry mutations in RPS4. suggesting that RPS4 acts downstream or in a complex with RRS1.

Predikin was implemented originally as a web application written in Javascript. Here. we describe a new version of Predikin. completely revised and rewritten as a modular framework that provides multiple enhancements compared with the original. Predikin now consists of two components: (i) PredikinDB. a database of phosphorylation sites that links substrates to kinase sequences and (ii) a Perl module. which provides methods to classify protein kinases. reliably identify substrate-determining residues. generate scoring matrices and score putative phosphorylation sites in query sequences.

Different importin-α paralogs in a single organism are specific for distinct repertoires of cargos. Structural studies revealed that monopartite cNLSs and the C-terminal basic clusters of the bipartite cNLSs bind to the same site on importin-α. termed the major cNLS-binding site. We used an oriented peptide library approach with five degenerate positions to probe the specificity of the major cNLS-binding site in importin-α. We identified the sequences KKKRR.

However. a crystal structure does not define a unique protein–protein interface. and distinguishing a ‘biological interface’ from ‘crystal contacts’ is often not straightforward.

Successful crystallization requires the formation of nuclei and their subsequent growth to crystals of suitable size. Crystal growth generally occurs spontaneously in a supersaturated solution as a result of homogenous nucleation. However. in a typical sparse matrix screening experiment. precipitant and protein concentration are not sampled extensively. and supersaturation conditions suitable for nucleation are often missed.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe tested the effect of nine potential heterogenous nucleating agents on crystallization of ten test proteins in a sparse matrix screen. Several nucleating agents induced crystal formation under conditions where no crystallization occurred in the absence of the nucleating agent. Four nucleating agents: dried seaweed; horse hair; cellulose and hydroxyapatite. had a considerable overall positive effect on crystallization success. This effect was further enhanced when these nucleating agents were used in combination with each other.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results suggest that the addition of heterogeneous nucleating agents increases the chances of crystal formation when using sparse matrix screens.,True,WOQzUzMAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,62,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001091,1612905152614951582,/scholar?cites=1612905152614951582,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001091,0,0,0

In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to this response. we examined the Arabidopsis thaliana NLR protein RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1 (RPP1). which recognizes the Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis effector ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA RECOGNIZED1 (ATR1). Expression of the N-terminus of RPP1. including the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain (“N-TIR”). elicited an effector-independent cell death response. and we used allelic variation in TIR domain sequences to define the key residues that contribute to this phenotype. Further biochemical characterization indicated that cell death induction was correlated with N-TIR domain self-association. In addition. we demonstrated that the nucleotide-binding (NB)-ARC1 region of RPP1 self-associates and plays a critical role in cell death activation. likely by facilitating TIR:TIR interactions. Structural homology modeling of the NB subdomain allowed us to identify a putative oligomerization interface that was shown to influence NB-ARC1 self-association. Significantly. full-length RPP1 exhibited effector-dependent oligomerization and. although mutations at the NB-ARC1 oligomerization interface eliminated cell death induction. RPP1 self-association was unaffected. suggesting that additional regions contribute to oligomerization.

The prediction of these epitopes focuses on the peptide binding process by MHC class II proteins. The ability to account for MHC class II polymorphism is critical for epitope-based vaccine design tools. as different allelic variants can have different peptide repertoires. In addition. the specificity of CD4+ T-cells is often directed to a very limited set of immunodominant peptides in pathogen proteins. The ability to predict what epitopes are most likely to dominate an immune response remains a challenge. We developed the computational tool Predivac to predict CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Predivac can make predictions for 95% of all MHC class II protein variants (allotypes). a substantial advance over other available methods. Predivac bases its prediction on the concept of specificity-determining residues. The performance of the method was assessed both for high-affinity HLA class II peptide binding and CD4+ T-cell epitope prediction. In terms of epitope prediction. Predivac outperformed three available pan-specific approaches (delivering the highest specificity). A central finding was the high accuracy delivered by the method in the identification of immunodominant and promiscuous CD4+ T-cell epitopes. which play an essential role in epitope-based vaccine design.

Importin-α has two separate NLS binding sites (the major and the minor site). both of which recognize positively charged amino acid clusters in NLSs. Little is known about the molecular basis of the unique features of the classical nuclear import pathway in plants. We determined the crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa) importin-α1a at 2-Å resolution.

The development of a commercial GAS vaccine is hampered by the occurrence of many unique GAS serotypes. antigenic variation within the same serotype. differences in serotype geographical distribution. and the production of antibodies cross-reactive with human tissue that may lead to autoimmune disease. Several independent studies have documented a number of GAS cell wall-associated or secreted metabolic enzymes that contain neither N-terminal leader sequences nor C-terminal cell wall anchors. Here. we applied a proteomic analysis of serotype M1T1 GAS cell wall extracts for the purpose of vaccine development.

115189,Essential role of the N-terminal autoregulatory sequence in the regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase,2001,Ian G Jennings and Trazel Teh and Bostjan Kobe,488,FEBS letters,3,196-200,No longer published by Elsevier,Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is activated by its substrate phenylalanine and inhibited by its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). The crystal structure of PAH revealed that the N-terminal sequence of the enzyme (residues 19–29) partially covered the enzyme active site. and suggested its involvement in regulation. We show that the protein lacking this N-terminal sequence does not require activation by phenylalanine. shows an altered structural response to phenylalanine. and is not inhibited by BH4. Our data support the model where the N-terminal sequence of PAH acts as an intrasteric autoregulatory sequence. responsible for transmitting the effect of phenylalanine activation to the active site.,True,WOQzUzMAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,48,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579300024261,13271566306886048865,/scholar?cites=13271566306886048865,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579300024261,0,0,0

Here. we demonstrate that these FHA domains contain 130–140 residues. and are thus considerably larger than previously predicted by sequence comparisons (55–75 residues). In vivo. expression of the proteolytically defined Dun1p FHA domain. but not a fragment containing only the predicted domain boundaries. inhibited the transcriptional induction of repair genes following replication blocks.

These effectors interact in a gene‐for‐gene manner with host‐dominant susceptibilty loci. resulting in disease. However. whilst the requirement of these effectors for infection is clear. their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. A yeast‐two‐hybrid library approach was used to search for wheat proteins that interacted with the necrotrophic effector SnTox3. Using this strategy we indentified an interaction between SnTox3 and the wheat pathogenicity‐related protein TaPR‐1‐1. and confirmed it by in‐planta co‐immunprecipitation. PR‐1 proteins represent a large family (23 in wheat) of proteins that are upregulated early in the defence response; however. their function remains ellusive.

There are two NLS‐binding sites (major and minor) on importin‐α and the major NLS‐binding site is considered to be the primary binding site. Here. we used crystallographic and biochemical methods to investigate the binding between importin‐α and predicted ‘minor site‐specific’ NLSs: four peptide library‐derived peptides. and the NLS from mouse RNA helicase II/Guα. The crystal structures reveal that these atypical NLSs indeed preferentially bind to the minor NLS‐binding site. Unlike previously characterized NLSs. the C‐terminal residues of these NLSs form an α‐helical turn. stabilized by internal H‐bond and cation‐π interactions between the aromatic residues from the NLSs and the positively charged residues from importin‐α.

The T6SS comprises a central tube formed of stacked hexamers of hemolysin co-regulated proteins (Hcp) and terminated by a trimeric valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) component. the cell puncturing device. A contractile tail sheath. formed by the TssB and TssC proteins. surrounds this tube. This syringe-like machine has been compared to an inverted phage. as both Hcp and VgrG share structural homology with tail components of Caudovirales. Here we solved the crystal structure of a tryptophan-substituted double mutant of Hcp1 from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and compared it to the structures of other Hcps. Interestingly. we observed that the purified Hcp native protein is unable to form tubes in vitro. To better understand the rationale for observation. we measured the affinity of Hcp1 hexamers with themselves by surface plasmon resonance. The intra-hexamer interaction is weak. with a KD value of 7.2 µM. However. by engineering double cysteine mutants at defined positions. tubes of Hcp1 gathering up to 15 stacked hexamers formed in oxidative conditions. These results. together with those available in the literature regarding TssB and TssC. suggest that assembly of the T6SS tube differs significantly from that of Sipho- or Myoviridae.,True,WOQzUzMAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086918,11704921755062057216,/scholar?cites=11704921755062057216,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086918,0,0,0

The dynamic reorganization of actin in the cytoskeleton drives processes including changes in cell morphology. cell migration. and phagocytosis. In general. structural proteins of the cytoskeleton bind in the N-terminal region of cortactin and regulatory proteins in the C-terminal region. Previous structural studies have reported an extended conformation for cortactin. It is therefore unclear how cortactin facilitates cross-talk between structural proteins and their regulators. In the study presented here. circular dichroism. chemical cross-linking. and small angle x-ray scattering are used to demonstrate that cortactin adopts a globular conformation. thereby bringing distant parts of the molecule into close proximity. In addition. the actin bundling activity of cortactin is …,True,WOQzUzMAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820461563,11364576738420617814,/scholar?cites=11364576738420617814,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820461563,0,0,0

Comparison of the structure of CPA2 with that of bovine carboxypeptidase A (referred to here as CPA1) reveals that the specificity of the former for larger amino acids probably arises from two amino acid replacements within the binding cavity (Thr268—-Ala and Leu203—-Met). coupled with differences in the positions of conserved residues in a surface loop on one face of the specificity pocket. The position of the reactive-site surface loop may be affected also by a disulfide bridge between Cys210 and Cys244. In this unliganded form of the enzyme. Tyr248 takes up a position interior to the specificity pocket and is distinct from that observed in bovine CPA1.
