Although the hybridization pattern among the strains of the same species does not differ. this pattern is significantly different among the species. The β-tubulin genes in the montium subgroup seem to be organized in a cluster. or in a semi-cluster. or are completely dispersed. The clustered arrangement is found in the North-Oriental sibling species D. auraria. D. triauraria. and D. quadraria. The semi-clustered arrangement. wherein the β1 and β2 genes are located at the same locus while β3 is at a different one. appears in the South-Oriental species D. bicomuta.

1103914,A time-calibrated mitogenome phylogeny of catfish (Teleostei: Siluriformes),2016,Ilias Kappas and Spiros Vittas and Chrysoula N Pantzartzi and Elena Drosopoulou and Zacharias G Scouras,11,PLoS One,12,e0166988,Public Library of Science,A very significant part of the world’s freshwater ichthyofauna is represented by ancient. exceptionally diverse and cosmopolitan ray-finned teleosts of the order Siluriformes. Over the years. catfish have been established as an exemplary model for probing historical biogeography at various scales. Yet. several tantalizing gaps still exist in their phylogenetic history. timeline and mode of diversification. Here. we re-examine the phylogeny of catfish by assembling and analyzing almost all publicly available mitogenome data. We constructed an ingroup matrix of 62 full-length mitogenome sequences from 20 catfish families together with four cypriniform outgroups. spanning 15.557 positions in total. Partitioned maximum likelihood analyses and Bayesian relaxed clock dating using fossil age constraints provide some useful and novel insights into the evolutionary history of this group. Loricarioidei are recovered as the first siluriform group to diversify. rendering Neotropics the cradle of the order. The next deepest clade is the South American Diplomystoidei placed as a sister group to all the remaining Siluroidei. The two multifamilial clades of “Big Asia” and “Big Africa” are also recovered. albeit nodal support for the latter is poor. Within “Big Asia”. Bagridae are clearly polyphyletic.

A classic case of groups for concern are those animals exhibiting temperature-dependent sex-determination (TSD). such as sea turtles. where climate warming may produce single sex populations and hence extinction. We show that. globally. female biased hatchling sex ratios dominate sea turtle populations (exceeding 3:1 in >50% records). which. at-a-glance. reiterates concerns for extinction. However. we also demonstrate that more frequent breeding by males. empirically shown by satellite tracking 23 individuals and supported by a generalized bio-energetic life history model. generates more balanced operational sex ratios (OSRs).

We show that for sea turtles. a major group exhibiting TSD. these concerns are currently unfounded but may become important under extreme climate warming scenarios. We show how highly female-biased sex ratios in developing eggs translate into much more balanced operational sex ratios so that adult male numbers in populations around the world are unlikely to be limiting. Rather than reducing population viability. female-biased offspring sex ratios may. to some extent. help population growth by increasing the number of breeding females and hence egg production. For rookeries across the world (n = 75 sites for seven species). we show that extreme female-biased hatchling sex ratios do not compromise population size and are the norm. with …,True,YFTVVGgAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,77,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2016.2576,18068175291801876875,/scholar?cites=18068175291801876875,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2016.2576,0,0,0

Estimates of the age at maturity for such long-lived species are derived using somatic growth models. which are still lacking for several regions of the world. In the present study. the growth rate of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta in the Mediterranean was investigated using a length-frequency analysis of a dataset collected over a 19 yr period (1990 to 2008). A total of 2255 individuals were measured in the central Mediterranean. with turtle size ranging from 16.8 to 97.5 cm curved carapace length (CCL).

To preserve biodiversity. networks of protected areas have been established worldwide. like the Natura 2000 network across the European Union (EU). Currently. this reserve network consists of more than 26000 sites covering more than 17% of EU terrestrial territory. Its efficiency to mitigate the detrimental effects of land use and climate change remains an open research question. Here. we examined the potential current and future geographical ranges of four birds of prey under scenarios of both land use and climate changes. By using graph theory. we examined how the current Natura 2000 network will perform in regard to the conservation of these species. This approach determines the importance of a site in regard to the total network and its connectivity. We found that sites becoming unsuitable due to climate change are not a random sample of the network. but are less connected and contribute less to the overall connectivity than the average site and thus their loss does not disrupt the full network. Hence. the connectivity of the remaining network changed only slightly from present day conditions. Our findings highlight the need to establish species-specific management plans with flexible conservation strategies ensuring protection under potential future range expansions. Aquila pomarina is predicted to disappear from the southern part of its range and to become restricted to northeastern Europe. Gyps fulvus. Aquila chrysaetos. and Neophron percnopterus are predicted to locally lose some suitable sites; hence. some isolated small populations may become extinct.

Thirty-eight turtles were released from Italian coasts and re-encountered after 1.0-10.9 years in the period 1986-2007. Their mean CCL (curved carapace length) ranged from 32.5 to 82.0 cm and they showed variable growth rates. ranging from 0 to 5.97 cm/yr (mean: 2.5). The association between annual growth rate and three covariates (mean year. mean size and time interval) was investigated through a non-parametric modelling approach. Only mean size showed a clear effect on growth rate. described by a monotonic declining curve. Variability indicates that factors not included in the model. probably individual-related ones. have an important effect on growth rates. Based on the monotonic decreasing growth function which indicates no growth spurt. a von Bertalanffy growth function was used to estimate the time required by turtles to grow within the observed size range. The results indicate that turtles would take 16-28 years to reach 66.5-84.7 cm CCL. the average nesting female sizes observed at the most important Mediterranean nesting sites. which can be considered an approximation of the size at maturity.,True,YFTVVGgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,73,http://scientiamarina.revistas.csic.es/index.php/scientiamarina/article/view/1088,17045937873864840658,/scholar?cites=17045937873864840658,,http://scientiamarina.revistas.csic.es/index.php/scientiamarina/article/download/1088/1131,0,0,0

However. these extinctions do not happen immediately. The biodiversity surplus (extinction debt) declines with some delay through the process of relaxation. Estimating the time constants of relaxation. mainly the expected time to first extinction and the commonly used time for half the extinction debt to be paid off (half-life). is crucial for conservation purposes. Currently. there is no agreement on the rate of relaxation and the factors that it depends on. Here we find that half-life increases with area for all groups examined in a large meta-analysis of extinction data. A common pattern emerges if we use average number of individuals per species before habitat loss as an area index: for mammals. birds. reptiles and plants. the relationship has an exponent close to a half.

Shifts in phenology have the potential to alter ecological interactions. to the detriment of one or more interacting species. Recent models predict that detrimental phenological mismatch may increasingly occur between plants and their pollinators. One way to test this prediction is to examine data from ecological communities that experience large annual weather fluctuations. Taking this approach. we analyzed interactions over a four-year period among 132 plant species and 665 pollinating insect species within a Mediterranean community.

With the identification of 23 DHHC mammalian palmitoyl acyl transferases (PATs). a key question was the nature of substrate‐enzyme specificity for these PATs. Using the acyl‐biotin exchange palmitoylation assay. we compared the substrate specificity of four neuronal PATs. namely DHHC‐3. DHHC‐8. HIP14L (DHHC‐13). and HIP14 (DHHC‐17). Exogenous expression of enzymes and substrates in COS cells reveals that HIP14L and HIP14 modulate huntingtin palmitoylation.

Recent studies reveal that mTORC1 signaling complexes are assembled on lysosomal membranes. but how mTORC1 membrane targeting is regulated is not fully clear. Our examination of palmitoyl-proteomic databases and additional bioinformatic analyses revealed that several mTORC1 proteins are predicted to undergo covalent modification with the lipid palmitate. This process. palmitoylation. can dynamically target proteins to specific membranes but its roles in mTORC1 signaling are not well described. Strikingly. we found that acute pharmacological inhibition of palmitoylation prevents amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation in HEK293T cells and BDNF-dependent mTORC1 activation in hippocampal neurons. We sought to define the molecular basis for this finding and found that the mTORC1 proteins LAMTOR1 and mTOR itself are directly palmitoylated. while several other mTORC1 proteins are not palmitoylated. despite strong bioinformatic prediction. Interestingly. palmitoylation of LAMTOR1. whose anchoring on lysosomal membranes is important for mTORC1 signaling. was rapidly increased prior to mTORC1 activation. In contrast. mTOR palmitoylation was decreased by stimuli that activate mTORC1. These findings reveal that specific key components of the mTOR pathway are dynamically palmitoylated. suggesting that palmitoylation is not merely permissive for …,True,EpnpIqoAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,7,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00115/full,5836930777104094286,/scholar?cites=5836930777104094286,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00115/full,0,0,0

Dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) conveys retrograde pro-degenerative signals to neuronal cell bodies via its downstream target c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). We recently reported that such signals critically require modification of DLK by the fatty acid palmitate. via a process called palmitoylation. Compounds that inhibit DLK palmitoylation could thus reduce neurodegeneration. but identifying such inhibitors requires a suitable assay. Here we report that DLK subcellular localization in non-neuronal cells is highly palmitoylation-dependent and can thus serve as a proxy readout to identify inhibitors of DLK palmitoylation by High Content Screening (HCS).

These diseases are characterized by abnormal dendritic and synaptic architecture. AnkG is a multifunctional scaffold protein with several isoforms: The 480 kDa and 270 kDa isoforms have roles at the axon initial segment and node of Ranvier. but the function of the 190 kDa isoform (AnkG-190) is less well understood. Moreover. AnkG isoforms are regulated by palmitoylation. but palmitoylation of AnkG-190 has not been investigated in neurons. Here we show that AnkG is required for normal dendrite and spine architecture in vivo and that AnkG-190 stabilizes pyramidal neuron dendrites. We found that palmitoylation at Cys70 stabilizes AnkG-190 in spine heads and at dendritic plasma membrane nanodomains.

Across neuronal populations and circuits. a diverse set of synapses is utilized. and they differ in their molecular composition to enable heterogenous connectivity patterns and functions. In addition to pre-and post-synaptic specializations. the synaptic cleft is now understood to be an integral compartment of synapses that contributes to their structural and functional organization. Aiming to map the cleft proteome. this study applied a peroxidase-mediated proximity labeling approach and used the excitatory synaptic cell adhesion protein SynCAM 1 fused to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a reporter in cultured cortical neurons. This reporter marked excitatory synapses as measured by confocal microcopy and was targeted to the edge zone of the synaptic cleft as determined using 3D dSTORM super-resolution imaging. Proximity labeling with a membrane-impermeant biotin-phenol compound restricted labeling to the cell surface. and Label-Free Quantitation (LFQ) mass spectrometry combined with ratiometric HRP tagging of membrane vs. synaptic surface proteins was used to identify the proteomic content of excitatory clefts. Novel cleft candidates were identified. and Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase zeta was selected and successfully validated. This study supports the robust applicability of peroxidase-mediated proximity labeling for synaptic cleft proteomics and its potential for understanding synapse heterogeneity in health and changes in diseases such as psychiatric disorders and addiction.

PlasMACC runs in the image analysis software ImageJ environment. it is user-friendly and freely available.PlasMACC delivers detailed information about intensity …,True,mPV0IHAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,9,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027014002817,14657934238453134305,/scholar?cites=14657934238453134305,,https://research.vumc.nl/files/595320/chapter%203.pdf,0,0,0
