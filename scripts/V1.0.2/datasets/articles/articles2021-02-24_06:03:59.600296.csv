1069036,Localization and activation of glucagon-like peptide-2 receptors on vagal afferents in the rat,2007,David W Nelson and James W Sharp and Mark S Brownfield and Helen E Raybould and Denise M Ney,148,Endocrinology,5,1954-1962,Oxford University Press,Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a nutrient-dependent proglucagon-derived hormone that stimulates intestinal growth through poorly understood paracrine and/or neural pathways. The relationship between GLP-2 action and a vagal pathway is unclear. Our aims were to determine whether 1) the GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) is expressed on vagal afferents by localizing it to the nodose ganglia; 2) exogenous GLP-2 stimulates the vagal afferent pathway by determining immunoreactivity for c-fos protein in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS); and 3) functional ablation of vagal afferents attenuates GLP-2-mediated intestinal growth in rats maintained with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of the rat GLP-2R was raised and characterized. The GLP-2R was localized to vagal afferents in the nodose ganglia and confirmed in enteroendocrine cells. enteric neurons. and nerve fibers …,True,OITXv2wAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,102,https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/148/5/1954/2501504,1025688151518279387,/scholar?cites=1025688151518279387,,https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/148/5/1954/2501504,0,0,0

TPN rats showed small bowel mucosal hyperplasia at 8 h through 7 days after resection. demonstrating that exogenous luminal nutrients are not essential for resection-induced adaptation when residual ileum and colon are present. Increased enterocyte proliferation was a stronger determinant of resection-induced mucosal growth in orally fed animals. whereas decreased apoptosis showed a greater effect in TPN animals.

1069040,Intestinal triacylglycerol synthesis in fat absorption and systemic energy metabolism,2015,Chi-Liang Eric Yen and David W Nelson and Mei-I Yen,56,,3,489-501,Elsevier,The intestine plays a prominent role in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (triglyceride; TAG). Digested dietary TAG is repackaged in the intestine to form the hydrophobic core of chylomicrons. which deliver metabolic fuels. essential fatty acids. and other lipid-soluble nutrients to the peripheral tissues. By controlling the flux of dietary fat into the circulation. intestinal TAG synthesis can greatly impact systemic metabolism. Genes encoding many of the enzymes involved in TAG synthesis have been identified. Among TAG synthesis enzymes. acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)1 are highly expressed in the intestine. Their physiological functions have been examined in the context of whole organisms using genetically engineered mice and. in the case of DGAT1. specific inhibitors.

Here. we report that loss of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan. syndecan-1. causes a profoundly depleted intradermal fat layer. which provides crucial thermogenic insulation for mammals. Mice without syndecan-1 enter torpor upon fasting and show multiple indicators of cold stress. including activation of the stress checkpoint p38α in brown adipose tissue. liver and lung. The metabolic phenotype in mutant mice. including reduced liver glycogen. is rescued by housing at thermoneutrality. suggesting that reduced insulation in cool temperatures underlies the observed phenotypes. We find that syndecan-1. which functions as a facultative lipoprotein uptake receptor. is required for adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Intradermal fat shows highly dynamic differentiation. continuously expanding and involuting in response to hair cycle and ambient temperature. This physiology probably confers a unique role for Sdc1 in this adipocyte sub-type. The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone rescues Sdc1−/− intradermal adipose tissue. placing PPARγ downstream of Sdc1 in triggering adipocyte differentiation.

Animal models of PAE display glucose intolerance and increased adiposity. suggesting that PAE causes metabolic reprogramming. We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of binge PAE. wherein pregnant C57Bl/6J females received 3 g/kg alcohol (ETOH) daily from gestational day 12.5 to 17.5; maltodextrin (MD) and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) served as isocaloric nutritional controls. and sham (H2O) treatment controlled for gavage stress. Our comprehensive assessment quantified body composition. energy expenditure. glucose tolerance. and cardiovascular function in offspring at age 17 weeks.

Reef corals that brood their larvae internally and release mature larvae are believed to show little exchange of larvae over ecological times scales and are therefore expected to recover extremely slowly from large-scale perturbations.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using analysis of ten DNA microsatellite loci. we show that although Great Barrier Reef (GBR) populations of the brooding coral. Seriatopora hystrix. are mostly self-seeded and some populations are highly isolated. a considerable amount of sexual larvae (up to ∼4%) has been exchanged among several reefs 10 s to 100 s km apart over the past few generations. Our results further indicate that S. hystrix is capable of producing asexual propagules with similar long-distance dispersal abilities (∼1.4% of the sampled colonies had a multilocus genotype that also occurred at another sampling location). which may aid in recovery from environmental disturbances.

1069112,A quantitative profiling method of phytohormones and other metabolites applied to barley roots subjected to salinity stress,2017,Da Cao and Adrian Lutz and Camilla Beate Hill and Damien L Callahan and Ute Roessner,7,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,Frontiers,As integral parts of plant signaling networks. phytohormones are involved in the regulation of plant metabolism and growth under adverse environmental conditions. including salinity. Globally. salinity is one of the most severe abiotic stressors with an estimated 800 million hectares of arable land affected. Roots are the first plant organ to sense salinity in the soil. and are the initial site of sodium (Na+) exposure. However. the quantification of phytohormones in roots is challenging. as they are often present at extremely low levels compared to other plant tissues. To overcome this challenge. we developed a high-throughput LC-MS method to quantify ten endogenous phytohormones and their metabolites of diverse chemical classes in roots of barley. This method was validated in a salinity stress experiment with six barley varieties grown hydroponically with and without salinity. In addition to phytohormones. we quantified fifty-two polar primary metabolites. including some phytohormone precursors. using established GC-MS and LC-MS methods. Phytohormone and metabolite data were correlated with physiological measurements including biomass. plant size and chlorophyll content. Root and leaf elemental analysis was performed to determine Na+ exclusion and K+ retention ability in the studied barley varieties.

Acropora millepora. during experimentally-induced bleaching under ecologically relevant conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the states of these two pools. together with physiological parameters assessing the general state of the symbiosis (including photosystem II photochemical efficiency. chlorophyll concentration and Symbiodinium cell densities). The results show that the responses of the two antioxidant systems occur on different timescales: (i) the redox state of the Symbiodinium PQ pool remained stable until twelve days into the experiment. after which there was an abrupt oxidative shift; (ii) by contrast. an oxidative shift of approximately 10% had occurred in the host CoQ pool after 6 days of thermal stress. prior to significant changes in any other physiological parameter measured. Host CoQ pool oxidation is thus an early biomarker of thermal stress in corals. and this antioxidant pool is likely to play a key role in quenching thermally-induced ROS in the coral-algal symbiosis.

For many species the genetic composition is not homogeneous and is determined. in part. by the character of the complex dispersal pathways that connect the populations situated on each coral reef. One method of measuring these genetic connections is to examine the microsatellite composition of individual corals and then statistically compare populations across the region. We use these connection strengths. derived from a population similarity measure. to create complex networks to describe and analyse the genetic exchange of the brooding coral. Seriatopora hystrix. The network. based on determining the putative parental origin of individual coral colonies. involved sampling 2163 colonies from 47 collection sites and examining 10 microsatellites. A dispersal network was created from the genetic distance DLR values that measure the genetic similarity of each population (defined by the local sampling effort) to every other sampled population based on the microsatellite composition. Graph theory methods show that this network exhibited infrequent long distance links and population clustering which is commonly referred to as small world topology.

These microbes may be pathogenic. mutualistic or commensal. Hence. the health and survival of plants is heavily reliant on their ability to perceive different microbial lifestyles and respond appropriately. Emerging research suggests that there is a pivotal role for plant root secondary metabolites in responding to microbial colonization. However. it is largely unknown if plants are able to differentiate between microbes of different lifestyles and respond differently during the earliest stages of pre-symbiosis (i.e. prior to physical contact). By studying. here. plant responses to a range of microbial isolates. we questioned: (1) if individual microbes of different lifestyles and species caused alterations to the plant root metabolome during pre-symbiosis. and (2) if these early metabolite responses correlate with the outcome of the symbiotic interaction in later phases of colonization.

However. many species produce similar colours using self-synthesised pteridine pigments. A compelling but untested hypothesis is that pteridines compensate for low environmental availability of carotenoids because it is metabolically cheaper to synthesise pteridines than to acquire and sequester carotenoids. Based on a phylogenetic comparative analysis of 11 pigment concentrations in skin tissue of agamid lizards. we show that pteridine concentrations are higher and carotenoid concentrations lower in less productive environments. Both carotenoid and pteridine pigments were present in all species. but only pteridine concentrations explained colour variation among species. Furthermore. pigment concentrations were uncorrelated with indices of sexual selection. These results suggest that variation among species in pteridine synthesis compensates for environmental availability of carotenoids and challenge the paradigm of honest carotenoid signalling in vertebrates with complex colour production mechanisms.,True,gaHMdO8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.161132817.77514172,,,,https://www.authorea.com/doi/pdf/10.22541/au.161132817.77514172,0,0,0

This poses a serious threat to public health nowadays. In addition. traditional pathogen-based detection methods may not be able to report an infection from an unknown type or a subtype of virus if its nucleotide sequence is not known. Because of these factors. targeting host microRNA signatures may be an alternative to classify infections and distinguish types of pathogens as microRNAs are produced in humans shortly after infection. Although this approach is in its infant stage. there is an urgent need to develop a rapid reporter assay for microRNA for disease control and prevention.

In this work we report on the sat encoded dissimilatory ATP sulfurylase from the sulfur-oxidizing purple sulfur bacterium Allochromatium vinosum. In this organism. the sat gene is located in one operon and co-transcribed with the aprMBA genes for membrane-bound APS reductase. Like APS reductase. Sat is dispensible for growth on reduced sulfur compounds due to the presence of an alternate. so far unidentified sulfite-oxidizing pathway in A. vinosum. Sulfate assimilation also proceeds independently of Sat by a separate pathway involving a cysDN-encoded assimilatory ATP sulfurylase. We produced the purple bacterial sat-encoded ATP sulfurylase as a recombinant protein in E. coli. determined crucial kinetic parameters and obtained a crystal structure in an open state with a ligand-free active site. By comparison with several known structures of the ATPS-APS complex in the closed state a scenario about substrate-induced conformational changes was worked out.

Cancer cells can process nutrient molecules differently from normal cells and use it to overcome stress imposed on them by various therapies. This metabolic conversion is controlled by specific genetic mutations that are associated with activation of oncogenes and loss of tumour suppressor proteins. Understanding these processes is important as it can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that can predict the aggressiveness of the disease and its response to therapy. and even more importantly. to the development of novel therapeutics. A classic tumour in this respect is clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Diethylphosphoryl oximes (DEP-OX) that were generated in situ were demonstrated in the past to be unstable. yet were more potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than the parent OPs. In view of the inconsistencies among reported results. and the potential toxicity of POXs. it seemed important to characterize authentic DEP-OXs. and to evaluate their interference with reactivation of diethylphosphoryl-ChE (DEP-ChE) conjugates.

1069285,Combined effect of organophosphorus hydrolase and oxime on the reactivation rate of diethylphosphoryl-acetylcholinesterase conjugates,1998,Yacov Ashani and Haim Leader and Nathan Rothschild and Carlos Dosoretz,55,Biochemical pharmacology,2,159-168,Elsevier,Reactivation of inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is essential for rapid recovery after organophosphate (OP) poisoning. However. following administration of an oxime reactivator. such as pralidoxime mesylate (P2S). in patients poisoned with certain diethylphosphorothioate pesticides. no reactivation is observed. presumably due to reinhibition by circulating anti-cholinesterase OPs. Pretreatment alone with organophosphorus hydrolases (OPH) that are capable of rapidly hydrolyzing OPs was demonstrated. in animals. to confer significant protection against OP toxicity. One strategy to augment the potentially therapeutic scope of OPHs is a combined post-exposure treatment consisting of a drug(s) commonly used against OP toxicity and a suitable hydrolase. In this study. we examined the in vitro ability of OPH from Pseudomonas sp. (OPHps) to prevent reinhibition of P2S-reactivated AChE by excess OPs.

Enzyme entrapment was studied in the range of 0.01–0.25 U. and compared with the activity of the free. non-immobilized enzyme. The reaction catalyzed by the entrapped enzyme was almost two orders of magnitude slower than with the free enzyme. Addition of surfactants slightly increased the parathion hydrolysis rate. and the addition of ethanol almost doubled it. However. this increase of reaction rate cannot by itself explain the decrease of activity. suggesting that irreversible damage to the enzyme during gelation. rather than diffusion limitation throughout the gel-glass structure. is the main cause for the decrease of activity. Regardless of damage to the enzyme during gelation. the remaining entrapped active fraction displayed stability even after eleven days. during successive cycles …,True,-4yuXVAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,35,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00401877,5750213321962006857,/scholar?cites=5750213321962006857,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49472480/bf0040187720161009-3952-1i0q673.pdf,0,0,0

Boston. MA,Several quaternary oxime reactivators of phosphorylated cholinesterases (ChE) are effective antidotes in organophosphates (OP) toxicity. Reactivation of OP-inhibited ChEs probably proceeds via nucleophilic displacement which causes the accumulation of a phosphorylated oxime (POX) intermediate. Several POXs that were generated in situ over the last 4 decades from a variety of oxime antidotes and OPs. have been demonstrated to be more potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than the parent OPs (1. 2). Their rapid removal is expected to improve therapeutic management of OP toxicity by oxime antidotes (1).

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits. The present work aims to explore. in studies published during the last five years. the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from olive oil on different cancer or CVD aspects. in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.

Healthy dietary patterns. with abundant fruit and vegetable consumption. may prevent the onset of these risk factors due to the presence of phytochemical compounds. Strawberries are known for their high content of polyphenols; among them. flavonoids are the major constituents. and it is presumed that they are responsible for the biological activity of the fruit. Nevertheless. there are only a few studies that actually evaluate the effects of different fractions isolated from strawberries.

The results showed that the synergic topical use of strawberry and Coenzyme Q 10 provided a significant (p< 0.05) photoprotective effect. reducing cell death and ROS. increasing antioxidant defense. lowering inflammatory markers. and improving mitochondrial functionality. The obtained results suggest the use of strawberry-based formulations as an innovative. natural. and useful tool for the prevention of UVA exposure-induced skin diseases in order to decrease or substitute the amount of synthetic sunscreen agents.

It is the handling of fat and/or excessive energy intake that encompasses the linkage of inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism to the deleterious effects associated with the continuous excess of food ingestion. The roles of cytokines and insulin resistance in excessive energy intake have been studied extensively. Tobacco use and obesity accompanied by an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are the main factors that underlie noncommunicable diseases. The implication is that the management of energy or food intake. which is the main role of mitochondria. is involved in the most common diseases. In this study. we highlight the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the mutual relationships between causative conditions. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that fuse and divide in response to environmental stimuli. developmental status. and energy requirements. These organelles act to supply the cell with ATP and to synthesise key molecules in the processes of inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism.

The paraoxonases (PON) are a group of antioxidant enzymes. termed PON1. PON2. and PON3 that protect lipoproteins and cells from peroxidation and. as such. may be involved in protection against the atherosclerosis process. PON1 inhibits the production of chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in endothelial cells incubated with oxidized lipoproteins. PON1 and CCL2 are ubiquitously distributed in tissues. and this suggests a joint localization and combined systemic effect. The aim of the present study has been to analyze the quantitative immunohistochemical localization of PON1. PON3. CCL2 and CCL2 receptors in a series of patients with severe PAD. Portions of femoral and/or popliteal arteries from 66 patients with PAD were obtained during surgical procedures for infra-inguinal limb revascularization. We used eight normal arteries from donors as controls. PON1 and PON3. CCL2 and the chemokine-binding protein 2. and Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor. were increased in PAD patients. There were no significant changes in C–C chemokine receptor type 2.

In turn. inflammation. oxidation. and metabolism are associated with the course of these diseases; mitochondrial dysfunction seems to be at the crossroads of mutual relationships. The migration of immune cells during inflammation is governed by the interaction between chemokines and chemokine receptors. Chemokines. especially C-C-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). have a variety of additional functions that are involved in the maintenance of normal metabolism. It is our hypothesis that a ubiquitous and continuous secretion of CCL2 may represent an animal model of low-grade chronic inflammation that. in the presence of an energy surplus. could help to ascertain the afore-mentioned relationships and/or to search for specific therapeutic approaches.

Metformin is a strong candidate to be incorporated in alternative therapeutic approaches. We used a targeted metabolomic approach to assess changes related to the multi-faceted metabolic disturbances provoked by HFD. We evaluated the protective effects of metformin and explored how pro-inflammatory and metabolic changes respond when mice rendered obese. glucose-intolerant and hyperlipidemic were switched to diet reversal with or without metformin. Mice treated with metformin and diet-reversal showed a dramatically improved protection against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. a beneficial effect that was accompanied by a lowering of liver-infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages and lower release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metformin combined with diet reversal promoted effective weight loss along with better glucose control. lowered levels of circulating cholesterol and triglycerides. and reduced adipose tissue content. Our findings underscored the ability of metformin to target the contribution of branched chain amino acids to adipose tissue metabolism while suppressing mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis in hepatic tissue. The relationship between adipose tissue and liver might provide clinical potential for combining metformin and dietary modifications to protect against the metabolic damage occurring upon excessive dietary fat intake.

The activity of this enzyme has been shown to be decreased in breast cancer (BC) patients. The aims of our study were to investigate the changes produced by radiotherapy (RT) on activity and concentration of serum PON1 in BC patients. and to evaluate the observed variations in relation to clinical and pathological characteristics of patients and tumors. and the response to treatment. We studied 200 women with BC who were scheduled to receive RT following excision of the tumor. Blood for analyses was obtained before and after the irradiation procedure. The control group was composed of 200 healthy women. Relative to control. BC patients had significantly lower serum PON1 activities pre-RT. while PON1 concentrations were at similar levels. RT was associated with a significant increase in serum PON1 activities and concentrations. We observed significant differences in serum PON1 concentrations post-RT between patients with luminal A or luminal B tumors. Serum PON1 concentration post-RT was markedly lower in BC patients with metastases. We conclude that benefit from RT accrues to the BC patients not only through its direct effect on cancer cells but also indirectly by improving the organism’s anti-oxidant defense mechanisms.

Lifestyle and pharmacological treatments are usually prescribed for prevention. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol). as an anti-atherogenic agent. is being taken into consideration due to its potential beneficial effects in lipid metabolism and its anti-inflammatory potency. To assess the effects of vitamin D 3 in the postprandial lipid profile in obese. vitamin D-deficient women. a non-targeted lipidomics approach using liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time-of flight mass spectrometer was used to identify and quantitate a wide-range of circulating lipid species. including diglycerides. lysophosphatidylcholines. phosphatidylcholines. phosphatidylethanolamines. sphingomyelins and triglycerides. The most important changes were found in plasmatic sphingomyelin levels. which experience a decrease after vitamin D 3 intake.

Spain,2020,Simona Iftimie and Ana F López-Azcona and Manuel Vicente-Miralles and Ramon Descarrega-Reina and Anna Hernández-Aguilera and Francesc Riu and Josep M Simó and Pedro Garrido and Jorge Joven and Jordi Camps and Antoni Castro,15,PloS one,9,e0234452,Public Library of Science,Spain is one of the countries that has suffered the most from the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). the strain that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However. there is a lack of information on the characteristics of this disease in the Spanish population. The objective of this study has been to characterize our patients from an epidemiological point of view and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality in our geographical area. We performed a prospective. longitudinal study on 188 hospitalized cases of SARS-Cov-2 infection in Hospital Universitari de Sant Joan. in Reus. Spain. admitted between 15th March 2020 and 30th April 2020. We recorded demographic data. signs and symptoms and comorbidities. We also calculated the Charlson and McCabe indices. A total of 43 deaths occurred during the study period. Deceased patients were older than the survivors (77.7 ± 13.1 vs. 62.8 ± 18.4 years; p < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that fever. pneumonia. acute respiratory distress syndrome. diabetes mellitus and cancer were the variables that showed independent and statistically significant associations with mortality. The Charlson index was more efficient than the McCabe index in discriminating between deceased and survivors. This is one of the first studies to describe the factors associated with mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. and one of the few in the Mediterranean area. We identified the main factors independently associated with mortality in our population.

The chain collapse that accompanies protein folding involves extrusion of water from the nonpolar core.

However. the debate continues as to whether the core of the collapsed intermediate state is hydrated and. if so. what the dynamic nature of this water is. A key challenge is that protein hydration dynamics is significantly heterogeneous. yet suitable experimental techniques for measuring hydration dynamics with site-specificity are lacking.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Recent evidence suggests that proteins at equilibrium can exist in a manifold of conformational substates. and that these substates play important roles in protein function. Therefore. there is great interest in identifying regions in proteins that are in conformational exchange. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin‐labeled proteins containing the nitroxide side chain (R1) often consist of two (or more) components that may arise from slow exchange between conformational substates (lifetimes > 100 ns). However. crystal structures of proteins containing R1 have shown that multicomponent spectra can also arise from equilibria between rotamers of the side chain itself. In this report. it is shown that these scenarios can be distinguished by the response of the system to solvent perturbation with stabilizing osmolytes such as sucrose.

The purpose of the present study was to explore this potential using 38 singly spin-labeled mutants of myoglobin distributed throughout the sequence. Correlation of the EPR spectra with protein structure provides new evidence that the site-dependent variation in line shape. and hence motion of the spin label. is due largely to differences in mobility of the helical backbone in the ns time range. Fluctuations between conformational substates. typically in the μs–ms time range. are slow on the EPR time scale. and the spectra provide a snapshot of conformational equilibria frozen in time as revealed by multiple components in the spectra.

The most popular strategy. double electron–electron resonance (DEER). is carried out at cryogenic temperatures (50–80 K) to increase the short spin–spin relaxation time (T2) upon which the technique relies. A challenge is to measure long-range distances (20–60 Å) in proteins near physiological temperatures. Toward this goal we are investigating an alternative approach based on the distance-dependent enhancement of spin–lattice relaxation rate (T1–1) of a nitroxide spin label by a paramagnetic metal.

1069458,Mapping molecular flexibility of spin labeled proteins on the nanosecond and longer time scales via CW lineshape analysis and osmolyte-perturbation EPR,2012,Carlos Javier López,,,,,,Proteins in solution exhibit structural fluctuations on a wide range of characteristic time scales. from fast backbone motions in the picosecond to nanosecond range to slow conformational exchange in the microsecond to millisecond time domain.  These motions can play important roles in function. thus elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying function requires experimental techniques capable of measuring motions on these time scales. Site directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy (SDSL-EPR) has been established as an important tool in protein science for studying structure. identifying dynamically disordered sequences. and monitoring conformational switching triggered by chemical or physical signals in soluble and membrane-bound proteins. However. it remains to be investigated whether fast backbone motions contribute to the spectra of the spin label side chain R1 in well-ordered sequences of regular secondary structure. and how slow conformational exchange between substates can be detected at equilibrium; these are goals of this dissertation. The results from this work support a model wherein variations in the EPR spectral lineshape of R1-labeled proteins measures the amplitude of fast but constrained backbone fluctuations on the nanosecond time scale. and show that these motions are correlated with the local packing density. In addition. it is shown that osmolyte perturbation SDSL (OP-SDSL) can be used to identify conformational equilibria between substates that have characteristic lifetimes > 100 ns.

The novel 2019 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The virus specific molecular interaction with the host cell represents a promising therapeutic target for identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The repurposing of drugs can provide a rapid and potential cure towards exponentially expanding COVID-19. Thereto. high throughput virtual screening approach was used to investigate FDA approved LOPAC library drugs against both the S-RBD and ACE2 host cell receptor.

The CLPs share significant sequence and structural similarities with active chitinases. however. do not display chitinase activity. Some of these proteins are reported to have specific functions and carbohydrate binding property. In the present study. we report a novel chitinase like lectin (TCLL) from Tamarindus indica. The crystal structures of native TCLL and its complex with N-acetyl glucosamine were determined. Similar to the other CLPs of the GH18 members. TCLL lacks chitinase activity due to mutations of key active site residues. Comparison of TCLL with chitinases and other chitin binding CLPs shows that TCLL has substitution of some chitin binding site residues and more open binding cleft due to major differences in the loop region. Interestingly. the biochemical studies suggest that TCLL is an N-acetyl glucosamine specific chi-lectin. which is further confirmed by the complex structure of TCLL with N-acetyl glucosamine complex. TCLL has two distinct N-acetyl glucosamine binding sites S1 and S2 that contain similar polar residues. although interaction pattern with N-acetyl glucosamine varies extensively among them. Moreover. TCLL structure depicts that how plants utilize existing structural scaffolds ingenuously to attain new functions.

Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies provide structural insights into key interactions between capsid protein (CP) and trans-membrane glycoproteins E1 and E2.

This delocalized LMCT excited state decays to a second excited state with two CN-stretch absorption bands.

Strong coherent coupling occurs between certain types of excitons but is missing between other types of excitons because the distinctive nature of excitons results in different spatial overlap.

The samples grown by Sb incorporation and Sb pre-deposition methods display high room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) intensity at extended long wavelength. This result is explained by the surfactant effects of Sb during the growth of GaInAs/GaAs QW systems. An abnormal S-shaped temperature dependence of the PL peak position is found in the In 0.42 Ga 0.58 As/GaAs triple QWs sample grown with Sb pre-deposition. By investigating the transmission electron microscope images and time-resolved PL spectra. it is found that the S-shaped temperature dependence of the PL peak position originates from the exciton localization effect brought by the Sb-rich clusters on the QW interface.,True,b72i4MEAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,8,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0256-307X/22/8/073/meta,541198929800841480,/scholar?cites=541198929800841480,,http://cpl.iphy.ac.cn/EN/article/downloadArticleFile.do?attachType=PDF&id=35125,0,0,0

While a very long spin relaxation lifetime of a few nanoseconds at low temperature is observed under non-resonant excitation. it decreases dramatically under resonant excitation.

The measured radiative recombination lifetimes of different Te bound exciton states are quite different. varying from a few nanoseconds to tens of nanosecond.

It reaches maximum (∼40ns) for the Te4 bound states at x=0.155. The increase of the exciton lifetime is attributed to the increasing exciton localization effect caused by larger localization potential. In the large Te composition range (x>0.155). the exciton recombination lifetime decreases monotonically with Te composition.

Methodology/Principal Findings Its genome consists of four replicons (two chromosomes and two plasmids) containing a total of 6631 protein coding genes. Comparative analysis identified 1910 core genes common to the four genomes compared (C. necator JMP134. C. necator H16. C. metallidurans CH34. R. solanacearum GMI1000). Although secondary chromosomes found in the Cupriavidus. Ralstonia. and Burkholderia lineages are all derived from plasmids. analyses of the plasmid partition proteins located on those chromosomes indicate that different plasmids gave rise to the secondary chromosomes in each lineage.

This strain also shows additional metabolic capabilities towards alicyclic compounds and the potential for catabolism of almost all proteinogenic amino acids.

Improvement of plant salt-stress tolerance using Plant-Growth Promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has arisen as a promising strategy to help overcome this limitation. However. the molecular and biochemical mechanisms controlling PGPR/plant interactions under salt-stress remain unclear. The main objective of this study was to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying salt-stress tolerance enhancement in the salt-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants. when inoculated with the well-known PGPR strain Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. To tackle this. different life history traits. together with the spatiotemporal accumulation patterns for key metabolites and salt-stress related transcripts. were analyzed in inoculated plants under short and long-term salt-stress. Inoculated plants displayed faster recovery and increased tolerance after sustained salt-stress. PsJN treatment accelerated the accumulation of proline and transcription of genes related to ABA signaling (RD29A and RD29B). ROS scavenging (APX2) and detoxification (GLYI7). and down-regulated the expression of LOX2 (related to JA biosynthesis). Among the general transcriptional effects of this bacterium. the expression pattern of important ion-homeostasis related genes was altered after short and long-term stress (AKT1. HKT1.

The ability to degrade specific aromatic components of root exudates could thus provide versatile catabolic bacteria with an advantage for rhizosphere colonization and growth. In this work. Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134. a well-known aromatic compound degrader (including the herbicide 2.4-dichlorophenoxyacetate. 2.4-D). was shown to stably colonize Arabidopsis thaliana and Acacia caven plants both at the rhizoplane and endorhizosphere levels and to use root exudates as a sole carbon and energy source.

Catabolism of 3-CB is achieved via the expression of the chromosomally encoded benABCD genes and the tfd genes from plasmid pJP4. Since passive diffusion of benzoic acid derivatives at physiological pH is negligible. the uptake of this compound should be facilitated by a transport system. However. no transporter has so far been described to perform this function. and identification of chloroaromatic compound transporters has been limited. In this work. uptake experiments using 3-[ring-UL-14C]CB showed an inducible transport system in strain JMP134. whose expression is activated by 3-CB and benzoate.

Two of these. MALAT1 and Menβ. generate a tRNA-like small RNA in addition to the mature lncRNA. The stability of these tRNA-like small RNAs and bona fide tRNAs is monitored by the CCA-adding enzyme. Whereas CCA is added to stable tRNAs and tRNA-like transcripts. a second CCA repeat is added to certain unstable transcripts to initiate their degradation. Here. we characterize how these two scenarios are distinguished. Following the first CCA addition cycle. nucleotide binding to the active site triggers a clockwise screw motion. producing torque on the RNA.

However. DNA is not conventionally known to spontaneously enter into cells or to have any intrinsic biological activity. We hypothesized that cellular entry and acquisition of biological properties are functions of the size of DNA. To test this hypothesis. we generated small DNA fragments by sonicating high molecular weight DNA (HMW DNA) to mimic circulating cfDNA. Sonication of HMW DNA isolated from cancerous and non-cancerous human cells. bacteria and plant generated fragments 300–3000 bp in size which are similar to that reported for circulating cfDNA.

A chlorpromazine stimulatory effect upon iron uptake from 55Fe-citrate and 55Fe-transferrin by cortical synaptosome preparations of rats was recently demonstrated. The present work extends this study to other neuroleptic drugs such as thioridazine. haloperidol. clozapine and fluphenazine. Like chlorpromazine. thioridazine showed a stimulatory effect upon iron uptake from both iron donors whereas fluphenazine highly increased uptake from 55Fe-citrate but not from 55Fe-transferrin. Haloperidol and clozapine had no effect. Stimulation of iron uptake by neuroleptics is probably related to their property of calmodulin antagonism. since calmidazolium also stimulated synaptosomal iron uptake from both donors.

InTech,,61-72,,Nitric oxide has been found to play an important role as a signal molecule in many parts of the organism as well as a cytotocic effector molecule of nonspecific immune response. Nitric oxide is very important functions both in helminthes and mammalian hosts. Nitric oxide may react with proteins and nucleic acids. In addition to binding to heme groups. eg of guanylate cyclase. hemoglobin. and cytochrome C oxidase. NO may react with nucleophilic centers like sulfur. nitrogen. oxygen and aromatic carbons. The prime target for covalent binding of NO to a functional groups in proteins under physiological condition in the presence of oxygen are SH groups. The intra-mitochondrial reaction of NO with superoxide anion yields peroxynitrite. which irreversibly modifies susceptible targets within the mitochondria. inducing oxidative and/or nitrative stresses. The signal molecule of NO is synthesized by constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS). The killer molecule NO is synthesized by inducible NOS (iNOS). There is no signal or killer NO–it depends on the environments and partners involved–be very careful in that. Yes. the production is regulated in different ways. Inducible NOS is induced by numerous inflammatory stimuli. including endotoxin. cytokines and excretory/secretory products (ESP) of helminthes. ESP directly interact with the immune system and modulate host immunity. Nitric oxide is a highly reactive and unstable free radical gas that is produced by oxidation of L-arginine by oxygen and NADPH as electron donor to citrulline mediated by a family of homodimer named nitric oxide synthase.

Resveratrol. having robust anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. has a high potential to treat or prevent the pathogenesis of diseases. This study was conducted to reveal the relationship between diabetes-induced oxidative stress and tissue inflammation with changes in main enzymatic antioxidants (cat. sod. gpx. and gst) and the components of the insulin signaling pathway (insulin Rβ. irs-1. pi3k. akt. mtor) in kidney tissues. Additionally. the effects of resveratrol on these parameters were evaluated. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups;(1) control/vehicle;(2) control/20 mg/kg resveratrol;(3) diabetic/vehicle;(4) diabetic/20 mg/kg resveratrol. Gene and protein expressions of antioxidant enzymes and insulin signaling elements were evaluated in renal tissues. Results: Downregulation of antioxidant enzymes’ gene expression in the kidney tissues of diabetic rats was demonstrated and this situation was devoted partially to the reduced gene expression of nfκb. Moreover. the components of renal insulin signaling elements were upregulated at both gene and protein expression levels in diabetic rats. and resveratrol treatment decreased this sensitization towards the control state. Conclusion: Resveratrol partially improved diabetes-induced renal oxidative stress and inflammation due to healing action on renal antioxidant enzymes and insulin signaling pathway components.

1070031,Antioxidants and regulation of antioxidant enzymes by cellular redox status,2010,Gökhan Sadi and Özlem Sadi,,,,,Yayıncı Yok,It has been well known that free radicals have numerous detrimental effects in both in vitro and in vivo in biological systems because of their unavoidable and tremendous reactivity against biological macromolecules especially proteins. carbohydrates and nucleic acids. They are produced in the biological systems continuously by various mechanisms and eliminated by cellular antioxidant systems. If not eliminated sufficiently. or there is a disturbance in their neutralization. inevitable cellular damage may occur. Activities or the presence of antioxidant enzymes in the cells are under strong regulation with transcriptional. translational and post translational mechanisms as a consequence of changes in cellular redox potential. Redox sensitive metabolic enzymes or proteins; such as protein phosphatases. NF-?B and AP-1. are capable of sensing the oxidant signals by reversible oxidation of their regulatory units which cause them to transduce the signal and adjust the cellular antioxidant metabolism. Redox sensitive proteins execute their functions via kinases. phosphatases. and transcription factors influencing the steady state levels of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore. cells may sense. transduce. and translate the oxidant signals into appropriate cellular responses depending on the cellular redox state.

Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a retrovirus that has been the subject of intense debate since its detection in samples from humans with prostate cancer (PC) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Controversy has arisen from the failure of some studies to detect XMRV in PC or CFS patients and from inconsistent detection of XMRV in healthy controls. Here we demonstrate that Taqman PCR primers previously described as XMRV-specific can amplify common murine endogenous viral sequences from mouse suggesting that mouse DNA can contaminate patient samples and confound specific XMRV detection. To consider the provenance of XMRV we sequenced XMRV from the cell line 22Rv1. which is infected with an MLV-X that is indistinguishable from patient derived XMRV. Bayesian phylogenies clearly show that XMRV sequences reportedly derived from unlinked patients form a monophyletic clade with interspersed 22Rv1 clones (posterior probability >0.99). The cell line-derived sequences are ancestral to the patient-derived sequences (posterior probability >0.99). Furthermore. pol sequences apparently amplified from PC patient material (VP29 and VP184) are recombinants of XMRV and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) a virus with an envelope that lacks tropism for human cells.

HIV also causes specific qualitative changes to the repertoire including an altered distribution of V gene usage. depletion of public TCR sequences and disruption of TCR networks. Short term anti-retroviral therapy has little impact on most of the global damage to repertoire structure. but is accompanied by rapid changes in the abundance of many individual TCR sequences. decreases in abundance of the most common sequences. and decreases in the majority of HIV-associated CDR3 sequences. Thus high-throughput repertoire sequencing of small blood samples that are easy to take. store and process can shed light on various aspects of the T-cell immune compartment and stands to offer insights into patient stratification and immune reconstitution.,True,gnbtFO0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,50,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00644/full,6430059289901798243,/scholar?cites=6430059289901798243,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00644/full,0,0,0

Little is known about whether these outbreaks are associated with a single or multiple viral genotypes and whether new mutations rapidly accumulate during transmission. Here. we take advantage of a well-characterized population cohort in Guinea-Bissau and produce a unique set of 23 full-length genome sequences. collected over 7 months from eight households. Comparative sequence analysis reveals that four distinct genotypes cocirculated among the population. three of which were present during the first week of the outbreak. although no patients were coinfected. which indicates that exposure to infectious virus from multiple sources is common during VZV outbreaks.

XMRV (Xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus). in chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer. though whether as causative agent or opportunistic infection is unclear. It has also been suggested that the virus can be found circulating amongst the general population. The discovery has been controversial. with conflicting results from attempts to reproduce the original studies.   Methodology/Principal Findings We extracted peripheral blood DNA from a cohort of 540 HIV-1-positive patients (approximately 20% of whom have never been on anti-retroviral treatment) and determined the presence of XMRV and related viruses using TaqMan PCR. While we were able to amplify as few as 5 copies of positive control DNA. we did not find any positive samples in the patient cohort.   Conclusions/Significance In view of these negative findings in this highly susceptible group. we conclude that it is unlikely that XMRV or related viruses are circulating at a significant level. if at all. in HIV-1-positive patients in London or in the general population.,True,gnbtFO0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018096,10730205533100933380,/scholar?cites=10730205533100933380,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018096,0,0,0

1070072,Route of entry-dependent blocks to retroviral replication,2008,Eleanor Ruth Gray,,,,,,Restriction factors are endogenous cellular proteins that block retroviral replication at specific points in the life cycle. Those identified so far include Fvl. Trim5a and TrimCyp. Their characterisation has extended knowledge of retroviral and cellular functions. and has added a new branch to innate immunity. Retroviral susceptibility to Fvl and Trim5a is determined by its capsid. and is manifested in a pre- (Trim5a. TrimCyp) or post- (Fvl) reverse transcription block to replication. Other blocks to replication have been postulated. For example. a novel anti-viral factor. Lv2. is thought to block replication of several primary isolates of HIV-2 in some cell lines. Knowledge of the early steps of virus replication. between entry and nuclear import. is critical to understanding restriction. The intention of the studies described in this thesis was to determine whether alternative routes of virus trafficking might affect susceptibility to Fvl and Trim5a. as well as to the putative Lv2. A system of two receptors was used. Tva800 and Tva950 both permit entry via ASLV envelope protein. but take the virus into the cell by two different endocytic mechanisms. The pathways traversed after binding to Tva800 and Tva950 were investigated and shown not to reroute virions around restriction mediated by Fvl and Trim5a. When virus titration curves were analysed. a distinctive pattern emerged suggesting that entry via Tva800. but not Tva950. requires engagement of more than one receptor- envelope pair. The block to replication caused by the putative factor Lv2 was also analysed.

In addition. we assessed the effects of zerumbone on cell proliferation activity of crypts by counting silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions protein (AgNORs) in colonic cryptal cell nuclei. To induce ACF rats were given three weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight). They were also fed the experimental diet containing 0.01% or 0.05% zerumbone for 5 weeks. starting one week before the first dosing of AOM.

Pakistani population has a very rich anthrogeneological background with waves of migration from neighboring regions. Incidence rates of breast and ovarian cancer in Pakistan are on such a rapid rise that it is necessary to check the contributory factors. genetic and nongenetic. An insight into the prevalence data emphasizes the formulation of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 database for the Pakistani population. Method. In this study conducted by authors. data from diagnosed cases of both sporadic and inherited female breast and ovarian cancer cases was gathered after performing molecular genetic analysis by screening for alterations in the coding sequence of the BRCA gene. The region of interest was analyzed by the aid of various molecular biology tools such as automated DNA sequencer. Bioinformatics software was used to interpret the results. and database was prepared. Results. Mutational screening of the exons in all the samples of our study group did not reveal any pathogenic mutation. These results along with the results of the previous Pakistani studies for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were summed up to prepare a Pakistani database. Percentage involvement of these genes was estimated. Nine percent of these cancers show alterations in BRCA1 gene while 3 percent have shown BRCA2 variants. The remaining 88 percent of breast and ovarian cancers can be attributed to the involvement of other genes.,True,4v2i06MAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,30,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2011/632870/abs/,5391118494203405806,/scholar?cites=5391118494203405806,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2011/632870/abs/,0,0,0

Rawalpindi. and Centre forResearch in Experimental and Applied Medicine (CREAM). Army Medical College. Rawalpindi. Pakistanfrom June 2011-June 2012. We determined the levels of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). Total LeukocyteCount (TLC). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) in 72 patients withType 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and 40 healthy controls. The levels were correlated with age. durationof the disease. Body Mass Index (BMI). lipid profile and insulin resistance.Results: ESR. TLC. IL-6 and TNF-α were found to be significantly higher in T2DM patients. There wasalso statistically significant difference in BMI. fasting blood sugar. insulin resistance and dyslipidemia (except LDL) between diabetic and control group. All inflammatory markers except TNF-α were positivelycorrelated with insulin resistance. Only TNF-α was found to be correlated to duration of the disease. Both TLC and Serum insulin were positively correlated to BMI. Inflammatory markers were not correlatedto dyslipidemia.Conclusion: This is the first study reporting levels of cytokines in Pakistani diabetic patients and healthycontrols. There is augmented inflammation in T2DM in Pakistani patients which plays role in higher insulinresistance in these patients. TNF-α levels increases with longer duration of the disease.

1070223,Structural and functional insights of human 5-lipoxygenase,2011,Nathaniel Carson Gilbert,,,,,,This work describes the structure of human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)(Gilbert. Bartlett et al. 2011) and the techniques required to ascertain the structure. 5-LOX is a notoriously unstable enzyme with important biological functions. The human 5-LOX has been implicated in many disease states including asthma. atherosclerosis and cancer. Part of 5-LOX biology is the inherent instability of the enzyme. which is thought to help regulate the production of its pro-inflammatory products. the leukotrienes. Our objective was stabilizing the enzyme for in vitro studies without affecting catalytic fidelity. I was able to quantitate stabilizing and destabilizing point mutations of 5-LOX by thermal denaturation and kinetic analysis along with other biochemical techniques. Through rigorous site-directed mutagenesis experiments and multiple expression protocols. I was able to over-express an engineered form of 5-LOX that is soluble and stable for biochemical studies and most importantly amenable to crystallization. Our lab is the first to crystallize a human lipoxygenase and model the molecular details. Another objective was studying the effect of phosphorylation on specific serine residues in 5-LOX that have been previously shown to be phosphorylated in vivo. I focused on phosphorylation of Ser663. which is ten amino acids removed from the C-terminus that penetrates the 5-LOX body and binds to the catalytic iron. I mutated this Ser663 to an aspartate. which is a mutation that has been previously shown to mimic a phosphorylated serine. The mutant 5-LOX S663D has altered product specificity in that it oxygenates arachidonic acid (AA) on the 15 carbon preferentially …,True,32FTxtYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_dissertations/1747/,7709812654864269685,/scholar?cites=7709812654864269685,,https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2746&context=gradschool_dissertations,0,0,0

Acting at the nuclear membrane in leukocytes. 5‐LOX oxygenates its lipid substrate arachidonic acid to leukotriene A4. The structure of 5‐LOX was solved in a closed conformation with helix‐α2 shortened and two large hydrophobic residues from the helix corking the active site. Most other animal lipoxygenase structures were solved with an elongated helix‐α2 allowing for an open conformation of the active site. Our goal is to study the molecular determinants important for the transition from a closed to open structure. We used site‐directed mutagenesis of helix‐α2 residues to favor either a more opened or closed conformation. We also used inhibitors to probe the conformational flexibility of 5‐LOX by …,True,32FTxtYAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.01876,,,,,0,0,0

Most conventional therapies for the management of type II diabetes include oral hypoglycemic drugs. exercise. diet and physical intervention therapies such as Acupuncture. Insulin is used in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin and oral hypoglycemic drugs are expensive and have numerous side effects. Through ages different communities have used medicinal herbs for diabetes mellitus management. Today herbal remedies are gaining popularity because the efficacy of conventional medicine is on the wane. This study was designed to bioscreen aqueous leaf extracts of Caesalpinia volkensii for its hypoglycemic potential. Its in vivo toxicity was also evaluated. Ethnobotanical and pharmacological information on the plant was gathered from the local traditional herbal practitioner. The three tested dose levels (50. 100. and 150mg/kg body weight) lowered blood glucose levels appreciably. Phytochemical screening results show that the aqueous extract has phytochemicals associated with antidiabetic activity. The analysis of trace metal composition of the aqueous extracts showed that it contained Manganese. Iron. Copper. Zinc. Magnesium. Molybdenum. Chromium and Vanadium. all of which aid in lowering blood glucose levels. Preliminary in vivo histopathological analysis established that the extracts had no toxic effects on the organs and tissues.

Delile in albino mice,2016,VZ Safari and JK Kamau and PM Nthiga and MP Ngugi and G Orinda and EM Njagi,2,Pain Manage Med,113,2,,Acacia nilotica has been used to manage several diseases including pain. inflammation and fever. However. its efficacy has not been scientifically validated. The aim of this study therefore is to investigate the antinociceptive. antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activities of its aqueous extracts. The plant extract was collected from Loita division. Narok county in Kenya. A total of 96 albino mice with an average weight of 20 g was used for this study. Antinociceptive activity was determined by use of formalin− induced writhing test. A writhe was recorded by a stopwatch following the stretching of the abdomen and/or stretching of at least one hind limb. Anti-inflammatory activity was established by a formalin induced inflammation test. Hourly changes in paw sizes and reduction of edema around the paw was determined using a venier calipers. Antipyretic activity was carried out using Brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia. Temperature of each mouse was determined rectally by thermal probe thermometer. The aqueous leaf extracts of A. nilotica reduced pain. inflammation and fever mostly at dose 150 mg/kg body weight. Based on these findings it was concluded that the present study has demonstrated the antinociceptive. anti-inflammatory and antipyretic potential of aqueous leaf extracts of A. nilotica in albino mice and will serve as good bio-resource for generating readily available herbal formulations that are more effective in the treatment of pain. inflammation and fever conditions which are cheaper than the conventional synthetic drugs and have no side effects.,True,mIAOm6oAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,22,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Ngugi2/publication/299346569_Antipyretic_Antiinflammatory_and_Antinociceptive_Activities_of_Aqueous_Bark_Extract_of_Acacia_Nilotica_L_Delile_in_Albino_Mice/links/56f16c2a08aed354e56fb7dd.pdf,9198843476416112563,/scholar?cites=9198843476416112563,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Ngugi2/publication/299346569_Antipyretic_Antiinflammatory_and_Antinociceptive_Activities_of_Aqueous_Bark_Extract_of_Acacia_Nilotica_L_Delile_in_Albino_Mice/links/56f16c2a08aed354e56fb7dd.pdf,0,0,0

This scaffolding activity requires the release of the autoinhibited conformation of LGN by binding of Gαi to its C-terminal GoLoco (GL) motifs. The interaction between the GL and TPR motifs of LGN represents a distinct GL/target binding mode with an unknown mechanism. Here. we show that two consecutive GL motifs of LGN form a minimal TPR-motif-binding unit. GL12 and GL34 bind to TPR0–3 and TPR4–7. respectively. The crystal structure of a truncated LGN reveals that GL34 forms a pair of parallel α helices and binds to the concave surface of TPR4–7. thereby preventing LGN from binding to other targets.

A number of individual genes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism have previously been reported to enhance the oil content of seeds when their expression is altered. However. it has yet to be established whether specific combinations of these genes can be used to achieve an additive effect and whether this leads to enhanced yield. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as an experimental system. we show that seed-specific overexpression of WRINKLED1 (a transcriptional regulator of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis) and DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (a triacylglycerol biosynthetic enzyme) combined with suppression of the triacylglycerol lipase SUGAR-DEPENDENT1 results in a higher percentage seed oil content and greater seed mass than manipulation of each gene individually.

Ascorbate oxidase is an apoplastic enzyme. which controls the redox state of the apoplastic ascorbate pool. RNA interference was used to decrease ascorbate oxidase activity in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Fruit yield was increased in these lines under three conditions where assimilate became limiting for wild‐type plants: when fruit trusses were left unpruned. when leaves were removed or when water supply was limited. Several alterations in the transgenic lines could contribute to the improved yield and favour transport of assimilate from leaves to fruits in the ascorbate oxidase lines.

In eukaryotes only one gluconeogenic route has been described from organic acid intermediates and this relies on the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK). Here we show that two routes exist in Arabidopsis. and that the second uses pyruvate. orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK). Gluconeogenesis is critical to fuel the transition from seed to seedling. Arabidopsis pck1 and ppdk mutants are compromised in seed-storage reserve mobilization and seedling establishment.

Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy [OPEN],2017,Fabio Fedi and Carmel M O’Neill and Guillaume Menard and Martin Trick and Simone Dechirico and Françoise Corbineau,,,,,,The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that. for the first of these mutants. designated awake1. the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that awake1 mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify awake1 as an allele of ABCG20. an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition. and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed coat suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation. but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed coat suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.Environmental signals during seed production are important determinants of seed properties. including seed dormancy and seed longevity. The mother plant plays an important role in this signaling process. collecting signals throughout her life history and modulating dormancy by providing hormones to maturing seeds and by plastic development of the tissues surrounding the embryo (Gutterman …,True,VOi6CpIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabio_Fedi/publication/315063161_Awake1_an_ABC-Type_Transporter_Reveals_an_Essential_Role_for_Suberin_in_the_Control_of_Seed_Dormancy/links/590b39bcaca272f6580eb287/Awake1-an-ABC-Type-Transporter-Reveals-an-Essential-Role-for-Suberin-in-the-Control-of-Seed-Dormancy.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabio_Fedi/publication/315063161_Awake1_an_ABC-Type_Transporter_Reveals_an_Essential_Role_for_Suberin_in_the_Control_of_Seed_Dormancy/links/590b39bcaca272f6580eb287/Awake1-an-ABC-Type-Transporter-Reveals-an-Essential-Role-for-Suberin-in-the-Control-of-Seed-Dormancy.pdf,0,0,0

Yeast Lipid Conference,,,,The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome that comprises obesity. diabetes and  atherosclerosis is rapidly increasing in western populations. Fatty acid lipotoxicity due to  saturation of triglyceride biosynthesis in non-adipose depots. and cholesterol toxicity in  macrophages are underlying mechanisms to many of these disorders. We have generated  models of this phenomenon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by genetically either ablating  neutral lipid biosynthesis and exposing the cells to free fatty acids or blocking transport from  the ER. We demonstrate that loss of the acyltransferases responsible for triglyceride and  steryl ester synthesis renders the cells sensitive to unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate  and palmitoleate. Similarly. loss of the ER sterol transporter ARV1 induces numerous  responses to cell stress including the unfolded protein response.

The mechanism by which farnesol induces apoptosis is currently believed to be by direct competitive inhibition with diacylglycerol for cholinephosphotransferase. the final step in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway. Our recent isolation of the first mammalian cholinephosphotransferase cDNA has enabled us to more precisely assess how farnesol affects phosphatidylcholine synthesis and the induction of apoptosis.

Reduced glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in maintaining cellular redox status by participating in thiol-disulfide exchange. which regulates a number of cell functions including gene expression and the activity of individual enzymes and enzyme systems. Maintaining optimum GSH/GSSG ratio is essential to cell viability. Decrease in the ratio can serve as an indicator of damage to the cell redox status and of changes in redox-dependent gene regulation. Disturbance of intracellular GSH balance is observed in a number of pathologies including cancer.

Role of development of adaptive antioxidant response to the rise of resistance to cytotoxical effect of doxorubicin (DOX) has been studied in human erythroleukemia K562 cells. Growth of resistance to DOX caused enhancement of antioxidant enzymes (Cu. Zn-SOD. Mn-SOD. catalase) elevation of Mn-SOD activity being predominant. Additional increasing of antioxidant level was elevation of GSH maintenance and level of GST-related enzymes (glutathione peroxidase. glutathione S-transferase. glutathione reductase) in resistance K562/DOX cells.

1070559,Why does iron abrogate the cytotoxic effect of S-nitrosothiols on human and animal cultured cells?,2007,VA Serezhenkov and EV Kalinina and VA Glazunova and AN Saprin and AF Vanin,52,Biofizika,5,869-875,,It was found that dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNIC) with thiol-containing ligands (cysteine or glutathione) of concentrations up to 1 mM produce no cytotoxic effect on cultured cells from human milk gland carcinoma (MCF-7). The cytotoxic action on MCF-7 cells was produced by S-nitrosocysteine: at a concentration of 1 mM. it induced the death of 50% cells. A more stable S-nitrosothiol. S-nitrosoglutathione. did not produce any cytotoxic effect at the same concentration. It is assumed that the negative action of nitrosocysteine is due to its rapid degradation. which results in the accumulation of large amounts of free NO molecules followed by their oxidation by superoxide ions to peroxynitrite. an efficient inhibitor of metabolic processes. These processes seem to be not characteristic of the more stable S-nitrosoglutathione. The cytotoxic effect of nitrosocysteine was completlly abrogated by the addition of 0.2 mM ferrous citrate complex to the medium. When S-nitrosoglutathione NO (0.5 mM) or S-nitrosoglutathione (0.5 mM)+ Fe (2+)-citrate (0.2 mM) were added to the medium. protein-bound dinitrosyl iron complexes formed with the involvement of endogenous or exogenous iron were detected in cells. The amount of the complexes in the presence of exogenous iron increased four times. reaching the value of 1.6 nmole/5 x 10 (6) cells. Therefore. it was proposed that the blockade of the cytotoxic action of S-nitrosoglutathione by iron complexes is due to Cys-NO transformation of S-nitrosocysteine into dinitrosyl iron complexes. The high stability of these complexes ensures only a gradual accumulation of nitric oxide in cells.,True,62YfiKMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://europepmc.org/article/med/17969921,2951752563064328385,/scholar?cites=2951752563064328385,,,0,0,0

Stress conditions induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species which can lead to cellular damage. In vitro assays have shown that enzyme inactivation by hydroxyl radicals (·OH) can be avoided in presence of Pro. suggesting that this amino acid could act as an ·OH scavenger. We applied Density Functional Theory coupled with a polarizable continuum model to elucidate how Pro reacts with ·OH. In this work we suggest that Pro reacts favourably with ·OH by H–abstraction on the amine group. This reaction produces the spontaneous decarboxylation of Pro leading to the formation of pyrrolidin-1-yl. In turn. pyrrolidin-1-yl can easily be converted to Δ1-pyrroline. the substrate of the enzyme Δ1-pyrroline dehydrogenase. which produces γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA and Pro are frequently accumulated in stressed plants and several protective roles have been assigned to these molecules.

1070589,The fermentation analogy: a point of view for understanding the intriguing role of proline accumulation in stressed plants,2016,Santiago Signorelli,7,Frontiers in Plant Science,,1339,Frontiers,The accumulation of proline under environmental stress is a conserved response of plants. Five decades have passed since the first report of proline accumulation in plants (Barnnet and Naylor. 1966). Many hypotheses have been put forward regarding assignment of a function to proline. These proposed roles include antioxidant capacity. osmoprotection. signaling. developmental function. and contributing in redox and cellular homeostasis (Smirnoff and Cumbes. 1989; Mattioli et al.. 2008; Szabados and Savouré. 2010; Kishor et al.. 2015). Among these. the osmotic adjustment. osmoprotectant. and antioxidant role have probably been the earliest and most widely accepted functions of proline. It is known that compatible osmolytes contribute in the retention of water. but also some of them force proteins to adopt a compactly folded structure. preventing the unfolding and reducing the exposed surface of the protein to damaging compounds (Attri et al.. 2010). In case of proline this was demonstrated both in vitro and in single cell organisms. For example. it was observed that proline overproducing E. coli mutants had greater osmotolerance (Csonka et al.. 1988) and also proline can inhibit protein aggregation in vivo (Ignatova and Gierasch. 2006). However. neither osmotic adjustment nor osmoprotection has been clearly confirmed in plants (Maggio et al.. 2002; Kavi Kishor and Sreenivasulu. 2014). This is probably more complex in plants because plants have different osmoregulatory mechanisms. Controversy is present regarding its proposed antioxidant role because recent evidence demonstrates that proline cannot scavenge singlet oxygen …,True,low6biAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,35,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01339/full,2859145463219081612,/scholar?cites=2859145463219081612,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01339/full,0,0,0

However. it is still controversial whether its protection is due to the direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To solve this issue and considering that nitrosative stress is directly related with an oxidative stress condition. we evaluated whether proline can protect against nitrosative damage.

It can oxidize proteins and lipids with important consequences on their biological functions. Despite its relevance. the interaction of NO2 with the cell barrier. the lipid membrane. is poorly understood. For instance. can lipid membranes limit NO2 diffusion? To estimate the permeability of lipid membranes to NO2 it is necessary to learn more about its solubility in the lipid phase. However. experimental data on NO2 solubility is very limited.

1070598,Autophagy in plants: Both a puppet and a puppet master of sugars,2019,Henry Christopher Janse van Rensburg and Wim Van den Ende and Santiago Signorelli,10,,,14,Frontiers,Autophagy is a major pathway that recycles cellular components in eukaryotic cells both under stressed and non-stressed conditions. Sugars participate both metabolically and as signalling molecules in development and response to various environmental and nutritional conditions. It is therefore essential to maintain metabolic homeostasis of sugars during non-stressed conditions in cells. not only to provide energy. but also to ensure effective signalling when exposed to stress. In both plants and animals. autophagy is activated by the energy sensor SnRK1/AMPK and inhibited by TOR kinase. SnRK1/AMPK and TOR kinases are both important regulators of cellular metabolism and are controlled to a large extent by the availability of sugars and sugar-phosphates in plants whereas in animals AMP/ATP indirectly translate sugar status. In plants. during nutrient and sugar deficiency. SnRK1 is activated. and TOR is inhibited to allow activation of autophagy which in turn recycles cellular components in an attempt to provide stress relief. Autophagy is thus indirectly regulated by the nutrient/sugar status of cells. but also regulates the level of nutrients/sugars by recycling cellular components. In both plants and animals sugars such as trehalose (Tre) induce autophagy and in animals this is independent of the TOR pathway. The glucose-activated G-protein signalling pathway has also been demonstrated to activate autophagy. although the exact mechanism is not completely clear. This mini-review will focus on the interplay between sugar signalling and autophagy.,True,low6biAAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,26,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00014/full,3148945424025915122,/scholar?cites=3148945424025915122,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00014/full,0,0,0

During quiescence. a homeostasis exists in phytohormone and source/sink regulation. which represses the metabolic and mitotic progression of the bud. Environmental change and shoot development can alter the homeostasis. leading to a binary state change and the commitment to growth. Within this context. light and oxygen availability can serve both metabolic and signaling functions. However. the question of substrate versus signal has proven challenging to resolve; in the case of sugars. there are disparities in the data from apical and axillary buds in juvenile shoots. while in postdormant perennial buds. light has only a facultative role in the decision. but signaling may still be essential for bud fate.

Nitric oxide (·NO) is a small free radical molecule having diverse signalling roles in plants. Here we present and discuss evidence showing the role of ·NO during different stages of the legume-rhizobia interaction such as recognition. infection. nodule development. and nodule senescence. Although the mechanisms by which ·NO modulates this interaction are not fully understood. we discuss potential mechanisms including its interaction with cytokinin. auxin and abscisic acid signalling pathways. In matures nodules. a more active metabolism of ·NO has been reported and both the plant and rhizobia participate in ·NO production and scavenging. Although ·NO has been shown to induce the expression of genes coding for NITROGENASE. controlling the levels of ·NO in mature nodules seems to be crucial as ·NO was shown to be a potent inhibitor of NITROGENASE activity. to induce nodule senescence. and reduce nitrogen assimilation. In this sense. LEGHEMOGLOBINS (Lbs) were shown to play an important role in the scavenging of ·NO and RNS. potentially more relevant in senescent nodules. Even though ·NO can reduce NITROGENASE activity. most reports have linked ·NO to positive effects on BNF. This can relate mainly to the regulation of the spatiotemporal distribution of ·NO which favours some effects over others.

Siena. Italy,Based on the different functions they perform. one might not expect at first that the type IV pilus (T4P) and type II secretion (T2S) systems are related. T4P are long. retractable polymers involved in adhesion. motility. biofilm formation and DNA uptake/transfer (Craig and Li. 2008). while the T2S system exports folded proteins or protein complexes from the periplasm using a short pseudopilus (McLaughlin et al.. 2012). Emerging structures of several components of the two systems has given credence to early predictions–based on sequence homology–that the T4P and T2S machineries are descended from a common ancestor (Hobbs and Mattick. 1993). Further support comes from studies showing that T2S pseudopili can be manipulated to form long adhesive pilus-like fibres (Sauvonnet et al.. 2000; Vignon et al.. 2003). and that some T4P systems can secrete proteins (Hager et al.. 2006; Han et al.. 2007). Although it is now clear that many T4P and T2S components–even those with poor sequence identity–are structurally related and may operate using similar mechanisms (Ayers et al.. 2010). intriguing differences in the number and arrangement of components hint at adaptations that may optimize them for their specific roles.Understanding of structure–function relationships in the T2S/T4P superfamily is further complicated by divergence of T4P into distinct classes. T4P are generally divided into type IVa (T4a) and type IVb (T4b) pili. with the T4bP containing a monophyletic subclass called the tight adherence (Tad) pili (Burrows. 2012).

1070663,Characterization of PilP from the Type IV Pilus System of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2012,Stephanie Tammam,,,,,,Pathogenic bacteria employ a number of mechanisms to induce infection and survive in host tissues. including toxin secretion and the formation of protective multicellular structures called biofilms. Type IV Pili (T4P) are highly conserved organelles essential for both the establishment of infection and biofilm maturation. The goal of this research is to gain a molecular level understanding of the function of the highly dynamic T4P of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pilMNOPQ operon encodes 5 members of a transmembrane complex that facilitates pilus function. While PilQ is the putative outer membrane secretin through which the pilus exits the cell. the roles of the PilM/N/O/P proteins are less well defined. Using both in vivo and in vitro techniques our characterization of PilP has provided significant insight into organization of the apparatus. PilP is an inner membrane lipoprotein essential for T4P function. but lipidation is dispensable. suggesting that its interactions with other T4P components are sufficient for PilP function.

Lys48-linked chains are the principal signal for proteasomal degradation. while Lys63-linked chains act as nonproteolytic signals. Despite significant progress in characterization of various cellular pathways involving ubiquitin. understanding of the structural details of polyubiquitin chain recognition by downstream cellular effectors is missing.

In carrying out its myriad functions. Ub conjugated to substrate proteins interacts with dozens of receptor proteins that link the Ub signal to various biological outcomes. Here we report mutations in conserved residues of Ub's hydrophobic core that have surprisingly potent and specific effects on molecular recognition. Mutant Ubs bind tightly to the Ub-associated domain of the receptor proteins Rad23 and hHR23A but fail to bind the Ub-interacting motif present in the receptors Rpn10 and S5a. Moreover. chains assembled on target substrates with mutant Ubs are unable to support substrate degradation by the proteasome in vitro or sustain viability of yeast cells.

Ubiquitination controls many critical cellular processes. most of which require specific lysines on ubiquitin (Ub). Of the 7 lysines (K) least is known about effects of modification of K6.  Methodology and Principal Findings We replaced K6 with tryptophan (W) because K6 is the most readily modified K and W is the most structurally similar residue to biotin. The backbone of K6W-Ub is indistinguishable from that of Wt-Ub. K6W-Ub is effectively conjugated and deconjugated but the conjugates are not degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathways (UPP). Expression of K6W-ubiquitin in the lens and lens cells results in accumulation of intracellular aggregates and also slows cell proliferation and the differentiation program. including expression of lens specific proteins. differentiation of epithelial cells into fibers. achieving proper fiber cell morphology. and removal of nuclei. The latter is critical for transparency. but the mechanism by which cell nuclei are removed has remained an age old enigma. This was also solved by expressing K6W-Ub. p27kip. a UPP substrate accumulates in lenses which express K6W-Ub.

1070714,Molecular Interactions of Ubiquitin and Polyubiquitin with Ubiquitin Binding Domains,2007,Aydin Haririnia,,,,,,Ubiquitin is a small protein that is covalently attached to proteins. either as a single ubiquitin moiety or as polyubiquitin chains.  A cascade of enzymatic reactions is required for the isopeptide linkage between the C-terminus of ubiquitin and a lysine residue on a substrate protein or another ubiquitin.  Attachment of ubiquitin or polyubiquitin. termed ubiquitination. mediates numerous cellular processes by acting as a versatile signal.  The signal transmitted by the tag depends on the nature of the modification. which defines the specificity of the tag for different cellular machinery.  This versatility is conferred by the variations in polyubiquitin tags. both in terms of length and lysine-linkage.  Polyubiquitin chains can adopt a variety of different conformations based on these variations.  The conformational and dynamic properties of the tag may optimize its binding to specific ubiquitin binding domains. therefore committing the target protein to distinct cellular outcomes.         A combination of NMR methods are used to study the interaction of several ubiquitin binding domains with Lys48- and Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin. the simplest model of a polyubiquitin chain. to gain insights into polyubiquitin recognition.  The di-ubiquitin binding interface with ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and ubiquitin-associated domains (UBAs) are mapped.  Structural models of the complexes are also presented.

Current designs offer a hierarchy of folders containing documents and taskbar operations to launch/exit applications. We propose a Personal Role Management strategy that emphasizes management of the multiple roles users have in their professional and personal lives. Each role involves coordination with groups of people and accomplishment of tasks within a schedule. We define Personal Role Management and summarize our earlier work that led to this strategy. This current project focused on understanding how Personal Role Management might improve email for college students. College students often assume distinct and predictable roles. Their student role is structured by the rhythm and interactions of classes. projects and exams. In both their family role and their work role for local companies. they deal with separate groups of people. We describe scenarios of use of a role-based email system. an interface mockup and user reactions. This research suggests that using those roles as a driving component for designing an email interface might address problems identified in our surveys and interviews of college students.,True,Q-8b3gYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.79.4998&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.79.4998&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD–associated mutations in LRRK2. including the most common G2019S variant. have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity. and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations. are incompletely understood. Here. we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain. and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD–associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly. ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore. LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression. whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and …,True,PPS0P9AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,132,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002526,13478864353211156678,/scholar?cites=13478864353211156678,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002526,0,0,0

KRS mutations produce truncated forms of ATP13A2 with impaired protein stability resulting in a loss-of-function. Recently. homozygous and heterozygous missense mutations in ATP13A2 have been identified in subjects with early-onset parkinsonism. The mechanism(s) by which missense mutations potentially cause parkinsonism are not understood at present. Here. we demonstrate that homozygous F182L. G504R and G877R missense mutations commonly impair the protein stability of ATP13A2 leading to its enhanced degradation by the proteasome. ATP13A2 normally localizes to endosomal and lysosomal membranes in neurons and the F182L and G504R mutations disrupt this vesicular localization and promote the mislocalization of ATP13A2 to the endoplasmic reticulum. Heterozygous T12M. G533R and A746T mutations do not obviously alter protein stability or subcellular localization but instead impair the ATPase activity of microsomal ATP13A2 whereas homozygous missense mutations disrupt the microsomal localization of ATP13A2. The overexpression of ATP13A2 missense mutants in SH-SY5Y neural cells does not compromise cellular viability suggesting that these mutant proteins lack intrinsic toxicity.

LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing GTPase and kinase enzymatic domains. Disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 variably influence enzymatic activity with the common G2019S variant leading to enhanced kinase activity. Mutant LRRK2 induces neuronal toxicity through a kinase-dependent mechanism suggesting that kinase activity is important for mediating the pathogenic effects of LRRK2 mutations.

The intracellular imbalance of ions. disturbance in membrane dynamics. hypoxic conditions. and dysregulation of gene expression are all molecular pathogenic mechanisms closely associated with oxidative stress and underpin systemic changes in the body. These also include aspects such as chronic immune system activation. the impairment of cellular structure renewal. and alterations in the character of the endocrine secretion of diverse tissues.

1070756,Nitric oxide induced axon retraction is mediated through S-nitrosylation of microtubule-associated proteins.,,A Tranciková and H Stroissnigg and J Fuhrmann and A Meixner and F Nothias and F Propst,,,,,,Text Nitric oxide and S-nitrosylation of proteins at cysteine residues by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) are well established signaling mechanisms. In the nervous system. nitric oxide signaling is instrumental in long term potentiation and refinement of neuronal projections. On the other hand. nitric oxide has dramatic effects on growth cone morphology and growth cone collapse of neurons in culture. indicating that the cytoskeleton is involved in its actions. Despite the fact that tubulin and actin have been found to be S-nitrosylated. there is little to no knowledge about how nitric oxide signals to the cytoskeleton. Nitric oxide induced growth cone collapse and axon retraction involve reconfiguration (but not depolymerization) of axonal microtubules. but the underlying mechanism is unknown.We found evidence for an S-nitrosylation dependent signal transduction pathway involved in growth cone morphology and …,True,PPS0P9AAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6050175076615114751&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Kenya,2015,Ngugi M Piero and Njagi NM Eliud and Kimuni N Susan and Orinda O George and NJMM David,,,,,,Cissampelos pareira Linn has been used traditionally in the management of several diseases including diabetes mellitus but its efficacy and safety after long term use is not scientifically evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine in vivo hypoglycemic activity and safety of aqueous leaf extracts of C. pareira in white male albino rats. The extracts were screened for their hypoglycemic activity in alloxan induced diabetic rats using the oral and intraperitoneal routes. The safety of these extracts was studied in rats orally or intraperitoneally administered with 1 g/kg body weight daily for 28 days by recording the changes in body and organ weight. hematological and biochemical parameters and histology. Mineral composition of the extracts were estimated using total reflection X-ray fluorescence system (TRXF) while the types and quantities of phytochemicals present were assessed using standard procedures. Aqueous extracts orally and intraperitoneally administered at 50 mg/kg. 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg body weight demonstrated hypoglycemic activity with the intraperitoneal route being more effective than the oral route.

However. this important tuber crop has a fair share of demerits. among which is the fact that all parts of the plant contain toxic levels of cyanogenic glycosides. which have to be removed by laborious processing before cassava can be safely consumed. Conventional methods for removal of cyanogenic glycosides in cassava have seldom been successful for decades. Genetic engineering holds the key to overcoming majority of these limitations in order to produce cassava plants in which desirable traits are optimized and undesirable traits downregulated. The objective of this study was to determine the levels of cyanogenic compounds in three Kenyan cassava genotypes along with an exotic model cultivar in which cyanogenic glycosides had been downregulated via RNA interference approach in an earlier study by the authors. Cassava roots from transgenic and wild type genotypes were harvested. peeled. cut to pieces and washed three times with cold water. following cyanogenic compounds were extraction by homogenization in acid extraction medium.

Malignant lymphoid cells exploit several mechanisms to deregulate the expression of BCL6. including chromosomal translocations. somatic mutations in the promoter regulatory regions. or inactivation of the pathway that controls its degradation. FBXO11 was recently identified as a major ubiquitin ligase involved in the degradation of BCL6 and was found to be frequently inactivated by mutations or deletion in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Thus. FBXO11 acts as an oncosuppressor in DLBCL by promoting the accumulation of BCL6. Given the prominent role of FBXO11 in regulating BCL6 stability. we searched for FBXO11 mutations in BCL6-positive lymphomas. other than DLBCL. and we investigated its role in lymphoma development in vivo.Methods: We sequenced the entire FBXO11 coding sequence by classical Sanger sequencing in …,True,FPwxlUsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,1,https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/23/24_Supplement/PR10.abstract,16489359745848934840,/scholar?cites=16489359745848934840,,https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/23/24_Supplement/PR10,0,0,0

Thus. erythroid precursor cells possess an efficient mechanism for iron uptake in which iron loaded transferrin (Tf) binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR) at the cell surface. The Tf:TfR complex then enters the endosome via receptor mediated endocytosis. Following acidification within the endosome. iron is released from Tf and reduced from Fe3+ to Fe2+ by Steap3. the endosomal erythrocyte ferrireductase. The reduced iron then undergoes transport across the endosomal membrane by divalent metal iron transporter 1 (DMT1). Steap3 is a member of a unique family of metalloreductases.

The dye degradation was studied with respect to four factors viz.. initial concentration of dye. concentration of H2O2 and Fe2+ ions and process time. Central composite design (CCD) was used to evaluate the effect of four factors and a second order regression model was obtained. The optimum degradation of 99.84% Rh-B was obtained when 159 ppm dye. 239 ppm H2O2. 46 ppm Fe2+ were treated for 27 min. The independent variables were fed as inputs to ANN with the percentage dye degradation as outputs. For the optimum percentage dye degradation. a three-layered feed-forward network was trained by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm and the optimized topology of 4:10:1 (input neurons: hidden neurons: output neurons) was developed. A high regression coefficient (R2 = 0.9861) suggested that the developed ANN model was more accurate and predicted in a better way than the regression model given by RSM (R2 = 0.9112).,True,k5WbBb4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,16,http://ijer.ut.ac.ir/article_59683_7599.html,9727907908163856975,/scholar?cites=9727907908163856975,,https://ijer.ut.ac.ir/article_59683_22c12ed286f266b1eafd9c2972249ebe.pdf,0,0,0

1070897,Partitioning of thermostable glucoamylase in polyethyleneglycol/salt aqueous two-phase system,2015,Vinayagam Ramesh and Vytla Ramachandra Murty,2,Bioresources and Bioprocessing,1,1-8,SpringerOpen,A major challenge in downstream processing is the separation and purification of a target biomolecule from the fermentation broth which is a cocktail of various biomolecules as impurities. Aqueous two phase system (ATPS) can address this issue to a great extent so that the separation and partial purification of a target biomolecule can be integrated into a single step. In the food industry. starch production is carried out using thermostable glucoamylase. Humicola grisea serves as an attractive source for extracellular production of glucoamylase. In the present investigation. the possibility of using polyethylene glycol (PEG)/salt-based ATPS for the partitioning of glucoamylase from H. grisea was investigated for the first time. Experiments were conducted based on one variable at a time approach in which independent parameters like PEG molecular weight. type of phase-forming salt. tie line length. phase volume ratio. and neutral salt concentration were optimized. It has been found that the PEG 4000/potassium phosphate system was suitable for the extraction of glucoamylase from the fermentation broth. From the results. it was observed that. at a phase composition of 22 % w/w PEG 4000 and 12 % w/w phosphate in the presence of 2 % w/w NaCl and at pH 8. glucoamylase was partitioned into the salt-rich phase with a maximum yield of 85.81 %. A range of parameters had a significant influence on aqueous two-phase extraction of glucoamylase from H. grisea. The feasibility of using aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) as a preliminary step for the partial purification of glucoamylase was clearly proven.,True,k5WbBb4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,7,https://bioresourcesbioprocessing.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40643-015-0056-6,6421847524499788252,/scholar?cites=6421847524499788252,,https://bioresourcesbioprocessing.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40643-015-0056-6,0,0,0

There are few studies have been already reported the prevalence of DED nevertheless studies shown prevalence of DED and DR by sex in patients with T2D. The study was carried out with 100 T2D patients. DED was assessed with Tear break up time and Schirmer tests. All the subjects were examined by slit lamp bio-microscopy and colored fundus photographs. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was graded according to early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy (ETDRS) criteria. Out of 100 T2D patients. the prevalence of DED was noticed in 53 patients. Out of 53 DED cases. 14 (43.8%) were males and 39 (57.4%) were females. Next we assessed the association of DED with DR and it was found 47.6% in males and 69.4% in females. In our study. the prevalence of DED was high in T2D patients and showed to have a high correlation with DR. Prevalence of DED was more in females as compared to males with DR but severity of DR was more in males as compared to females with DR. As T2D and dry eye seems to have a common association. further studies are needed to establish the underlying etiologic relationship with large sample size.

Despite their importance. structural and functional characterisation of membrane proteins still remains a challenge. partially due to the difficulties in recombinant expression and purification. Therefore the need for development of efficient methods for heterologous production is essential.   Methodology/Principal FindingsFifteen integral membrane transport proteins from Archaea were selected as test targets. chosen to represent two superfamilies widespread in all organisms known as the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and the 5-Helix Inverted Repeat Transporter superfamily (5HIRT). These proteins typically have eleven to twelve predicted transmembrane helices and are putative transporters for sugar. metabolite. nucleobase. vitamin or neurotransmitter. They include a wide range of examples from the following families: Metabolite-H+-symporter; Sugar Porter; Nucleobase-Cation-Symporter-1; Nucleobase-Cation-Symporter-2; and neurotransmitter-sodium-symporter. Overproduction of transporters was evaluated with three vectors (pTTQ18. pET52b. pWarf) and two Escherichia coli strains (BL21 Star and C43 (DE3)). Thirteen transporter genes were successfully expressed; only two did not express in any of the tested vector-strain combinations.

However. the number of three dimensional structures of membrane proteins elucidated has been modest in comparison with those of soluble proteins. and this is attributable to three major bottlenecks: expression. purification and structure determination of these hydrophobic proteins.  A genomic approach was conducted to overcome these bottlenecks for two families of membrane proteins: (1) the NCS1 family of transporters and; (2) the histidine kinases of two-component signal transduction systems of E. faecalis. The genes encoding these membrane proteins were cloned separately into plasmid pTTQ18-His6 and subjected to expression trials in Escherichia coli. Purification of the recombinant intact proteins from E. coli membranes was undertaken using Ni-NTA chromatography. and for proteins that were produced in sufficient quantities crystallisation trials and investigations of structural characteristics were performed.

In Enterococcus faecalis. Fsr quorum sensing produces and responds to the gelatinase biosynthesis‐activating pheromone (GBAP).

Far‐UV CD measurements demonstrated a predominantly α‐helical protein exhibiting a small level of conformational flexibility. Fivefold (400 μm) GBAP stabilised FsrB (80 μm) secondary structure. FsrB thermal denaturation in the presence and absence of GBAP revealed melting temperatures of 70.1 and 60.8 °C. respectively. demonstrating GBAP interactions and increased thermal stability conferred by GBAP.

S. pneumoniae lacks complete respiratory chain and relies on carbohydrate fermentation for energy generation. One of the essential components for this includes the mannose phosphotransferase system (Man-PTS). which plays a central role in glucose transport and exhibits a broad specificity for a range of hexoses. Importantly. Man-PTS is involved in the global regulation of gene expression for virulence determinants. We herein report the three-dimensional structure of the EIIA domain of S. pneumoniae mannose phosphotransferase system (SpEIIA-Man). Our structure shows a dimeric arrangement of EIIA and reveals a detailed molecular description of the active site. Since PTS transporters are exclusively present in microbes and sugar transporters have already been suggested as valid targets for antistreptococcal antibiotics. our work sets foundation for the future development of antimicrobial strategies against Streptococcus pneumoniae.

In rhodopsin the absorption of a photon results in the isomerisation of the covalently-bound chromophore ligand (11-cis-retinal). inducing conformational changes in the receptor. These changes lead to the activation of the G protein transducin. which constitutes the initial event of dim-light vision. While the structures of dark [1] and fully active states [2] of rhodopsin have been characterised. the photoactivation mechanism at an atomic level remains controversial.Recently. we have shown that serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography with X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) is a powerful method to study dynamics of structural changes in the bacterial homolog bacteriorhodopsin [3]. Billions of microcrystals at room temperature are extruded one by one into the very intense X-ray pulse of a free electron laser and measured under the “diffraction before destruction” mode. For time-resolved studies. a pump laser photoactivates the protein in the microcrystals at different delays before diffraction. We have purified rhodopsin and obtained high density microcrystals suspensions required for serial crystallography. Rhodopsin microcrystals have been already tested at the two XFELs in LCLS in Stanford and SACLA in Japan. The final results will give insights on structural changes in the range of femtoseconds to milliseconds involved in the photoactivation process. These knowledge will be beneficial for other G protein-coupled receptors. one of the major targets in drug discovery.,True,SqBxzZEAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,0,https://bioxfel.org/resources/1525/download/Poster_Abstracts_2018.pdf#page=30,,,,https://bioxfel.org/resources/1525/download/Poster_Abstracts_2018.pdf#page=30,0,0,0

HIV-1 gp120 has also been implicated in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. However. the mechanism(s) responsible for gp120-mediated neuroinflammation remain undefined. In view of increased levels of IL-6 in HIV-positive individuals with neurological manifestations. we sought to address whether gp120 is involved in IL-6 over-expression in astrocytes. Transfection of a human astrocyte cell line with a plasmid encoding gp120 resulted in increased expression of IL-6 at the levels of mRNA and protein by 51.3±2.1 and 11.6±2.2 fold respectively; this effect of gp120 on IL-6 expression was also demonstrated using primary human fetal astrocytes. A similar effect on IL-6 expression was observed when primary astrocytes were treated with gp120 protein derived from different strains of X4 and R5 tropic HIV-1. The induction of IL-6 could be abrogated by use of gp120-specific siRNA. Furthermore. this study showed that the NF-κB pathway is involved in gp120-mediated IL-6 over-expression. as IKK-2 and IKKβ inhibitors inhibited IL-6 expression by 56.5% and 60.8%. respectively. These results were also confirmed through the use of NF-κB specific siRNA. We also showed that gp120 could increase the phosphorylation of IκBα. Furthermore. gp120 transfection in the SVGA cells increased translocation of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 gp120-mediated over-expression of IL-6 in astrocytes is one mechanism responsible for neuroinflammation in HIV-infected individuals and this is mediated by the NF-κB pathway.,True,tpWsyMQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,70,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021261,9558707475138851620,/scholar?cites=9558707475138851620,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021261,0,0,0

This study was designed in order to investigate the interactive effect of morphine abuse and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/ Simian Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV/SHIV) infection on plasma oxidant/antioxidant balance in rhesus macaques. Six rhesus macaques adapted to morphine dependence (20 weeks) along with three controls were infected with mixture of SHIVKU-1B. SHIV89.6P. and SIV17E-Fr.

Certain mutations within the −45 region generate sequences that resemble UP elements in base composition and mimic the stimulation by the rrnBP1 UP element. yielding up to 15-fold stimulation in vivo. These −45 region “UP mutants” are compromised in their CAP stimulation. CAP and UP elements do not act in a fully additive manner in vivo at the lac operon. Transcription assays with the wild-type lac promoter and an UP mutant of lac indicate that CAP and UP DNA also fail to act in a completely additive manner in vitro.

We have determined crystal structures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ARL6–GDP. ARL6–GTP and the ARL6–GTP–BBS1 complex.

Enhancing the resolution of 1H NMR spectra by broadband homonuclear decoupling,2014,N Helge Meyer and Klaus Zangger,25,Synlett,07,920-927,© Georg Thieme Verlag,The structural characterization of synthetic organic and natural products often relies on proton-detected NMR spectra. While the sensitivity of protons is the highest of all NMR-active nuclei. their spectral resolution is rather poor. The removal of scalar couplings leads to a large resolution enhancement by collapsing all signals to singlets. Such homonuclear broadband decoupled proton spectra. which resemble proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra. can be obtained by several techniques. most of which require the acquisition of an additional dimension and/or special data processing. Recently introduced homonuclear decoupling during acquisition yields free induction decays (FIDs). which can be processed and analyzed like regular proton data.

Boophilus annulatus,2007,Amr E El Hakim and Yasser E Shahein and Amira MK Abouelella and Mohamed E Selim,8,Journal of Veterinary Science,2,175,The Korean Society of Veterinary Science,The present study was conducted to identify new target immunogenic molecules from the larval stage of the cattle tick. Boophilus annulatus (Acari: Ixodidae). Two specific larval glycoproteins (GLPs) were isolated by two-step affinity chromatography. The larval immunogens were first purified with CNBr-Sepharose coupled to rabbit anti-larval immunoglobulins. and the glycoproteins were then purified with Con-A Sepharose. These glycoproteins have molecular weights of approximately 32 and 15 kDa with isoelectric points between 6.8 and 7.2. Antibodies against the two GLPs. labeled I and II. were detected in the anti-whole tick.-whole larval. and-gut antigens through immunoblot analysis.

Previously. two other known rhodopsin mutants that cause congenital night blindness. A292E and G90D. have been shown in vitro to constitutively activate the G protein transducin in the absence of a chromophore. The proposed mechanism of constitutive activation of these two mutants is an electrostatic disruption of the active site salt bridge between Glu113 and Lys296 that contributes to stabilization of the protein in the inactive state. Here. the T94I rhodopsin mutant is characterized and compared to the two other known rhodopsin night blindness mutants. The T94I mutant opsin is shown also to constitutively activate transducin.

1071217,Defective trafficking of rhodopsin and its role in retinal degenerations,2012,TJ Hollingsworth and Alecia K Gross,293,,,1-44,Academic Press,Retinitis pigmentosa is a retinal degeneration transmitted by varied modes of inheritance and affects approximately 1 in 4000 individuals. The photoreceptors of the outer retina. as well as the retinal pigmented epithelium which supports the outer retina metabolically and structurally. are the retinal regions most affected by the disorder. In several forms of retinitis pigmentosa. the mislocalization of the rod photoreceptor protein rhodopsin is thought to be a contributing factor underlying the pathophysiology seen in patients. The mutations causing this mislocalization often occur in genes coding proteins involved in ciliary formation. vesicular transport. rod outer segment disc formation. and stability. as well as the rhodopsin protein itself. Often. these mutations result in the most early-onset cases of both recessive and dominant retinitis pigmentosa. and the following presents a discussion of the proteins. their degenerative …,True,i4DYqvgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123943040000063,10262598091350832891,/scholar?cites=10262598091350832891,,,0,0,0

This effect does not appear to be general to night blindness mutations as the two other mutants (A292E and T94I) were not found to bind retinal with slowed kinetics. However. T94D was similar to G90D in that the rate of retinal binding was dramatically slowed. Gly90 and Thr94 are both located in the active site of the protein close to the Schiff base counterion Glu113. Thus. the slow kinetics of Schiff base formation appear to correlate with the introduction of a negative charge close to the Schiff base counterion. suggesting a possible role for Glu113 as a catalytic base in this reaction. Consistent with this model. the E113Q mutant was also found to bind retinal more slowly than the wild type. ,True,i4DYqvgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,36,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi020612r,2374912083739706252,/scholar?cites=2374912083739706252,,,0,0,0

Here. we elucidate the molecular mechanism of phosphorylation-regulated translation of TNF. We demonstrate that translation of the TNF-precursor at the ER requires expression of the ARE–binding and -stabilizing factor human antigen R (HuR) together with either activity of the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway or the absence of the ARE-binding and -destabilizing factor tristetraprolin (TTP). We show that phosphorylation of TTP by MK2 decreases its affinity to the ARE. inhibits its ability to replace HuR. and permits HuR-mediated initiation of translation of TNF mRNA. Since translation of TTP's own mRNA is also regulated by this mechanism. an intrinsic feedback control of the inflammatory response is ensured.

The autophagosomes degrade their cargo by lysosomal proteolysis generating raw materials for the biosynthesis of vital macromolecules. One of the initial steps in the assembly of autophagosomes from pre-autophagic structures is the recruitment and activation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex consisting of Beclin 1 (BECN1).

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gaining importance as possible biomarkers with prognostic potential. By large-scale data mining. we identified LINC00261 as a lncRNA which was significantly downregulated in lung cancer. Low expression of LINC00261 was associated with recurrence and poor patient survival in lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover. the gene pair of LINC00261 and its neighbor FOXA2 were significantly co-regulated. LINC00261 as well as FOXA2 negatively correlated with markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and were suppressed by the EMT inducer TGFβ.

However. unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 1448 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences available and identified 40 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif as hotspots for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly. three of the 40 substitutions occur within highly conserved secondary structures in the 5′ and 3′ regions of the genomic RNA that are critical for the virus life cycle. Furthermore. clustering analysis revealed unique geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile. Of note. we observed several co-occurring mutations that almost never occur individually. We define five mutually exclusive lineages (A1. B1. C1. D1 and E1) of SARS-CoV-2 which account for about three quarters of the genomes analysed. We identify lineage-defining leading mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which precede the occurrence of sub-lineage defining trailing mutations.

Cham,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gaining prominence as more evidence emerges for crucial roles of these molecules in diverse biological processes. Differential expression analyses have contributed the most in the discovery of functional lncRNAs. Among the generally deciphered functions. the sequence-complementarity-based mechanisms including miRNA sponge activity have predominated. However. some of the functionally characterized lncRNAs perform interesting scaffolding functions by nucleating multiprotein complexes. Multidomain lncRNAs can act as flexible linkers for assembling dynamic signaling complexes. much like protein adaptors. Even though these are among the most difficult lncRNA functions with respect to predictability and characterization. recent large-scale interactome studies have identified protein-association or scaffolding as a prominent regulatory role of lncRNAs.

In contrast to DNA mutations. epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore suitable targets for pharmacological therapy. To understand which patients will benefit the most from which drug regime remains a challenge in everyday clinical practice. The aim of this study is to characterize the tumor drug sensitivity and epigenetic modifications on a molecular level induced by different compounds. in order to improve tumor-specific treatment for patients.MethodWe tested a total of 40 epigenetically active compounds (partly known and partly unknown/unpublished) in two different concentrations in 56 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and 3 control cell lines for cell viability.,True,vct7PXQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(18)32831-4/abstract,,,,https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(18)32831-4/pdf,0,0,0

1071307,Functional Analysis of KSRP Interaction,,Michael Kracht Dhamija and Helmut Holtmann,,,,,,Returned for modification 13 September 2007/Accepted 19 September 2007 mRNA stability is a major determinant of inflammatory gene expression. Rapid degradation of interleukin-8 (IL-8) mRNA is imposed by a bipartite AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3 untranslated region (R. Winzen et al.. Mol. Cell. Biol. 24: 4835–4847. 2004). Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the ARE-binding protein KSRP resulted in stabilization of IL-8 mRNA or of a ß-globin reporter mRNA containing the IL-8 ARE. Rapid deadenylation was impaired. indicating a crucial role for KSRP in this step of mRNA degradation. The two IL-8 ARE domains both contribute to interaction with KSRP. corresponding to the importance of both domains for rapid degradation. Exposure to the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 has been shown to stabilize IL-8 mRNA through p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and MK2. IL-1 treatment impaired the interaction of KSRP with the IL-8 ARE in a manner dependent on p38 MAP kinase but apparently independent of MK2. Instead. evidence that TTP. a target of MK2. can also destabilize the IL-8 ARE reporter mRNA is presented. In a comprehensive approach to identify mRNAs controlled by KSRP. two criteria were evaluated by microarray analysis of (i) association of mRNAs with KSRP in pulldown assays and (ii) increased amounts in KSRP knockdown cells. According to both criteria. a group of 100 mRNAs is controlled by KSRP. many of which are unstable and encode proteins involved in inflammation. These results indicate that KSRP functions as a limiting factor in inflammatory gene expression.Rapid degradation controls the levels …,True,vct7PXQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.8739&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.8739&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

While the role of PPARγ in regulating insulin sensitivity has been well defined. research into PPARδ has been limited until recently due to a scarcity of selective PPARδ agonists. The metabolic effects of PPARγ and PPARδ activation have been examined in vivo in white adipose tissue from ob/ob mice and in vitro in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry metabolomics to understand the receptors' contrasting roles. These steady state measurements were supplemented with 13C-stable isotope substrate labeling to assess fluxes. in addition to respirometry and transcriptomic microarray analysis. The metabolic effects of the receptors were readily distinguished. with PPARγ activation characterized by increased fat storage. synthesis and elongation. while PPARδ activation caused increased fatty acid β-oxidation. tricarboxylic acid cycle rate and oxidation of extracellular branch chain amino acids. Stimulated glycolysis and increased fatty acid desaturation were common pathways for the agonists. PPARγ and PPARδ restore insulin sensitivity through varying mechanisms.

We now report that CaMKII has a remarkable property. which is that activation of the holoenzyme triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes. including unactivated ones. enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation of new subunits. We show. using a single-molecule TIRF microscopy technique. that the exchange process is triggered by the activation of CaMKII. and that exchange is modulated by phosphorylation of two residues in the calmodulin-binding segment.

Based on these results. and on the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. we suggest that the phosphorylated regulatory segment of CaMKII interacts with the central hub of the holoenzyme and weakens its integrity. thereby promoting exchange.

Cell plasma membranes that are detached from the cytoskeletal structure spontaneously phase separate into distinct domains at equilibrium. which show their inherent demixing properties. Recently. researchers have discovered that proteins with strong interprotein interactions also spontaneously phase separate into distinct protein domains. thus enabling the maintenance of many membraneless organelles.

Hence where in the phase diagram the live cell membrane is poised would be a very important question in terms of thermodynamics even considering the possible non-equilibrium perturbation to the membrane by actin cytoskeleton or active exchange of components etc. Temperature dependent fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of fluorescent labeled lipids shows a consistently linear trend of mobility as a function of temperature for several different types of lipids. Supported by Monte-Carlo simulation on random walking particles under different states of the system. it shows cell membrane doesn’t experience effective miscibility transition well below the physiological temperature.

1071375,Molecular stochaticity in mammalian cell signaling: Lipid membrane organization and CaMKII kinetics,2012,Il Hyung Lee,,,,,,Molecular processes viewed at the single molecule level are stochastic and living cells are full of stochastic processes. Cellular processes frequently occur with a discrete number of molecules and understanding the stochastic behavior of them is of fundamental importance. Here. I studied physical chemistry of two important molecular species in cells: the lipid and the protein. On the subject of lipids. I studied miscibility phase structure of the live cell membrane. Observations of liquid-liquid miscibility phase transition in ternary mixture membranes with hypothetical existence of heterogeneous membrane domains in mammalian cells caused hypothesis of immiscible domains in live cell membranes. Discussion on the subject is often misleading when the discussion is only focused on the qualitative picture of domain existence. but does not consider the physical principles behind it. The question is where in the phase diagram the living cell membrane is poised. To address this question directly I observed physical parameters of the live cell membrane as a function of temperature and I conclude that the live cell membrane is poised reasonably far from the transition temperature. I also discuss the lack of direct evidence for miscibility phase structures playing an important role in actual signaling and the implication of criticality in membrane reactions.On the subject of protein. I studied kinetics of CaMKII. a major protein involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. CaMKII holoenzyme has a complex structure comprising of twelve subunits and as a molecular component in a neuronal signaling network. this complex structure allows the enzyme to carry out …,True,Qm8z1LgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4f71z7gz,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt4f71z7gz/qt4f71z7gz.pdf,0,0,0

The most commonly-used procedure today to obtain these derivatives is based on the reaction with methyl iodide as reagent and N-methylpyrrolidone as solvent. This procedure is not N-selective and significant O-methylation is observed in highly trimethylated material. The O-methylation reduces solubility of the TMC derivatives and therefore limits the use of highly N-quaternised products.

At the cellular level. abnormalities include increased calcium concentration in platelets. lymphocytes. and erythrocytes. Recent studies have shown that antibodies directed against angiotensin II type I (AT1) receptors are also highly associated with preeclampsia.Methods and Results— We tested the hypothesis that AT1 receptor–agonistic antibodies (AT1-AAs) could activate AT1 receptors. leading to an increased intracellular concentration of free calcium and to downstream activation of Ca2+ signaling pathways.

Most physiological roles of adenosine are mediated through adenosine receptors; however. the mechanisms by which adenosine influences mediator release from lung mast cells are not understood. We established primary murine lung mast cell cultures and used real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the A2A. A2B. and A3 adenosine receptors are expressed on murine lung mast cells. Studies using selective adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists suggested that activation of A3 receptors could induce mast cell histamine release in association with increases in intracellular Ca2+ that were mediated through Gi and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways.

The membrane-permeable derivative of diacylglycerol (OAG) stimulated an increase in oscillations of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in PHM1-41 and myometrium cells. OAG-induced Ca2+-oscillations were not affected by inhibition of PKC. It was proved that hTrpC channels take part in the regulation of free Ca ions concentration in the myometrium cells. On the basis of results of experiments. conducted on myometrium plasma membrane fraction. the conclusion was made that oxytocin does not influence the passive Ca2+ efflux. It was shown that peptyde hormone partially inhibited Ca2+ accumulation in plasma membrane fraction.

Three mechanisms for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake are described: the electrogenic mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. a rapid mode of Ca2+ uptake (RaM) and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels (RyR). Two mechanisms of Ca2+ efflux from the mitochondrial matrix have been proposed: Na+-dependent and Na+-independent Ca2+ exchange. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore can also function as a Ca2+ efflux mechanism. Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria resulted in an increase of mitochondrial membrane potential. ATP synthesis and activation of metabolites transport. The dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential should prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.

In addition to DMSO. five organic solvents for screening experiments of TNF-α inhibitors were explored. DMSO and PEG3350 were the most suitable for both protein stability and ligand-binding experiments. In addition. glycerol is a promising solvent for the screening of other compounds for which it might provide acceptable solubilization. due to its strong tendency to preserve the protein. Moreover. a fluorescence binding assay was developed using the TNF-α/SPD304 system. and a Kd of 5.36 ± 0.21 μM was determined.

Many different products have been produced in this cell factory by reconstruction of heterologous biosynthetic pathways; however. endogenous metabolism by itself involves many metabolites of industrial interest. and de-regulation of endogenous pathways to ensure efficient carbon channelling to such metabolites is therefore of high interest. Furthermore. many of these may serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of complex natural products. and hence strains overproducing certain pathway intermediates can serve as platform cell factories for production of such products.

1071652,Changes in lipid metabolism convey acid tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,2018,Zhong-peng Guo and Sakda Khoomrung and Jens Nielsen and Lisbeth Olsson,11,Biotechnology for biofuels,1,1-15,BioMed Central,The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays an essential role in the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Weak organic acids in lignocellulosic hydrolysate can hamper the use of this renewable resource for fuel and chemical production. Plasma-membrane remodeling has recently been found to be involved in acquiring tolerance to organic acids. but the mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown. Therefore. it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of acid tolerance of S. cerevisiae for developing robust industrial strains. We have performed a comparative analysis of lipids and fatty acids in S. cerevisiae grown in the presence of four different weak acids. The general response of the yeast to acid stress was found to be the accumulation of triacylglycerols and the degradation of steryl esters. In addition. a decrease in phosphatidic acid. phosphatidylcholine. phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. and an increase in phosphatidylinositol were observed. Loss of cardiolipin in the mitochondria membrane may be responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the dramatic decrease in the rate of respiration of S. cerevisiae under acid stress. Interestingly. the accumulation of ergosterol was found to be a protective mechanism of yeast exposed to organic acids. and the ERG1 gene in ergosterol biosynthesis played a key in ergosterol-mediated acid tolerance. as perturbing the expression of this gene caused rapid loss of viability. Interestingly. overexpressing OLE1 resulted in the increased levels of oleic acid (18:1n-9) and an increase in the unsaturation index of fatty acids in the plasma membrane. resulting in …,True,s0BDG5IAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC,18,https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-018-1295-5,3367255410575351761,/scholar?cites=3367255410575351761,,https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-018-1295-5,0,0,0

This can be a significant issue when performing quantitative metabolomics in clinical trials or screening for a potential biomarker in early-stage disease. because changes in metabolism or a desired-metabolite signal are small compared to the total metabolite signals. As a result. inter-individual variability can interfere subsequent statistical analyses. Here. we propose an additional data processing step using linear mixed-effects modelling to readjust an individual metabolite signal prior to multivariate analyses.

To cause rice blast disease the fungus elaborates a specialised infection structure called an appressorium. Here. we report genome wide transcriptional profile analysis of appressorium development using next generation sequencing (NGS). We performed both RNA-Seq and High-Throughput SuperSAGE analysis to compare the utility of these procedures for identifying differential gene expression in M. oryzae. We then analysed global patterns of gene expression during appressorium development. We show evidence for large-scale gene expression changes. highlighting the role of autophagy. lipid metabolism and melanin biosynthesis in appressorium differentiation. We reveal the role of the Pmk1 MAP kinase as a key global regulator of appressorium-associated gene expression. We also provide evidence for differential expression of transporter-encoding gene families and specific high level expression of genes involved in quinate uptake and utilization. consistent with pathogen-mediated perturbation of host metabolism during plant infection.

Binding of the actin-linking protein. talin. to integrin β cytoplasmic tails (CTs) induces high affinity ligand binding (integrin activation). whereas binding of another actin-linking protein. filamin. to the integrin β CTs negatively regulates this process by blocking the talin-integrin interaction. Here we show structurally that migfilin. a novel cytoskeletal adaptor highly enriched in the integrin adhesion sites. strongly interacts with the same region in filamin where integrin β CTs bind. We further demonstrate that the migfilin interaction dissociates filamin from integrin and promotes the talin/integrin binding and integrin activation.

Various integrin subfamilies communicate with each other and growth factor receptors under diverse cellular contexts to facilitate or inhibit various integrin-mediated functions.

1071719,Migfilin and filamin as regulators of integrin activation in endothelial cells and neutrophils,2011,Mitali Das and Sujay Subbayya Ithychanda and Jun Qin and Edward F Plow,6,PloS one,10,e26355,Public Library of Science,Cell adhesion and migration depend on engagement of extracellular matrix ligands by integrins. Integrin activation is dynamically regulated by interactions of various cytoplasmic proteins. such as filamin and integrin activators. talin and kindlin. with the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin β subunit. Although filamin has been suggested to be an inhibitor of integrin activation. direct functional evidence for the inhibitory role of filamin is limited. Migfilin. a filamin-binding protein enriched at cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contact sites. can displace filamin from β1 and β3 integrins and promote integrin activation. However. its role in activation and functions of different β integrins in human vascular cells is unknown. In this study. using flow cytometry. we demonstrate that filamin inhibits β1 and αIIbβ3 integrin activation. and migfilin can overcome its inhibitory effect. Migfilin protein is widely expressed in different adherent and circulating blood cells and can regulate integrin activation in naturally-occurring vascular cells. endothelial cells and neutrophils. Migfilin can activate β1. β2 and β3 integrins and promote integrin mediated responses while migfilin depletion impairs the spreading and migration of endothelial cells. Thus. filamin can act broadly as an inhibitor and migfilin is a promoter of integrin activation.,True,cCx3R5AAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,63,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026355,7450239617059400349,/scholar?cites=7450239617059400349,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026355,0,0,0

Loss of cell-ECM adhesion markedly reduces the migfilin level in untransformed epithelial cells and concomitantly induces apoptosis. Overexpression of migfilin substantially desensitizes cell detachment-induced apoptosis. Conversely. depletion of migfilin promotes apoptosis despite the presence of cell-ECM adhesion.

A major TR binding site in the immunoglobulin repeat 21 (Ig21) of filamin is masked by the adjacent repeat Ig20. resulting in autoinhibition. The TR binding to this site triggers the relief of Ig20 and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-2152. thereby dynamically regulating the TR-actin linkages. A P2204L mutation in Ig20 reportedly cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia. a skeletal disorder with unknown pathogenesis. We show here that the P2204L mutation impairs a hydrophobic core of Ig20. generating a conformationally fluctuating molten globule-like state.

The cytoskeleton is involved in numerous functions including maintenance of cell's internal scaffold. provision of mechanical stability. locomotion. intracellular transport of organelles. as well as chromosome separation in mitosis and meiosis. Through the recent application of molecular and proteomic approaches. we now know that the interactions between membrane channels. receptors and transporters. and cytoskeleton can either be direct or indirect. the latter being mediated through scaffolding or actin-binding proteins that serve as links between these integral proteins and the actin-based cytoskeleton. Bidirectional relationships are established where cytoskeleton and associated proteins affect the activities of membrane channels. receptors and transporters. and are also key downstream effectors of different signaling pathways. The present issue of Biochimica et Biophysica Acta—Biomembranes summarizes the main aspects of the state of the art on the reciprocal influences between cell cytoskeleton and membrane channels. receptors and transporters. Actin is a major cytoskeleton protein found ubiquitously within the cells that is involved in almost all biological events. particularly events related to motility.

For T2DM patients. the main surgical intervention for CAD is autologous saphenous vein grafting. However. T2DM patients have increased risk of saphenous vein graft failure (SVGF). While the mechanisms underlying increased risk of vascular disease in T2DM are not fully understood. hyperglycaemia. insulin resistance. and hyperinsulinaemia have been shown to contribute to microvascular damage. whereas clinical trials have reported limited effects of intensive glycaemic control in the management of macrovascular complications. This suggests that factors other than glucose exposure may be responsible for the macrovascular complications observed in T2DM. SVGF is characterised by neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) arising from endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and uncontrolled migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). This is driven in part by proinflammatory cytokines released from the activated ECs and SMCs. particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 stimulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT) pathway is a key mechanism through which EC inflammation. SMC migration. and proliferation are controlled and whose activation might therefore be enhanced in patients with T2DM. In this review. we investigate how proinflammatory cytokines. particularly IL-6. contribute to vascular damage resulting in SVGF and how suppression of proinflammatory cytokine responses via targeting the JAK/STAT pathway could be exploited as a potential …,True,aLaqF0oAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,18,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crp/2019/9846312/,16340244808463265100,/scholar?cites=16340244808463265100,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crp/2019/9846312/,0,0,0

This study explored the concept that endothelial cells (EC) cultured from T2DM and nondiabetic (ND) patients are phenotypically and functionally distinct. Cultured human saphenous vein- (SV-) EC were compared between T2DM and ND patients in parallel. Proliferation. migration. and in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed; western blotting was used to quantify phosphorylation of Akt. ERK. and eNOS. The ability of diabetic stimuli (hyperglycaemia. TNF-α. and palmitate) to modulate angiogenic potential of ND-EC was also explored. T2DM-EC displayed reduced migration (~30%) and angiogenesis (~40%) compared with ND-EC and a modest. nonsignificant trend to reduced proliferation. Significant inhibition of Akt and eNOS. but not ERK phosphorylation. was observed in T2DM cells. Hyperglycaemia did not modify ND-EC function. but TNF-α and palmitate significantly reduced angiogenic capacity (by 27% and 43%. resp.). effects mimicked by Akt inhibition. Aberrancies of EC function may help to explain the increased risk of SV graft failure in T2DM patients.

Mn-SOD and phenolics in their production,2009,Biljana Kukavica and Miloš Mojović and Željko Vucčinić and Vuk Maksimović and Umeo Takahama and Sonja Veljović Jovanović,50,Plant and Cell Physiology,2,304-317,Oxford University Press,The hydroxyl radical produced in the apoplast has been demonstrated to facilitate cell wall loosening during cell elongation. Cell wall-bound peroxidases (PODs) have been implicated in hydroxyl radical formation. For this mechanism. the apoplast or cell walls should contain the electron donors for (i) H2O2 formation from dioxygen; and (ii) the POD-catalyzed reduction of H2O2 to the hydroxyl radical. The aim of the work was to identify the electron donors in these reactions. In this report. hydroxyl radical (·OH) generation in the cell wall isolated from pea roots was detected in the absence of any exogenous reductants. suggesting that the plant cell wall possesses the capacity to generate ·OH in situ. Distinct POD and Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) isoforms different from other cellular isoforms were shown by native gel electropho‑resis to be preferably bound to the cell walls.

Complete growth arrest of seedlings was    observed in the Slatina water (T3). The alkalinity of external media was    recovered to pH 8 within four days only in T1 and T2. Analysis of    morphological parameters (the length of the main root. root application    zone. number of lateral roots) indicated that the thermo-mineral water    either promoted (T1) or inhibited (T2) the formation of lateral roots and    plant growth. Comparative histological and anatomical analyses showed that    inhibition of lateral roots was accompanied by an increase in the xylem and    phloem.

EC 1.11. 1.7). two populations of Verbascum thapsus L. were exposed to excess Zn2+ or Cu2+ for three weeks in hydroponic culture. One population originating from an uncontaminated area (NMET) and one from an industrial disposal area for jarosite residues from zinc refining (MET) were chosen to test the capacity of V. thapsus to adapt to excess metal in the soil. Exposure to 60 µM Zn2+ led to increased levels of protein carbonyl groups only in the roots of NMET. which was accompanied by higher increase of POD activity and NADH-oxidase activity compared with MET plants. New anionic and cationic POD isoforms were induced in the roots of both populations in response to Zn2+ treatment. while IAA-oxidase activity decreased. On the other hand. root growth was more affected by Cu2+ than Zn2+ in both populations. which was correlated with increased auxin-oxidase (IAA-oxidase) activity. Cu2+ induced an increased activity of anionic POD isoforms in the roots of both populations. yet the ratio of NADH-oxidative to peroxidative POD activity remained higher in NMET than in MET plants. Overall results show differential effects of Zn2+ and Cu2+ on POD activity in the roots of V. thapsus L. In addition. higher tolerance to Zn2+ in MET plants than in NMET indicated that these plants have developed an adaptive mechanism to cope with Zn2+ excess.,True,0XZ3DPcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,5,http://botanicaserbica.bio.bg.ac.rs/arhiva/pdf/2015_39_2_638_full.pdf,2332944466705023285,/scholar?cites=2332944466705023285,,http://botanicaserbica.bio.bg.ac.rs/arhiva/pdf/2015_39_2_638_full.pdf,0,0,0

It is caused by a parasite Trypanosoma brucei. which is transmitted by the Tsetse fly. Current drugs are toxic and vaccine development is unlikely because the parasites undergo antigenic variation. Antigenic variation involves the switching of Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs). which depends on fatty acids for surface expression. Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis and hence is a potential therapeutic target. Our studies demonstrated that inhibition of ACC expression causes a growth defect in insect procyclic form (PF) parasites in low lipid condition and reduced mammalian bloodstream form (BF) infection in mice. Under lab growth conditions. we observed regulation of ACC by environmental lipids in PFs but not BFs. In BFs. we showed that ACC is required for the elevated endocytosis needed for the parasite to avoid antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis. In sum. we propose that in PFs. ACC is regulated to maintain lipid levels while the parasite undergoes development in the Tsetse fly. while in BFs. ACC is always active to support the upregulation of endocytosis needed to evade the mammalian immune system.,True,yb246-8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/grads_symposium/18/,,,,,0,0,0

There is great interest in developing molecules which can mimic alphahelices found at the binding interface between two proteins. as such molecules can act as competitive inhibitors of proteinprotein interactions (PPIs). 1 The ability to selectively inhibit PPIs may enable therapeutics to be developed against a wide range of new protein targets previously thought to be ‘undruggable’.Whilst the native alpha-helical peptide is a clear starting point for designing a mimetic. the peptide itself is a poor therapeutic candidate. In isolation. short peptides usually do not retain their native conformation and binding capability. as they lack the structural reinforcement provided by the remainder of the protein. Peptides are also susceptible to proteolytic degradation and typically cannot cross the cell membrane. For these reasons. many research groups are investigating synthetic methods for modifying peptides. with the aim of reinforcing their native alpha-helical conformation and thereby restoring binding affinity towards their protein targets.

1072227,The cytosolic Arabidopsis thaliana cysteine desulfurase ABA3 delivers sulfur to the sulfurtransferase STR18,2020,Benjamin Selles and Tiphaine Dhalleine and Mathilde Hériché and Nicolas Rouhier and Jérémy Couturier,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,The biosynthesis of many sulfur-containing biomolecules depends on cysteine as a sulfur source. Cysteine desulfurase (CD) and rhodanese (Rhd) domain-containing protein families participate in the trafficking of sulfur for various metabolic pathways in bacteria and human. However. their connection is not yet described in plants even though the existence of natural chimeric proteins containing both CD and Rhd domains in specific bacterial genera suggests that the interaction between both proteins should be universal. We report here the biochemical relationships between two cytosolic proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. a Rhd domain containing protein. the sulfurtransferase 18 (STR18). and a CD isoform. ABA3. and compare these biochemical features to those of a natural CD-Rhd fusion protein from the bacterium Pseudorhodoferax sp.. We found that the bacterial enzyme is bifunctional exhibiting both CD and STR activities using L-cysteine and thiosulfate as sulfur donors. In vitro activity assays and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that STR18 stimulates the CD activity of ABA3 by recovering the intermediate persulfide on its catalytic cysteine. The ability of STR18 to catalyze trans-persulfidation reactions from ABA3 to a reduced roGFP2 used as a model acceptor protein reveals that the ABA3-STR18 couple may represent an uncharacterized pathway of sulfur trafficking in the cytosol of plant cells. independent of ABA3 function in molybdenum cofactor maturation.,True,Kw_g2XgAAAAJ:cNe27ouKFcQC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.008375v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/25/2020.03.25.008375.full.pdf,0,0,0

Recent genomic analyses have highlighted this organism’s potential to produce polyketide and nonribosomal peptide secondary metabolites. but little is known regarding the identity and function of these metabolites. This study provides a detailed bioinformatic analysis of seven biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) present in the Csa genome that are predicted to produce polyketides/nonribosomal peptides.

University of California,Natural products are important small molecules widely used as drugs. pesticides. herbicides. and biological probes. Tagging natural products with a unique chemical handle enables the visualization. enrichment. quantification. and mode of action study of natural products through bioorthogonal chemistry23. 39. 49-51. One prevalent bioorthogonal reaction is the triazole-forming azide-alkyne [3+ 2] cycloaddition. often referred to as “click” chemistry. This reaction has enabled selective imaging and study of azide-or alkynelabeled glycans. proteins. nucleic acids and lipids. Despite the success with macromolecules. the labeling of natural products has not been adequately explored. It is often challenging to obtain tagged natural products through total synthesis because of their structural complexity. or through semi-synthesis because of their chemical lability and the limited supply of most natural products. Alternatively. precursor-directed biosynthesis (PDB) may be employed to produce azide-or alkyne-labeled natural products based on the promiscuity of biosynthetic machinery. Mainly used as a tool to introduce structural diversity. PDB has allowed us and other researchers to generate labeled natural products22. 23. 26. 28. 29. However. the coexistence of diffusible precursors and final products with the same chemical handle introduces significant background in the PDB production system. making it incompatible with in situ bioorthogonal chemical transformations.

India,Replacement of fish meal in marine shrimp feeds is assuming greater importance due to increasing economic  and ecological considerations. This study evaluated sunflower cake as a replacement for fish meal in tiger shrimp  Penaeus monodon juveniles reared both in tanks and in net cages at 26-33 ppt salinity. Five practical diets were prepared  by incorporating sunflower cake at 0. 2.5. 5. 7.5 and 10% level by replacing fish meal. The essential amino acid index (EAAI) of test diets ranged from 0.91 to 0.88. Growth and digestibility study was conducted for 45 d in 500 L experimental tanks shrimp weighing 0.51±0.02 g with three replications for each treatment. There were significant (P<0.05) reductions in daily growth coefficients and protein utilization efficiency in shrimp fed with diets having above 2.5% sunflower cake in experimental tanks. The lysine and methionine digestibility (92.4±0.11 and 93.4±0.01%. respectively) was significantly (P<0.05) higher at 2.5% level inclusion than at 10% level (81.67±0.12 and 83.36±0.17%. respectively). The free amino acid profiles of shrimp muscle at 4 h post feeding indicated  significantly (P<0.05) lower levels for isoleucine. leucine. lysine and valine in shrimp fed with higher level of sunflower cake. The decreased levels of these essential amino acids could have hampered protein synthesis and in turn growth. With three dietary treatments (0. 5 and 10% sunflower cake diets) a 10-week growth trial was also conducted in net cages with tiger shrimp juveniles weighing 0.2 g.

In the present study. soybean meal (SBM). groundnut oil cake (GNC). rapeseed meal (RSM). sunflower oil cake (SFC) and guar meal (GRM) were subjected to natural. bacterial. fungal and yeast fermentation methods. The essential amino acid contents were increased by 4-28% in SBM. 7-26% in GNC. 3-27% in RSM. 8-18% in SFC and 4-14% in GRM. The increase was better for lysine with fungal fermentation (2.31-4.01%). The improvement in other limiting amino acids viz.. methionine and tryptophan also showed positive response to fermentation. The analytical results showed improved essential amino acid index (EAAI) in the fermented ingredients and the increase was better with RSM (0.82 to 0.92) using Aspergillus niger. Fiber fractions were reduced (p< 0.05) in fungal and yeast treated samples but not due to natural or bacterial fermentation. The reduction of cellulose and hemicellulose was not only influenced by the inoculum but also on the ingredient used. The reduction of anti-nutrients (p< 0.05) such as trypsin inhibitor. phytic acid. saponin. tannin. glucosinolate and guar gum were found to be lower in natural fermentation than other methods.

Significantly higher (p< 0.05) growth was observed between 10 and 30‰ salinity. with specific growth rate and daily growth coefficient of 2.57-2.64 and 2.00-2.08 respectively. Poor survival of 26.66% was noticed at 60‰. Higher levels of protein and lipid as well as lower levels of moisture and ash were found in shrimp reared in high salinity water. Calcium level in whole shrimp was around 30 g kg-1 up to 30‰ and a gradual reduction was observed from 40 to 60‰(23.49 to16. 24 g kg-1). Sodium and potassium contents were significantly (p< 0.05) higher and lower respectively in hyper saline reared shrimp carcass. Ca: P ratio was almost constant at 3: 1 in shrimps reared up to 30‰ salinity and the ratio decreased beyond 30‰. The mineral profiles of water and shrimp were negatively correlated for calcium (-0.830). potassium (-708) and Ca: P ratio (-0.654).

A balanced diet containing all the essential nutrients is necessary to build a good health. Fish in this context. is a healthy food being rich in essential nutrients like quality animal proteins. polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) especially the ω-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and micronutrients. Apart from this. fish are more available and affordable than other animal proteins sources in tropical countries. Thus. nutritional composition of fish is required for its utilization in achieving nutritional security and ensuing good health and nutrition. In this context. we have studied the detailed nutritional composition of selected fishes from India and developed a database ‘NutriFishIN (http://www. cifri. res. in/nutrifishin/) with the food data generated.

Scylla serrata. Fish meat (tilapia). which is conventionally used for feeding mud crab by farmers was used as control. Crabs with average weight of 151.7 g were stocked in 500 l oval shaped FRP tanks containing seawater@ 2 crabs per tank with six replicates per treatment. The crabs were fed daily with dry pellets@ 10% of their body weight in a 30-day feeding trial. The crabs showed excellent acceptability of the compounded feed from the start and had shown a weight gain of 36.7% and a feed gain ratio (FGR) of 2.94. compared to 33.5% weight gain and 5.56 FGR shown by the crabs fed with fish meat. The amino acid profiles of the feed. fish meat and the crabs before and after the feeding trial showed that the ratio of indispensable amino acids (IAA) and the dispensable amino acids (DAA) is same (0.8) for both feeds. Performance of dry as well as semimoist form of pelleted feeds also studied. In a 30-day feeding trial. the weight gain of crabs fed dry feeds was significantly higher (p< 0.05) compared to moist feeds. It was due to the higher wastage of feed (30.4%) in semi-moist feeds compared to the dry feeds (17.2%). There was no difference in the FGR shown by different feeds. The proximate composition of crabs fed with the different forms of feed also did not show any variation.

These two events elicit an interacting series of changes in cholesterol dynamics. Hyperphagia increases dietary cholesterol intake and cholesterol synthesis by the small intestine. These increases are balanced by a decrease in cholesterol synthesis in the rest of the body so that total cholesterol input is normal. With growth failure. utilization of cholesterol for formation of new tissue ceases. This decrease is balanced by an increase in bile acid synthesis by the liver.

Total plasma cholesterol is elevated. and more subtle indices of sterol homeostasis are also deranged.Insulinization of the poorly controlled diabetic reduces fecal bile acid excretion. Fecal neutral sterol excretion increases compensatorily. at least when caloric intake is maintained during insulinization. Thus. net sterol balance is not changed by insulin treatment. again assuming the diet remains constant. Other workers have found decreased sterol synthesis after insulinization if calories are reduced. Using isotopically labeled squalene turnover as a reflection of cholesterol synthesis. insulin treatment increases the flux of squalene.Pursuing diabetes9 effect on cholesterol synthesis at a more basic level. we found that HMG-CoA reductase. the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. is increased in small intestine. and decreased in …,True,4MBe_kMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,34,https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/Supplement_2/76.short,5857604326241308639,/scholar?cites=5857604326241308639,,https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes/30/Supplement_2/76.full.pdf,0,0,0

Chromatographic peaks in order of polarity are: 3 H-α-ecdysone. 3 H-β-ecdysone. a metabolite with mobility similar to 26-OH-β-ecdysone. and a group of very polar metabolites which include glucose and sulfate conjugates. 3 H-α-ecdysone is irreversibly converted to 3 H-β-ecdysone with an apparent K m which greatly exceeds endogenous substrate levels. Therefore saturation by substrate is unlikely to be a rate limiting factor in the synthesis of endogenous β-ecdysone. The conversion is product inhibited with an apparent K I of the same order of magnitude as the maximal concentration of endogenous product. Therefore. product inhibition may be a rate limiting factor in vivo.

However. whether AKAPs play a role in the control of AC activity by Ca2+ is unknown.

Type 1 and 8 ACs (AC1 and AC8). which are both expressed in the brain and are stimulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM). have discrete neuronal functions. Although the Ca2+ sensitivity of AC1 is higher than that of AC8. precisely how these two ACs are regulated by Ca2+/CaM remains elusive. and the basis for their diverse physiological roles is quite unknown. Distinct localization of the CaM binding domains within the two enzymes may be essential to differential regulation of the ACs by Ca2+/CaM.

Adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) is a Ca2+ stimulated isoform that displays a selective regulation by capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). the process whereby the entry of Ca2+ into cells is triggered by the emptying of intracellular stores. This selectivity was believed to be achieved through the localization of AC8 in lipid raft microdomains. along with components of the CCE apparatus.

As cancer cells have increased NAD requirements. the main NAD salvage enzymes in humans. nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT). are involved in the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. Knowledge of the expression patterns of both genes in tissues and tumors is critical for the use of nicotinic acid (NA) as cytoprotective in therapies using NAMPT inhibitors. Herein. we provide a comprehensive study of NAPRT and NAMPT expression across human tissues and tumor cell lines.

Bactrocera oleae (Rossi. 1790)(Diptera: Tephritidae). is the most important pest of olive trees globally. causing losses that. in the absence of control measures. can exceed 90% of the crop. In the Mediterranean basin. where the overwhelming majority of production is concentrated (~ 98%). organophosphate insecticides (OPs) have been the main tool for B. oleae control for the last four decades. leading to the development of resistance to these compounds. Mutations of the Ace gene. which codes for acetylcholinesterase. the target enzyme of OPs and other insecticides. have been identified as the underlying cause. with studies reporting mid to very high frequencies of resistance alleles in several countries. Interestingly. no resistance alleles were detected in Portugal. at the Western end of the Mediterranean basin. As the original study was done almost a decade ago and did not include many samples. we decided to re-evaluate the situation. by analysing a larger number of individuals from multiple locations in Western and Southern Iberia (Portugal and Spain). In our present study. resistance-associated Ace alleles were found to have become widespread in both regions. but with highly varying frequencies. Together with the observed haplotype distributions. this finding is consistent with previous suggestions of a recent. selection-driven spread and has implications for the importance of Ace mutations in organophosphate resistance in the field as well as the importance of gene flow between Mediterranean populations of B. oleae.,True,F7s7QFMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barbara_Van_Asch/publication/274958570_Bactrocera_oleae_Diptera_Tephritidae_organophosphate_resistance_alleles_in_Iberia_Recent_expansion_and_variable_frequencies/links/5530e2660cf2f2a588ab4641/Bactrocera-oleae-Diptera-Tephritidae-organophosphate-resistance-alleles-in-Iberia-Recent-expansion-and-variable-frequencies.pdf,7269423920919365023,/scholar?cites=7269423920919365023,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barbara_Van_Asch/publication/274958570_Bactrocera_oleae_Diptera_Tephritidae_organophosphate_resistance_alleles_in_Iberia_Recent_expansion_and_variable_frequencies/links/5530e2660cf2f2a588ab4641/Bactrocera-oleae-Diptera-Tephritidae-organophosphate-resistance-alleles-in-Iberia-Recent-expansion-and-variable-frequencies.pdf,0,0,0

TCFs associate with β-catenin to activate transcription in the presence of Wnt signaling. but in its absence act as repressors together with Groucho-family proteins (GRGs). TCF4 is critical in vertebrate intestinal epithelium. where TCF4-β-catenin complexes are necessary for the maintenance of a proliferative compartment. and their abnormal formation initiates tumorigenesis. However. the extent of TCF4-GRG complexes’ roles in development and the mechanisms by which they repress transcription are not completely understood. Here we characterize the interaction between TCF4 and GRG5/AES. a Groucho family member whose functional relationship with TCFs has been controversial. We map the core GRG interaction region in TCF4 to a 111-amino acid fragment and show that. in contrast to other GRGs. GRG5/AES-binding specifically depends on a 4-amino acid motif (LVPQ) present only in TCF3 and some TCF4 isoforms. We further demonstrate that GRG5/AES represses Wnt-mediated transcription both in human cells and zebrafish embryos. Importantly. we provide the first evidence of an inherent repressive function of GRG5/AES in dorsal-ventral patterning during early zebrafish embryogenesis. These results improve our understanding of TCF-GRG interactions. have significant implications for models of transcriptional repression by TCF-GRG complexes. and lay the groundwork for in depth direct assessment of the potential role of Groucho-family proteins in both normal and abnormal …,True,F7s7QFMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,11,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067694,789503867600434739,/scholar?cites=789503867600434739,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067694,0,0,0

In particular. pathogens usurp the actin cytoskeleton function to strongly adhere to the host cell surface. to induce plasma membrane remodelling allowing invasion and to spread from cell to cell and disseminate to the whole organism. Keratins are cytoskeletal proteins that are the major components of intermediate filaments in epithelial cells however. their role in bacterial infection has been disregarded. Here we investigate the role of the major epithelial keratins. keratins 8 and 18 (K8 and K18). in the cellular infection by Listeria monocytogenes. We found that K8 and K18 are required for successful InlB/cMet-dependent L. monocytogenes infection. but are dispensable for InlA/E-cadherin-mediated invasion. Both K8 and K18 accumulate at InlB-mediated internalization sites following actin recruitment and modulate actin dynamics at those sites. We also reveal the key role of K8 and K18 in HGF-induced signaling which occurs downstream the activation of cMet. Strikingly. we show here that K18. and at a less extent K8. controls the expression of cMet and other surface receptors such TfR and integrin 1. by promoting the stability of their corresponding transcripts.

Since PDF is crucial in maintaining mitochondrial function and given the atypical short distance between the end of COG8 coding sequence and the PDF initiation codon. we investigated whether the regulation of the human PDF is affected by the COG8 overlapping partner.

Bactrocera oleae. is the most important pest affecting the olive industry. to which it is estimated to cause average annual losses in excess of one billion dollars. As with other insects with a wide distribution. it is generally accepted that the understanding of B. oleae population structure and dynamics is fundamental for the design and implementation of effective monitoring and control strategies. However. and despite important advances in the past decade. a clear picture of B. oleae's population structure is still lacking. In the Mediterranean basin. where more than 95% of olive production is concentrated. evidence from several studies suggests the existence of three distinct sub-populations. but the geographical limits of their distributions. and the level of interpenetration and gene flow among them remain ill-characterized. Here we use mitochondrial haplotype analysis to show that one of the Mediterranean mitochondrial lineages displays geographically correlated substructure and demonstrate that Italic populations. though markedly distinct from their Iberian and Levantine counterparts are more diverse than previously described. Finally. we show that this distinction does not result from extant hypothetical geographic limits imposed by the Alps or the Pyrenees nor. more generally. does it result from any sharp boundary. as intermixing is observed in a broad area. albeit at variable levels.

In this work. the evolutionary history and origin of a same-strand gene overlap is dissected through the analysis of COG8 (component of oligomeric Golgi complex 8) and PDF (peptide deformylase). Comparative genomic surveys reveal that the relative locations of these two genes have been changing over the last 445 million years from distinct chromosomal locations in fish to overlapping in rodents and primates. indicating that the overlap between these genes precedes their divergence.

Yet. a connection between phase separation and chromatin compaction has not been experimentally demonstrated. More fundamentally. how HP1 action at the level of a single nucleosome drives chromatin compaction remains poorly understood. Here we directly demonstrate that the S. pombe HP1 protein. Swi6. compacts arrays of multiple nucleosomes into phase-separated droplets. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange. NMR. and mass-spectrometry. we further find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within a mononucleosome. Restraining these dynamics via site-specific disulfide bonds impairs the compaction of nucleosome arrays into phase-separated droplets. Our results indicate that chromatin compaction and phase separation can be highly coupled processes. Further. we find that such coupling is promoted by a counter-intuitive function of Swi6. namely disorganization of the octamer core. Phase separation is canonically mediated by weak and dynamic multivalent interactions. We propose that dynamic exposure of buried histone residues increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes. thereby coupling chromatin compaction to phase separation.

At present. nifurtimox and benznidazole. both compounds developed empirically over four decades ago. represent the chemotherapeutic arsenal for treating this highly neglected disease. However. both drugs present variable efficacy depending on the geographical area and the occurrence of natural resistance. and are poorly effective against the later chronic stage. As a part of a search for new therapeutic opportunities to treat chagasic patients. pre-clinical studies were performed to characterize the activity of a novel arylimidamide (AIA - DB1831 (hydrochloride salt) and DB1965 (mesylate salt)) against T.cruzi. These AIAs displayed a high trypanocidal effect in vitro against both relevant forms in mammalian hosts. exhibiting a high selectivity index and a very high efficacy (IC50 value/48 h of 5–40 nM) against intracellular parasites. DB1965 shows high activity in vivo in acute experimental models (mouse) of T.cruzi. showing a similar effect to benznidazole (Bz) when compared under a scheme of 10 daily consecutive doses with 12.5 mg/kg. Although no parasitological cure was observed after treating with 20 daily consecutive doses. a combined dosage of DB1965 (5 mg/kg) with Bz (50 mg/kg) resulted in parasitaemia clearance and 100% animal survival.

Heidelberg,This chapter describes apoptosis as an active process of cellular deconstruction and compares it morphologically with necrosis. In contrast to necrosis. apoptosis involves the regulated action of catabolic enzymes (proteases and nucleases) within the limits of near-to-intact plasma membranes. It also involves the activation of specific caspases that cleave at specific sites after aspartic acid residues.

In this study. we determined the prevalence of anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (anaerobic CODHs. or [Ni.Fe]-CODHs) in currently available genomic sequence databases. More than 6% (185 genomes out of 2887 bacterial and archaeal genome sequences in the IMG database) possess at least one gene encoding [Ni.Fe]-CODH. the key enzyme for anaerobic CO utilization. The phylogenetic study of this extended protein family revealed nine distinct clades of [Ni.Fe]-CODHs. These clades consisted of [Ni.Fe]-CODHs that. while apparently monophyletic within the clades. were encoded by microorganisms of disparate phylogeny. based on 16S rRNA sequences. and widely ranging physiology. Following this discovery. it was therefore of interest to examine the extent and possible routes of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) affecting [Ni.Fe]-CODH genes and gene clusters that include [Ni.Fe]-CODHs. The genome sequence of the extreme thermophile Thermosinus carboxydivorans was used as a case study for HGT. The [Ni.Fe]-CODH operon of T. carboxydivorans differs from its whole genome in its G+C content by 8.2 mol%. Here. we apply statistical methods to establish acquisition by T. carboxydivorans of the gene cluster including [Ni.Fe]-CODH via HGT.

Distinct water masses are present throughout the oceans. which drive thermohaline circulation. These water masses may contain specific microbial assemblages. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of physical and geological phenomena on the microbial community of the Eastern Mediterranean water column. Chemical measurements were combined with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial community in the water column at five sites. We demonstrate that the chemistry and microbial community of the water column were stratified into three distinct water masses. The salinity and nutrient concentrations vary between these water masses. Nutrient concentrations increased with depth. and salinity was highest in the intermediate water mass. Our PLFA analysis indicated different lipid classes were abundant in each water mass. suggesting that distinct groups of microbes inhabit these water masses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed the presence of distinct microbial communities in each water mass. Taxa involved in autotrophic nitrogen cycling were enriched in the intermediate water mass suggesting that microbes in this water mass may be important to the nitrogen cycle of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Microbial utilization of CO is quite common. evidenced by the rapid escalation in description of new species of CO-utilizing bacteria and archaea. Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). the protein complex that enables anaerobic CO utilization has been well-characterized from an increasing number of microorganisms. however the regulation of multiple CO-related gene clusters in single isolates remains unexplored. Many species are extroraordinarily resistant to high CO concentrations. thiriving under pure CO at more than one atmosphere. We hypothesized that. in strains that can grow exclusively on CO. both carbon acquisition via the CODH/Acetyl CoA synthase complex and energy conservation via a CODH-linked hydrogenase must be differentially regulated in response to the availability of CO. The CO-sensing transcriptional activator. CooA is present in most CO-oxidizing bacteria.

The phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity of three strains of Colwellia psychrerythraea was investigated in order to understand adaptions to local environments. Colwellia are psychrophilic heterotrophic marine bacteria ubiquitous in cold marine ecosystems.

This Vif-directed ubiquitin ligase induces the degradation of APOBEC3G (a cytidine deaminase) and thereby protects the viral genome from mutation. A conserved PPLP motif near the C-terminus of Vif is essential for Vif function and is also involved in Vif oligomerization. However. the mechanism and functional significance of Vif oligomerization is unclear. We employed analytical ultracentrifugation to examine the oligomeric properties of Vif in solution. Contrary to previous reports. we find that Vif oligomerization does not require the conserved PPLP motif.

In a common experimental design. two units. one control and one experimental. are sampled before and after the treatment is applied to the experimental unit. The four resulting samples contain information about the dynamics of organisms that respond to the treatment. but there are no analytical methods designed to extract exactly this type of information from this configuration of samples. Here we present an analytical method specifically designed to visualize and generate hypotheses about microbial community dynamics in experiments that have paired samples and few or no replicates.

To demonstrate the method’s validity and potential. we analyzed an experiment that measured the effect of crude oil on ocean microbial communities in microcosm. Our method identified known oil degraders as well as two clades. Maricurvus and Rhodobacteraceae. that responded to amendment with oil but do not include known oil degraders.

Mature seeds were harvested and stored at 33°-36°C. 23.5°C. 13.5°C. and 5°C for 0 to 105 days. Seeds from each storage temperature were studied for the moisture loss during storage as well as germinability at different time intervals. While the seeds stored at room temperature (33°-36°C) lost their viability within 11 days. the viability was prolonged at temperatures of 13.5° and 23.5°C. The rapid loss in seed moisture at higher (33°-36°C) and near freezing (5°C) temperatures seems to be the primary cause of loss in viability.

Nanoscience involves the study of materials on the nanoscale level between approximately 1 and 100 nm [1]. The demand of nanoparticles is increasing due to their wide application in various areas.The use of gold nanoparticles dates back to the 16th century. for both medical and staining purposes. Thereafter. gold nanoparticles have found application in analytical methods. such as colorimetric techniques for the determination of heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions [2]. One of the other major applications of nanotechnology is in biomedicine. Gold nanoparticles have been investigated in diverse areas such as in vitro assays. in vitro and in vivo imaging. cancer therapy. and drug delivery [3]. Nanoparticles can be further designed into multi-functional delivery systems with a tumor-specific targeting moiety. therapeutic payload. and diagnostic tool (imaging or biochemical sensor) that enables monitoring of therapeutic efficacy [4. 5. 6]. Nanoparticles synthesized by chemical methods are energy intensive processes and a large amount of capital is involved. The use of hazardous chemicals makes the method non eco-friendly. Thus. there is a need for ‘green chemistry’that includes a clean. nontoxic and environmentfriendly method of nanoparticle synthesis [7]. Moreover nanoparticles produced by these methods exhibit aggregation with time. there by compromising with the size factor upon storage [8. 9].

Here. we integrate information from association studies with epigenomic maps to demonstrate that enhancers significantly overlap known loci associated with the cardiac QT interval and QRS duration. We apply functional criteria to identify loci associated with QT interval that do not meet genome-wide significance and are missed by existing studies. We demonstrate that these 'sub-threshold' signals represent novel loci. and that epigenomic maps are effective at discriminating true biological signals from noise. We experimentally validate the molecular. gene-regulatory. cellular and organismal phenotypes of these sub-threshold loci. demonstrating that most sub-threshold loci have regulatory consequences and that genetic perturbation of nearby genes causes cardiac phenotypes in mouse.

Divergent regions of amino acid sequence of H2A.Z likely determine its functional specialization compared to core histone H2A. For example. H2A.Z contains three divergent residues in the essential C-terminal acidic patch that reside on the surface of the histone octamer as an uninterrupted acidic patch domain; however. we know little about how these residues contribute to chromatin structure and function. Here. we show that the divergent amino acids Gly92. Asp97. and Ser98 in the H2A.Z C-terminal acidic patch (H2A.ZAP3) are critical for lineage commitment during ESC differentiation. H2A.Z is enriched at most H3K4me3 promoters in ESCs including poised. bivalent promoters that harbor both activating and repressive marks. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 respectively. We found that while H2A.ZAP3 interacted with its deposition complex and displayed a highly similar distribution pattern compared to wild-type H2A.Z. its enrichment levels were reduced at target promoters. Further analysis revealed that H2A.ZAP3 was less tightly associated with chromatin. suggesting that the mutant is more dynamic. Notably. bivalent genes in H2A.ZAP3 ESCs displayed significant changes in expression compared to active genes. Moreover. bivalent genes in H2A.ZAP3 ESCs gained H3.3. a variant associated with higher nucleosome turnover. compared to wild-type H2A.Z.

Here. we use a synthetic. photochemically activated derivative of FR400482 to investigate the molecular mechanism of this class of drugs in a biologically relevant context. We find that the organization of DNA into nucleosomes effectively protects it against drug-mediated crosslinking. while permitting monoalkylation. This modification has the potential to lead to the formation of covalent crosslinks between chromatin and nuclear proteins.

Hybrid QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations for the Kemp elimination in this new enzyme have provided a deep insight into the origin of its catalytic efficiency.

It is widely accepted that plants also interact. but the degree of this interaction has been constricted to competition for space. nutrients. water and light. Here. we analyzed the root secreted metabolites and proteins involved in early plant neighbor recognition by using Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 ecotype (Col) as our focal plant co-cultured in vitro with different neighbors [A. thaliana Ler ecotype (Ler) or Capsella rubella (Cap)]. Principal component and cluster analyses revealed that both root secreted secondary metabolites and proteins clustered separately between the plants grown individually (Col-0. Ler and Cap grown alone) and the plants co-cultured with two homozygous individuals (Col-Col. Ler-Ler and Cap-Cap) or with different individuals (Col-Ler and Col-Cap). In particularly. we observed that a greater number of defense- and stress- related proteins were secreted when our control plant. Col. was grown alone as compared to when it was co-cultured with another homozygous individual (Col-Col) or with a different individual (Col-Ler and Col-Cap). However. the total amount of defense proteins in the exudates of the co-cultures was higher than in the plant alone. The opposite pattern of expression was identified for stress-related proteins. These data suggest that plants can sense and respond to the presence of different plant neighbors and that the level of relatedness is perceived upon initial interaction.

Therefore. the aim of this study was to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms of the receptor gene for the hormone melatonin in buffaloes from northern Brazil by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. The PCR products exhibited a cutting point for HpaI at the 318th position of the gene. indicating a transition substitution (T↔ C). This substitution was synonymic. and did not alter the stability of the mRNA structure. Allelic and genotypic frequencies differed between the populations studied. and all of the populations demonstrated endogamy and were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

We surveyed 17 accessions of mashua collected from Quechua farmers in the provinces of Cuzco and Ayacucho. Peru. Most cross-reacted with the TropMV antibody and showed viral disease symptoms. Significant differences were observed between accessions from Cuzco and Ayacucho. with respect to virus infection and tuber yield under greenhouse conditions. Of the accessions from Cuzco. 87% displayed viral symptoms. while only 22% from Ayacucho showed symptoms. Fewer tubers from Cuzco generated mature plants. In turn. those mature plants produced lower tuber yields. The practice of trading seed tubers may be advantageous for promoting crop diversity but can be harmful when diseased seed tubers are being traded.

ATP synthases interconvert two forms of free energy: they are driven by the proton-motive force across an energy-transducing membrane to synthesize ATP and displace the ADP/ATP ratio from equilibrium. For thermodynamically efficient energy conversion they must be reversible catalysts. However. in many species ATP synthases are unidirectional catalysts (their rates of ATP hydrolysis are negligible). and in others mechanisms have evolved to regulate or minimize hydrolysis. Unidirectional catalysis by Paracoccus denitrificans ATP synthase has been attributed to its unique ζ subunit. which is structurally analogous to the mammalian inhibitor protein IF1.

We and others have previously suggested that peroxisome proliferation as a result of abiotic stress may be important in plant stress responses. and recently it was reported that several rice PEX11 genes were up regulated in response to abiotic stress. We sought to test the hypothesis that promoting peroxisome proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana by over expression of one PEX11 family member. PEX11e. would give increased resistance to salt stress. We could demonstrate up regulation of PEX11e by salt stress and increased peroxisome number by both PEX11e over expression and salt stress. however our experiments failed to find a correlation between PEX11e over expression and increased peroxisome metabolic activity or resistance to salt stress.

Despite the numerous components of the import machinery identified by proteomics. the properties of hydrophobic import substrates remain poorly understood. Recent studies support several principles for these membrane proteins: first. they become organized into partially assembled forms within the translocon; second. they present noncontiguous targeting signals; and third. they induce conformational changes in translocase subunits. thereby mediating ‘assembly on demand’ of the import machinery. It is possible that the energy needed for these proteins to pass across the outer membrane. to travel through the intermembrane space and to target the inner-membrane surface is provided by conformational changes involving import components that …,True,kEmWT6oAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000406000831,1677653181796508078,/scholar?cites=1677653181796508078,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.334.2568&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1073000,Lactate consumption mediates repeated high-intensity interval exercise-enhanced executive function in adult males,2020,Hae-Sung Cho and Won Sang Lee and Kyeong Jin Yoon and Soo Hong Park and Hyung Eun Shin and Yeon-Soo Kim and Hyukki Chang and Hyo Youl Moon,24,Physical Activity and Nutrition,4,15-23,Korean Society for Exercise Nutrition,[Purpose]Lactate is a principal energy substrate for the brain during exercise. A single bout of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) can increase the blood lactate level. brain lactate uptake. and executive function (EF). However. repeated HIIE can attenuate exercise-induced increases in lactate level and EF. The lactate levels in the brain and blood are reported to be correlated with exercise-enhanced EF. However. research is yet to explain the cause-and-effect relationship between lactate and EF. This study examined whether lactate consumption improves the attenuated exerciseenhanced EF caused by repeated HIIE.[Methods]Eleven healthy men performed two sets of HIIE. and after each set. 30 min were given for rest and examination. In the 2 nd set. the subjects consumed experimental beverages containing (n= 6) and not containing (n= 5) lactate. Blood. cardiovascular. and psychological variables were measured. and EF was evaluated by the computerized color-word Stroop test.[Results]The lactate group had a higher EF (P< 0.05) and tended to have a higher blood lactate level (P= 0.082) than the control group in the 2 nd set of HIIE. Moreover. blood lactate concentration was correlated with the interference score (ie. reverse score of EF)(r=-0.394; P< 0.05).[Conclusion]Our results suggest that the attenuated exercise-enhanced EF after repeated HIIE can be improved through lactate consumption. However. the role of lactate needs to be elucidated in future studies. as it can be used for improving athletes’ performance and also in cognitive decline-related clinical studies.,True,duRbJcsAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,0,https://www.e-pan.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.20463/pan.2020.0023,,,,https://www.e-pan.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.20463/pan.2020.0023,0,0,0

Aph-1 and Pen-2. γ-Secretase is crucial for the generation of the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) but also takes part in the processing of many other substrates. In cell lines. active γ-secretase has been found to localize primarily to the Golgi apparatus. endosomes and plasma membranes. However. no thorough studies have been performed to show the subcellular localization of the active γ-secretase in the affected organ of AD. namely the brain.  Principal Findings We show by subcellular fractionation of rat brain that high γ-secretase activity. as assessed by production of Aβ40. is present in an endosome- and plasma membrane-enriched fraction of an iodixanol gradient. We also prepared crude synaptic vesicles as well as synaptic membranes and both fractions showed high Aβ40 production and contained high amounts of the γ-secretase components. Further purification of the synaptic vesicles verified the presence of the γ-secretase components in these compartments. The localization of an active γ-secretase in synapses and endosomes was confirmed in rat brain sections and neuronal cultures by using a biotinylated γ-secretase inhibitor together with confocal microscopy.  Significance The information about the subcellular localization of γ-secretase in brain is important for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD. Furthermore. the identified fractions can be used as sources for highly active γ-secretase.,True,DprR7zcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,71,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008948,3295427358561197106,/scholar?cites=3295427358561197106,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008948,0,0,0

Amsterdam: Elsevier Science BV",,76-83,,Pectins from the soft tissue of higher plants. in many ways the land-based counterpart of alginate in sea plants. have yet found only negligible applications in biochemical technology. Despite this lack of interest. evidence of their unique properties exists. favouring especially pectates (de< 3%) as the most attractive material within the family of pectin biopolymers [1]. Like with alginate. ionotropic gelation of pectate is simple and inexpensive. It also provides mild and physiological conditions for cell entrapment [1-4]. Calcium pectate gel (CPG) is not only an alternative to calcium alginate gel (CAG); various advantages of CPG over CAG have been recognized [1. 2. 5. 6]. In particular. CPG beads are less sensitive to ions and chemical agents which destroy CAG beads [2. 6]; the stability constant of calcium pectate is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of calcium alginate [5]. Probably due to this fact. the operational stability of bead-entrapped yeasts in the horizontal column reactor was higher than that of the reference material. ie. CAG [3. 6]. However. CPG beads must be stabilized and hardened when used continuously. Thus. preformed beads were treated with polyethylenimine (PEI) followed by glutaraldehyde (GA). In this way. a layer was formed which increased substantially the stability of the CPG beads towards Ca2+-complexing reagents (eg phosphate. citrate). lowered pH. as well as to mechanical stress. Stabilization and hardening of CPG beads did not substantially change their morphologic properties. such as the porosity. pore size distribution. size-exclusion limit or plasticity.

Recent biochemical studies by a chemically-defined reconstitution approach reveal that. in addition to the structurally-diverse classic tethering factors such as coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes. Rab-family small GTPases also retain the inherent membrane tethering functions to directly and physically bridge two distinct lipid bilayers by themselves.

1073147,The hinge segment of human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in conformational switching: the critical role of ionic strength,2017,Diana Campelo and Thomas Lautier and Philippe Urban and Francisco Esteves and Sophie Bozonnet and Gilles Truan and Michel Kranendonk,8,Frontiers in pharmacology,,755,Frontiers,NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is a redox partner of microsomal cytochrome P450s and is a prototype of the diflavin reductase family. CPR contains 3 distinct functional domains: a FMN-binding domain (acceptor reduction). a linker (hinge). and a connecting/FAD domain (NADPH oxidation). It has been demonstrated that the mechanism of CPR exhibits an important step in which it switches from a compact. closed conformation (locked state) to an ensemble of open conformations (unlocked state). the latter enabling electron transfer to redox partners. The conformational equilibrium between the locked and unlocked states has been shown to be highly dependent on ionic strength. reinforcing the hypothesis of the presence of critical salt interactions at the interface between the FMN and connecting FAD domains. Here we show that specific residues of the hinge segment are important in the control of the conformational equilibrium of CPR. We constructed six single mutants and two double mutants of the human CPR. targeting residues G240. S243. I245 and R246 of the hinge segment. with the aim of modifying the flexibility or the potential ionic interactions of the hinge segment. We measured the reduction of cytochrome c at various salt concentrations of these 8 mutants. either in the soluble or membrane-bound form of human CPR. All mutants were found capable of reducing cytochrome c yet with different efficiency and their maximal rates of cytochrome c reduction were shifted to lower salt concentration. In particular. residue R246 seems to play a key role in a salt bridge network present at the interface of the hinge and the connecting …,True,19xCQwkAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,14,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2017.00755/full,14936124975605960753,/scholar?cites=14936124975605960753,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2017.00755/full,0,0,0

CPR exists in a conformational equilibrium between open and closed conformations throughout its electron transfer (ET) function. Previously. we have shown that electrostatic and flexibility properties of the hinge segment of CPR are critical for ET. Three mutants of human CPR were studied (S243P. I245P and R246A) and combined with representative human drug-metabolizing CYPs (isoforms 1A2. 2A6 and 3A4). To probe the effect of these hinge mutations different experimental approaches were employed: CYP bioactivation capacity of pre-carcinogens. enzyme kinetic analysis. and effect of the ionic strength and cytochrome b 5 (CYB5) on CYP activity. The hinge mutations influenced the bioactivation of pre-carcinogens. which seemed CYP isoform and substrate dependent. The deviations of Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters uncovered tend to confirm this discrepancy. which was confirmed by CYP and hinge mutant specific salt/activity profiles. CPR/CYB5 competition experiments indicated a less important role of affinity in CPR/CYP interaction. Overall. our data suggest that the highly flexible hinge of CPR is responsible for the existence of a conformational aggregate of different open CPR conformers enabling ET-interaction with structural varied redox partners.

The Na+ channel blocking activity of verapamil and its implication to changes in repolarisation were studied on chicken ventricular strips where upstroke is due to highly TTX sensitive Na+ channels. At low doses verapamil (0.5-5 micro M) and TTX (0.1-0.5 nM) did not cause any significant effect on resting membrane potential (Em). maximal upstroke velocity (+ Vmax) or AP duration (ADP). Higher concentrations of both verapamil (10-320 micro M) and TTX (1-40 nM) caused dose-dependent decrease in+ Vmax and overshoot (Eov) without any change in Em. EC50 for the inhibitory effect of verapamil and TTX on+ Vmax was 140 microM and 14 nM respectively. Na+ channels in adult chicken ventricular myocardium. therefore. seem to be more sensitive to TTX than their mammalian counterpart. Higher dosage of verapamil are needed to block Na+ channels in adult avian heart as reported for mammalian myocardium. Both verapamil and TTX caused dose-dependent changes in APD at-20 mV (ADP20) and at 90% repolarisation (APD90).

Bay-K-8644. isoproterenol. forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP on spontaneous AP of freshly isolated 3 day embryonic chick ventricle (3 day ECV).

Bay-K-8644 (0.1-0.8 microM). isoproterenol (5-10 pM) and forskolin (0.1-2.0 microM) induced a concentration-dependent increase in APD20 and Eov without affecting+ Vmax. Dibutyryl-cAMP (1 microM) also enhanced the APD20 and Eov and had no effect on+ Vmax. Elevation of [Ca2+] 0 from 0.6 mM to 9.6 mM caused a concentration-dependent increase in APD20 and Eov leaving+ Vmax unaltered. Elevated [Ca2+] and the other Ca2+ channel activators had no significant effect on MDP in above concentration range. Increase in APD20 and Eov could be explained at least by activation of slow Ca2+ channels but the lack of any change in+ Vmax clearly suggests that the slow Ca2+ channels do not contribute to the upstroke of AP. All these interventions reduced the rate of spontaneous firing without any noticeable effect on MDP. This finding shows that the slow Ca2+ channels also do not contribute directly to the generation of pacemaker potential in spontaneously active freshly isolated 3 day ECV.,True,jlNsL-AAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C,0,https://europepmc.org/article/med/17051731,,,,,0,0,0

The 3-day ECV exhibited prominent automaticity and spontaneous APs characterized by maximum upstroke velocity (+Vmax). maximum diastolic potential (MDP). overshoot (Eov). AP duration at -20 mV (APD₂₀) and cycle length (CL) of 33.09±3.18 V/sec. -63.77±1.17 mV. 17.40±0.91 mV. 51.20±3.05 m sec and 795±150 m sec. respectively (n= 10 preparations). 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM) caused significant increase in Eov and APD₂₀ (37% and 56%. respectively. p<0.01). but failed to produce any stimulatory effect on +Vmax and MDP. Surprisingly. 8-Br-cAMP produced negative chronotropic effect on spontaneous firing (automaticity) and enhanced the CL significantly by 43% (p<0.05). 8-Br-cGMP. however. had no effect on AP configuration and the rate of spontaneous firing. The present findings with 8-Br-cAMP suggest that L-type slow Ca²⁺ channels do not contribute to upstroke of AP and pacemaker potential of spontaneously firing freshly isolated 3-day ECV. The negative chronotropic effect of 8-Br-cAMP suggests that the ionic mechanism underlying pacemaker potential is [Ca]i-dependent.

1073214,Influence of storage on darkening and hardening of slow-and regular-darkening carioca bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes,2014,Beatriz dos Santos Siqueira and Wendell Jacinto Pereira and Karla de Aleluia Batista and B Dave Oomah and Kátia Flávia Fernandes and Priscila Zaczuk Bassinello,,,,,Estados unidos,New carioca bean cultivars are being introduced into the market necessitating their evaluation under trade conditions. which often require storage under ambient conditions. We therefore evaluated the darkening and hardening processes of six carioca bean genotypes each representing regular and slow darkening trait during storage under ambient conditions for five months to elucidate their relationship as a breeding strategy. Storage time adversely affected color characteristics (L*. a*. b*. C* and ΔE) depending on bean genotype. whereas hardness and resistance to cooking increased during storage independent of the lignification process. Bean darkening and hardening occurred during storage at different intensities in each genotype and were not always correlated. BRSMG-Madrepérola. a slow darkening genotype. was unaffected (resistant to storage conditions). whereas BRS-Pontal with regular tegument darkening. was highly susceptible to storage conditions reflected in extended cooking time and darkening (low L* values). Principal component and cluster analyses on 8 constituents analyzed in this study demonstrate the difference in color characteristics. cooking time and hardness as major factors in segregating the bean genotypes. Seed coat color is an important but inappropriate single parameter for predicting the resistance to cooking or hardness induced by storage of carioca beans under ambient conditions.

The film presented malleability and mechanical properties enabling an easy handling. Wetting the film changed the optical property from opacity to levels of transparency higher than 70% and resulted in up to 2-fold increase in its superficial area. Different swelling indexes were obtained varying the pH of solvent. which allows classifying the CGP/PVA film as pH sensitive stimuli-responsive material. The bioactivity was achieved through covalent immobilization of papain. which remained active after storage of CGP/PVA-papain film for 24 h in the presence of buffer or in a dry form.

1073249,Proteomics and models for enzyme cooperativity,2002,Daniel E Koshland and Kambiz Hamadani,277,,49,46841-46844,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Cooperativity is a phenomenon of universal importance in biological systems and has almost as much variety as it has ubiquity. In virtually all ecosystems the cooperativity of groups. species. and individual organisms is evident. The cooperativity known as “mutualism” is one in which one species provides a haven or a metabolic advantage to another species. On a more microscopic level is the “metabolic cooperativity” in which an enzyme or substrate of one pathway can cooperate with another pathway by providing a component that can act as a substrate or a regulator of that pathway. Delving deeper into the molecular realm we find the type of cooperativity that will be the focus of this review:“allosteric cooperativity”(1. 2). The term “allosteric” has been used to describe a ligand-enzyme interaction. which results in a measurable conformational change in proximal and distal regions of that protein. We will categorize as a subdivision of allosteric cooperativity the phenomenon of i3 cooperativity in which the three following conditions are met:(a) the binding of the ligand induces a conformational change in the protein;(b) the conformational changes are intramolecular in the subunits of a multisubunit enzyme; and (c) the sites are initially essentially identical to each other. This type of cooperativity. which has since been shown in many enzymes. receptors. and ion channels. is of critical importance to both evolution and the field of proteomics because it can serve as a general model for the way in which the networks of interacting enzymes of metabolic pathways are regulated. Because these networks of interactions explain a lot of the factors that control …,True,Sd-KMN8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,170,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kambiz_Hamadani/publication/11198800_Proteomics_and_Models_for_Enzyme_Cooperativity/links/54ad6f250cf24aca1c6f511a.pdf,4566904420538119903,/scholar?cites=4566904420538119903,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kambiz_Hamadani/publication/11198800_Proteomics_and_Models_for_Enzyme_Cooperativity/links/54ad6f250cf24aca1c6f511a.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,Cooperative protein folding requires distant regions of a protein to interact and provide mutual stabilization. The mechanism of this long‐distance coupling remains poorly understood. Here. we use T4 lysozyme (T4L*) as a model to investigate long‐range communications across two subdomains of a globular protein. T4L* is composed of two structurally distinct subdomains. although it behaves in a two‐state manner at equilibrium. The subdomains of T4L* are connected via two topological connections: the N‐terminal helix that is structurally part of the C‐terminal subdomain (the A‐helix) and a long helix that spans both subdomains (the C‐helix). To understand the role that the C‐helix plays in cooperative folding. we analyzed a circularly permuted version of T4L* (CP13*). whose subdomains are connected only by the C‐helix.

DSB repair pathways serve as important mechanisms for tumor suppression. Thus. genetic lesions. such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. that disrupt DSB repair are often associated with cancer susceptibility. In addition. recent evidence suggests that DSB “mis-repair”. in which DSBs are resolved by an inappropriate repair pathway. can also promote genomic instability and presumably tumorigenesis. This notion has gained currency from recent cancer genome sequencing studies which have uncovered numerous chromosomal rearrangements harboring pathological DNA repair signatures.

Ltd,Chromosomal DNA replication is strictly regulated through a sequence of steps that involve many macromolecular protein complexes. One of these is the GINS complex. which is required for initiation and elongation phases in eukaryotic DNA replication. The GINS complex consists of four paralogous subunits. At the G1/S transition. GINS is recruited to the origins of replication where it assembles with cell‐division cycle protein (Cdc)45 and the minichromosome maintenance mutant (MCM)2–7 to form the Cdc45/Mcm2–7/GINS (CMG) complex. the presumed replicative helicase.

DNA synthesis takes place at defined nuclear structures termed “replication foci” (RF) that follow the same order of activation in each cell cycle. Intriguingly. immunofluorescence studies have failed to visualize the DNA helicase minichromosome maintenance (MCM) at RF. raising doubts about its physical presence at the sites of DNA synthesis. We have revisited this paradox by pulse-labeling RF during the S phase and analyzing the localization of MCM at labeled DNA in the following cell cycle. Using high-throughput confocal microscopy. we provide direct evidence that MCM proteins concentrate in G1 at the chromosome structures bound to become RF in the S phase. Upon initiation of DNA synthesis. an active “MCM eviction” mechanism contributes to reduce the excess of DNA helicases at RF.

Transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) is known to transiently-enhance the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [5]. allowing intravenously administered therapeutics to enter the brain [6]–[8]. Our goal was to establish that anti-Aβ antibodies delivered to the brain using magnetic resonance imaging-guided FUS (MRIgFUS) [9] can reduce plaque pathology. To test this. TgCRND8 mice [10] received intravenous injections of MRI and FUS contrast agents. as well as anti-Aβ antibody. BAM-10. MRIgFUS was then applied transcranially. Within minutes. the MRI contrast agent entered the brain. and BAM-10 was later found bound to Aβ plaques in targeted cortical areas. Four days post-treatment.

For stem cells to progress towards clinical use. the risks associated with invasive intracranial surgery used to deliver the cells to the brain. needs to be reduced. Here. we show that MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRIgFUS) is a novel method for non-invasive delivery of stem cells from the blood to the brain by opening the blood brain barrier (BBB) in specific brain regions. We used MRI guidance to target the ultrasound beam thereby delivering the iron-labeled. green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing neural stem cells specifically to the striatum and the hippocampus of the rat brain. Detection of cellular iron using MRI established that the cells crossed the BBB to enter the brain. After sacrifice. 24 hours later. immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of GFP-positive cells in the targeted brain regions. We determined that the neural stem cells expressed common stem cell markers (nestin and polysialic acid) suggesting they survived after transplantation with MRIgFUS. Furthermore. delivered stem cells expressed doublecortin in vivo indicating the stem cells were capable of differentiating into neurons. Together. we demonstrate that transient opening of the BBB with MRIgFUS is sufficient for transplantation of stem cells from the blood to targeted brain structures.

Here. we provide evidence that degeneration of adult axons occurs in the intact rodent brain through a p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR)-and myelin-dependent mechanism. Specifically. we show that p75NTR-mediated axonal degeneration prevents septal cholinergic axons from aberrantly growing onto myelinated tracts in vivo or on a myelin substrate in culture. Myelin also triggers local degeneration of p75NTR-expressing sympathetic axons that is rescued by increasing TrkA signaling or elevating intracellular cyclic AMP.

La inmunorreactividad del PPAR-γ se observó en neuronas de la corteza cerebral y en astrocitos distribuidos de manera heterogénea en las láminas de la I a la V de la corteza cerebral. La densidad relativa de neuronas y astrocitos inmunopositivos fue significativamente mayor respecto al control en el giro frontal inferior y temporal superior de individuos con diagnóstico de enfermedad de Alzheimer. Las células inmunopositivas para la proteína acídica fibrilar glial se observaron organizadas en «coronas». clásicamente descritas rodeando las placas neuríticas.

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However. ordinary biases in human reasoning. such as hindsight bias. make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application. such as when the data are preexisting.

It has been previously proposed that the U2 snRNA adopts two conformations within the stem II region: stem IIa or stem IIc. Dynamic rearrangement of stem IIa into IIc and vice versa is necessary for proper progression of the spliceosome through assembly and catalysis. How this conformational transition is regulated is unclear; although. proteins such as Cus2p and the helicase Prp5p have been implicated in this process. We have used single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study U2 stem II toggling between stem IIa and IIc. Structural interconversion of the RNA was spontaneous and did not require the presence of a helicase; however. both Mg2+ and Cus2p promote formation of stem IIa.

Uridines 56 and 93 are both modified to pseudouridines (Ψ) during nutrient deprivation. while U56 is also pseudouridylated during heat shock. Both positions are located within stem II. which must toggle between two mutually exclusive structures during splicing. Stem IIa forms during spliceosome assembly. and stem IIc forms during the catalytic steps. We have studied how uridine 56 and 93 pseudouridylation impacts conformational switching of stem II. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. we show that Ψ56 dampens conformational dynamics of stem II and stabilizes stem IIc. In contrast.

Capturing the spliceosome and pre‐mRNA splicing with single‐molecule fluorescence microscopy,2016,Alexander C DeHaven and Ian S Norden and Aaron A Hoskins,7,,5,683-701,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,The process of removing intronic sequences from a precursor to messenger RNA (pre‐mRNA) to yield a mature mRNA transcript via splicing is an integral step in eukaryotic gene expression. Splicing is carried out by a cellular nanomachine called the spliceosome that is composed of RNA components and dozens of proteins. Despite decades of study. many fundamentals of spliceosome function have remained elusive. Recent developments in single‐molecule fluorescence microscopy have afforded new tools to better probe the spliceosome and the complex. dynamic process of splicing by direct observation of single molecules. These cutting‐edge technologies enable investigators to monitor the dynamics of specific splicing components. whole spliceosomes. and even cotranscriptional splicing within living cells.

1073392,Evaluating implementation of the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines: The TRUST Process for rating journal policies. procedures. and practices,2021,Evan Mayo-Wilson and Sean Grant and Lauren Supplee and Sina Kianersi and Afsah Amin and Alexander DeHaven and David Thomas Mellor,,,,,MetaArXiv,Background: The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines describe standards that journals can adopt to promote open science. The TOP Factor is a metric to describe the extent to which journals have adopted the TOP Guidelines in their policies. Systematic methods and rating instruments are needed to calculate the TOP Factor. Moreover. implementation of these open science policies depends on journal procedures and practices. for which TOP provides no standards or rating instruments. Methods: We describe a reproducible process for assessing journal policies. procedures. and practices according to the TOP Guidelines. We developed this process as part of the Transparency of Research Underpinning Social Intervention Tiers (TRUST) Initiative to advance open science in the social intervention research ecosystem. We also provide new instruments for rating journal instructions to authors (policies). manuscript submission systems (procedures). and published articles (practices) according to standards in the TOP Guidelines. In addition. we describe how to determine the TOP Factor score for a journal. calculate reliability of journal ratings. and assess coherence among a journal’s policies. procedures. and practices. As a demonstration of this process. we describe a protocol for studying approximately 345 influential journals that have published research used to inform evidence-based policy. Discussion: The TRUST Process is a reproducible method for assessing and facilitating implementation of the TOP Guidelines by journals across disciplines. Our study of journals publishing influential social intervention research will …,True,40bNqH4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/b3wju/,,,,,0,0,0

Work over the past two decades has shown that Ca2 + influx during LTP induction triggers the activation of CaMKII in dendritic spines. CaMKII activation results in autophosphorylation of the kinase rendering it constitutively active long after the Ca2 + dissipates within the spine. This “molecular switch”1 mechanism is essential for LTP and learning and memory. Here. we discuss this key regulatory mechanism and the diversity of downstream targets that can be modulated by CaMKII to exert dynamic control of synaptic structure and function.,True,M5EIawwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,114,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124201705000039,2957742225112451325,/scholar?cites=2957742225112451325,,,0,0,0

Using biochemical and pharmacological approaches. we demonstrate here that mGlu2 and mGlu4 form a hetero-complex in native rat and mouse tissues which exhibits a distinct pharmacological profile.

Reasons for latter phenomenon are unknown. In the present paper we have investigated how glycine influences cytosolic chloride level monitored by fluorescent dye SPQ. membrane potential monitored by fluorescent dye DiSC3(5) and [14C]-glutamate release in synaptosomes. We estimated that cytosolic chloride concentration in synaptosomes was about 52 ± 1 mM. Glycine (1 mM) induced chloride efflux and caused slow plasma membrane depolarization. Chloride efflux was almost completely blocked by 100 μM strychnine whilst glycine-induced depolarization was only partially.

In the presence of toxins the change in DiSC3(5) fluorescence was specific for plasma membrane potential. In the second case. DiSC3(5) signal represented the total potential of mitochondria and plasma membrane. It was shown that decreasing of pHo works both in the presence of mitochondrial toxins and also in their absence.

1073486,Lanthanides induce neurotransmitter release from the vesicular pool in rat brain synaptosomes,2005,LP Lopatina and TV Vasim and SV Fedorovich and SV Konev,50,Biofizika,6,1120-1124,,Neurotransmitter release in a neuron under physiological conditions is coupled to calcium influx into the presynaptic terminus. The binding of calcium to a calcium sensor (presumably. synaptotagmin) induces fusion of the plasma membrane with synaptic vesicles; ie. it triggers exocytosis [1. 2]. Then. neurotransmitters are released from vesicles. In different pathologies (eg. in ischemia or hypotonic swelling). glutamate can be released from the cytosol due to transporter reversal [3. 4]. In some cases (eg. in osmotic shock or neuron treatment with ruthenium red). calcium-independent exocytosis may be observed [4–6]. The mechanism of calcium-independent exocytosis remains obscure. Probably. elucidating this mechanism will reveal new characteristic features of regulation of neurotransmitter release from vesicles under physiological conditions. It can be assumed that the volume regulation systems are involved in osmotically induced exocytosis [3. 4]. Ruthenium red binds to an unknown receptor on the outer side of presynaptic terminus plasma membrane [5]. It is believed that many polyvalent cations may function in a similar way; however. experimental data confirming this assumption are insufficient. Gadolinium and other lanthanoids can induce neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons without the involvement of calcium [7]. It remains unknown whether neurotransmitters are released from the cytosolic or vesicular pool.Synaptosomes. isolated presynaptic termini of neurons. are a convenient object for studying exocytosis.

1073544,Var2CSA minimal CSA binding region is located within the N-terminal region,2011,Anand Srivastava and Stéphane Gangnard and Sébastien Dechavanne and Farroudja Amirat and Anita Lewit Bentley and Graham A Bentley and Benoît Gamain,6,PloS one,5,e20270,Public Library of Science,Var2CSA. a key molecule linked with pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). causes sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (PEs) in the placenta by adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Var2CSA possesses a 300 kDa extracellular region composed of six Duffy-binding like (DBL) domains and a cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDRpam) module. Although initial studies implicated several individual var2CSA DBL domains as important for adhesion of PEs to CSA. new studies revealed that these individual domains lack both the affinity and specificity displayed by the full-length extracellular region. Indeed. recent evidence suggests the presence of a single CSA-binding site formed by a higher-order domain organization rather than several independent binding sites located on the different domains. Here. we search for the minimal binding region within var2CSA that maintains high affinity and specificity for CSA binding. a characteristic feature of the full-length extracellular region. Accordingly. truncated recombinant var2CSA proteins comprising different domain combinations were expressed and their binding characteristics assessed against different sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Our results indicate that the smallest region within var2CSA with similar binding properties to those of the full-length var2CSA is DBL1X-3X. We also demonstrate that inhibitory antibodies raised in rabbit against the full-length DBL1X-6ε target principally DBL3X and. to a lesser extent. DBL5ε.

1073546,Antibodies to a full-length VAR2CSA immunogen are broadly strain-transcendent but do not cross-inhibit different placental-type parasite isolates,2011,Marion Avril and Marianne J Hathaway and Anand Srivastava and Sébastien Dechavanne and Mirja Hommel and James G Beeson and Joseph D Smith and Benoît Gamain,6,PloS one,2,e16622,Public Library of Science,The high molecular weight. multidomain VAR2CSA protein mediating adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta is the leading candidate for a pregnancy malaria vaccine. However. it has been difficult so far to generate strong and consistent adhesion blocking antibody responses against most single-domain VAR2CSA immunogens. Recent advances in expression of the full-length recombinant protein showed it binds with much greater specificity and affinity to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) than individual VAR2CSA domains. This raises the possibility that a specific CSA binding pocket(s) is formed in the full length antigen and could be an important target for vaccine development. In this study. we compared the immunogenicity of a full-length VAR2CSA recombinant protein containing all six Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains to that of a three-domain construct (DBL4-6) in mice and rabbits. Animals immunized with either immunogen acquired antibodies reacting with several VAR2CSA individual domains by ELISA. but antibody responses against the highly conserved DBL4 domain were weaker in animals immunized with full-length DBL1-6 recombinant protein compared to DBL4-6 recombinant protein.

Anti-inflammatory drugs are often the first step of treatment in many of these diseases. The present study is aimed at evaluating the anti-inflammatory properties of isoorientin. a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor isolated from the tubers of Pueraria tuberosa. in vitro on mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) and in vivo on mouse paw edema and air pouch models of inflammation. Isoorientin reduced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cell line in vitro and carrageenan induced inflammatory animal model systems in vivo. Cellular infiltration into pouch tissue was reduced in isoorientin treated mice compared to carrageenan treated mice. Isoorientin treated RAW 264.7 cells and animals showed reduced expression of inflammatory proteins like COX-2. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). interleukin-6 (IL-6). 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). and interleukin 1-β (IL-1-β) both in vitro and in vivo. The antioxidant enzyme levels of catalase and GST were markedly increased in isoorientin treated mice compared to carrageenan treated mice. These results suggest that isoorientin. a selective inhibitor of COX-2. not only exerts anti-inflammatory effects in LPS induced RAW cells and carrageenan induced inflammatory model systems but also exhibits potent antioxidant properties.,True,5bnHpccAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,44,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/5498054/abs/,15005935089639448139,/scholar?cites=15005935089639448139,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/5498054/abs/,0,0,0

Comparison of this non‐glycosylated structure with that of the native glycosylated lectin reveals that the tertiary and quaternary structures are identical in the two forms. with local changes observed at one of the glycosylation sites (Asn17). These changes take place in such a way that hydrogen bonds with the neighboring protein molecules in rECorL compensate those made by the glycan with the protein in ECorL.

Dibutyrilfluorescine (DBF) was used as substrate for the enzyme and the fluoresceine liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was measured. Extracts of acetone powder from adipose tissue as an enzyme source showed characteristics of lipoprotein lipase activity. ie. inhibition by NaCl and optimum activity in alkaline pH. There was close agreement in LPL activity when the same sample was measured simultaneously using either dibutyrilfluorescine or tri [9. 10 (3) H] oleylglycerol as substrate. The extent of inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by NaCl was similar with both methods.

En los casos esporádicos el tumor es unilateral y en la forma familiar puede presentarse de manera unilateral o bilateral. Esta neoplasia tiene una incidencia promedio de 1/15.000 nacidos vivos. presentando signos y síntomas que incluyen leucocoria. estrabismo. midriasis unilateral y heterocromía. El gen que predispone al desarrollo de retinoblastoma es RBl y se localiza en el cromosoma 13 en la región ql4.2. El gen RBl codifica para una fosfoproteína nuclear que participa de manera importante en la regulación del ciclo celular. De acuerdo con la hipótesis de Knudson. para que se desarrolle la neoplasia se deben presentar dos mutaciones en el gen RBl. Las mutaciones puntuales son las que más frecuentemente se presentan en el gen RBl; la mayoría de los estudios indican que los exones 3. 8. 18. 19 y 20 son las regiones de mutación preferencial.

1073652,Genomic retinoblastoma perspectives: Implications of supressor gene of tumor RB1,2005,Maricela Rodríguez-Cruz and Martha del Prado and Mauricio Salcedo,57,,4,572-581,,In order to define the molecular and cellular bases of the development of retinoblastomas it is necessary to know its etiology. and to apply the advances in genome technology to this kind of neoplasia. Retinoblastomas are childhood tumors of the eye with an average incidence of one case in every 15.000-20.000 live births. which occur in sporadic and hereditary forms. The sporadic form appears regularly as a unilateral tumor. while in the familial form of the disease. tumors may be unilateral and bilateral. This neoplasia is characterized by leukocoria. strabism. and heterochromia. The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) is a molecular marker of retinoblastoma tumors. This gene is located in chromosome 13q14. 2 and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein (pRB) of 110 KDa. which plays a major role in cell proliferation control through cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles of this protein.

1073658,Saponins: Anti-diabetic principles from medicinal plants–A review,2015,Olusola Olalekan Elekofehinti,22,,2,95-103,Elsevier,Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a global health problem. It is the most common of the endocrine disorders and is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to relative or absolute lack of insulin secretion or insulin actions. According to the World Health Organization projections. the diabetes population is likely to increase to 300 million or more by the year 2025. Current synthetic agents and insulin used effectively for the treatment of diabetes are scarce especially in rural areas. expensive and have prominent adverse effects. Complementary and alternative approaches to diabetes management such as isolation of phytochemicals with anti-hyperglycemic activities from medicinal plants is therefore imperative. Saponins are phytochemical with structural diversity and biological activities.

Here we show that bovine chromaffin granules readily fuse with large unilamellar liposomes in a SNARE-dependent manner. Fusion is enhanced by Ca 2+. but only when the target liposomes contain phosphatidylinositol-4. 5-bisphosphate and when polyphosphate anions. such as nucleotides or pyrophosphate. are present. Ca 2+-dependent enhancement is mediated by endogenous synaptotagmin-1. Polyphosphates operate by an electrostatic mechanism that reverses an inactivating cis association of synaptotagmin-1 with its own membrane without affecting trans binding.

Before fusion. SNARE proteins form complexes bridging the membrane followed by assembly toward the C-terminal membrane anchors. thus initiating membrane fusion. After fusion. the SNARE complex is disassembled by the AAA-ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor that requires the cofactor α-SNAP to first bind to the assembled SNARE complex. Using chromaffin granules and liposomes we now show that α-SNAP on its own interferes with the zippering of membrane-anchored SNARE complexes midway through the zippering reaction. arresting SNAREs in a partially assembled trans-complex and preventing fusion.

1073798,Reconstitution of Synaptic SNAREs into Large Liposomes with Reduced Curvature Stress,2017,Javier M Hernandez,,,,93-105,Humana Press. New York. NY,Liposomes constitute a convenient biochemical model system to investigate mechanistic aspects of the membrane fusion of synaptic vesicles. The proteins responsible for mediating fusion are the SNAREs that belong to a highly conserved family of transmembrane proteins. Reconstituting SNAREs into liposomes using detergents has become a common approach not only to understand how SNAREs work. but also how fusion is regulated by the vast array of accessory proteins present at the presynapse. However. a concern has been that the high curvature stress of the small liposomes (diameters of ~40 nm) frequently used in many studies renders them prone to spontaneous fusion. bringing into question whether the measurements obtained faithfully represent SNARE-mediated fusion. By systematically varying the detergent concentration and characterizing the SNARE-liposome size distributions by light …,True,6TQhmDkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-6688-2_8,,,,,0,0,0

The complex of T7 RNA polymerase with the phage phi 10 promoter has been visualized indirectly by exploiting the ability of the polymerase to protect DNA sequences from cleavage by methidiumpropyl-EDTA X Fe(II).

For T7 transcription it has frequently been observed that T7 class III promoters are qualitatively stronger than T7 class II promoters.

One common aspect of extracellular matrices is that they contain complex sugar moieties in form of glycoproteins. proteoglycans. and/or polysaccharides. Examples include the extracellular matrix of humans and animal cells consisting mainly of fibrillar proteins and proteoglycans or the polysaccharide based cell walls of plants and fungi. and the proteoglycan/glycolipid based cell walls of bacteria. All these glycostructures play vital roles in cell-to-cell and cell-to-environment communication and signalling. An extraordinary complex example of an extracellular matrix is present in the walls of higher plant cells. Their wall is made almost entirely of sugars. up to 75% dry weight. and consists of the most abundant biopolymers present on this planet.

Since mucilage is rich in pectin. its architecture can be visualized with the ruthenium red (RR) dye. We screened the seeds of around 280 Arabidopsis natural accessions for variation in mucilage structure. and identified a large number of novel variants that differed from the Col-0 wild-type. Most of the accessions released smaller RR-stained capsules compared to the Col-0 reference. By biochemically characterizing the phenotypes of 25 of these accessions in greater detail. we discovered that distinct changes in polysaccharide structure resulted in gelatinous coatings with a deceptively similar appearance. Monosaccharide composition analysis of total mucilage extracts revealed a remarkable variation (from 50% to 200% of Col-0 levels) in the content of galactose and mannose. which are important subunits of heteromannan. In addition. most of the natural variants had altered Pontamine Fast Scarlet 4B staining of cellulose and significantly reduced birefringence of crystalline structures. This indicates that the production or organization of cellulose may be affected by the presence of different amounts of hemicellulose. Although the accessions described in this study were primarily collected from Western Europe. they form five different phenotypic classes based on the combined results of our experiments.

Characterization of mucilage mutants has identified novel genes required for cell wall biosynthesis and modification (North et al.. 2014). The biochemical analysis of seed mucilage is essential to evaluate how different mutations affect cell wall structure (Voiniciuc et al.. 2015c). Here we describe a robust method to screen the monosaccharide composition of Arabidopsis seed mucilage using ion chromatography (IC). Mucilage from up to 48 samples can be extracted and prepared for IC analysis within 24 h (only 4 h hands-on).

Two classes of c-di-GMP-binding riboswitches have been discovered that bind this second messenger with high affinity and regulate diverse downstream genes. underscoring the importance of RNA receptors in this pathway. We have solved the structure of a c-di-GMP-II riboswitch. which reveals that the ligand is bound as part of a triplex formed with a pseudoknot.

The c-di-GMP riboswitch (GEMM) is an important downstream target in this signaling pathway and alters gene expression in response to changing concentrations of c-di-GMP. The riboswitch selectively recognizes its second messenger ligand primarily through contacts with two critical nucleotides. However. these two nucleotides are not the most highly conserved residues within the riboswitch sequence. Instead. nucleotides that stack with c-di-GMP and that form tertiary RNA contacts are the most invariant.

Riboswitches that bind this second messenger are important downstream targets in this bacterial signaling pathway. The breakdown of c-di-GMP in the cell is accomplished enzymatically and results in the linear dinucleotide pGpG. The c-di-GMP-binding riboswitches must be able to discriminate between their cognate cyclic ligand and linear dinucleotides in order to be selective biological switches.

A recently discovered family of fluoride export (FEX) proteins protects organisms from fluoride toxicity by removing it from the cell. We show here that FEX proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae function as ion channels that are selective for fluoride over chloride and that these proteins are constitutively expressed at the yeast plasma membrane. Continuous expression is in contrast to many other toxin exporters in yeast. and this. along with the fact that two nearly duplicate proteins are encoded in the yeast genome. suggests that the threat posed by fluoride ions is frequent and detrimental. Structurally. eukaryotic FEX proteins consist of two homologous four-transmembrane helix domains folded into an antiparallel dimer. where the orientation of the two domains is fixed by a single transmembrane linker helix.

FEX efficiently eliminates intracellular fluoride that otherwise would accumulate at toxic concentrations. The FEX homolog in bacteria. Fluc. is a ‘double-barreled’ channel formed by dimerization of two identical or similar subunits. FEX in yeast and other eukaryotes is a monomer resulting from covalent fusion of the two subunits. As a result. both potential fluoride pores are created from different parts of the same protein. Here we identify FEX proteins from two multicellular eukaryotes. a plant Arabidopsis thaliana and an animal Amphimedon queenslandica. by demonstrating significant fluoride tolerance when these proteins are heterologously expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Residues important for eukaryotic FEX function were determined by phylogenetic sequence alignment and functional analysis using a yeast growth assay. Key residues of the fluoride channel are conserved in only one of the two potential fluoride-transporting pores. FEX activity is abolished upon mutation of residues in this conserved pore. suggesting that only one of the pores is functional. The same topology is conserved for the newly identified FEX proteins from plant and animal. These data suggest that FEX family of fluoride channels in eukaryotes are ‘single-barreled’ transporters containing one functional pore and a second non-functional vestigial remnant of a homologous gene fusion event.,True,F0212mEAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177096,2150799198062298336,/scholar?cites=2150799198062298336,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177096,0,0,0

The objectives of this study were to determine whether the Sassouni cephalometric analysis could help predict two-dimensional mandibular shape in humans using cephalometric planes and landmarks. A retrospective computerised analysis of 100 lateral cephalometric radiographs taken at Kingston Hospital Orthodontic Department was carried out. Results showed that the Euclidean straight-line mean difference between the estimated position of gonion and traced position of gonion was 7.89 mm and the Euclidean straight-line mean difference between the estimated position of pogonion and the traced position of pogonion was 11.15 mm. The length of the anterior cranial base as measured by sella-nasion was positively correlated with the length of the mandibular body gonion-menton. r = 0.381 and regression analysis showed the length of the anterior cranial base sella-nasion could be predictive of the length of the mandibular body gonion-menton by the equation 22.65 + 0.5426x. where x = length of the anterior cranial base (SN). There was a significant association with convex shaped palates and oblique shaped mandibles. p = 0.0004. The method described in this study can be used to help estimate the position of cephalometric points gonion and pogonion and thereby sagittal mandibular length.

However. we have recently found that the acid stress from fluoride exposure is sufficient to elicit many of the hallmark phenotypes of fluoride toxicity. Here we report the systematic screening of genes involved in fluoride resistance and general acid resistance using a genome deletion library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We compare these to a variety of acids – 2.4-dinitrophenol. FCCP. hydrochloric acid. and sulfuric acid – none of which has a high metal affinity. Pathways involved in endocytosis. vesicle trafficking. pH maintenance. and vacuolar function are of particular importance to fluoride tolerance.

ATN-658. does not inhibit ligand binding (i.e. uPA and vitronectin) to uPAR and its mechanism of action remains unclear. As a first step in understanding the anti-tumor activity of ATN-658. we set out to identify the epitope on uPAR to which ATN-658 binds. Guided by comparisons between primate and human uPAR. epitope mapping studies were performed using several orthogonal techniques. Systematic site directed and alanine scanning mutagenesis identified the region of aa 268–275 of uPAR as the epitope for ATN-658.

Although these two pathways respond to very different stimuli and generate very different responses. they utilize many of the same signaling components. This implies the need for robust mechanisms to maintain signal fidelity. Dse1 was identified in an allele-specific suppressor screen for proteins that interact with the pheromone-responsive Gβγ. and found to bind both to a Gβγ-affinity column. and to the shared MEKK.

Previously published studies identified Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) as a new therapeutic target in GBM. Because GSK-3β is a positive regulator of NF-κB-mediated survival and chemoresistance in cancer cells. we hypothesize that the inhibition of GSK-3 may overcome NF-κB-mediated chemoresistance to conventional drugs in human GBM. Using IVIS imaging of live mice. we found that: 1) NF-κB is constitutively active in orthotopic GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors expressing an NF-κB luciferase reporter; and 2) a single intravenous injection of our novel GSK-3 inhibitor 9-ING-41 significantly reduced NF-κB transcriptional activity in orthotopic GBM PDX tumor. Using two different GBM PDX tumor models (GBM6 and GBM12). enabled for bioluminescence imaging through luciferase reporter transduction. we evaluated the antitumor effects of 9-ING-41. alone as well as in combination with irinotecan. CCNU and temozolomide. Our in vivo results revealed that treatment with a combination of 9-ING-41 and CCNU leads to a complete regression of orthotopic GBM6 and GBM12 tumors. Histological evaluation of mouse brain confirmed the absence of cancer cells in mice treated with 9-ING-41+ CCNU.

VEGFR2 knockdown dramatically decreased MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation caused by high OxPAPC concentrations with modest effects on VE-cadherin phosphorylation at Y. We present the 731 evidence that activation of Rho is involved in the OxPAPC/VEGFR2 mechanism of EC permeability induced by high OxPAPC concentrations.

Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity. removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins. disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors. whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease. being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors.

Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however. without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series. we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design. obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained. culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a 9BL2 groove9 that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however. until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity.

TiO2 nanoparticles were modified with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS). The adsorbed and covalently immobilized enzymes showed 76% and 93% activity. respectively. as compared to the free enzyme. The catalytic efficiency Vmax/Km increased from 0.4 to 4.0 after covalent attachment. whereas in adsorption method. it increased slightly from 0.4 to 1.2.

Such degradative bacteria. under normal circumstances. enzymatically convert xenobiotic. aromatic compounds to either catechol or protocatechuate. The most common catabolic pathway involves conversion of the parent molecules to chlorocatechols by the action of a monooxygenase or a dioxygenase. Many members of Pseudomonas carry plasmid that encodes enzymes capable of degrading aromatic and halogenated organic compounds. The degradation proceeds in two phases. first. an aromatic compound is prepared for ring cleavage by a variety of ring modification reactions.

Additionally. these enzymes find potential applications as an insecticide. synthesis of anti-fungal antibiotics and a biocatalyst to transform a number of sterol and non-sterol compounds. However. the soluble form of cholesterol oxidases are found to be less stable when applied at higher temperatures. broader pH range. and incur higher costs. These disadvantages can be overcome by immobilization on carrier matrices.Methods:This review focuses on the immobilization of cholesterol oxidases on various macro/micro matrices as well as nanoparticles and their potential applications. Selection of appropriate support matrix in enzyme immobilization is of extreme importance. Recently. nanomaterials have been used as a matrix for immobilization of enzyme due to their large surface area and small size. The bio-compatible length scales and surface chemistry of nanoparticles provide reusability. stability and enhanced performance characteristics for the enzyme-nanoconjugates.Conclusion:In this review. immobilization of cholesterol oxidase on nanomaterials and other matrices are discussed.

Beginning with the discovery of the prototypical bacterial NEF GrpE. a large diversity of Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factors has been identified. connecting Hsp70 to a multitude of cellular processes in the eukaryotic cell.

Macrophages in particular are a good example of this phenomenon. Whether the macrophage obtains its energy through glycolysis or through oxidative metabolism can give rise to different phenotypes. Classically activated or M1 macrophages are key players of the first line of defense against bacterial infections and are known to obtain energy through glycolysis. Alternatively activated or M2 macrophages on the other hand. are involved in tissue repair and wound healing and use oxidative metabolism to fuel their longer-term functions. Metabolic intermediates however. are not just a source of energy but can be directly implicated in a particular macrophage phenotype. In M1 macrophages. the Krebs cycle intermediate succinate regulates HIF1α. which is responsible for driving the sustained production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β. In M2 macrophages. the sedoheptulose kinase CARKL is critical for regulating the pentose phosphate pathway.

Oligomerization of this complex is actually the second step of activation. and a priming step must occur first. This involves transcriptional upregulation of pro-IL-1β. inflammasome sensor NLRP3. or the non-canonical inflammasome sensor caspase-11. An additional aspect of priming is the post-translational modification of particular inflammasome constituents. Priming is typically accomplished in vitro using a microbial Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand.

Four drugs were initially compared to mefloquine. a known gap junction inhibitor. The drug with optimal inhibitory activity. PQ1. was tested for inhibition and was found to inhibit dye transfer by 70% at 10 μM. Retinal ischemia was produced in R28 cells using cobalt chloride as a chemical agent.

Although Etv2 downstream targets have been identified. little is known regarding the upstream transcriptional regulation of Etv2 gene expression. In this study. we established a novel methodology that utilizes the differentiating ES cell and embryoid body system to define the modules and enhancers embedded within the Etv2 promoter. Using this system. we defined an autoactivating role for Etv2 that is mediated by two adjacent Ets motifs in the proximal promoter. In addition. we defined the role of VEGF/Flk1-Calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade in the transcriptional regulation of Etv2.

An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout (cKO or floxed) alleles by microinjection of 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides as donors (referred herein as “two-donor floxing” method). We re-evaluate the two-donor method from a consortium of 20 laboratories across the world. The dataset constitutes 56 genetic loci. 17.887 zygotes. and 1718 live-born mice. of which only 15 (0.87%) mice contain cKO alleles. We subject the dataset to statistical analyses and a machine learning algorithm. which reveals that none of the factors analyzed was predictive for the success of this method. We test some of the newer methods that use one-donor DNA on 18 loci for which the two-donor approach failed to produce cKO alleles. We find that the one-donor methods are 10- to 20-fold more efficient than the two-donor approach. We propose that the two-donor method lacks efficiency because it relies on two simultaneous recombination events in cis. an outcome that is dwarfed by pervasive accompanying undesired editing events. The methods that use one-donor DNA are fairly efficient as they rely on only one recombination event. and the probability of correct insertion of the donor cassette without unanticipated mutational events is much higher.

Every tissue is supposed to produce a specific α-DG harboring a particular sugar moiety that will enable it to bind a specific ligand. but often several α-DG ligands are co-expressed within the same tissue.

The knowledge collected on the subdomain organization of the two subunits of the adhesion complex dystroglycan (DG) enabled us to insert the 10 amino acids myc-tag at different locations along the α-subunit. in order to better visualize and investigate the DG complex in eukaryotic cells. We have generated two forms of DG polypeptides via the insertion of the myc-tag 1) within a flexible loop (between a.a. 170 and 171) that separates two autonomous subdomains. and 2) within the C-terminal domain in position 500. Their analysis showed that double-tagging (the β-subunit is linked to GFP) does not significantly interfere with the correct processing of the DG precursor (pre-DG) and confirmed that the α-DG N-terminal domain is processed in the cell before α-DG reaches its plasma membrane localization. In addition. myc insertion in position 500. right before the second Ig-like domain of α-DG. proved to be an efficient tool for the detection and pulling-down of glycosylated α-DG molecules targeted at the membrane. Further characterization of these and other myc-permissive site(s) will represent a valid support for the study of the maturation process of pre-DG and could result in the creation of a new class of intrinsic doubly-fluorescent DG molecules that would allow the monitoring of the two DG subunits. or of pre-DG. in cells without the need of antibodies.,True,24mzxoQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,18,https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2091-13-14,15883661998458854503,/scholar?cites=15883661998458854503,,https://bmcbiochem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2091-13-14,0,0,0

Lacking experimental structural data for zebrafish DG domains. the detailed mechanism for the observed mutation-induced destabilization of the DG complex and membrane damage. remained unclear. With the aim to contribute to a better clarification of the structure-function relationships featuring the DG complex. three-dimensional structural models of wild-type and mutant (V567D) C-terminal domain of alpha-DG from zebrafish were constructed by a template-based modelling approach. We then ran extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the structural and dynamic properties of the C-terminal domain and to evaluate the effect of the single mutation on alpha-DG stability. A comparative study has been also carried out on our previously generated model of murine alpha-DG C-terminal domain including the I591D mutation. which is topologically equivalent to the V567D mutation found in zebrafish. Trajectories from MD simulations were analyzed in detail. revealing extensive structural disorder involving multiple beta-strands in the mutated variant of the zebrafish protein whereas local effects have been detected in the murine protein.

Functional expression analysis in vitro and in vivo indicated that the mutation was responsible for a decrease in posttranslational glycosylation of dystroglycan. eventually interfering with its extracellular-matrix receptor function and laminin binding in skeletal muscle and brain. The X-ray crystal structure of the missense variant T190M of the murine N-terminal domain of α-dystroglycan (50-313) has been determined. and showed an overall topology (Ig-like domain followed by a basket-shaped domain reminiscent of the small subunit ribosomal protein S6) very similar to that of the wild-type structure.

The monolayer capacity (KL/aL) for 0.04 g of residual wheat bran was corresponds to 5.25 mg of protein. The pH and temperature stability was enhanced after immobilization. The bound enzyme displayed a higher Vmax and it could be reused for 15 cycles still retaining 70.0% of its initial activity. The enzyme was fully stable during storage at 4 C for two months. The immobilized enzyme was found to be effective in removing chromophores from the newspaper pulp. The chromophores released by the enzyme exhibited absorbance at 240 to 360 nm wavelengths with maximum at 300 nm. The immobilization protocol proposed here is apparently cost-effective as it reuses the wheat bran. A considerable stability and reusability of the bound enzyme may be advantageous for its industrial application.,True,9put3T0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,3,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.679.1112&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16975021083442670866,/scholar?cites=16975021083442670866,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.679.1112&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Swern oxidation was used for hemisynthesis of diosgenone (one of the most active steroidal sapogenin diosgenin compounds). Eighteen structural analogues were prepared; three of them were found to be more active than diosgenone (IC 50 27.9 μM vs. 10.1 μM. 2.9 μM and 11.3 μM). The presence of a 4-en-3-one grouping in the A-ring of the compounds seems to be indispensable for antiplasmodial activity; progesterone (having the same functional group in the steroid A-ring) has also displayed antiplasmodial activity. Quantitative correlations between molecular structure and bioactivity were thus explored in diosgenone and several derivatives using well-established 3D-QSAR techniques. The models showed that combining electrostatic (70%) and steric (30%) fields can explain most variance regarding compound activity. Malarial parasitemia in mice became reduced by oral administration of two diosgenone derivatives.

1074321,Prevalence of haemosporidians in a Neotropical endemic bird area,2016,Catalina González Quevedo and Adriana Lucía Pabón Vidal and Héctor Fabio Rivera Gutiérrez,,,,,Resilience Alliance,Haemosporidians are vector-transmitted intracellular parasites that occur in many bird species worldwide and may have important implications for wild bird populations. Surveys of haemosporidians have traditionally focused on Europe and North America. and only recently have they been carried out in the Neotropics. where the prevalence and impacts of the disease have been less studied and are not well understood. In this study we carried out a survey in the endemic bird area of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM). an isolated coastal massif in northern Colombia that contains a large number of biomes and that is experiencing high rates of habitat loss. We sampled birds from 25 species at 2 different altitudes (1640 and 2100 m asl) and determined avian haemosporidian infection by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing a portion of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene of the parasite. From the sampled birds. 32.1% were infected by at least 1 of 12 unique cyt b lineages of haemosporidian genera: Plasmodium. Leucocytozoon. Haemoproteus. and subgenus Parahaemoproteus. We found a higher prevalence of avian haemosporidians at low altitudes (1640 m asl). All endemic bird species we sampled had at least one individual infected with avian haemosporidians. We also found evidence of higher overall prevalence among endemic rather than nonendemic birds. suggesting higher susceptibility in endemic birds. Overall. our findings suggest a high haemosporidian species richness in the bird community of the SNSM.

As there are relatively few alternatives for malaria treatment. it is necessary to search for new chemotherapeutic options. Colombia possesses a great diversity of plants. which are potential sources of new compounds of medical interest. Thus. in this study the antiplasmodial effect of extracts from two species of plants from the families Simaroubaceae and Picramniaceae (Picramnia latifolia and Picrolemma huberi) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. These plants were chosen because they contain secondary metabolites with interesting medicinal effects. The ethanolic extracts of both species were highly active with IC50: 1.2 ± 0.19 µg/mL for P. latifolia and IC50: 0.05 ± 0.005 µg/mL for P. huberi. The P. latifolia extract had a stage specific effect on trophozoites and inhibited parasite growth in vivo by 52.1 ± 3.4%. evaluated at 1000 mg/kg in Balb/c mice infected with Plasmodium berghei. On the other hand. evaluated at 150 mg/kg body weight in the same murine model. the ethanolic extract from P. huberi had an antiplasmodial effect in all the asexual intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum FCR3 and inhibited the parasitic growth in 93 ± 32.9%.

Allophycocyanin (APC) is the phycobiliprotein always found in the PBS core complex. Phycocyanobilin (PCB) chromophores. covalently bound to conserved Cys residues of α- and β- subunits of APC. are responsible for solar energy absorption from phycocyanin and for transfer to photosynthetic apparatus. In the known APC structures. heterodimers of α- and β- subunits (known as αβ monomers) assemble as trimer or hexamer.

Inc.,Background: Many HIV databases and applications focus on a limited domain of HIV knowledge. Since even a ‘‘simple’’organism like HIV represents a very complex system with many interacting elements. the fractured structure of existing databases and applications likely limits our ability to investigate and understand HIV. To facilitate research. therefore. we have built HIVToolbox. which integrates much of the knowledge about HIV proteins and presents the data in an interactive web application. HIVToolbox allows quick and convenient hypotheses generation. experiment interpretation. and potential new drug structure creation. Methods: HIVToolbox was built as a standard three-tier J2EE web application. consisting of 1) an underlying relational MySQL database. 2) a set of standard Java data access objects that pull data from the database. and 3) a set of dynamic web pages the user interacts with. HIV-1 data from external sources such as the Protein Data Bank. NCBI. Los Alamos. etc. was collected. curated. and stored in the HIVToolbox database. Additional data. such as homology and position statistics matrices. was generated from existing data. Since version 1. drug binding site and drug resistant mutation data has also been added. Results: HIVToolbox was used to create several new hypotheses about HIV-1 integrase. including predicting the location of a CK2 phosphorylation site. which was later confirmed by experiment.,True,pMfiFdgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/138319,,,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/138319,0,0,0

1074504,Role of the formylmethionine codon AUG in phasing translation of synthetic messenger RNA,1966,TA Sundararajan and Robert E Thach,19,Journal of molecular biology,1,74-90,Academic Press,The coding specificity of the triplets AUG and UUG was measured in the binding assay of Nirenberg & Leder (1964). as a function of the magnesium ion and oligonucleotide concentration. AUG was extremely active in promoting the binding of formylmethionine-sRNA under all conditions tested. while UUG was active only at very high magnesium ion and oligonucleotide concentration. These results suggest that AUG is the correct formylmethionine codon. When the AUG codon is incorporated into longer polynucleotide chains. it suppresses the reading of codons which partially overlap its sequence. and promotes the reading of the adjacent 3′ codon. For example. ApUpG (pU) 15¯ stimulates the binding of Met-and Phe-sRNA. but not of Val-sRNA; in contrast. ApUpGpG (pU) 16¯ codes for Met-and Val-sRNA. whereas the binding of Phe-sRNA is reduced to a low level. comparable to oligo U. The triplets ACG.

Incorporation of P32 into free phosphopeptides of milk and of mammary gland,1960,KSV Sampath Kumar and TA Sundararajan and PS Sarma,235,Journal of Biological Chemistry,,679-683,The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Recent studies on casein biosynthesis have conclusively shown that the mammary gland utilizes the inorganic phosphorus of the blood for the formation of casein phosphorus and that the phosphorus incorporation occurs at a rapid rate (14). Very little is known. however. concerning the steps involved in this conversion. o-Phosphoserine as the basic phosphorus-containing unit of casein (4. 5) would appear to be the obvious choice as an intermediate in this reaction. The formation of o-phosphoserine by transamination of phosphohydroxypyruvate was first suggested by Le Bars et al.(6) and has subsequently received experimental support from recent studies on the biosynthesis of serine from carbohydrate in the liver (7). In a study of the occurrence of P-serinel in mammary tissue. carried out in this laboratory. it was observed that the lactating mammary gland of the rat did not contain a detectable amount of this amino acid. These studies. on the other hand. brought to light the presence of traces of phosphorylated peptides in this tissue (8). The conditions of the experiments for the isolation of the mammary gland peptides (homogenization with trichloroacetic acid (8)) were such as to rule out the possibility of these arising as a result of the proteolytic action of the mammary gland. A possible role for these phosphopeptides as intermediates in the biosynthesis of casein is indicated from the observed similarity of their amino acid composition with that of phosphopeptones obtained by enzymatic degradation of casein (9) as also from the work of Thoai and Pin (10) who demonstrated the ability of goat udder homogenates to synthesize a phosphopeptide …,True,Ha5BBwYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,69,http://repository.ias.ac.in/35302/1/35302.pdf,15254360787325605180,/scholar?cites=15254360787325605180,,http://repository.ias.ac.in/35302/1/35302.pdf,0,0,0

The animal was killed after a time interval of 2 to 3 hours by a blow on the head and the liver and mammary glands (along with adhering milk) were dissected out and placed in beakers containing ice-cold 0.9% sodium chloride solution (100 ml). All subsequent operations were carried out at O-4” unless otherwise specified. The mammary glands were cut into large bits to facilitate removal of milk. After a gentle swirling. the milk was transferred to a conical flask. The mam-mary tissue was washed twice with small portions (20 ml) of sodium chloride solution and the washings added to the milk. The tissue wits washed thrice more with sodium chloride solution and the washings were discarded. The tissue was blotted and kept at-25” for an hour. The frozen tissue was ground well in a mortar which had previously been kept in the deep freeze. This operation repeated thrice at intervals of 30 minutes resulted in an easier homogenization of the tissue. Weighed amounts (5 g) of the liver and mammary tissues were homogenized in 5 volumes of a 10% solution of trichloroacetic acid in a Potter-Elvehjem type of homogenizer for 2 minutes. The phosphorus-containing fractions of the homogenate were separated according to the scheme of Schmidt and Thannhauser (17) as modified by Friedkin and Lehninger (18).

Acidification of the digest after the completion of dephosphorylation precipitated a substance resembling casein. Rimington 2 analysed the dephosphorized casein for its nitrogen distribution and noticed little difference in composition from that of casein except in amide and arginine nitrogen. The low values obtained in these two cases were evidently due to the hydrolytic action of alkali on these compounds with the production of ammonia. Plimmer and Lawton 3 found besides that by the action of N/4 alkali on casein there was formed in addition to casein a substance or mixture of substances resembling a primary proteose.

Inc.,Male zebra finches are most apt to mimic songs heard between posthatch days (PHD) 35 and 65. and this vocal learning depends. in part. on the activation of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDAR) within a discrete forebrain circuit that includes the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (lMAN) and area X. Using in situ hybridization. we show that transcripts for both the constitutive NMDAR subunit NR1 and the modulatory subunit NR2B decrease abruptly in the lMAN between PHD20 and 40. This downregulation corresponds to the onset of song learning and a transition from slow to faster NMDAR currents in lMAN neurons. In area X. NR1 mRNA increases as NR2B mRNA decreases during song development.

Inc.,In passerine songbirds. song learning often is restricted to an early sensitive period and requires the participation of several discrete regions within the anterior forebrain. Activation of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors is implicated in song learning and in one forebrain song region. the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (lMAN). NMDA receptors decrease in density. their affinity for the antagonist MK‐801 increases. and their currents decay more quickly as young male zebra finches lose the ability to imitate new song elements. These developmental changes in NMDA receptor pharmacology and physiology suggest that the subunit composition of NMDA receptors changes developmentally.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In several songbird species. a specialized anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) that includes part of the avian basal ganglia has been implicated specifically in song learning. To further elucidate cellular mechanisms and circuitry involved in vocal learning. we used quantitative immunoblot analysis to determine if early song tutoring promotes within the AFP phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II (CaMKII). a multifunctional kinase whose phosphorylation at threonine 286 is critical for many forms of neural plasticity and behavioral learning. We report that in young male zebra finches likely to have begun the process of song acquisition. brief tutoring by a familiar conspecific adult promotes a dramatic increase in levels of phosphorylated CaMKII (pCaMKII) in Area X. the striatal/pallidal component of the AFP. In contrast. pCaMKII levels in this region were not elevated if 1) the tutor did not sing. 2) the tutor …,True,mrv5GhEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,20,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/neu.20198,70163920567726838,/scholar?cites=70163920567726838,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.3453&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Specifically. NR2B levels in lMAN decrease during song acquisition. potentially reducing synaptic plasticity by decreasing NMDAR EPSC duration and/or affecting NMDAR-coupled intracellular cascades. While rearing birds in isolation extends the sensitive period and also delays the developmental changes in NR2B expression and NMDAR physiology. recent work indicates that a transition to faster NMDAR currents does not preclude further song learning. However. NR2B mRNA expression in isolates remains elevated beyond the age at which NMDAR currents shorten. leaving open the possibility that NR2B levels regulate closure of the …,True,mrv5GhEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074742702000163,2753098437852223600,/scholar?cites=2753098437852223600,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.298.5111&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,All songbirds learn to sing during postnatal development but then display species differences in the capacity to learn song in adulthood. While the mechanisms that regulate avian vocal plasticity are not well characterized. one contributing factor may be the composition of N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDAR). Previous studies of an anterior forebrain pathway implicated in vocal plasticity revealed significant regulation of NMDAR subunit expression during the developmental sensitive period for song learning. Much less is known about the developmental regulation of NMDAR subunit expression in regions that participate more directly in motor aspects of song behavior.

They are also known as metzincins due to their interaction with zinc ion of the conserved methionine (Met) at the active site. MMPs play an important role in physiological and signaling processes of wound healing. bone resorption and angiogenesis. The structure of MMPs consists of signal peptide. propeptide. catalytic domain. hinge region and hemopexin-like domain. MMP-9 shares high structural and functional similarities with MMP-2. therefore designing selective MMP-9 inhibitors (MMPIs) is challenging. The selectivity can be achieved by targeting S2 subsite of MMP-9 that is having difference with MMP-2. Further. targeting its exosite and protein disulfide isomerase may also provide selective MMPIs.

The experimental group was divided into subgroups and subjected to hypoxia conditions for 1. 7. 14 or 21 days. Afterwards. histopathological evaluation and study of the protein expression of the gastric mucosa were performed. Results: the results showed that longer exposure to hypoxic conditions leads to more severe gastric ulceration. Twenty-four hours after induction. 60% of rats had developed gastric ulcers. Seven days after induction. 80% of rats developed gastric ulcers. In the 14-day and 21-day hypoxia conditions. epithelialization (a sign of gastric ulcer healing) was observed. Evaluation of the average ulcer depth on the day of treatment showed that the greatest depth was on day 7. and the shallowest was on day 21 of treatment. Western blot analyses demonstrated that systemic hypoxia resulted in the expression of heat shock factor (HSF) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70). which were highest on day 7 and then regressed gradually.

However. in some individuals. small wounds such as parenteral injections or body piercings may cause increased expression of collagen synthesis. The condition is known as keloid. Histopathology of keloid demonstrates extensive tissue proliferation that extends beyond the margin of primary wound. As a result. it develops uncontrolled or excessive fibrogenesis and tremendous source of collagen that still causes clinical problems until now. A wound. no matter how small the size is. will be followed by increased expression of collagen synthesis. Procollagen I and III is one of markers indicating the development of fibrosis.

This study also aimed to test the hypothesis that systemic chronic hypoxia may cause heart failure.Methods: although clinical use of BNP as a biomarker in heart failure is increasing. the specificity of BNP for heart failure is not robust. suggesting that other mechanisms beyond simple ventricular stretch stimulate BNP release. Plasma BNP levels were markedly increased in patients with coronary artery disease but without concomitant left ventricular dysfunction. Thus. elevated BNP levels do not necessarily reflect heart failure but may also result from cardiac ischemia. Sprague-Dawley male rats. weighing 220-250 g at the time of recruitment were randomly divided into 7 groups (n= 4 per group). the control normoxia group was exposed to room air. while the hypoxia group were caged in a plexiglass hypoxic chamber (8% O2 and 92% N2) for 1. 3. 7. 14. 21. and 28 days. respectively. Results: our data clearly showed that plasma BNP-45 and ventricular BNP-45 mRNA concentration were markedly increased which reached its peak on day 21 after treatment.Conclusion: regulation of BNP-45 gene expression occurred at transcription as well as post-transcription level.

High incidence of oxidative stress-based therapy resistance could be related to the high antioxidant status of GBM cells. Our previous study has reported that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) antioxidant expression was significantly higher in high grade glioma than in low grade. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of MnSOD suppression toward GBM cell survival.Methods: This study is an experimental study using human glioblastoma multiforme T98G cell line. Suppression of MnSOD expression was performed using in vitro transfection MnSOD-siRNA. The MnSOD expression was analyzed by measuring the mRNA using real time RT-PCR. protein using ELISA technique. and specific activity of enzyme using inhibition of xantine oxidase. Concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intracellular was determined by measuring superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. Cell survival was analyzed by measuring viability. proliferation. and cell apoptosis.Results: In vitro transfection of MnSOD-siRNA suppressed the mRNA. protein. and specific activity of MnSOD. This treatment significantly increased the concentration of superoxide radical; however. it did not influence the concentration of hydrogen peroxide.

If the high energy demand during exercise is not balanced by sufficient oxygen supply. hypoxia occurs in skeletal muscle tissue leading to upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1Î±(HIF-1Î±). The activity of HIF-1Î±increases the expression of various genes in order to reduce the metabolic dependence on oxygen and to increase oxygen supply to the tissue. eg. VEGF which plays a role in angiogenesis. In myocardium. it is unclear whether exercise leads to hypoxia and whether HIF-1Î±and VEGF play a role in the mechanism of hypoxic adaptation. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of HIF-1Î±and VEGF in heart muscle tissue of rats during aerobic and anaerobic exercise.Methods: A rat treadmill was used with a specific exercise program for 1. 3. 7 and 10 days. The concentrations of HIF-1Î±and VEGF were measured the myocardium.Results: Both. HIF-1Î±protein and VEGF were increased (p< 0.05) in the groups with aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

The analysis of APOA1 gene revealed that this patient was heterozygous for a cytosine insertion in exon 3 (c.49–50 ins C). resulting in a frame-shift and premature stop codon at position 26 of pro-Apo A-I (Q17PFsX10). This novel mutation. which prevents the synthesis of Apo A-I. was also found in four family members. including three siblings and the daughter of the proband. Carriers of Apo A-I mutation had significantly lower HDL-C and Apo A-I than non-carriers family members (0.77 ± 0.15 mmol/l vs. 1.15 ± 0.20 mmol/l.

The specificity of the process relies on the use of the surface active property of the product to extract it by foaming. The control law is designed to maintain a constant specific biomass growth rate while taking into account the particularity of the process. This law can be regarded as a generalization of the conventional exponential feeding strategy and is generic enough to encompass the case of continuous processes with partial recycling. Conventional exponential feeding strategies indeed fail to account for the loss of biomass induced by the foaming. Previous experiments have provided a model of the process and values for its parameters. From this information. a feeding rate law was computed using the feeding strategy proposed in this paper and applied to an experimental culture.

This proteolytic activity generates the free amino acids needed by the bacteria. but also a large variety of peptides. some of which are endowed with biological activities. These so-called “bioactive peptides” (BAPs) are interesting from nutrition and healthcare point of views. The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as lactobacilli is an effective strategy for production and valorization of new bioactive peptides. The proteolytic activity of lactobacilli is exerted in a strain- and species-dependent manner: each species exhibits different proteinase content. leading to a large variety of proteolytic activities. This underlines the high potential of Lactobacillus strains to produce novel hydrolysates and bioactive peptides of major interest. This review aims at discussing the potential of different Lactobacillus species to release bioactive peptides from fermentation media and processes. Strategies used for peptide production are presented.

The lipopeptides surfactin. plipastatin and mycosubtilin contain distinct cyclic peptide headgroups as well as differences in alkyl chain length. branching and chain length distribution. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and X-ray scattering reveal that surfactin and plipastatin aggregate into 2 nm-radius spherical micelles. whereas in complete contrast mycosubtilin self-assembles into extended nanotapes based on bilayer ordering of the lipopeptides. Circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopy indicate the presence of turn structures in the cyclic peptide headgroup.

Firstly. we develop a new algorithm for gene knockout prediction based on abstract interpretation. which applies to a recent modeling language for reaction networks with partial kinetic information. Secondly. we model the leucine metabolic pathway as a reaction network in this language. and apply the knockout prediction algorithm with the target of leucine overproduction.

Our project aims at characterizing mycosubtilin. surfactin and fengycin. three bacterial cyclic non-ribosomal lipopeptides produced by the rhizobacterium Bacillus subtilis. for their ability to induce resistance in wheat against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici). RT-qPCR approach was used to investigate effect of lipopeptides on expression pattern of defence-related genes. such as PR protein-encoding genes or genes involved in plant defence pathways (reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. lipid peroxidation. phenylpropanoid and octadecanoid pathways) in response to fungus and revealed that expression of LOX and PR1 was strongly induced by surfactin at 24h and 18h after inoculation. respectively. Mycosubtilin seemed to be more efficace to induce expression of OXO and Ltp. Surfactin could also induce expression of chitinase encoding genes but neither surfactin nor mycosubtilin could induce the expression of GSTphi and PAL genes in response to the fungus.,True,GkEbmKcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://europepmc.org/article/med/23878959,1222496126405031853,/scholar?cites=1222496126405031853,,,0,0,0

The microbiome is composed mostly of fungi. bacteria. oomycetes and archaea that can be either pathogenic or beneficial for plant health and fitness. To grow healthy. plants need to surveil soil niches around the roots for the detection of pathogenic microbes. and in parallel maximize the services of beneficial microbes in nutrients uptake and growth promotion. Plants employ a palette of mechanisms to modulate their microbiome including structural modifications. the exudation of secondary metabolites and the coordinated action of different defence responses. Here. we review the current understanding on the composition and activity of the root microbiome and how different plant molecules can shape the structure of the root-associated microbial communities. Examples are given on interactions that occur in the rhizosphere between plants and soilborne fungi. We also present some well-established examples of microbiome harnessing to highlight how plants can maximize their fitness by selecting their microbiome.

Both domains show a strong antifungal activity. but they do not have chitinolitic properties. CD-HEL was found to be endowed with RNase. but not DNase activity. Molecular modeling carried out on both domains revealed that CB-HEL possesses a chitin binding site strictly conserved between hevein-type peptides and that the cavity involved in substrate interaction of CD-HEL do not show any residue substitution with respect to the orthologous wheatwin1 from wheat.

Priming is a physiological process by which a plant exposed to low doses of biotic or abiotic elicitors activates faster and/or stronger defense responses when subsequently challenged by a stress. In this work. we investigated the impact of MeJA-induced defense responses to mechanical wounding in rice (Oryza sativa). The proteome reprogramming of plants treated with MeJA. wounding or MeJA+ wounding has been in-depth analyzed by using a combination of high throughput profiling techniques and bioinformatics tools. Gene Ontology analysis identified protein classes as defense/immunity proteins. hydrolases and oxidoreductases differentially enriched by the three treatments. although with different amplitude. Remarkably. proteins involved in photosynthesis or oxidative stress were significantly affected upon wounding in MeJA-primed plants. Although these identified proteins had been previously shown to play a role in defense responses. our study revealed that they are specifically associated with MeJA-priming. Additionally. we also showed that at the phenotypic level MeJA protects plants from oxidative stress and photosynthetic damage induced by wounding. Taken together. our results add novel insight into the molecular actors and physiological mechanisms orchestrated by MeJA in enhancing rice plants defenses after wounding.

1074798,GLYI4 Plays A Role in Methylglyoxal Detoxification and Jasmonate-Mediated Stress Responses in Arabidopsis thaliana,2019,Silvia Proietti and Gaia Salvatore Falconieri and Laura Bertini and Ivan Baccelli and Elena Paccosi and Antonio Belardo and Anna Maria Timperio and Carla Caruso,9,Biomolecules,,635,,Plant hormones play a central role in various physiological functions and in mediating defense responses against (a) biotic stresses. In response to primary metabolism alteration. plants can produce also small molecules such as methylglyoxal (MG). a cytotoxic aldehyde. MG is mostly detoxified by the combined actions of the enzymes glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII) that make up the glyoxalase system. Recently. by a genome-wide association study performed in Arabidopsis. we identified GLYI4 as a novel player in the crosstalk between jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) hormone pathways. Here. we investigated the impact of GLYI4 knock-down on MG scavenging and on JA pathway. In glyI4 mutant plants. we observed a general stress phenotype. characterized by compromised MG scavenging. accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). stomatal closure. and reduced fitness. Accumulation of MG in glyI4 plants led to lower efficiency of the JA pathway. as highlighted by the increased susceptibility of the plants to the pathogenic fungus Plectospherella cucumerina. Moreover. MG accumulation brought about a localization of GLYI4 to the plasma membrane. while MeJA stimulus induced a translocation of the protein into the cytoplasmic compartment. Collectively. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that GLYI4 is a hub in the MG and JA pathways.

However. two vascular plant species (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) have been able to colonize this hostile environment. Although it has been proposed that C. quitensis possesses tolerance mechanisms and adaptations allowing survival and growth under such stressful conditions. the underlying molecular/transcriptional mechanisms are currently unknown. Furthermore. the impact of global warming on the endophytic and epiphytic organisms associated with C. quitensis remains unclear. Here. a metatranscriptomic approach was used to determine the effect of an in situ simulated global warming scenario on C. quitensis plants.

As a food material. fish is considered to be a highly perishable material; therefore it needs to be processed to prevent spoilage. One way to extend the shelf life of fish is by processing the fish into Fish Protein Concentrate (FPC). The utilization of FPC from Patin fish (Pangasius pangasius) on common food products like chocolate cookies is expected to increase the utilization of fishery product In order to make FPC. fat and moisture content in fish should be removed by extraction. which is influenced by type of solvent and extracting repetition. Extraction using ethanol with 3 repetitions is the most effective method. resulting in Type B of FPC.

Inc.,Roes of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and red snapper (Lutjanus champecanus) are considered as abundant and underutilized by-product in Indonesia. The production of roe protein concentrate (RPC) is expected to increase the economic value and potency of their usage. Tuna and red snapper RPC was defatted using etanol 95% with one. two. three and four times of repetition. Both RPC made with four times repetition of defatting had the highest protein content (79.90% and 80.72%). showed high emulsion activity (97.46% and 99.62%) and emulsion stability (97.10% and 99.48%). and decreased the interfacial tension of 51% and 55.9%. respectively. Mayonnaise was made with 0. 25. 50. 75 and 100% substitution level of each RPC with four times repetition of defatting. The physical. chemical and organoleptic properties of mayonnaise were studied. The best mayonnaise formulation was obtained from 50% substitution level of tuna and red snapper RPC. Mayonnaise with tuna and red snapper RPC had good viscosity (5.920 cPs and 5.845 cPs). high emulsion stability (90.5% and 91.73%) and small fat globule size (±2.5 µm and±2.25 µm). respectively.

We show that MR1. unlike other antigen-presenting molecules. does not constitutively present self-ligands. In the steady state it accumulates in a ligand-receptive conformation within the endoplasmic reticulum. VitB antigens reach this location and form a Schiff base with MR1. triggering a'molecular switch'that allows MR1-VitB antigen complexes to traffic to the plasma membrane. These complexes are endocytosed with kinetics independent of the affinity of the MR1-ligand interaction and are degraded intracellularly. although some MR1 molecules acquire new ligands during passage through endosomes and recycle back to the surface.

The Ags presented by MR1 are vitamin B-related Ags (VitBAgs). ‘building-block’ metabolites of riboflavin that are synthesized by a range of microbes. MR1 presentation is thus a unique mechanism for the immune detection of a pathogen metabolic signature. While the full picture of how MR1 accomplishes this remains incomplete. recent data show that. unlike other MHC molecules. MR1 operates by a presentation-on-demand mechanism. In the absence of metabolite ligands MR1 is mostly stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ligand binding leads to the formation of a Schiff-base bond between MR1 and its ligand. triggering a ‘molecular switch’ in MR1 that allows trafficking of the complexes to the cell surface.

Control of this disease is hindered by the animal reservoirs of the parasite. in particular the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). which is responsible for significant levels of human transmission. A transmission-blocking vaccine administered to buffaloes is a realistic option which would aid in the control of schistosomiasis. This will however require a better understanding of the immunobiology of schistosomiasis in naturally exposed buffaloes. particularly the immune response to migrating schistosome larvae. which are the likely targets of an anti-schistosome vaccine. To address this need we investigated the immune response at the major sites of larval migration. the skin and the lungs. in previously exposed and re-challenged water buffaloes. In the skin. a strong allergic-type inflammatory response occurred. characterised by leukocyte and eosinophil infiltration including the formation of granulocytic abscesses. Additionally at the local skin site. interleukin-5 transcript levels were elevated. while interleukin-10 levels decreased. In the skin-draining lymph node (LN) a predominant type-2 profile was seen in stimulated cells. while in contrast a type-1 profile was detected in the lung draining LN. and these responses occurred consecutively. reflecting the timing of parasite migration. The intense type-2 immune response at the site of cercarial penetration is significantly different to that seen in naive and permissive animal models such as mice. and suggests a possible mechanism for immunity.

This study investigates the interaction between two ovine galectins. galectin-11 and galectin-14. and the parasitic liver fluke. F. hepatica. Galectin-14 was found in eosinophils infiltrating the tissue surrounding infected bile ducts and secreted in the connective tissue. while galectin-11 was specifically induced in epithelial cells of bile ducts from infected sheep.

In particular. downregulation of MHC-I molecules at the cell surface can reduce the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognise viral peptides presented by MHC-I molecules and thereby delay viral clearance by CD8+ T cells. To date. MHC-I downregulation by influenza viruses has not been reported. Given that influenza virus infections are a global health concern and that CD8+ T cells play an important role in promoting influenza virus clearance and recovery from influenza disease. we investigated whether influenza A and B viruses (IAV. IBV) downregulated MHC-I as a novel mechanism to evade cellular immunity. Here. we showed that infection of several cell types. including epithelial A549 cells. with a panel of IAV and IBV viruses downregulated the surface MHC-I expression on IAV/IBV-infected cells during the late stages of influenza virus infection. This observation was consistent across a panel of class I-reduced (C1R) cell lines expressing 14 different HLA-A or -B alleles and a panel of 721.221 cell lines expressing 11 HLA-C alleles. Interestingly. IBV infection caused more pronounced reduction in surface MHC-I expression compared to IAV. Importantly. the two viruses utilized two distinct mechanisms for MHC-I downregulation. Our data demonstrated that while IAV caused a global loss of MHC-I within influenza-infected cells. IBV infection resulted in the preferential loss of MHC-I molecules from the cell surface. consequent of delayed MHC-I trafficking to the cell surface. resulting from retaining …,True,lK07wWoAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,14,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01158/full,10521074337877856,/scholar?cites=10521074337877856,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01158/full,0,0,0

Once ingested. they can spend a substantial time as encysted larvae in the intestinal wall. The larvae can comprise up to 90% of the total burden. with up to several million worms reported in individuals. These stages can emerge in large numbers to cause life-threatening colitis. Direct methods for detection of encysted larval burdens in live horses do not exist. Previously. two antigen complexes were identified as promising markers for infection. A component of these. cyathostomin gut associated larval antigen-1 (Cy-GALA-1). was identified following immunoscreening of a complementary DNA library. Serum immunoglobulin G (T)(IgG (T)) responses to Cy-GALA-1 were shown to inform on larval infection. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from individual worms indicated that Cy-GALA-1 was derived from Cyathostomum pateratum. As cyathostomin infections always comprise multiple species. a diagnostic test must account for this. Here. segments of the Cy-gala gene were isolated from four common species. Cyathostomum catinatum. Cylicocyclus ashworthi. Cylicostephanus goldi andCylicostephanus longibursatus. and the associated proteins expressed in recombinant form.

Bubalus bubalis. 11–12 days post challenge with Schistosoma japonicum cercariae. The selected scFv-phages showed clear enrichment towards adult schistosomes and excretory-secretory (ES) proteins by immunofluorescence. ELISA and western blot analysis. The enriched libraries were used to probe a schistosome specific protein microarray resulting in the recognition of a number of proteins. five of which were specific to schistosomes. with RNA expression predominantly in the adult life-stage based on interrogation of schistosome expressed sequence tags (EST). As the libraries were enriched by panning against ES products. these antigens may be excreted or secreted into the host vasculature and hence may make good targets for a diagnostic assay. Further selection of the scFv library against infected mouse sera identified five soluble scFv clones that could selectively recognise soluble whole adult preparations (SWAP) relative to an irrelevant protein control (ovalbumin).

The present study comprised a systematic review and meta-analysis of ciclosporin and tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients using studies published since January 2000.   Methods Searches of PubMed. the Cochrane Library and EMBASE identified RCTs of tacrolimus and ciclosporin as the immunosuppressant in adult primary liver transplant recipients. published between January 2000 and August 6. 2014. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative risk of death. graft loss. acute rejection (AR). new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) and hypertension with tacrolimus relative to ciclosporin at 12 months.   Results The literature search identified 11 RCTs comparing ciclosporin with tacrolimus.

1074981,The imprint of codons on protein structure,2011,Charlotte M Deane and Rhodri Saunders,6,,6,641-649,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,The “central dogma” of biology outlines the unidirectional flow of interpretable data from genetic sequence to protein sequence. This has led to the idea that a protein's structure is dependent only on its amino acid sequence and not its genetic sequence. Recently. however. a more than transient link between the coding genetic sequence and the protein structure has become apparent. The two interact at the ribosome via the process of co‐translational protein folding. Evidence for co‐translational folding is growing rapidly. but the influence of codons on the protein structure attained is still highly contentious. It is theorised that the speed of codon translation modulates the time available for protein folding and hence the protein structure.

They are advantageous because the discretisation of space can make extensive protein evaluations computationally feasible. Various approaches to the protein chain lattice fitting problem have been suggested but only a single backbone-only tool is available currently. We introduce LatFit. a new tool to produce high-accuracy lattice protein models. It generates both backbone-only and backbone-side-chain models in any user defined lattice. LatFit implements a new distance RMSD-optimisation fitting procedure in addition to the known coordinate RMSD method. We tested LatFit's accuracy and speed using a large nonredundant set of high resolution proteins (SCOP database) on three commonly used lattices: 3D cubic. face-centred cubic. and knight's walk. Fitting speed compared favourably to other methods and both backbone-only and backbone-side-chain models show low deviation from the original data (~1.5 Å RMSD in the FCC lattice). To our knowledge this represents the first comprehensive study of lattice quality for on-lattice protein models including side chains while LatFit is the only available tool for such models.,True,9RqQYfkAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,20,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/148045.pdf,4104081896142264223,/scholar?cites=4104081896142264223,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/148045.pdf,0,0,0

However. experimental methods to determine structure are very costly and time‐consuming. Computational approaches such as folding simulations and structure prediction algorithms are quicker and cheaper but lack consistent accuracy. This currently restricts extensive computational studies to abstract protein models. It is thus essential that simplifications induced by the models do not negate scientific value. Key to this is the use of thoroughly defined proteinlike sequences. In such cases abstract models can allow for the investigation of important biological questions. Here. we present a procedure to generate and classify proteinlike sequence data sets. Our LatPack tools and the approach in general are applicable to arbitrary lattice protein models.

The strongest signature of co‐translational folding is a reduced number of possible favorable contacts in the amino terminus. There is no evidence of fewer contacts. more local contacts. or less‐compact structures.

Optimal use of mechanical ventilation could save costs and improve patient outcomes. Here. the cost effectiveness of proportional assist ventilation (PAV™+ ventilation by Medtronic) is estimated relative to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

Results The mean cost of ICU care was lower with PAV™+ than with PSV in the US and UK. but the total cost of care over 40 years was higher due to more patients surviving and incurring future care costs. Reduced time on mechanical ventilation. fewer nosocomial infections. and extended life expectancy with PAV™+ drove QALY improvement. The cost per QALY gained with PAV™+ was $8.628 and £2.9985.
