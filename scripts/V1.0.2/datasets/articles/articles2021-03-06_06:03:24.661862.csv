1135493,Antioxidant properties of cerium oxide nanocrystals as a function of nanocrystal diameter and surface coating,2013,Seung Soo Lee and Wensi Song and Minjung Cho and Hema L Puppala and Phuc Nguyen and Huiguang Zhu and Laura Segatori and Vicki L Colvin,7,ACS nano,11,9693-9703,American Chemical Society,This work examines the effect of nanocrystal diameter and surface coating on the reactivity of cerium oxide nanocrystals with H2O2 both in chemical solutions and in cells. Monodisperse nanocrystals were formed in organic solvents from the decomposition of cerium precursors. and subsequently phase transferred into water using amphiphiles as nanoparticle coatings. Quantitative analysis of the antioxidant capacity of CeO2–x using gas chromatography and a luminol test revealed that 2 mol of H2O2 reacted with every mole of cerium(III). suggesting that the reaction proceeds via a Fenton-type mechanism. Smaller diameter nanocrystals containing more cerium(III) were found to be more reactive toward H2O2. Additionally. the presence of a surface coating did not preclude the reaction between the nanocrystal surface cerium(III) and hydrogen peroxide. Taken together. the most reactive nanoparticles were the …,True,QgC1LakAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,285,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn4026806,11610528513480970480,/scholar?cites=11610528513480970480,,http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~ls15/segatori/segatori/Publications_files/Sung%202013%20ACS%20Nano.pdf,0,0,0

Most QDs consist of a heavy metal core/shell coated with amphiphilic organics that stabilize the nanoparticles and allow conjugation with biological molecules. In this study. QDs were evaluated for their effects on bacterial pure cultures. which serve as models of cell toxicity and indicators of potential impact to ecosystem health. QDs with intact surface coatings decreased growth rates of Gram positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram negative Escherichia coli but were not bactericidal. In contrast. weathering of various types of QDs under acidic (pH ≤ 4) or alkaline (pH ≥ 10) conditions significantly increased bactericidal activity due to the rapid (<1 min) release of cadmium and selenite ions following QD destabilization upon loss of the organic coating.

However. the RC reactions involving allenoate substrates are very rare. and in particular. asymmetric intramolecular RC reaction of allenoates is yet to be discovered. Here. we show that the intramolecular RC reaction proceeds smoothly in the presence of 1 mol% β-ICD. and bicyclic lactones are obtained in high yields and with excellent enantiomeric excesses. With the employment of γ-substituted allenoates as racemic precursors. a novel dynamic kinetic resolution of allenes via RC reaction is observed. which allows for facile synthesis of highly enantiomerically enriched allenes.,True,jAOGXIgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,54,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13024,11479272245697203254,/scholar?cites=11479272245697203254,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13024,0,0,0

Our study indicates a possible mechanism which couples a conjugate addition and micelle-catalyzed large membered ring formation/elimination sequence. This method enables excellent selectivity towards GSH over other biological thiols such as cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy). The proposed method is precise with a relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 6%(n= 3) and has been successfully applied to determine GSH in human plasma with recoveries between 99.2% and 102.3%.

We investigate the thermal transport property of graphyne nanoribbons (GYNRs) by using the nonequilibrium Green's-function method. The thermal conductance of GYNRs is only approximately 40% that of graphene nanoribbons. A distinct width dependence of the thermal property is observed in GYNRs as well. The conductance of armchair-edged GYNRs (A-GYNRs) shows a linear width dependence. while a steplike width dependence is displayed in the conductance of zigzag-edged GYNRs (Z-GYNRs).

We find that by isotopic superlattice modulation the thermal conductivity of a graphene nanoribbon can be reduced significantly. The thermal transport property of the IS-ZGNRs strongly depends on the superlattice period length and the isotopic mass. As the superlattice period length decreases. the thermal conductivity undergoes a transition from decreasing to increasing. This unique phenomenon is explained by analyzing the phonon transmission coefficient. While the effect of isotopic mass on the conductivity is monotone. Larger mass difference induces smaller thermal conductivity. In addition. the influence of the geometry size is also discussed. The results indicate that isotopic superlattice modulation offers an available way for improving the thermoelectric performance of graphene …,True,gFlMtZMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,86,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/88/28002/meta,8330731888827857572,/scholar?cites=8330731888827857572,,,0,0,0

From both fundamental and technological standpoints. this field requires advancements in three principle directions: (a) understanding the mechanism and driving forces of three-dimensional (3D) SA with both nano- and microlevels of organization; (b) understanding disassembly/deconstruction processes; and (c) finding synthetic methods of assembly into continuous superstructures without insulating barriers. From this perspective. we investigated the formation of well-known star-like PbS superstructures and found a number of previously unknown or overlooked aspects that can advance the knowledge of NP self-assembly in these three directions.

This protocol allows the facile insertion of the halogens (bromines or chlorides) to the porphyrin peripheral positions. The electronic absorption spectra and the redox potentials of the free porphyrins as well as the terbium complexes are dramatically affected as the number of halogen atoms increase. In fact. two antagonistic effects are responsible for that. the inductive and the distortion effects on the porphyrin ring. They result in a red shift for the Soret band and a stabilization/destabilization of the HOMOs/LUMOs which in turn is manifested by variations on the redox potentials.

Copper is needed to form holo-plastocyanin. which must shuttle electrons between photosystems to convert light into biologically useful chemical energy. Copper can bind tightly to proteins. so it has been hypothesized that copper partitions onto ligand-exchange pathways to reach intracellular locations without inflicting damage en route. The copper metallochaperone Atx1 of chloroplast-related cyanobacteria (ScAtx1) engages in bacterial two-hybrid interactions with N-terminal domains of copper-transporting ATPases CtaA (cell import) and PacS (thylakoid import). Here we visualize copper delivery. The N-terminal domain PacSN has a ferredoxin-like fold that forms copper-dependent heterodimers with ScAtx1.

A selection of four solid fuels is considered in the study. namely two plastics (polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate). one lignocellulosic material (Robinia Pseudoacacia) and a South African bituminous coal. Fuels are pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric apparatus at different heating rates. under inert conditions or in the presence of oxygen at different concentration.Results indicate that the action exerted by oxygen during pyrolysis depends on the nature of the fuel and on the process conditions such as heating rate and oxygen concentration. Larger heating rates and larger oxygen concentration may indeed emphasize differences between inert and oxidative pyrolysis.

In this study. two carbons were used: petroleum coke (PC) and South African (SA) coal. Samples of the untreated carbons and samples that were heat treated in nitrogen at temperatures in the range 500–2000°C for different times were characterized by (1) thermogravimetric analysis in air at 500°C and in CO2 at 900 °C and (2) Raman microprobe spectroscopy in the range 200–2500 cm−1. The effects of mineral matter on Raman spectra were found to be negligible.

Pesticidal degradative genes in microbes have been found to be located on plasmids. transposons. and/or on chromosomes. Recent studies have provided clues to the evolution of degradative pathways and the organization of catabolic genes. thus making it much easier to develop genetically engineered microbes for the purpose of decontamination.Genetic manipulation offers a way of engineering microorganisms to deal with a pollutant. including pesticides that may be present in the contaminated sites. The simplest approach is to extend the degradative capabilities of existing metabolic pathways within an organism either by introducing additional enzymes from other organisms or by …,True,MRDmbp0AAAAJ:rKOGDx9nJ1EC,145,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408419609106454,4076486093806695872,/scholar?cites=4076486093806695872,,,0,0,0

What is the evidence for sphenopalatine artery ligation?,2003,S Kumar and A Shetty and J Rockey and E Nilssen,28,,4,360-363,Blackwell Science Ltd,Contemporary surgical treatment of epistaxis. What is the evidence for sphenopalatine artery ligation? The optimal surgical management for failed conservative measures in epistaxis remains unclear. Given the growing enthusiasm for endoscopic transnasal sphenopalatine artery ligation. it is prudent and timely to evaluate the evidence base for this technique. This study aims to analyse the current evidence for transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation by reviewing the literature and also by comparing the results with other approaches to the management of epistaxis. A detailed literature search identified 11 publications relating to endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation. The total number of patients in the pooled series was 127. of which 98% had control of epistaxis following surgery.

1135809,The stability of guar gum in an aqueous system under acidic conditions,2000,Q Wang and PR Ellis and SB Ross-Murphy,14,Food hydrocolloids,2,129-134,Elsevier,The stability of guar galactomannan in acidic conditions was investigated using dilute polymer solutions at temperatures of 25. 37 and 50°C. The depolymerisation of guar galactomannan was monitored by determining changes in solution viscosity. from which the viscosity-average molecular weight was estimated. The lowest pH values at which guar galactomannan remained stable were found to be 2.0. 3.0 and 3.5. respectively. at these temperatures. The acid degradation appears to be a random scission process obeying first order kinetics. The activation energy at pH 1.5. 2.0 and 3.0 were estimated to be 117.4. 118.6 and 120.5 kJ mol−1. respectively. This indicates that guar gum is reasonably stable under an acidic environment. The viscosity of fully hydrated guar gum solutions at acidic pH was found to be slightly lower than it was at neutral pH even when no degradation occurred.

The [7/5-C5 (CH3) 5] 3Co3B4H4 molecule is. to our knowledge. the only structurally characterized species con-taining three mutually bonded M [7j5-C5 (CH3) 5] groups. As we note in the Introduction. prior to the crystal structure determination it was questionable whether such an arrange-ment would be viable. given the unavoidably severe interligand steric crowding. The fact that this structure is nonetheless adopted even at the expense of cobalt-cobalt bond lengthening and considerable bending of the methyl groups out of the C5 ring planes implies strong thermodynamic preference for this particular cluster geometry as opposed to other. less sterically crowded arrangements.

A 6-parameter affine motion model has been used. Coarse estimation is carried out in the frequency domain using polar. log-polar or log-log sampling of the Fourier magnitude spectrum of the sub-sampled image. The sampling scheme is adaptively selected. based on past motion patterns. The refinement stage consists of a RANSAC based model fitting to motion vectors of randomly selected high-activity blocks. and hence is robust to outliers. The motion vector of blocks is measured using phase correlation. which offers two advantages in this context: sub-pixel accuracy without significant computational overhead; and if a particular block consists of background as well as foreground pixels. both motions are simultaneously measured.

Here we report that. independent of inflammasome and membrane proteins. alum binds dendritic cell (DC) plasma membrane lipids with substantial force. Subsequent lipid sorting activates an abortive phagocytic response that leads to antigen uptake. Such activated DCs. without further association with alum. show high affinity and stable binding with CD4+ T cells via the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and lymphocyte function–associated antigen-1 (LFA-1).

In order to enhance their immunogenicity and promote long-lasting immune responses. carbohydrates are often chemically modified to link to an immunogenic protein or peptide fragment for eliciting T-cell-dependent responses.

A simple. flow-limited model provides good simulations of the data at doses of 0.6 mg/m2 (0.03 mg/kg) and 2.7 mg/m2 (0.135 mg/kg) for most normal tissues. This implies that uptake of actinomycin-D in vivo is limited by tissue blood flow rate rather than by cell permeability. However. uptake by the testes is restricted by a blood-testis barrier. and a linear membrane-limited model is required to simulate the testis data. Linear binding of actinomycin-D to tissue is suggested by the fact that tissue concentrations are proportional to dose at least up to the lethal dose in dogs. The binding is also rapid and reversible as indicated by the tissue concentration curves which are parallel to the time course of the declining plasma curves.,True,thNqP2wAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,91,https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/200/3/469.short,1812364196849094723,/scholar?cites=1812364196849094723,,,0,0,0

Gold-based catalysts were revealed to be very active in the oxidation of morin under mild conditions. especially when Li2O is used as additive. and cationic imidazolium ionic liquids are used as AuNPs stabilizer. All kinetic data could be modeled in terms of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model; that is both reactants are assumed to be adsorbed on the surface of the nanoparticles. The apparent reaction rate could therefore be related to the surface of the nanoparticles. to the kinetics constant. related to the rate determining steps. and to the adsorption constant of the reactants.

If the temperature is above the critical temperature of CO2 then the methanol-rich phase can become completely miscible with the CO2-rich phase. and this new phase is completely ionic liquid-free. Since CO2 is nonpolar. it is not equipped to solvate ions. As the CO2 dissolves in the methanol/[C4mim][PF6] mixture. the solvent power of the CO2-expanded liquid is significantly reduced. inducing the formation of the second liquid phase that is rich in ionic liquid. This presents a new way to recover products from ionic liquid mixtures and purify organic phases that have been contaminated with ionic liquid.

The structural characteristics of CHPs in water were studied by static (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the fluorescence probe method. Irrespective of the molecular weight of the parent pullulan and the DS. all of CHPs provided unimodal and monodisperse self-aggregates in water. The size of the self-aggregate decreased with an increase in the DS of the cholesteryl moiety (hydrodynamic radius. 8.4−13.7 nm). However. the aggregation number of CHP in one nanoparticle was almost independent of the DS. The polysaccharide density within the self-aggregate (0.13−0.50 g/mL) was affected by both the molecular weight and the DS of CHPs.

The CHP self-aggregates complexed with one BSA molecule to give colloidally stable nanoparticles (RG = 17 nm) at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. This was almost irrespective of the substitution degree of the cholesterol group of CHP. The helical content of BSA decreased upon complexation. Unfolding of BSA by either heating or a denaturant such as urea was largely suppressed upon complexation. BSA would be incorporated inside into the hydrogel matrix of the CHP nanoparticle. Kinetic analysis of the complexation suggested a two-step process:  namely. the fast pre-equilibrium of looser binding of BSA to the CHP self-aggregate …,True,NI-ixQQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,241,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja953843c,7002057140961735646,/scholar?cites=7002057140961735646,,,0,0,0

Given the large monetary and health costs of medical-device colonization and hospital-acquired infections due to bacteria. there is considerable interest in better understanding of material properties that can limit bacterial adhesion and viability.

A honeycomb film was fabricated by depositing a dilute solution of an amphiphilic polymer on water surface. The honeycomb film transferred onto a solid substrate was characterized by atomic force microscopy. By this fabrication method. it was possible to control film area. pore diameter. and film thickness. The pore size depended upon the evaporation time of the polymer solution spread on water surface. The thickness of a honeycomb film was controlled by spreading area of the polymer solution. The spreading behavior was influenced by the water temperature.

Evidence for the transition from normal vaporization to phase explosion has been obtained for these materials. showing a dramatic increase in the ablation rate at the threshold fluences of 22. 15 and 17.5 J/cm2. respectively.

The fundamental (1064 nm) or second (532 nm) harmonics of a Nd: YAG laser were used for ablation. The evolution of the time-of-flight ion signal from single-peaked to double-peaked and again to single-peaked with increasing laser fluence in the range of 2–25 J/c m 2 has been followed. The analysis of the ion velocity distributions shows that increasing laser fluence results in the appearance of a portion of accelerated ions that can be recognized as an additional fast peak in the time-of-flight distribution. The dependencies of the ion signal on the target-to-collector distance. the background pressure. and the wavelength of laser radiation have been studied.

Both calculations and measurements. performed for laser ablation of Cu in oxygen or noble gases. reveal an oscillatory behaviour of plume expansion dynamics which is strongly dependent on the molecular weight of the ambient gas. Simple gas-dynamic considerations based on the analogy between an ablation plume and a supersonic underexpanded gaseous jet are found to explain a number of the effects of the interaction between the plume and the background gas. The effect of plume focusing observed previously at fairly high pressures of various ambient gases is reasonably described using the phenomenology of the underexpanded jet.

One of such topics is plasma impact on the overall phenomenon of the interaction and its particular features. including influence of the laser-excited plasma re-radiation. back flux of energetic plasma species. and massive material redeposition. on the surface quality and processing efficiency. In this paper. we analyze different plasma aspects. which go beyond a simple consideration of the well-known effect of plasma shielding of laser radiation. The following effects are considered: ambient gas ionization above the target on material processing with formation of a “plasma pipe”; back heating of the target by both laser-driven ambient and ablation plasmas through conductive and radiative heat transfer; plasma chemical effects on surface processing including microstructure growth on liquid metals; complicated dynamics of the ablation plasma flow interacting with an ambient gas that can result in substantial redeposition of material around the ablation spot. Together with a review summarizing our main to-date achievements and outlining research directions. we present new results underlining importance of laser plasma dynamics and photoionization of the gas environment upon laser processing of materials.

Nature employs a variety of coordinating functional groups in siderophore scaffolds as a way of creating structural diversity. We have successfully shown that the pseudomonine synthetase can produce three distinct siderophore natural products and five siderophore-like compounds. The in vitro enzymatic production of acinetobactin has prompted a revision of the reported structure from an oxazoline to an isoxazolidinone.

A unique effect of the N‐glutarimide substituent. leading to uniformly high twist (ca. 90°) irrespective of the steric effect at the carbon side of the amide bond has been found. This represents the first example of a twisted amide that does not bear significant steric hindrance at the α‐carbon atom. The 15N NMR data show linear correlations between electron density at nitrogen and amide bond twist.

The Rb 1 C 60 and Cs 1 C 60 phases undergo diffusionless structural transformations upon cooling and their phase diagrams require solutions that differ from the eutectoid transformation of K 1 C 60. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been used to characterize these transformations. Phase diagrams incorporating two invariant reactions are proposed. The equilibrium vapor pressure of C 60 has been determined at lower temperatures than prevously examined and the pure C 60 phase diagram has been assembled for a large range of temperature and pressure.

Moreover. the demand for powdered CaCO 3 has recently increased considerably in various fields of industry. The aim of this study was therefore to synthesize fine particles of calcite with controlled morphology by hydrothermal carbonation of calcium hydroxide at high CO 2 pressure (initial P CO 2= 55 bar) and at moderate and high temperatures (30 and 90° C).

CH4. N2O and CFCs. The CO2 emissions contribute approximately 60% to this climate change. This study investigates experimentally the aqueous carbonation mechanisms of an alkaline paper mill waste containing about 55 wt% portlandite (Ca(OH)2) as a possible mineralogical CO2 sequestration process. The overall carbonation reaction includes the following steps: (1) Ca release from portlandite dissolution. (2) CO2 dissolution in water and (3) CaCO3 precipitation. This CO2 sequestration mechanism was supported by geochemical modelling of final solutions using PHREEQC software. and observations by scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction of final reaction products.

In the present experimental study. olivine grains were replaced by chrysotile and brucite under high alkaline conditions. In our study. olivine replacement implied a spatial and temporal coupling of dissolution and precipitation reactions at the interface between olivine and chrysotile–brucite minerals. Coupled dissolution–precipitation led to the alteration of starting olivine grains (so-called primary or parent mineral) to a porous mineral assemblage of chrysotile and brucite with preservation of the initial olivine morphology.

We assume that carbonation reaction was then rapidly autocatalysed by the water production and followed by a passivation step due to the formation of a dense layer of carbonate around the reacting particles of portlandite.

However. the swelling potential of soils is also considered a prevalent cause of damage to buildings and constructions. For these reasons. it is fundamental to investigate the physicochemical and mechanical behavior of swelling clays. In the current study. the swelling–shrinkage potential (aggregates scale) was estimated using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) coupled with a digital image analysis (DIA) program (Visilog).

MX80 bentonite (bentonite of Wyoming) contains approximately 85% Na/Ca-montmorillonite and 15% accessory minerals. The dominant presence of Na/Ca-montmorillonite in this clay mineral could cause it to perform exceptionally well as an engineered barrier for a radioactive waste repository because this buffer material is expected to fill up by swelling the void between canisters containing waste and the surrounding ground. However. the Na/Ca-montmorillonite could be transformed to other clay minerals as a function of time under repository conditions. Previous modelling studies based on the hydrolysis reactions have shown that the Na/Ca-montmorillonite-to-Ca-montmorillonite conversion is the most significant chemical transformation.

Among various storage materials and methods currently under investigation. molecular hydrogen adsorption on materials of large surface area [5–8] and clathrate hydrates.[9] the use of bonded hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons.[10] metal hydrides [11. 12] or formic acid (FA)[13–17] show considerable promise.The decomposition of FA as a formate–amine adduct. such as the azeotropic mixture comprising HCO2H and NEt3 (5: 2 molar ratio). is usually the method of choice for hydrogen generation.[18–22] FA decomposition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide can easily be catalyzed by several homogeneous [14. 16. 18–23] and heterogeneous catalysts.[24] In particular. Ru phosphine complexes in the presence of a base. such as triethylamine or sodium formate. in water are quite effective catalysts for this transformation.

In the early 1980s Lehn and co-workers proposed that a simple bicyclic azacryptand (bis-tren) derived from two tren (tris (2-aminoethyl) amine) units might be capable of encapsulating a bifluoride ion.[1] Although not considered as™ discrete∫ ions in that regard. bifluoride does consist of two fluoride ions linked by a hydrogen bridge. However. a crystal structure revealed only a single fluoride ion sitting to one side of the cavity (A). In 1998 we observed ditopic anion binding behavior. namely. two discrete encapsulated nitrate ions. for a related azacryptand.

Different binding modes in solution and solid states in terms of monotopic. ditopic. cascade and sandwich complexes of halides are discussed. The sizes and functional groups of the macrocycles. as well as solvents have been shown to play a critical role in binding and selectivity for anionic guests. In general. macrobicyclic or tricyclic hosts tend to form monotopic complexes with anions of comparable sizes. while an expanded cavity is needed for the higher degree of complexation (e.g.. ditopic or cascade).

A potentiokinetic technique was utilised to analyse the electrochemical characteristics of the anodic polarisation curves of these alloys. A considerable anodic polarisation range (about 2.0 V vs SCE) was used to investigate the possibility of developing a passive regime at such high potential range. The most important feature noted was a rapid rise in current density above a certain critical potential called pitting potential. Ep. The experimental data show that the open circuit potential.

The impedance data indicate that the corrosion of steel is controlled by a charge transfer process at all the temperatures examined and in solutions containing various concentrations of the inhibitor. At a critical concentration of the inhibitor (5 × 10-4 M) a high protection efficiency is maintained over the temperature range examined.

The anisotropic orientation of the cationic dye inside the ZL channel is unambiguously determined and understood. The most stable orientation of MeAcr+. which features both its long and short molecular axes nearly perpendicular to the channel axis. is mainly determined by dye-ZL electrostatic interactions but also depends on the cosolvent water.

1136618,Resorufin in the Channels of Zeolite L,1998,Dominik Brühwiler and Niklaus Gfeller and Gion Calzaferri,102,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,16,2923-2929,American Chemical Society,Zeolite L containing the resorufin anion (Res-) in its anionic framework can be prepared by incorporating the neutral resorufin molecule (ResH) from the gas phase and then exchanging the protons with potassium ions which leads to dark violet colored microcrystals. The reversibility of the deprotonation/protonation reaction of resorufin can be monitored by measuring the UV/vis absorption spectrum of the samples. The absorption spectra of Res- and ResH and their solvent dependence was interpreted using the EHMO-EDiT theory. While Res- is strongly fluorescent in solution. the fluorescence is completely quenched when Res- is located inside the channels of potassium zeolite L. This allows the investigation of the exit kinetics of the resorufin molecules as a function of the size of the solvent molecules which enter the zeolite channels and displace the incorporated resorufin molecules irreversibly.

An accepted ice nucleation pathway. known as deposition nucleation. assumes a direct transition of water from the vapor to the ice phase. without an intermediate liquid phase. However. studies have shown that nucleation occurs through a liquid phase in porous particles with narrow cracks or surface imperfections where the condensation of liquid below water saturation can occur. questioning the validity of deposition nucleation. We show that deposition nucleation cannot explain the strongly enhanced ice nucleation efficiency of porous compared with nonporous particles at temperatures below −40 °C and the absence of ice nucleation below water saturation at −35 °C.

The organic dye hostasol red (HR) is strongly luminescent in aprotic solvents but only weakly luminescent in potassium zeolite L (ZL) at ambient conditions. We observed a dramatic increase of the luminescence quantum yield of HR–ZL composites if some or all exchangeable potassium cations of ZL are substituted by an organic imidazolium cation (IMZ+) and if the acceptor HR is embedded in the middle part of the channels. so that it is fully protected by the environment of the perylene dye tb-DXP. This led to the discovery of a highly efficient donor.acceptor-ZL antenna material where tb-DXP acts as donor and HR acts as acceptor. The material has a donor-to-acceptor (D/A) absorption ratio of more than 100:1 and a nearly quantitative FRET efficiency. Synthesis of this host–guest material is reported.

The photoactivity of AgCl extends from the UV into the visible light region in a process known as self-sensitization. which is due to the formation of silver during the photoreaction. This silver can be almost quantitatively reoxidized electrochemically. making it feasible that a thin AgCl layer deposited on a conducting substrate can be used as a photoanode for water splitting if coupled with an appropriate photocathode. The silver chloride/silver cluster phase boundary plays a decisive role in the photocatalytic silver chloride electrode system. We have therefore studied this interphase by means of quantum chemical calculations from which we report first results. specifically for the (Ag)115(AgCl)192 composite. Clusters of semiconducting materials are interesting considering their application as a photocathode in such a device.

Stopcocks that rely on van-der-Waals-driven adsorption require careful selection of the solvent used for the deposition onto the zeolite surface to avoid a nonspecific distribution of the molecules.

These devices allow fast energy transfer from an electronically excited molecule to an unexcited neighbor molecule in such a way that the excitation energy reaches the reaction center with high probability.

Fluorescence from the dye was observed only at the base planes of the cylindrical zeolite L crystals. indicating selective modification of the channel entrances. Leaching of the dye was observed when the material was dispersed in ethanol immediately after the insertion. suggesting reversibility of adsorption. A stable material was obtained after refluxing in toluene. This procedure led to the formation of covalent siloxane bonds between the triethoxysilyl group and silanol groups at the entrances of the zeolite channels. Hence. selective modification of the channel entrances is achieved via consecutive insertion and covalent bond formation processes. An appropriate choice of solvent for the insertion step is crucial.

In this vein. the Cu-catalyzed enantioselective conjugate alkynylation of Meldrum’s acid acceptors is reported using Me-StackPhos. Enabled by this new ligand. the reaction tolerates a wide range of alkynes furnishing the products in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity.

In contrast to the previously proposed syn-oxypalladation mechanism for acyclic monoallylic diols. calculations and experiments strongly suggest that hydrogen bonding templates a hydroxyl group and Pd addition across the alkene and provides a low energy pathway via anti-addition (anti-oxypalladation) followed by intramolecular proton transfer and anti-elimination of water. This anti-addition. anti-elimination pathway also provides a simple rationale for the observed stereospecificity. For bicyclic monoallylic diol compounds.

The combination of both d- and l-amino acids into heterochiral sequences is a versatile strategy for building durable supramolecular architectures. especially when their homochiral analogs do not self-assemble. The reasons for this divergent behavior have remained obscure until now. Here. we elucidate how and why homochiral and heterochiral peptides behave differently.

We recently developed a novel class of sensors composed of RNAs that can be used to detect diverse small molecules and untagged proteins. These sensors are based on Spinach. an RNA mimic of GFP. and they have successfully been used to image several metabolites and proteins in living bacteria. Here we discuss the generation and optimization of these Spinach-based sensors. which. unlike most currently available genetically encoded reporters. can be readily generated to any target of interest.

The attachment of ubiquitin to a protein substrate is accomplished through an enzymatic cascade involving the actions of an activating enzyme (E1). a conjugating enzyme (E2). and a ligase (E3). There are more than 600 E3 ligases estimated to exist in the human genome that regulate the targeting specificity of protein ubiquitination. To understand the dynamic role of protein ubiquitination in biological processes. robust tools need to be developed which can be employed to establish the substrate specificity of each of these E3 ligases.

Two size regimes were investigated: very small crystallites. made in reverse micelle systems. andlarger crystallites. made as primitive photographic emulsions. Two mechanisms are thought to be re-sponsible for the enhancement of the indirect exciton emission: defect exclusion (for the larger and smaller particles) and quantum size effects (in the smaller particles only). Trapping at defects. which is the favored pathwayfor relaxation of photoexcited charge carriers in the bulk. appears to be a less likely pathway in “small” relative to indirect exciton emission.

Although the native hormone arginine-vasopressin leads to activation of both the stimulatory G protein (Gs) for the adenylyl cyclase and arrestin pathways. synthetic ligands exhibit highly biased signaling through either Gs alone or arrestin alone.

It is demonstrated to be effective for the correction of non‐uniform imaging characteristics across the image (shading correction) as well as for relating fluorescence intensities between images taken with different microscopes or imaging conditions. The variation of the illumination intensity over the image can be determined on the basis of the uniform bleaching characteristics of the layers. This permits correction for the latter and makes bleach‐rate‐related imaging practical. The significant potential of these layers for calibration in quantitative fluorescence microscopy is illustrated with a series of applications.

Internalization thus contributes to the diversity of GPCR-dependent signaling. and its dynamics and quantification in living cells has generated considerable interest. We developed a robust and sensitive assay to follow and quantify ligand-induced and constitutive GPCR internalization but also receptor recycling in living cells. This assay is based on diffusion-enhanced resonance energy transfer (DERET) between cell surface GPCRs labeled with a luminescent terbium cryptate donor and a fluorescein acceptor present in the culture medium. GPCR internalization results in a quantifiable reduction of energy transfer. This method yields a high signal-to-noise ratio due to time-resolved measurements. For various GPCRs belonging to different classes. we demonstrated that constitutive and ligand-induced internalization could be monitored as a function of time and ligand concentration. thus allowing accurate quantitative determination of kinetics of receptor internalization but also half-maximal effective or inhibitory concentrations of compounds. In addition to its selectivity and sensitivity. we provided evidence that DERET-based internalization assay is particularly suitable for characterizing biased ligands.

Different quantum-chemical methods were used to calculate the molecular structures and vibrational force fields in the ground state of the radical cation and in the resonant excited state. An excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental vibrational frequencies as well as resonance Raman intensities could be achieved. It is concluded that through-σ-bond interaction between the formal lone pair on one amino nitrogen and the odd electron on the other is strong enough to lead to a symmetric charge-delocalized molecular structure of the DMP radical cation. with a chair-type geometry. ,True,8CrBs7cAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,32,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja9735721,2560336430176271074,/scholar?cites=2560336430176271074,,,0,0,0

Surfaces become hydrophilic (water contact angle. ∼0°) after UV irradiation and gradually revert to a more hydrophobic state (contact angles. 50−70°) when left in the dark or exposed to visible light. Such changes have been observed for both anatase and rutile surfaces (single crystals and polycrystals) and presumably are not directly related to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. We report here similar changes of the contact angle of water on flat titania wafers and on densely packed layers of micron-sized titania particles. Wettability changes can be reversibly cycled. and the effect is rather robust.

Our combined study shows that criteria for spontaneous film formation. based on thermodynamic considerations as well as on simple geometric modelling of the meniscus shape. are insufficient to predict the onset of wicking. High aspect ratio pillars with a square cross-section may display a re-entrant pinning regime as the density of the pillars is increased. a behaviour that is captured by neither of the aforementioned models. Numerically computed energy landscapes for the advancing meniscus allow us to explain the re-entrant behaviour in terms of energy barriers between topologically different meniscus shapes.

Confined monodisperse gel emulsions self-organize into well-ordered droplet arrangements. which may be stable or metastable. depending on the geometry of the confining microchannel. Three arrangements are considered. in which the droplets are aligned in a single file. a two row. or a three row arrangement. We explore the potential for induced transitions between these distinct droplet arrangements as a tool for droplet-based microfluidic processing. Transitions are readily achieved by means of localized (geometrical) features in channel geometry. however the onset of the transition is strongly dependent on the subtleties of the microfluidic system. e.g. volume fraction. droplet size. and feature dimensions.

A careful analysis of the role of the dopant indicates that the fragmentations are not dependent on the nature of the dopant but on their ionization efficiencies.

In this work. vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) grown SiNWs were controllably roughened and then thoroughly characterized with transmission electron microscopy to obtain detailed surface profiles.

Aberrant regulation of KLKs has been associated with diverse diseases such as hypertension. renal dysfunction. skin disorders. inflammation. neurodegeneration. and cancer. Recent studies suggested that coordinated activation and regulation of KLK activity are achieved via a complex network of interactions referred to as the “KLK activome.” However. it remains to be validated whether these hypothetical KLK activation cascade pathways are operative in vivo.

These new cellular traits evolve from defects in major regulatory microcircuits that are fundamental for normal homeostasis. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) as a new class of small non-protein-coding RNAs that control gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to various mRNA targets suggests that these tiny RNA molecules likely act as molecular switches in the extensive regulatory web that involves thousands of transcripts.

The disease is characterized by extensive skin desquamation. inflammation. allergic manifestations and hair shaft defects. NS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 encoding the LEKTI serine protease inhibitor. LEKTI deficiency results in unopposed activities of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) and aberrantly increased proteolysis in the epidermis. Spink5-/- mice recapitulate the NS phenotype. display enhanced epidermal Klk5 and Klk7 protease activities and die within a few hours after birth because of a severe skin barrier defect. However the contribution of these various proteases in the physiopathology remains to be determined.

1137030,Evolutionary history of tissue kallikreins,2010,Athanasia Pavlopoulou and Georgios Pampalakis and Ioannis Michalopoulos and Georgia Sotiropoulou,5,PLoS One,11,e13781,Public Library of Science,The gene family of human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) encodes proteins with diverse and pleiotropic functions in normal physiology as well as in disease states. Currently. the most widely known KLK is KLK3 or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that has applications in clinical diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer. The KLK gene family encompasses the largest contiguous cluster of serine proteases in humans which is not interrupted by non-KLK genes. This exceptional and unique characteristic of KLKs makes them ideal for evolutionary studies aiming to infer the direction and timing of gene duplication events. Previous studies on the evolution of KLKs were restricted to mammals and the emergence of KLKs was suggested about 150 million years ago (mya). In order to elucidate the evolutionary history of KLKs. we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of KLK homologous proteins in multiple genomes including those that have been completed recently. Interestingly. we were able to identify novel reptilian. avian and amphibian KLK members which allowed us to trace the emergence of KLKs 330 mya. We suggest that a series of duplication and mutation events gave rise to the KLK gene family. The prominent feature of the KLK family is that it consists of tandemly and uninterruptedly arrayed genes in all species under investigation. The chromosomal co-localization in a single cluster distinguishes KLKs from trypsin and other trypsin-like proteases which are spread in different genetic loci. All the defining features of the KLKs were further found to be conserved in the novel KLK protein sequences.

Novel kallikrein genes were cloned recently. and it was shown that the human kallikrein family contains 15 genes tandemly aligned on chromosomal locus 19q13.3-q13.4.

Evidence is presented that certain kallikreins may be exploited as diagnostic cancer biomarkers. Although the function(s) of novel kallikreins is currently unknown. increasing evidence suggests that kallikreins may participate in regulatory enzymatic cascade(s).

Recent studies. mostly relying on in vitro proteolysis of recombinant proteins. have suggested that KLK activities are regulated by proteolytic activation cascades that can operate in a tissue-specific manner. such as the semen liquefaction and skin desquamation cascades. The validity of KLK activation cascades in vivo largely remains to be demonstrated. Here. we focus on recent investigations showing that KLKs represent interesting players in the broader field of immunology based on their ability to bridge their inherent ability to degrade the extracellular matrix with major functions of the immune system. More specifically. KLKs assist in the infiltration of immune cells through the skin and the blood brain barrier. whereas they catalyze the generation of antimicrobial peptides by proteolytic activation and further processing of protein precursors. In an attempt to integrate current knowledge. we propose KLK-mediated pathways that are putatively involved in inflammation associated with skin wounding and central nervous system disorders. including multiple sclerosis.

1137033,Multiple mechanisms underlie the aberrant expression of the human kallikrein 6 gene in breast cancer,2006,Georgios Pampalakis and Georgia Sotiropoulou,387,,6,773-782,Walter de Gruyter,Human kallikrein 6 (KLK6) was identified based on its transient upregulation in a primary breast tumor and its subsequent silencing in a metastatic tumor from the same patient. The molecular mechanism (s) underlying the deregulated expression of KLK6 during cancer progression are currently unknown. Here. we provide evidence that aberrant expression of KLK6 is regulated at the level of transcription by multiple cooperating mechanisms. KLK6 can be reactivated in non-expressing breast cancer cells by treatment with 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). a compound causing DNA demethylation. Trichostatin A (TSA). an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. resulted in moderate induction of KLK6 only in MDA-MB-231 cells. However. combined 5-azadC/TSA treatment resulted in synergistic activation of KLK6. We show that KLK6 inactivation is associated with hypermethylation of specific CpG dinucleotides located in the KLK6 proximal promoter and overexpression with complete demethylation. These results indicate a causal role of DNA methylation and chromatin structure in cancer-associated loss of KLK6 expression. In some breast cancer cell lines. KLK6 expression could be restored by the vitamin D3 analog EB1089. Our data indicate that transcriptional deregulation of KLK6 in cancer cells during breast cancer progression is complex and certainly not uniform in different tumors. involving epigenetic mechanisms as well as pathways regulated by nuclear receptors.

The NOSs catalyse the sequential mono-oxygenation of arginine to N-hydroxyarginine and then to citrulline and NO. The constitutive NOS isoforms (cNOSs) are regulated by calmodulin (CaM). which binds at elevated concentrations of free Ca2+. whereas the inducible isoform binds CaM irreversibly. One of the main structural differences between the constitutive and inducible isoforms is an insert of 40–50 amino acids in the FMN-binding domain of the cNOSs. Deletion of the insert in rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) led to a mutant enzyme which binds CaM at lower Ca2+ concentrations and which retains activity in the absence of CaM.

LATS1 is a central player of the emerging Hippo-LATS suppressor pathway. which plays important roles in cell proliferation. apoptosis. and stem cell differentiation. Despite the ample data supporting a role for LATS1 in tumor suppression. how LATS1 is regulated at the molecular level remains largely unknown. In this study. we have identified Itch. a HECT class E3 ubiquitin ligase. as a unique binding partner of LATS1.

Mounting evidence argues that cancer cell apoptosis triggered by antitubulin drugs relies upon activation of the cell-cycle kinase Cdk1; however. mechanistic connections of this event to apoptosis remain obscure. In this study. we identified the antiapoptotic protein YAP. a core component of the Hippo signaling pathway implicated in tumorigenesis. as a critical linker coupling Cdk1 activation to apoptosis in the antitubulin drug response. Antitubulin drugs activated Cdk1. which directly phosphorylated YAP on five sites independent of the Hippo pathway.

Because of the difficulty associated with selective fluorination. this class of molecules represent a formidable synthetic challenge. An alternative approach to selective fluorination of biaryls is to couple an arene that already possesses C–F bonds in the desired location. This strategy has been regularly utilized and relies heavily on traditional cross-coupling strategies that employ organometallics and halides (or pseudohalides) in order to achieve the coupling.

This layer consists of pillow-shaped masses of coarse biosparite within a biomicrite matrix. The pillows are 0.6–0.8 m thick and 1.5–4.0 m across. Experiments using layers of calcareous sand above calcareous mud have demonstrated that such structures may be produced by subjecting saturated sediments to seismic shocks. These Viséan carbonate ball and pillow structures are attributed to loading. resulting from liquefaction of underlying calcareous mud during the passage of earthquake shock waves associated with the Gulf Fault.,True,2Ay-tQoAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC,35,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/carbonate-ball-and-pillow-structures/A30B7DD463C5A19E12FA66CFE8A2F1EA,3088387016093576770,/scholar?cites=3088387016093576770,,,0,0,0

The photocatalytic reductive coupling of aryl bromides with unactivated alkenes is introduced as a convenient method that circumvents any need for synthesis of sp3-hybridized coupling partners. The reaction takes place via photoinduced electron transfer from a tertiary amine to an aryl bromide that fragments to provide an aryl radical and subsequently reacts with an alkene to form a C–C bond. Conveniently. the amine also serves as the final reductant. The method is operationally simple. functional group tolerant. and takes place with selectivities that will allow it to be used in the context of complex molecule synthesis.,True,2Ay-tQoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,34,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.orglett.5b01711,6416608687278242239,/scholar?cites=6416608687278242239,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amandeep_Arora/publication/286767295_ChemInform_Abstract_Reductive_Alkylation_of_2-Bromoazoles_via_Photoinduced_Electron_Transfer_A_Versatile_Strategy_to_Csp_2_-Csp_3_Coupled_Products/links/56d31dbf08ae059e376122b8.pdf,0,0,0

The decisive step in the determining regioselectivity in fluorine functionalization is fluoride fragmentation from the radical anion of the multifluorinated arene. To date. the availability of regioisomers has been dictated by the innate electronics of the fluorinated arene. limiting the synthetic utility of the chemistry. This study investigates the remarkable ability of a strategically located hydrogen bond to transcend the normal regioselectivity of the C–F functionalization event. A significant rate acceleration is additionally observed for hydrodefluorination of fluorines that can undergo intramolecular hydrogen bonds that form 5–8-membered cycles with moderately acidic N–H’s. The hydrogen bond is expected to facilitate the fragmentation not only by bending the C–F bond of the radical …,True,2Ay-tQoAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,28,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b06847,10812675230473471529,/scholar?cites=10812675230473471529,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069595/,0,0,0

However. the use of molecules with built-in strain is often complicated as a result of instability or selectivity issues. Here. we show that such strain. and subsequent cycloadditions. can be mediated by visible light via the harvesting of photochemical energy. Through theoretical investigations and molecular engineering of strain-loadable cycloalkenes. we demonstrate the rapid chemoselective cycloaddition of alkyl azides with unstrained cycloalkenes via the transiently (reversibly) formed trans-cycloalkene. We assess this system via the rapid bioconjugation of azide-functionalized insulin. An attractive feature of this process is the cleavable nature of the linker. which makes a catch-and-release strategy possible.

South Wales,1975,JD Weaver,10,Geological Journal,1,75-86,John Wiley & Sons Ltd,The Swansea Valley Disturbance is one of four NE‐SW belts of faulting and folding which cross the northern limb of the South Wales Coalfield syncline at variance with the normal E‐W Variscan structures. The Disturbance extends from Hay‐on‐Wye (Herefordshire) southwestwards to Clydach (near Swansea) and may extend northeastwards to Titterstone Clee Hill (near Ludlow) and southwestwards along the Tircanol Fault to Swansea Bay.The main structural elements of the Disturbance are: impersistent NE‐SW folds; NE‐SW normal faults; and NE‐SW and NNW‐SSE wrench faults. The NE‐SW structures are confined to a narrow zone which seldom exceeds two kilometres in width.It is suggested that this narrow belt of faulting and folding has been controlled mainly by sub‐Devonian basement structures. which involve faulting and/or folding.

Because the reagents used in acute experiments react not only with BDNF but also with neurotrophin-4/5 (NT4/5) and neurotrophin-3 (NT3). we examined the involvement of these neurotrophins in LTP using two highly specific. function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against BDNF and NT3. as well as a TrkB-IgG fusion protein. Our results show that NT3 antibodies did not have any effects on LTP. However. both TrkB-IgG fusion proteins and BDNF antibody similarly reduced LTP. suggesting that only BDNF but no other ligands of the TrkB-receptor are likely to be involved in LTP induction. The reduction in LTP depended on the inducing stimuli and was only observed with theta-burst stimulation (TBS) but not with tetanic stimulation.

A mechanism for the correlation of activity in simultaneously active pre‐and postsynaptic neurons could be provided by the properties of the N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its associated Ca2+ channel. which opens in a transmitter‐and voltage‐dependent manner. We have studied the effects on cortical plasticity of blocking NMDA receptors in different ways with competitive and non‐competitive NMDA antagonists.

The validity of the Hebbian rule was tested in the cortex. using slices of visual cortex from young rats. Results indicate that this rule is not strictly valid in the cortex. Double intracellular recordings showed that synaptic reinforcement was not confined to the depolarized postsynaptic neurons but was also observed in adjacent but not coactivated neurons.

This movement was not observed when a flexible loop was inserted between the α5 helix and the R*-binding C terminus. which uncouples R* binding from nucleotide exchange. suggesting that this movement is necessary for GDP release.

On the background of phosphorylation-independent mutants that bind with high affinity to both P-Rh⁎ and light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin. these mutations reduce the stability of the arrestin complex with P-Rh⁎. but not with light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin.

To evaluate the influence of base identity on the intrinsic reactivity of each nucleotide. we analyze NMIA and 1M7 reactivity using four distinct RNAs. under both native and denaturing conditions. We show that guanosine and adenosine residues have identical intrinsic 2′-hydroxyl reactivities at pH 8.0 and are 1.4 and 1.7 times more reactive than uridine and cytidine. respectively.

These mRNAs lack both 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. The mechanism by which the specialized mitochondrial translational apparatus locates start codons and initiates translation of these leaderless mRNAs is currently unknown. To better understand this mechanism. the secondary structures near the start codons of all 13 open reading frames have been analyzed using RNA SHAPE chemistry. The extent of structure in these mRNAs as assessed experimentally is distinctly lower than would be predicted by current algorithms based on free energy minimization alone. We find that the 5′ ends of all mitochondrial mRNAs are highly unstructured.

Mono- and divalent ions stabilize the native fold of RNA. whereas other polyvalent cationic ligands can act to both stabilize or disrupt native RNA structure. In this work. we analyze the effects of two ligands. Mg2+ and tobramycin. on the folding of S. cerevisiae tRNAAsp transcripts using single nucleotide resolution SHAPE chemistry. Surprisingly. reducing the Mg2+ concentration favors a structural rearrangement in which the D- and variable loops pair. The tobramycin polycation binds to loops in tRNAAsp and induces RNA unfolding in two distinct transitions: the loss of tertiary interactions between the T- and D-loops followed by complete unfolding of the D-stem. Although Mg2+ and tobramycin are relatively simple ligands. both modulate tRNAAsp folding in unanticipatedly complex ways. neither of which is consistent …,True,VAp-ANoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,53,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi702372x,75988293112322363,/scholar?cites=75988293112322363,,https://webshare.oasis.unc.edu/weeksgroup/pdf-files/2008_bw_bch.pdf,0,0,0

1137293,High-throughput SHAPE analysis reveals structures in HIV-1 genomic RNA strongly conserved across,2008,KA Wilkinson and RJ Gorelick and SM Vasa and N Guex and A Rein,,,,,,As is the case with many natural RNAs. the function of the HIV RNA genome is strongly linked to its ability to form higher-order structure and to interact with protein effectors in each stage of its replication cycle. The 59 end of the HIV genome alone contains a noncoding. highly structured region that is involved in viral packaging. dimerization. pairing with the cellular tRNA primer for cDNA synthesis. and binding numerous viral proteins [1. 2]. Immediately downstream of this regulatory region. the HIV genome contains nine open reading frames. The first protein encoded by the HIV-1 genome is Gag. which is ultimately cleaved into a complex set of proteins. including matrix. capsid. and nucleocapsid [2]. The nucleocapsid protein has two dissimilar RNA binding activities. First. as part of the Gag precursor protein. the nucleocapsid domain specifically recognizes and directs the HIV genome to be packaged into new virions [3–5] in the context of a vast excess of other cellular RNAs. In contrast. the nucleocapsid protein also has a significant duplex destabilizing activity. which plays a key role in facilitating the RNA annealing and rearrangement events essential for viral reverse transcription [6. 7]. Because of its importance in regulating replication and for governing interactions with protein cofactors. extensive efforts have been directed towards developing structural models for the HIV-1 genome and for identifying candidate interaction sites for the nucleocapsid protein. Multiple models based on phylogenetic. chemical mapping. and mutagenesis approaches have been proposed [8–17].

1137294,The SHAPE of tRNA folding and of the 5'-end of the HIV-1 genome,2007,Kevin A Wilkinson,,,,,,Most RNAs function only once they fold to form difficult-to-predict base-paired helices and other structural elements. As an RNA forms a preferred secondary or tertiary structure. a characteristic set of nucleotides becomes constrained by base pairing and higher-order interactions. while unconconstrained positions remain flexible. Determining local nucleotide flexibility as a function of nucleotide position in a folded RNA provides important information that enables the sequence and structure of an RNA to be related to its biological function. I have developed a technology. termed selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). that can be used to interrogate RNA structure under diverse in vitro and in vivo conditions. SHAPE chemistry can be applied to monitor protein binding events and locate promising sites for primer annealing in arbitrary RNA. SHAPE chemistry is based on the discovery that flexible RNA nucleotides preferentially sample conformations that enhance the nucleophilic reactivity of the 2'-hydroxyl group toward electrophiles. such as N-methylisatoic anhydride. Modified sites are detected as stops in an optimized DNA primer extension reaction. followed by sizing of the extension products. SHAPE chemistry scores local flexibility at all four ribonucleotides in a single experiment and discriminates between base-paired versus unconstrained residues with a dynamic range of 20-fold or greater. I have applied SHAPE chemistry to observe equilibrium melting of a model tRNA at single nucleotide resolution. I observed that RNA folding is a complex process involving structural rearrangement and the formation of tertiary …,True,VAp-ANoAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,0,https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/vq27zp259,,,,https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/downloads/gm80hw39q,0,0,0

The start codons of the mRNAs are usually within the first 8 nucleotides of the 5′ end. Since mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs do not have a Shine‐Dalgarno sequence as in prokaryotes nor a 5′ cap as in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes. a different mechanism must be used for start codon recognition. As a first step in understanding how the start codon of mitochondrial mRNAs is recognized we have used Selective 2′‐Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) to map the secondary structure of the 5′ ends of the mRNAs for cytochrome oxidase subunits II and III.

1137321,Reactions of coordinated ligands,1993,Allan Blackman,58,,,123-170,Academic Press,This chapter reviews the reactions of transition metal-bound aromatic heterocycles. focusing on the ways in which metal coordination affects the reactivity of the bound heterocycle in comparison to that of the free ligand. The coordination of a ligand to a metal ion has long been known to alter its chemical properties. The coordination of a ligand to a transition metal perturbs both the d-orbitals of the metal and the molecular orbitals of the ligand via a combination of electronic and steric effects. and these interactions can significantly alter the reactivity of the bound ligand relative to its free counterpart. The coordination to a metal ion also introduces steric constraints that are not present in the free ligand. Consequently. ligand atoms adjacent to the metal ion are sterically hindered and reactivity at these sites may be reduced or indeed totally eliminated.,True,f0dOKwkAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065272508602858,1094972061258619272,/scholar?cites=1094972061258619272,,,0,0,0

This result has been interpreted considering that the nature of the bridge affects the overall molecular shape and the p.p‘-substituents affect both the molecular polarizability and shape. This investigation points out that the polarizability of the solute and the solvent is the main parameter in determining the value of the twisting power while electrostatic arene−arene interactions contribute to a less extent.

The strong bathochromic effect exerted by the nitro group in the para position of the phenyl sulfoxides indicates that the sulfur atom acts as an electron donor moiety towards the phenyl ring. Such behavior requires a significant 2p(C)–3sp3(S) overlap. and therefore the phenyl (and p‐substituted phenyl) sulfoxides 1—‐12. as well as the 2‐naphthyl sulfoxides 15 and 16. must assume a conformation which permits such orbital overlap. The steric effect of the peri hydrogen in 1‐naphthyl‐substituted compounds 13 and 14 does not allow a conformation of this type. and in these compounds the above‐mentioned 2p(C) and 3sp3(S) orbitals are positioned in almost orthogonal planes.

The advantage of the SSNMR approach described herein is the ability to measure both ϕ and ψ to high resolution using a single noncrystalline. doubly carbonyl labeled peptide. It is also shown that DRAWS and DQDRAWS data are insensitive to 14N−13C and 15N−13C dipolar couplings making corrections for these effects unnecessary. Extremes in secondary structure (e.g.. α-helix vs β-sheet) can be discerned by simple inspection of DQDRAWS spectra.

Recoupling sequences are used for excitation of double-quantum coherence. which. in turn. is employed in experiments to estimate internuclear distances and molecular torsion angles. Much effort is spent on the design of recoupling sequences that are able to produce double-quantum coherence with high efficiency in demanding spin systems. i.e.. spin systems with small dipole−dipole couplings and large chemical-shift anisotropies (CSAs). The sequence should perform robustly under a variety of experimental conditions.

Deposition of fibrils on a planar substrate creates a highly anisotropic distribution of fibril orientations (hence. CSA tensor orientations) with most fibrils lying in the substrate plane. The anisotropic orientational distribution gives rise to distorted spinning sideband patterns in MAS spectra from which the fibril axis direction can be inferred.

Since electrodes are not required. the intrinsic properties of the photoactive layer itself can be studied in the absence of complications arising from non-ohmic contacts. short-circuits and exciton deactivation at the bilayer/electrode interfaces. The exclusion of such complications is particularly important when attempting to obtain fundamental information on the processes of exciton diffusion within the antenna layer and charge separation at the semiconductor/antenna interface.The magnitude of an FP-TRMC photoconductivity transient is determined by the concentration of highly mobile conduction-band electrons present in the semiconductor layer. By comparing the photo-conductivity on photoexcitation of the antenna layer in the visible with that for direct bandgap excitation of the semiconductor in the UV. absolute values of the efficiency of sensitization can be derived. Photoconductivity action spectra throughout the visible can be measured using a laser capable of continuous wavelength tuning from 420 to 700 nm.

Flowing the sample during exposure helps to reduce the problem. but its effectiveness in the laminar-flow regime is limited by slow flow velocity at the walls of sample cells. To overcome this limitation. the coflow method was developed. where the sample flows through the centre of its cell surrounded by a flow of matched buffer. The method permits an order-of-magnitude increase of X-ray incident flux before sample damage. improves measurement statistics and maintains low sample concentration limits.

The equations of motion describing the gas phase are relatively well known and the approximations in the various gas phase sub-models have been extensively studied. However. coupling of the gas phase and the condensed phase to describe flame spread over a burning solid. has proven to be difficult to model. This is due to a lack of understanding of the underlying physical phenomena that take place during the decomposition of the solid as well as poor characterization of the fundamental material properties that control the burning process.The overall goal of this project is to improve the capability of the fire models to predict flame spread over materials that typically burn in a compartment fire. In this paper. we attempt to simulate fire growth and spread on 10 cm thick slabs of polyurethane foam. A multi-layered. multi-material model was developed to simulate flame spread. and material properties were obtained from various small scale experiments. Model predictions were compared with large scale experiments on polyurethane foam slabs. ignited on one edge. Results indicate that the model is capable of qualitatively predicting the observed trends in heat release rate. flame spread rate and heat fluxes measured in the experiments.

Additionally a small effect of the heme cofactor on the surface structure is identified for myoglobin not for apomyoglobin.

In the last two decades. research interest in CPs. such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs). has grown rapidly owing to their exclusive advantageous properties (e.g.. exceptionally high surface area. chemical and thermal stability. molecular functionality. porosity. electron mobility. thermal conductivity. and mechanical strength). In this study. we started with a basic question: Why and how are coordination polymers special and how do they differ from other classes of polymers? Next. we explored the value of unique and innovative CPs in line with the advent of design and synthesis approaches.

1137502,Partitioning of volatile organic compounds to aerosols: A review,2018,Guiying Rao and Eric P Vejerano,212,,,282-296,Pergamon,Although volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exist mainly in the gas-phase rather than in aerosols. the concentrations of VOCs measured from aerosols are comparable to those of semi-volatile organic compounds. which preferentially partition into aerosols. VOCs that partition into aerosols may raise health effects that are generally not exerted by aerosols or by VOCs alone. So far. only scant reports on VOC/aerosol partitioning are available in the extant literature. In this review. we discuss findings presented in recent studies on the partition mechanism. factors affecting the partition process. existing knowledge gaps. and recommendations to help address these gaps for future research.

N95 respirators. Healthcare workers who reused N95 respirators may resort to unproven methods of cleaning/sterilization that can severely compromise the respirators’ filtration efficiency. A recently issued guideline will test decontaminated N95 respirators against particles with a median diameter of 0.075 ± 0.020 µm at a flow rate of 85 L min–1. For emergency reuse. these conditions may be too stringent. N95 respirators tested at this flow rate had predicted efficiencies of < 69%. assuming complete degradation of their electrostatic coating. Experimental efficiencies were ~15% lower. For emergency reuse. we recommend to either adjust the flow rate closer to normal breathing. or the size of the test particle should reflect that of virus-laden respiratory aerosols (~> 0.5 µm).

One challenge in measuring the accurate partition coefficient of VOCs is quantifying their low mass fraction that sorbed on nanoparticles and differentiating them from the high VOC concentrations present in the gas-phase. Systematically characterizing the partitioning coefficient at a specific environmental condition is also difficult when sampling in the field. During field sampling. thermal and non-thermal issues such as sampling artifacts and non-equilibrium conditions because of a dynamic environment often result in considerable variability in the measured partition coefficients.

This results in persistent repression of translation. resulting in the loss of critical proteins that leads to synaptic failure and neuronal death. We have previously reported that localized genetic manipulation of this pathway rescues shutdown of translation and prevents neurodegeneration in a mouse model of prion disease. suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway might be of therapeutic benefit.

Accordingly. since 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) competes effectively with glucose. it has come under increasing scrutiny as a therapeutic agent. The initial response of tumor cells to 2-DG is growth inhibition. which is thought to conserve energy and consequently protect cells from its ATP-lowering effects as a glycolytic inhibitor. However. since 2-DG also mimics mannose and thereby interferes with N-linked glycosylation. the question is raised of how this sugar analog inhibits tumor cell growth and whether the mechanism by which it protects cells can be manipulated to convert 2-DG-induced growth inhibition to cell death.Cell growth and death were measured via counting viable and dead cells based on trypan blue exclusion.

Inc.,One of the major hurdles in the post-genomic era is to understand the function of genes and the interplay of many different cellular proteins. This is especially important for drug development. Capture compound mass spectrometry (CCMS) addresses this challenge by selectively reducing the complexity of the proteome. Capture compounds are trifunctional molecules: a selectivity function reversibly interacts via affinity with proteins; a reactivity function irreversibly forms a covalent bond outside the affinity binding site; and a sorting/pullout function allows the captured protein(s) to be isolated from cellular lysate for mass spectrometric analysis and characterization by database queries.

Most patients present at an advanced stage (FIGO stage III or IV). when local metastatic spread has already occurred. However. ovarian cancer has a unique pattern of metastatic spread. in that tumor implants are initially contained within the peritoneal cavity. This feature could enable. in principle. the complete resection of tumor implants with curative intent. Many of these metastatic lesions are microscopic. making them hard to identify and treat. Neutralizing such micrometastases is believed to be a major goal towards eliminating tumor recurrence and achieving long-term survival.

In the present approach a starting molecule of interest may be amplified through a reaction it induces with specifically engineered and functionalized particles. namely protected particles A and storage particles B. This reaction may result in a set of output DNA molecules that is larger in number than the input DNA molecules. Thus the reaction between nanoparticles for amplification of a certain DNA sequence (input DNA molecules) may occur when there is a match with a targeted molecule (stored molecules on storage particles B) and if the DNA sequence of the input DNA molecules does not match (partially or completely) the targeted molecule the reaction may not occur.

Such structural control provides access to the novel material functions. While many functional nanoscale blocks are inorganic. soft matter components. ie surfactants. macromolecules. polymers. and biopolymers. can play an important role in defining structures formed from those blocks via self-assembly. In recent years DNA-based self-assembly approaches emerged as powerful means for nanoscale fabrications: DNA can direct inter-particle binding. can be used as a scaffold for particle positioning and can regulate a structural self-assembly. We review here the major areas of DNA-based nanoscale selfassembly. including systems formed purely from the DNA strands and structures formed by particles with the help of DNA.

By incorporating silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) in the polymeric matrices. it is possible to obtain hybrid polymer films with increased tensile strength and impact resistance. without decreasing the flexural properties of the polymer matrix. The SiNPs can further be used as carriers to impart other functionalities (optical. etc.) to the hybrid films. By using polymer-coated SiNPs. it is possible to reduce particle aggregation in the films and. thus. achieve more homogeneous distributions of the inorganic components and. therefore. better properties.

We describe the application of this tool to a few examples of polymer systems containing nanodomains and heterogeneous distributions of the components. from block copolymer films and micelles to polymer nanoparticles.,True,0gMS6MAAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,51,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp8016437,13020339768487326812,/scholar?cites=13020339768487326812,,http://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/farinha/papers/45-J%20Phys%20Chem%20C%202008%20112%2010591-10601_FRET%20nanodomains_cover.pdf,0,0,0

This appears to be a very attractive method for the synthesis of fluorescent polymers for different applications. However. fluorescent polymers obtained by RAFT are known to suffer strong fluorescence quenching.

Above 30 °C. the kinetics of pyrene excimer formation is well described by a two-state model. Below this temperature. a new excited species appears. which we identified as being a pyrene dimer. The appearance of the pyrene dimer was associated with a broad coil−globule transition. For lower temperatures. the kinetics of pyrene excimer and dimer formation can only be described by a three-states model. The fluorescence decay curves of the polymer in toluene were analyzed according to these models in order to obtain the rate constants.

Both the discrete blob model (DB) and the distribution density (DD) model describe well the tethered layer of the soluble block. The structure and thickness of the adlayer formed by adsorption of the PS−PEO diblock copolymer micelles onto PS lattices is strongly dependent on the radius of the latex particle and the length of the PEO block. The star model is adequate for a latex of 32 nm radius and long PEO blocks (N = 445 and 480). but deviates for smaller PEO chains (N = 148). where the adlayer thickness is well predicted by the planar brush model.

These experiments employed the nonfluorescent acceptor chromophore NBen. which allowed faster data acquisition at lower acceptor dye concentration (0.3. 0.5 mol %) than previous experiments with anthracene (1 mol %) as the acceptor. The data were analyzed in two distinct ways. Our traditional simplified approach involved calculating fm values for the quantum efficiencies of FRET (ΦET).

This occurs when the experimental data is fitted to a set of functional parameters that depend in the model parameters to be estimated in the end. A realistic example can be found in the two state model of monomer‐excimer kinetics. The decay curves of the monomer and excimer are a sum and a difference of two exponentials. respectively. It is usual to fit the experimental decays in order to obtain the pre‐exponential factors and decay constants. thus using a reparametrization that is non‐linear with respect to the model parameters.

During the long history of carp domestication. numerous carp strains with diverse skin colors have been established. Skin color is used as a visual criterion to determine the market value of carp. However. the genetic basis of common carp skin color has not been extensively studied.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. we performed Illumina sequencing on two common carp strains: the reddish Xingguo red carp and the brownish-black Yellow River carp. A total of 435.348.868 reads were generated. resulting in 198.781 assembled contigs that were used as reference sequences. Comparisons of skin transcriptome files revealed 2.012 unigenes with significantly different expression in the two common carp strains. including 874 genes that were up-regulated in Xingguo red carp and 1.138 genes that were up-regulated in Yellow River carp. The expression patterns of 20 randomly selected differentially expressed genes were validated using quantitative RT-PCR. Gene pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicated that melanin biosynthesis. along with the Wnt and MAPK signaling pathways. is highly likely to affect the skin pigmentation process. Several key genes involved in the skin pigmentation process. including TYRP1. SILV. ASIP and xCT. showed significant differences in their expression patterns between the two strains.

The other 50% pass with the fluid phase to the omasum and are absorbed before the duodenum. The objective of this experiment was to measure the absorption surface of the reticulorumen and omasum aiming to compare it with the absorption magnitude. Eight adult bovines had their stomachs removed immediately after slaughtering. The stomach compartments were separated and weighed. Fragments were collected from several anatomical regions. Measurements of the total area of the internal surface were taken through image capture and analysis. The reticulorumen absorptive surface (7.7 m²) was larger (P< 0.001) than the omasum absorptive surface (2.1 m²). The surface/digest ratio. however. was larger (P= 0.07) in the omasum (0.22 m²/kg) than in the reticulorumen (0.12 m²/kg). representing an omasum surface area for each digest unit 83.3% larger. The area of one of the rumen ventral sac fragments showed a positive correlation (0.84) with the total rumen surface area. indicating that it is possible to estimate the total rumen area by biopsy. The absorptive surface of the forestomach compartments seem to be compatible with absorption magnitude.

Fifty six fishes in total from wild and farm raised population. of two different weight categories (0.5 to 0.1 kg & 1.0 to 1.5 kg). were captured from Head Trimmu and Sher Dil Aquaculture facility District Jhang. Pakistan. Fish samples were chemically analyzed for protein. lipid. moisture and amino acid profile. When chemical composition of two fish species collected from different sources was compared. the differences were substantial. Elevated levels of protein and lipid were observed in farmed fish. while lower in wild fish. Values were. however. other way round for moisture contents. Quantitative estimation of amino acid profile was proportional to the protein contents at species level. higher in farm raised grass carp and lower in wild fish; contrarily. lipids were lower in farmed grass carp while higher in silver carp. In conclusion. grass carp showed significantly higher protein and lipid contents and lower moisture level than silver carp farmed fish is nutritionally better than wild irrespective of the species studied.

1137761,Environmental pollution of heavy metals as a cause of oxidative stress in fish: a review,2013,Shahid Mahboob,10,Life Sci. J,,336-347,,This review summarizes the current information on the contribution of heavy metals as a result of pollution to the development of oxidative stress in fish. Metals are considered as important toxic pollutants and there is an extensive literature about their accumulation in aquatic ecosystems. Globally. there is now abundant evidence that anthropogenic activities have contaminated the environment with heavy metals from multiple sources. Heavy metals are important inducers of oxidative stress in aquatic animals. promoting formation of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an unenviable part of aerobic life. The potential of oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to damage tissues and cellular components. called oxidative stress. in biological systems has become a topic of concern for environmental pollution studies. Their steady-state concentration is a balance between production and elimination providing certain steady-state ROS level. The balance between prooxidant endogenous and exogenous factors (ie. environmental pollutants) and antioxidant defenses (enzymatic and nonenzymatic) in biological systems can be used to assess the toxic effects under stressful environmental conditions. especially oxidative damage caused by various groups of chemical pollutants. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative damage including lipid peroxidation. protein and DNA oxidation. and enzyme inactivation. The components of the antioxidant defence are used as a biochemical markers of oxidative stress. This knowledge extends to specific applications in fish because of their sensitivity to …,True,3L5c65IAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,30,http://www.lifesciencesite.com/lsj/life1010s/056_20923life1010s_336_347.pdf,4080163106364174424,/scholar?cites=4080163106364174424,,http://www.lifesciencesite.com/lsj/life1010s/056_20923life1010s_336_347.pdf,0,0,0

A reactivity scale is presented in which a range of substrates is quantitatively ranked in order of the rate at which they undergo oxidative addition.

The catalysts were prepared by precipitation from an ethanol/metal acetate solution and the addition of small quantities of water was found to result in a mixed acetate precursor with surface areas >200 m2 g−1. considerably higher than those prepared by conventional precipitation methods. The surface area of the final calcined mixed oxide was found to be dependent upon the initial water concentration.

It is shown that a 72 h grind time and heat treatment under oxygen is necessary to form active CuMn2O4 for the conversion of CO to CO2 at room temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis mapping indicated that the degree of mixing was improved at longer grinding times. Contraction of the MnCO3 lattice. followed by X-ray diffraction. showed that grinding times in excess of 24 h were necessary for the near complete dissolution of Cu ions into the MnCO3 framework. which in turn facilitated the formation of CuMn2O4 upon calcination.

These cycloheptatrienyl analogues of the porphyrins show strong diatropic ring currents by proton NMR spectroscopy where the internal CH gives a resonance at −7.3 ppm. although the meso-protons are not shifted as far downfield as most aromatic porphyrinoid systems. These data indicate that the seven-membered ring distorts the porphyrinoid macrocycle and decreases the overall diatropicity in tropiporphyrins. Addition of trace amounts of TFA to solutions of 9 affords the corresponding aromatic monocations. and at higher acid concentrations a nonaromatic dication is generated.

Porphycene retains highly aromatic characteristics and while the macrocyclic core is elongated compared to the symmetrical cavity in true porphyrins. the system retains the ability to form numerous coordination complexes.[2] Constitutional isomers with other arrangements of the linking carbon atoms were subsequently reported.[3–6] specifically hemiporphycene.[4] corrphycene.[5] and isoporphycene.[6] In all of these analogues. the pyrrolic nitrogens are orientated into the central macrocyclic cavity.

However. current SABRE faces a number of stumbling blocks for translation to biochemical and clinical settings. Difficulties include inefficient polarization in water. relatively short-lived 1H-polarization. and relatively limited substrate scope. Here we use a water-soluble polarization transfer catalyst to hyperpolarize nitrogen-15 in a variety of molecules with SABRE-SHEATH (SABRE in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei).

In contrast to common high-field experiments. the observed coherence is a singlet-triplet coherence with a lifetime T 2 longer than the T 1 lifetime of dipole polarization in the triplet manifold. Moreover. we demonstrate that heteronuclear singlet states formed between a H 1 and a C 13 nucleus can exhibit longer lifetimes than the respective triplet states even in the presence of additional spins that couple to the spin pair of interest.

Ltd,This article presents the basic principles and methodology used in modern implementations of zero‐ to ultralow‐field NMR (ZULF NMR). with emphasis on the case where spin evolution is detected directly in the ZULF environment. In contrast to conventional high‐field NMR. ZULF NMR allows for measurement of spin–spin interactions ‘in their natural environment’ free of truncation by dominant coupling to applied magnetic fields. However. the absence of a large applied magnetic field means that spin precession frequencies and equilibrium spin polarization—related to the sensitivity of inductive detection and to the magnitude of the measurable magnetization. respectively—are dramatically lower than in the high‐field case. ZULF NMR thus requires the use of alternative detectors such as atomic magnetometers. along with the production of nonequilibrium spin polarization as prepared by. for example …,True,L6YvagcAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,44,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470034590.emrstm1369,6757858020555597520,/scholar?cites=6757858020555597520,,,0,0,0

Possible separation of the two competing oxidation reactions involved in the process (of CO and H2. respectively) is the key to modulation of overall CO-PROX activity and is based on involvement of different sites as most active ones for each of the two reactions. Achievement of large size CuO particles and adequate CeO2−CuO interfacial configurations in the inverse catalyst apparently allows appreciable enhancement of the catalytic properties of this kind of system for CO-PROX. constituting an interesting alternative to classic direct configurations so far explored for this process.

Acidophiles confront high metal loads via both abiotic and biotic mechanisms,2014,Mark Dopson and Francisco J Ossandon and Lars Lövgren and David S Holmes,5,Frontiers in microbiology,,157,Frontiers,All metals are toxic at high concentrations and consequently their intracellular concentrations must be regulated. Acidophilic microorganisms have an optimum growth pH < 3 and proliferate in natural and anthropogenic low pH environments. Some acidophiles are involved in the catalysis of sulfide mineral dissolution. resulting in high concentrations of metals in solution. Acidophiles are often described as highly metal resistant via mechanisms such as multiple and/or more efficient active resistance systems than are present in neutrophiles. However. this is not the case for all acidophiles and we contend that their growth in high metal concentrations is partially due to an intrinsic tolerance as a consequence of the environment in which they live. In this perspective. we highlight metal tolerance via complexation of free metals by sulfate ions and passive tolerance to metal influx via an internal positive cytoplasmic transmembrane potential. These tolerance mechanisms have been largely ignored in past studies of acidophile growth in the presence of metals and should be taken into account.,True,CSJ7xCcAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,61,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00157/full,14348923861770882962,/scholar?cites=14348923861770882962,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00157/full,0,0,0

In the present work the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from a concentrated bog-water on the adsorption of Cu (II) onto schwertmannite (Fe 8 O 8 (OH) 6 SO 4) and goethite (α-FeOOH) has been studied. The acid/base behaviour of DOM up to pH 6 was explained by assuming a diprotic acid with a density of carboxylate groups of 6.90 μeq (mg C)− 1. The resulting acidity constants. recalculated to zero ionic strength were p K a 1 0= 3.6 1 and p K a 2 0= 5.3 4. The uptake of DOM to schwertmannite and goethite was highest at low pH although adsorption was significant also under mildly alkaline conditions.

Metal ion adsorption on the cell walls was minimized by using a Teflon cell. Measurements in the absence of goethite showed the applicability of the voltammetric techniques for trace analysis in a wide pH range. The analysis seems to be limited mainly by the onset of metal ion hydrolysis at high pH values. where neutral and negatively charged species are formed. The results obtained in the presence of goethite were compared with previously determined surface complexation models. evaluated from relatively high metal ion (≈10−3M) and solid concentrations (≈10 g/L).

Many attempts have been made to develop metal‐free catalysts. but the lack of understanding of active‐sites at the atomic‐level has slowed the design of highly active and stable metal‐free catalysts.

The Mn composing the framework is mixed-valent; the charge balance owing to the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ and possibly Mn2+ is compensated by interstitial K+ ions (purple).[7. 8] Doping of an active metal into K-OMS-2 materials has been widely used as an effective strategy to improve their electronic and catalytic performance.Most studies have focused on the doping of low-valent metal cations into the tunnels of K-OMS-2. but very few on the incorporation of high-valent transition metal cations (eg. M5+. M6+) into the framework structure.[9. 10] We first reported the preparation of different V doped K-OMS-2 materials using a conventional hydrothermal method for chemical sensing application.[11] We later prepared these materials through a microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis and investigated the effects of V doping on the Li–ion intercalation properties of K-OMS-2.[12] The activities …,True,dMHo0a4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,40,https://www.academia.edu/download/44124663/ftp20160326-14838-dxn07r.pdf,9138705599673344520,/scholar?cites=9138705599673344520,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44124663/ftp20160326-14838-dxn07r.pdf,0,0,0

Photometric and spectral measurements on individual SWCNTs revealed that emission in the common biocompatible coating agents Pluronic F127. ss-DNA. and BSA is approximately an order of magnitude weaker than in the bioincompatible ionic surfactant SDBS. By contrast. one of the engineered peptides gave SWCNT emission ∼40% as intense as in SDBS.

Typically in these hybrids the linkage between the protein and the polymer is covalent. Here we describe a straightforward approach to a noncovalent PPH that is mediated by DNA. Although noncovalent. the DNA-mediated approach affords the highly specific pairing and assembly properties of DNA. To obtain the protein–DNA conjugate for assembly of the PPH. we report here the first direct copper catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition-based protein–DNA conjugation. This significantly simplifies access to protein–DNA conjugates. The protein–DNA conjugate and partner polymer–DNA conjugate are readily assembled through annealing of the cDNA strands to obtain the PPH. the assembly of which was confirmed via dynamic light scattering and fluorescence spectroscopy.,True,ijrX6AQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,34,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la204077v,12492655972596287568,/scholar?cites=12492655972596287568,,,0,0,0

Crystal structure and vibrational spectra of both LDHs have been studied in comparison. Their interlayer distances are rather larger than those corresponding to the most compact arrangement of the intercalated anions. Nevertheless. no sign of a turbostratic disorder has been detected in these LDH.

In this work. the nitrate–pyrovanadate anion exchange/re-exchange processes in these LDHs were investigated in situ. We demonstrate that the exchange reactions lead to a decrease of the average crystallite size of LDHs as a result of mechanical fragmentation of the crystallites rather than dissolution/recrystallization.

1138289,Structure Enumeration and Sampling,2010,Markus Meringer,,,,233-267,Chapman and Hall/CRC,In this chapter. we describe algorithms for solving these problems. The techniques are based on the representation of chemical compounds as molecular graphs (see Chapter 2). that is. they are mainly applied to constitutional isomers. The major problem is that in silico molecular graphs have to be represented as labeled structures. while in chemical compounds. the atoms are not labeled. The mathematical concept for approaching this problem is to consider orbits of labeled molecular graphs under the operation of the symmetric group. We have to solve the so-called isomorphism problem.According to our introductory questions. we distinguish several disciplines: counting. enumerating. and sampling isomers. While counting only delivers the number of isomers. the remaining disciplines refer to constructive methods. Enumeration typically encompasses exhaustive and non-redundant methods. while sampling typically lacks these characteristics. However. sampling methods are sometimes better suited to solve real-world problems.,True,6-vtlb8AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,94,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=O_9GU60TcGgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA233&dq=info:0x_AjJaL2r8J:scholar.google.com&ots=sEs5WA5pVq&sig=okU29oxHh4wWJNQ7gYyeP_IOf-I,13968870377772024825,/scholar?cites=13968870377772024825,,https://www.molgen.de/download/pubs/StructEnumHandbookChemInfAlgo.pdf,0,0,0

Chem,2,259-290,,In theory. the molecular formula of an unknown compound can be calculated from its exact molecular mass. However. even with highly accurate modern mass spectrometers with an accuracy of 1 ppm or lower. it is generally not possible to determine the molecular formula uniquely from measurements. Intensities of isotopic peaks are typically used as additional information to narrow down possible formulas associated with a mass spectrum (MS) peak. but this is not sufficient for larger compounds. Here. we introduce a method that takes information from fragment peak masses of the MS/MS into account to improve the reliability of formula determination. Matchvalues that reflect the consistency with MS isotope peaks and MS/MS fragment patterns are computed for candidate molecular formulas. We demonstrate that these matchvalues outperform methods based on isotope peak intensities alone.

Candidate ranking with respect to electron impact mass spectra is based on virtual fragmentation of a candidate structure and comparison of the fragments’ isotope distributions against the spectrum of the unknown compound. whence a structure–spectrum compatibility matchvalue is computed. Of special interest is the matchvalue’s ability to distinguish between the correct and false constitutional isomers. Therefore a quality score was computed in the following way: For a (randomly selected) spectrum–structure pair from the NIST MS library all constitutional isomers are generated using the structure generator MOLGEN. For each isomer the matchvalue with respect to the library spectrum is calculated. and isomers are ranked according to their matchvalues. The quality of the ranking can be quantified in terms of the correct structure’s relative ranking position (RRP). This procedure was repeated for 100 randomly selected spectrum–structure pairs belonging to small organic compounds. In this first approach the RRP of the correct isomer was 0.27 on average.,True,6-vtlb8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,37,https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=8805,11054228981167737402,/scholar?cites=11054228981167737402,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/8805,0,0,0

The ubiquity of these bonds makes such transformations attractive. while also posing several challenges. The first. and perhaps most important. is the selective functionalization of one C–H bond over another. Another key problem is inducing reactivity at sites that have been historically unreactive and difficult to access without prior inefficient prefunctionalization.Although remarkable advances have been made over the past decade toward solving these and other problems. several difficult tasks remain as researchers attempt to bring C–H functionalization reactions into common use.

The method combines an established fast-injection-based step to create the initial elongated shell with a second slow-injection growth that allows for a systematic variation of the shell thickness while maintaining a high degree of monodispersity at the batch level and enhancing the uniformity at the single-nanorod level. The second growth step resulted in nanorods exhibiting a fluorescence quantum yield up to 100% as well as effectively complete energy transfer from the shell to the core.

Here. we explore 2D spectra of bacteriochlorophyll a (BChla) in solution in an attempt to isolate vibrational beating signals in the absence of excitonic signals to identify the origin of the quantum beats in 2D spectra of FMO.

The two devices are based on a Bragg grating in planar waveguide with a liquid crystal overlayer. which enables changing the spectral behavior of the device. The fast and bistable switching of smectic C* in the surface-stabilized liquid crystal structure is used to investigate the possibility of realizing an integrated electro-optical switch. The principal advantage of this device is its spectral signature. which enables us to overcome the problems of intensity dependent devices.

These studies were directed primarily toward the development of synthetic methods for the construction and modification of the cyclic skeleton and were due. of course. to the demand for potent pharmaceutical agents.

Many methods have been developed for stereoselective generation of two chiral centres that ultimately correspond to the carbon atoms C~ 3 and C~ 4 in the cholestane skeleton. Most of these methods involve intermediates in which the chiral centre at C t3 has been already established. Construction of the chiral centre at Ct4 is then based upon reactions of the double bond located at carbon CI4 (C8-CI4 or C~ 4-CI5). Interesting parallels can be found in the reactivity of hydrindane building blocks and more complex polycyclic systems including condensed six-and five membered rings. Transformations of the AB rings ofcholestane. 4 which probably is the most studied natural decalin derivative. are also of relevance.

For SRRs on doped GaAs films. incident terahertz radiation with peak fields of∼ 20–160 kV/cm drives intervalley scattering. This reduces the carrier mobility and enhances the SRR L C response due to a conductivity decrease in the doped thin film. Above∼ 160 kV/cm. electric field enhancement within the SRR gaps leads to efficient impact ionization. increasing the carrier density and the conductivity which. in turn. suppresses the SRR resonance.

The f (r) indices was first proposed by Parr and Yang. 4 and is rigorously defined as the first derivative of the local electron density (r) with respect to the total number of electrons N of the system.

Hardness of a system is related to the second derivative of energy with respect to the number of particles N for constant v (potential due to nuclei plus external potential) and temperature. 1 The slope of such a curve in this condition is the chemical potential µ. The principle states that at constant v and µ. the system will evolve to a state with maximum. As has been pointed out. 2 this principle justifies a great deal of intuition. too. A rigorous proof of this has also been given by Parr and Chattaraj. 3 This principle has been tested by Pearson and Palke (PP) 4 as well as Datta5 recently. While Datta used MNDO calculations.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In the present article. we report a comparative study between the Hirshfeld and Mulliken population analysis schemes (abbreviated as HPA and MPA. respectively). Trends of atomic charges derived from these two population analysis schemes are compared with those expected from other commonly used chemical concepts like electronegativity. inductive effects. and resonance effects. Although previous studies on intramolecular reactivity sequences demonstrated that HPA generates reliable and non‐negative (and thus physically more realistic) condensed Fukui function (FF) values. the present study reveals problems with the HPA charge partitioning technique.

1138538,Crown-substituted phthalocyanines: from synthesis towards materials,2012,Yulia G Gorbunova and Alexander G Martynov and Aslan Yu Tsivadze,,,,271-388,,Numerous studies of synthetic arrays built of photo-and redox-active tetrapyrrolic macrocycles have been largely inspired by in vivo light-harvesting multiporphyrinic systems revealing astonishingly high orderliness and providing them with high efficiency and selectivity. 1–5 To assemble tetrapyrrole compounds in vitro. two general approaches can be utilized. One is the synthesis of arrays throughout the formation of covalent bonds between tetrapyrrole units. 6–9 Another is a supramolecular approach. when the required arrangement of tetrapyrrole units is a result of self-organization processes driven by molecular recognition and partially eliminating tedious synthetic procedures typically required for the preparation of covalent arrays. 10–16 Tetrapyrrolic macrocycles can form supramolecular assemblies in solution themselves via dynamic noncovalent interactions. resulting in the strong tendency of these compounds toward aggregation. particularly due to the stacking interaction between their huge aromatic systems. 17 These interactions also play a significant role in the ordering of molecules in solid state and predetermining therefore such properties of materials as electronic conductivity. From this viewpoint. the control over the aggregation of tetrapyrroles by means of supramolecular chemistry is a remarkable development. since it affords insight into the effects which arise from supramolecular assembling and therefore gives novel approaches towards material with outstanding physical-chemical characteristics. To achieve this control. additional binding sites should be introduced at the periphery of the tetrapyrrolic macrocycle.
