1205484,Transesterification of soybean oil catalyzed by sulfated zirconia,2008,Camila Martins Garcia and Sergio Teixeira and Letícia Ledo Marciniuk and Ulf Schuchardt,99,Bioresource technology,14,6608-6613,Elsevier,Two sulfated zirconias were synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. They were used as catalysts in the alcoholysis of soybean oil and in the esterification of oleic acid. Using sulfated zirconia prepared by the solvent-free method (S–ZrO2) as catalyst. the alcoholysis conversions of soybean oil under optimized conditions (120 °C. 1 h and 5 wt% of catalyst) were 98.6% (methanolysis) and 92% (ethanolysis). respectively. The esterification of oleic acid with methanol was complete after 2 h. Zirconia sulfated by standard methods (SZ) had low activity in the methanolysis of soybean oil (conversion of 8.5%) and conventional zirconia (NS) was inactive for methanolysis under the conditions optimized for S–ZrO2.,True,kqZCUrcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,321,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852407010565,13414641954474756927,/scholar?cites=13414641954474756927,,,0,0,0

The best methodology was to carry out the reaction in ethyl acetate under azeotropic water removal at 90 °C. and a molar ratio cyclohexanone:oxidant of 1:4. Under these conditions. the conversion was 53% with a selectivity of 98% for ɛ-caprolactone. The weak and strong acid sites of alumina were correlated with the substrate conversion and hydrogen peroxide consumption for the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation. It is shown that the weak acid sites. which activate hydrogen peroxide for the catalytic epoxidation of nucleophilic olefins. are also responsible for the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation. Stronger acid sites. however. also participate in the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation. by activation of the carbonyl group.

Here. we report that Fra-1 is highly expressed in the muscle-invasive form of the carcinoma of the bladder (80%) and to a lesser extent in superficial bladder cancer (42%). We demonstrate that in this type of cancer Fra-1 is regulated via a C-terminal instability signal and C-terminal phosphorylation. We show that manipulation of Fra-1 expression levels in bladder cancer cell lines affects cell morphology. motility and proliferation. The gene coding for AXL tyrosine kinase is directly upregulated by Fra-1 in bladder cancer and in other cell lines. Importantly. our data demonstrate that AXL mediates the effect of Fra-1 on tumour cell motility but not on cell proliferation.

The proposed method is based on application of 2-chloro-N-(2-hydroxyethyl) propanamide (NCPAE) as a bifunctional initiator. which enables ATRP of two monomers. differing in activity and polarity. into two stages. The synthesized copolymer molecules contain two well-defined polymer chains connected by a linker. which is a derivative of the proposed initiator. Using NCPAE led to PNIPAMs with well-planned molecular weight. low polydispersities (PDI= 1.1÷ 1.3) and hydroxyl functionality. Activation of such blocks for initiation of styrene polymerization was performed using α-bromoisobutyryl bromide. After such a modification. the synthesized homopolymers acted as macroinitiators in ARGET ATRP and a well-defined polystyrene block. as the next one in the polymer chain was successfully formed. Both of the synthesized macromolecules. PNIPAM and PNIPAM-b-PS. exhibit a thermoresponsive behavior with explicit lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) in their aqueous solutions.

The procedure developed by our group of the nanocomposites’ preparation consists of three steps: synthesis of narrow-dispersive AgNPs (5.96±1.02 nm); grafting of narrowly dispersed polystyrene onto the surface of AgNPs; thermoforming with a mixture of PS/PVA. Kirby-Bauer (KB) and Dynamic Shake Flask (DSF) assays revealed high antibacterial activity against a series of Gram (−) and Gram (+) bacteria strains of the fabricated nanocomposites at low silver content (0.5%). We showed that the doping of Ag/PS composites with PVA increases the antibacterial activity of composites.

MLC has previously been found to be useful in the prediction of partition coefficient values (log P) for pharmaceutical compounds. yet has not been incorporated in skin permeability models prior to this work. This article provides statistically supported data that this technique enhances the ability to predict the permeability of similar drugs through the skin (Kp). The replacement of a traditional physicochemical parameter. namely the octanol–water partition coefficient (log Pow) with a chromatographically determined value (log Pmw). results in a quantitative partition–permeability relationship that is robust to variation. MLC offers many benefits compared with the traditional techniques employed to obtain log P values.,True,szL0H9MAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,23,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098713003035,2788319229794236035,/scholar?cites=2788319229794236035,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49351860/Modelling_Skin_Permeability_with_Micella20161004-22092-1kfjiy6.pdf,0,0,0
1205604,Recent developments in skin mimic systems to predict transdermal permeation,2015,Laura J Waters,21,,20,2725-2732,Bentham Science Publishers,In recent years there has been a drive to create experimental techniques that can facilitate the accurate and precise prediction of transdermal permeation without the use of in vivo studies. This review considers why permeation data is essential. provides a brief summary as to how skin acts as a natural barrier to permeation and discusses why in vivo studies are undesirable. This is followed by an in-depth discussion on the extensive range of alternative methods that have been developed in recent years. All of the major ‘skin mimic systems’ are considered including: in vitro models using synthetic membranes. mathematical models including quantitative structurepermeability relationships (QSPRs). human skin equivalents and chromatographic based methods. All of these model based systems are ideally trying to achieve the same end-point. namely a reliable in vitro-in vivo correlation. i.e. matching non-in vivo …,True,szL0H9MAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,21,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cpd/2015/00000021/00000020/art00005,6078147992861417078,/scholar?cites=6078147992861417078,,http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/24765/1/Skin_mimics_review_22ndDec2014.pdf,0,0,0
1205605,In vitro controlled drug release from loaded microspheres-dose regulation through formulation,2007,Laura Jane Waters and Evangelos Pavlakis,10,Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences,4,464-472,,PURPOSE: Drug release profiles were established for ibuprofen encapsulated within several types of microspheres and a range of dissolution buffer media to study the effect these variables have in controlling the rate and extent of drug release. METHODS: Fatty acid microspheres containing ibuprofen were prepared by a process previously developed and refined to produce microspheres of a known size and composition. namely 80-125? m diameter and an excipient to ibuprofen ratio of 3: 1. Drug release profiles from these encapsulated formulations were compared with those obtained for the dissolution of ibuprofen alone under the same conditions. RESULTS: Stearic acid microspheres were found to only partially retard the release of ibuprofen over a twenty minute period compared with the dissolution of ibuprofen alone. However. a significant retardation of ibuprofen release was observed with cetostearyl alcohol microspheres over the same period of time. Secondly. drug release profiles for encapsulated ibuprofen were determined using five distinct dissolution buffer media; sodium phosphate. potassium phosphate. citric acid and phosphate mix. MOPS and tris. Significant differences in the extent and rate of drug release were recorded between the different dissolution buffer solutions. These differences were also shown to be independent of variations in pH. temperature. buffer concentrations and the type of cations present. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and choice of microsphere formulation. and the choice of buffer present in the dissolution solution. can influence drug release in vitro. ie it is possible to achieve controlled …,True,szL0H9MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,18,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/jpps/index.php/jpps/article/view/569,16439923872667146467,/scholar?cites=16439923872667146467,,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/jpps/index.php/JPPS/article/download/569/569,0,0,0

However. it remains difficult to set up these calculations without expert knowledge. To facilitate the use of such methods. software tools need to be available to support these methods and help to set up reasonable input files which will lower the barrier of entry for usage by non-experts. Previous tools relies on specific annotations in structure files for automatic and successful fragmentation such as residues in PDB files. We present a general fragmentation methodology and accompanying tools called FragIt to help setup these calculations. FragIt uses the SMARTS language to locate chemically appropriate fragments in large structures and is applicable to fragmentation of any molecular system given suitable SMARTS patterns. We present SMARTS patterns of fragmentation for proteins. DNA and polysaccharides. specifically for D-galactopyranose for use in cyclodextrins.

PM6-D3H+. and its implementation in the GAMESS program. The method combines the DFT-D3 dispersion correction by Grimme et al. with a modified version of the H+ hydrogen bond correction by Korth. Overall. the interaction energy of PM6-D3H+ is very similar to PM6-DH2 and PM6-DH+. with RMSD and MAD values within 0.02 kcal/mol of one another. The main difference is that the geometry optimizations of 88 complexes result in 82. 6. 0. and 0 geometries with 0. 1. 2. and 3 or more imaginary frequencies using PM6-D3H+ implemented in GAMESS. while the corresponding numbers for PM6-DH+ implemented in MOPAC are 54. 17. 15. and 2.

1205642,A computational method for the systematic screening of reaction barriers in enzymes: searching for Bacillus circulans xylanase mutants with greater activity towards a synthetic …,2013,Martin R Hediger and Casper Steinmann and Luca De Vico and Jan H Jensen,1,PeerJ,,e111,PeerJ Inc.,We present a semi-empirical (PM6-based) computational method for systematically estimating the effect of all possible single mutants. within a certain radius of the active site. on the barrier height of an enzymatic reaction. The intent of this method is not a quantitative prediction of the barrier heights. but rather to identify promising mutants for further computational or experimental study. The method is applied to identify promising single and double mutants of Bacillus circulans xylanase (BCX) with increased hydrolytic activity for the artificial substrate ortho-nitrophenyl β-xylobioside (ONPX 2). The estimated reaction barrier for wild-type (WT) BCX is 18.5 kcal/mol. which is in good agreement with the experimental activation free energy value of 17.0 kcal/mol extracted from the observed k cat using transition state theory (Joshi et al.. 2001). The PM6 reaction profiles for eight single point mutations are recomputed using FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G (d) single points. PM6 predicts an increase in barrier height for all eight mutants while FMO predicts an increase for six of the eight mutants. Both methods predict that the largest change in barrier occurs for N35F. where PM6 and FMO predict a 9.0 and 15.8 kcal/mol increase. respectively.

Three basis sets (6-31G(d). cc-pVDZ. and pcseg-1) are studied to provide guidance toward obtaining high accuracy with the FMO method on such systems. Using a fragmentation scheme of one residue per fragment. the FMO method using the 6-31G(d) basis set and second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) with the hybrid orbital projection fragmentation scheme provides the most reliable results across the entire reaction pathway. Calculations using the multilayer FMO method are performed and shown to be in agreement with single-layer calculations in all cases with differences of less than one kilocalorie per mole for all tested basis set combinations along the entire reaction path.

The approach is applied to the conversion of chorismate to prephenate by Chorismate Mutase. where the substrate is treated at the MP2 level of theory while the rest of the system is treated at the RHF level. MP2 geometry optimization is found to lower the barrier by up to 3.5 kcal/mol compared to RHF optimzations and ONIOM energy refinement and leads to a smoother convergence with respect to the basis set for the reaction profile.

By relying on accurate forms of the embedding potential. where especially the inclusion of local field effects are in focus. we show that qualitative agreement between rotatory strength parameters calculated by full quantum mechanical calculations and the more efficient embedding calculations can be obtained. An important aspect in the computation of reliable absorption parameters is the need for conformational sampling.

There is. however. a comparatively high computational overhead associated with the computation of the embedding potential. which is derived from first-principles calculations on individual fragments of the environment.

1205648,Effective fragment molecular orbital method,2017,Casper Steinmann and Jan H Jensen,,Fragmentation: Toward Accurate Calculations on Complex Molecular Systems,,165-182,Wiley,Modeling biological systems with modern computational approaches represents one of the most difficult tasks at hand because of the range. magnitude. and scope of the complex interactions involved and the sizes of the systems investigated. In a single system such as ligand binding to a protein. the full range of inter-molecular interactions can be at play: long-range effects such as electrostatics. many-body polarization. dispersion interactions or effects that are only short-range in nature such as exchange-repulsion or charge-transfer. To accurately describe all of these interactions. computational quantum mechanical methods that include electron correlation must be used such as MP2 or ideally coupled cluster [1] theory with perturbative triples. that is. CCSD (T). However. such correlated methods also come with unfathomable scaling problems rendering them useless for biologically relevant systems. An alternative and computationally feasible approach is to obtain reliable model potentials for the interactions listed above based on quantum mechanical formulations and calculations. Two such approaches exist in the form of the sum of interactions among fragments ab initio computed (SIBFA)[2] and the effective fragment potential (EFP) method [3–5]. EFP works by doing calculations of subsystems (fragments) of a large system and is able to accurately capture the complex inter-molecular interactions that are present between the fragments. While the EFP method is completely free of adjustable parameters. it does have frozen internal geometries.

Among neritic tuna. long tail. kawakawa. frigate. bullet and striped bonitos are caught in tuna gillnet fisheries. Here we investigate the capture rates of the neritic tuna in four gillnet vessels and provide a snapshot on how different gear setting impact catch composition of neritic tuna. The different gear settings have proven to be a useful measure without compromising capture rates of tropical tuna species. in addition to reduced bycatch. However. the impact of different gear setting on neritic tuna species has not been determined. This paper therefore. aims to assess capture rates and discusses the catch composition variance by area of fishing and method using the data collected by four trained skippers (on 15-20 m vessels) during January 2013–December 2017. During this period. a total of 3.430 sets were observed. using two different gear settings viz.. surface and sub-surface (2 m below surface) multifilament gillnets.

The emerging concern regarding the diffusion of antibiotic resistant microorganisms (AMR) is directly linked to the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry as they act as coselective drivers for AMR development and spread. Therefore. a new analytical method for the detection of pharmaceuticals at trace levels to be able to study their occurrence. behaviour and fate in complex environmental matrices (including milk. wastewater slurry and soil) has been developed. Several extraction techniques were tested in solid matrices for analytes under study such as ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave assisted extraction (MAE). using different buffers and additives. Clean-up and pre-concentration of the extracts were performed by means of solid-phase extraction (SPE). using different cartridges (eg SAX-HLB) and methanol as eluting solvent. Antibiotic residues were also extracted from milk samples using acetonitrile previous to SPE purification or ultrafiltration. Recoveries were generally about 75% for most compounds. decreasing for those antibiotics having the highest instability (eg B-lactams). Identification and quantification of antibiotics were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

(4-MeOC6H4O)2P(O)OC6H4Z. with pyridines (XC5H4N) are investigated in acetonitrile at 55.0 °C. In the case of more basic phenolate leaving groups (Z = 4-Cl. 3-CN). the magnitudes of βX (βnuc) and βZ (βlg) indicate that mechanism changes from a concerted process (βX = 0.22−0.36. βZ = −0.42 to −0.56) for the weakly basic pyridines (X = 3-Cl. 4-CN) to a stepwise process with rate-limiting formation of a trigonal bipyramidal pentacoordinate (TBP-5C) intermediate (βX = 0.09−0.14. βZ = −0.08 to −0.28) for the more basic pyridines (X = 4-NH2. 3-CH3). This proposal is supported by a large negative cross-interaction constant (ρXZ = −1.98) for the former and a positive ρXZ (+0.97) for the latter processes. In the case of less basic phenolate leaving groups (Z = 3-CN. 4-NO2). the unusually small magnitude of βZ values is …,True,EkzT9cYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,36,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo0162742,6467593618171276434,/scholar?cites=6467593618171276434,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,Nucleophilic substitution at a P——O center is important in chemistry since the phosphorus chemistry is interesting because of its relevance to biological chemistry and usefulness in synthesis. Two main types of displacement processes are reported regarding the phosphoryl species; either stepwise (AN þ DN) through a trigonal bipyramidal pentacoordinate (TBP-5C) intermediate or a concerted process (ANDN).[1. 2] Nonlinear free energy relationships for variation of the nucleophile (X) and/or substrate (Y) and/or leaving group (Z) were observed for the pyridinolyses of Z-aryl bis (4-methoxyphenyl) phosphates.[3] Y-aryl phenyl isothiocyanophosphates.[4] diphenyl thiophosphinic chloride.[5] O.

The second-order rate constants were determined with at least five pyridine concentrations [XC5H4N]. No third-order or higher-order terms were detected. and no complications were found in the determination of kobsd or in the linear plot,True,EkzT9cYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,28,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201115037886654.page,827684098043211840,/scholar?cites=827684098043211840,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201115037886654.pdf,0,0,0
