The presence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM; the optically active portion of total DOM) can have significant controlling effects on transmittance of sunlight through the water column and therefore on primary production as well as the heat balance of the upper ocean. However. CDOM is also susceptible to photochemical degradation. which decreases the flux of solar radiation that is absorbed. Knowledge of the current spatial and temporal distribution of CDOM in marine environments is thus critical for understanding how ongoing and future changes in climate may impact these biological. biogeochemical. and physical processes.

Some calcifying marine organisms. including pteropods. foraminifers. mollusks. and coralline algae that could be susceptible to reduced calcification rates under increasing ocean acidity are keystone species in the Pacific-Arctic region.

This complementarity condition is the key feature distinguishing the NCP from a general inequality system. lies at the heart of all constrained optimi-tion problems in? nite dimensions. provides a powerful framework for the modeling of equilibria of many kinds. and exhibits a natural link between smooth and nonsmooth mathematics. The? nite-dimensional variational inequality (VI). which is a generalization of the NCP. provides a broad unifying setting for the study of optimization and equilibrium problems and serves as the main computational framework for the practical solution of a host of continuum problems in the mathematical sciences. The systematic study of the? nite-dimensional NCP and VI began in the mid-1960s; in a span of four decades. the subject has developed into a very fruitful discipline in the? eld of mathematical programming.

The book begins with the description of many source problems arising from engineering and economics that are amenable to treatment by the MPEC methodology. Error bounds and parametric analysis are the main tools to establish a theory of exact penalisation. a set of MPEC constraint qualifications and the first-order and second-order optimality conditions. The book also describes several iterative algorithms such as a penalty-based interior point algorithm. an implicit programming algorithm and a piecewise sequential quadratic programming algorithm for MPECs. Results in the book are expected to have significant impacts in such disciplines as engineering design. economics and game equilibria. and transportation planning. within all of which MPEC has a central role to play in the modelling of many practical problems.,True,DZryMhIAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,2229,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UcjLCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:8x0a6uQ1Rd4J:scholar.google.com&ots=aMO4YESolM&sig=nQsMDTD4DQMucjZle-J5jjavl_U,16016266907109432819,/scholar?cites=16016266907109432819,,,0,0,0

1125809,Strategic gaming analysis for electric power systems: An MPEC approach,2000,Benjamin F Hobbs and Carolyn B Metzler and J-S Pang,15,IEEE transactions on power systems,2,638-645,IEEE,Transmission constraints and market concentration may prevent power markets from being fully competitive. allowing firms to exercise market power and raise prices above marginal cost. We present a strategic gaming model for analyzing such markets; it represents an oligopolistic market economy consisting of several dominant firms in an electric power network. Each generating firm submits bids to an ISO. choosing its bids to maximize profits subject to anticipated reactions by rival firms. The single-firm model is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) with a parameter-dependent spatial price equilibrium problem as the inner problem.

As a detailed survey of the power market modeling literature shows. CSF models differ from previous approaches in that they represent each GenCo's conjectures regarding how rival firms will adjust sales in response to price changes. The CSF approach is a more realistic and flexible framework for modeling imperfect competition than other models for three reasons. First. the models include as a special case the Cournot conjecture that rivals will not change production if prices change; thus. the CSF framework is more general. Second. Cournot models cannot be used when price elasticity of demand is zero. but the proposed models can. Third. unlike supply function equilibrium models. CSF equilibria can be calculated for large transmission networks.

The characterization of superlinear convergence extends the classical result of Dennis and Moré for smooth equations and that of Ip and Kyparisis for B-differentiable equations.

Two major deficiencies exist with such a formulation: One is that the resulting Nash equilibrium may not exist. due to the nonconvexity in each player’s problem; the other is that such a nonconvex Nash game is computationally intractable. In order to obtain a viable formulation that is amenable to practical solution. we introduce a class of remedial models for the multi-leader-follower game that can be formulated as generalized Nash games with convexified strategy sets.

Given a tradable credit scheme. the user equilibrium (UE) and market equilibrium (ME) conditions with heterogeneous users are formulated into a variational inequalities (VI) problem. Sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the aggregate UE link flows and then the ME credit price are established.

Most previous studies up to date focus on investigation of the effects of speed limits from a local perspective. while network-wide traffic reallocation effects are overlooked. This paper makes the first attempt to investigate how a link-specific speed limit law reallocates traffic flow in an equilibrium manner at a macroscopic network level. We find that. although the link travel time–flow relationship is altered after a speed limit is imposed. the standard traffic assignment method still applies. With the commonly adopted assumptions. the uniqueness of link travel times at user equilibrium (UE) remains valid. and the UE flows on links with non-binding speed limits are still unique.

With such a scheme. the social planner initially distributes a certain number of credits to all eligible travelers. charges a link-specific number of credits from travelers using that link. and allows for free trading of the credits among travelers. The performance of such tradable credit schemes in traffic regulation is investigated in general networks with both homogeneous users and heterogeneous users. In the homogeneous user case. we demonstrate that. given a credit charging and distribution scheme. a unique equilibrium link flow pattern with either fixed or elastic demand can be obtained by solving a standard traffic equilibrium model subject to a total credit consumption constraint. and the credit price at equilibrium of the trading market is unique under very mild conditions. As a result. through appropriate distribution of credits among travelers and selection of link-specific credit charging rates. the tradable credit scheme can obtain and sustain most desirable network flow patterns. such as the social optimum and Pareto-improving flow pattern generated by the various congestion pricing or congestion pricing cum revenue-refunding schemes proposed in the literature. in a revenue-neutral manner.

This study proposes an analytical capacity model for highway mixed traffic based on a Markov chain representation of spatial distribution of heterogeneous and stochastic headways. This model captures not only the full spectrum of CAV market penetration rates but also all possible values of CAV platooning intensities that largely affect the spatial distribution of different headway types.

The effects of building heating; ventilation; and air conditioning (HVAC) systems’ design upgrade on the building energy performance are the focus of the current study. The adopted HVAC system consisted of chilled ceiling and chilled beam systems served by a centrifugal water chiller. An energy simulation study was undertaken in accordance with the national Australian built environment rating system-rules for collecting and using data. A three-dimensional simulation study was carried out utilizing the virtual environment-integrated environmental solutions software. Results from the current study have shown the importance of utilizing energy-efficient HVAC systems and HVAC strategies for achieving a high building energy star rating. Recommended strategies in order to achieve the nominated star rating; as predicted by the simulation analysis; were presented. Moreover; the effects of solar radiation inside the building atrium were significant; which cannot be overcome by simply installing a low shading coefficient glazing type at the atrium skylight. In addition to providing chilled ceiling technology; a high efficiency chiller and low energy lighting; it is recommended that the building be well tuned during the commissioning period.

The purpose of the current study is to develop a performance based ventilation system for a shopping center carpark. The aim of the study is to undertake computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling of the carpark to determine the potential minimum ventilation exhaust rate levels. Results showed that the proposed carpark exhaust system was considered acceptable and no modifications were required. The CO concentration levels in all areas. except within the immediate vicinity of car exhaust plumes. were below 100 ppm. The average predicted CO rise was less than 25 ppm across the carpark which is in compliance with the current Worksafe Australia and WHO CO exposure limits. Moreover. results indicated that the 64.000 l/s exhaust air flowrate was sufficient. and could be reduced to 50.000 l/s. From a financial point of view. it was concluded that the removal of the outlet grilles located at the Southern wall of the Commuters section of the carpark was an acceptable alternative. This cost saving is based on the potential deletion of a fan system. plenum arrangement and shaft which are required as part of the deemed-to-satisfy system design.,True,0FBU0ZUAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rafat_Al-Waked/publication/319566365_Indoor_Air_Environment_of_a_Shopping_Centre_Carpark_CFD_Ventilation_Study/links/59bc0cfb458515e9cfc7bf64/Indoor-Air-Environment-of-a-Shopping-Centre-Carpark-CFD-Ventilation-Study.pdf,724391273738470685,/scholar?cites=724391273738470685,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rafat_Al-Waked/publication/319566365_Indoor_Air_Environment_of_a_Shopping_Centre_Carpark_CFD_Ventilation_Study/links/59bc0cfb458515e9cfc7bf64/Indoor-Air-Environment-of-a-Shopping-Centre-Carpark-CFD-Ventilation-Study.pdf,0,0,0
1125900,Analysis of Accelerating Devices for Enclosure Wind Turbines,2017,Ahmad Sedaghat and Rafat Al-Waked and Mamdouh El Haj Assad and Khalil Khanafer and Muath Bani Salim,2,International Journal of Astronautics and Aeronautical Engineering,,009,VIBGOYR,There are fundamental differences between internal and external flows over short hollow devices. For internal flows. the outflow velocity in a pipe with constant cross section is unchanged. in a nozzle is accelerated. and in a diffuser is retarded. This is tempting for general wind turbine practitioners to develop enclosure type wind turbines for accelerating wind speed and augmenting wind power. In this study. the short hollow accelerating devices without interaction of wind turbines is investigated in vertical orientation using analytical and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) techniques. The literature on shrouded wind turbines and wind catchers are briefly reviewed. Bernoulli energy equation are used to derive some simple analytical formulations considering viscous losses to determine inlet and outlet pressure and velocity along centreline of three short hollow devices of tube. nozzle. and diffuser shapes in external flows. Then. CFD simulations are carried out for the hollow devices in both horizontal and vertical orientation. The results of computational and analytical methods indicate that the wind speed at the inlet of nozzle retarded due to development of a pressure zone. in good agreement with the experimental data. and the outlet flow velocity is slightly increased compared with the free stream inlet velocity at low wind speeds. Flow simulations around diffuser device however reveal a suction zone at the inlet where intake of air improves and the intake air velocity is increased compared with free stream inlet air velocity particularly at higher wind speeds. No noticeable differences are observed between flow features around horizontal and …,True,0FBU0ZUAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mamdouh_El_Haj_Assad/publication/319269142_Analysis_of_Accelerating_Devices_for_Enclosure_Wind_Turbines/links/599f21100f7e9b3639fe1f3f/Analysis-of-Accelerating-Devices-for-Enclosure-Wind-Turbines.pdf,15452700691360182282,/scholar?cites=15452700691360182282,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mamdouh_El_Haj_Assad/publication/319269142_Analysis_of_Accelerating_Devices_for_Enclosure_Wind_Turbines/links/599f21100f7e9b3639fe1f3f/Analysis-of-Accelerating-Devices-for-Enclosure-Wind-Turbines.pdf,0,0,0

A detailed calibration study was carried out to identify the correct velocity and yaw response of a typical plated X hot-wire probe. The calibration data identified an accurate calibration relationship for the X hot-wire probe. and enabled the development of a related look-up inversion method. This provided a reference for the assessment of the accuracy of common signal analysis methods. Using a step-by-step approach. the errors caused by the assumptions of constant values for the offset and exponent in a power law relationship were first identified.

One technique is by integrating the solar water heater with thermal energy storage. In the present study. an outdoor experimental investigation of Integrated Phase Change Material (PCM)-flat plate solar collector was carried out with paraffin wax. The absorber plate was modified by installing extended surfaces into the PCM reservoir to increase the heat transfer area. Paraffin wax is used to store heat during the day time. Water is the heating medium and was circulated between a 120 L water tank and the solar collector by pumping. Two cases have been investigated that is with and without PCM. It was found that on the average. 0.5 kg min-1 10 to 20° inclination angles with PCM can provide promising 38°C hot water temperature for daytime demand with 52±2.2% efficiency. PCM case gives the highest performance when considering the day and night time efficiency compared to the case of without PCM. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.,True,DP9W2fcAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,28,http://eprints.utp.edu.my/8926/,282307636831288618,/scholar?cites=282307636831288618,,http://eprints.utp.edu.my/8926/1/2390-2396.pdf,0,0,0

A number of heat extraction methods from all-glass evacuated tubes have been developed and the water-in-glass concept has been found to be the most successful due to its simplicity and low manufacturing cost. In this paper. the performance of a water-in-glass evacuated tube solar pre-heater is investigated using the International Standard test method ISO 9459-2 for a range of locations. Factors influencing the operation of water-in-glass collector tubes are discussed and a numerical study of water circulation through long single-ended thermosyphon tubes is presented.

This can be achieved by cooling the module and reducing the heat stored inside the PV cells during operation. In this paper. long-term performance modeling of a proposed solar-water pumping system is carried out. The system. which is used for irrigation purposes. consists of a PV module cooled by water. a submersible water pump. and a water storage tank. Cooling of the PV panel is achieved by introducing water trickling configuration on the upper surface of the panel.

The numerical algorithm integrates the Boussinesq-type Navier–Stokes equations in velocity–pressure formulation with a Chebyshev spatial approximation and a finite-difference secondorder time-marching scheme.

The dynamics of the time-dependent solutions. their time-averaged structure and preliminary results concerning their statistics are presented. In particular. the internal gravity waves are shown to play an important role in the time-dependent dynamics of the solutions. both at the onset of unsteadiness and in the fully chaotic regime.

Past studies have proposed many empirical correlations to estimate pressure losses and cuttings concentration. However. these developed correlations are limited to their experimental data range and setup. and hence. they cannot be applicable to all cases.

The simulation techniques are either based on solving governing partial differential equations using numerical schemes such as the finite element or finite difference methods. or a variety of heuristically based geometry driven methods. Numerical methods are more accurate. but geometry driven methods are computationally less expensive.

Instead of suppressing nonlinear response. the sensor was optimized in such a way that a ‘sine-like’function was displayed on top of the linear function. This concept of design had been implemented and verified in both software and hardware. A good agreement was achieved between the finite element model of proposed design and the approximation model (pure sinusoidal function). with a maximum difference of±1.2%. In addition. the design parameters of the sensor were analysed and investigated. It was found that the error in symmetry of the sinusoidal function could be minimized by adjusting the pitch of helix. The experiments of air-water and oil-water stratified flows were carried out and validated the sinusoidal relationship with a maximum difference of±1.2% and±1.3% for the range of water holdup from 0.15 to 0.85.

Understanding the behavior of two-phase flow through a T-junction is very important as it has significant effect on the operation. maintenance and efficiency of the components downstream from the junction. The objective of this paper is to determine the effect of ratio of side arm to main arm diameters. initial inlet gas saturation and gas density variation on passive separation performance in T-junction. Via computational fluid dynamics tool. preliminary investigation found that separation efficiency is proportional to diameter ratio in between 0.5-0.75.

Due to the phenomena known as multiphase maldistribution. occurring in a T‐junction. they are often used as partial phase separators for reducing the work load on phase separation devices in oil and gas platforms. Previous literature says that reducing the diameter ratio of the T‐junction improves the two‐phase separation. however it was also reported that reducing the diameter ratio too much has a negative effect on two‐phase separation. To test this. a numerical study was performed to see the two‐phase stratified flow separation in 1. 0.6 and 0.167 diameter ratio T‐junctions.

A major issue in the T-junction is the liquid carryover. where excessive liquid flows into the downstream process equipment causing the platform to trip. The primary objective of the present study is to determine the effect of ratio of side arm to main arm diameters on passive separation performance in T-junction. The analysis was carried out using Eulerian Multiphase model from ANSYS Fluent 16.1. The boundary conditions chosen for the inlet and two outlets of the T-junction were velocity inlet and volume fraction outlet flow. respectively. Likewise. pressure velocity coupling was achieved by using SIMPLE coupling scheme. Three different side to main arm diameter ratio and side to main arm length ratio of 0.2. 0.6. and 1.0 were investigated. with different gas velocities variation and inlet gas saturation. Investigation found that the gas volume fraction in the side arm cannot go beyond 90% irrespective of the variation of parameters such as gas to liquid velocity ratio. diameter ratio. length ratio. and mass split ratio. It was found that the amount of gas exiting through the side arm decreases by decreasing the initial gas saturation and gas to liquid velocity ratio. However. by decreasing the mass split ratio. more gas ends up in side arm. Likewise. in terms of geometrical aspects. increasing the T-junction diameter ratio and reducing the length ratio causes an increase in extraction of gas into side arm. It was also noticed that the highest fraction of gas in side arm was achieved when the diameter ratio was 0.6.

1126024,Experimental Studies on Fire for Offshore Structures and its Limitations: A Review,2015,M Imran and M.S Liew and M.S. Nasif,45,Chemical Engineering Transactions,,Pages 1951-1956,Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC,In past few decades a wide range of major accidents were reported due to oil & gas operation in offshore industry. Among of them hydrocarbon fire is the most frequently reported thread to offshore industry. It is an extremely costly and nearly impossible to conduct an experimental study on full scale offshore facilities under fire. But in order to understand the behaviour of fire and physically failure mode of structural member it is important to conduct an experimental study. For this purpose several studies focused just to understanding the behaviour of fire under expected fire scenarios. On the other hand. to maintain structure stability various structural members were tested under fire. In this review relevant studies will be presented to highlight and discuss the main studies based on experimental setup. Also the limitations of experimental studies will be highlighted in order to proposed comparison of experiment versus simulation. Although. simulation is considered to be the most economical and effect technique for modelling consequences before actual construction. It is recommended to validate simulation results obtained from computational fluid dynamics or nonlinear structural analysis which depends on the modelling techniques.,True,m0vCHn4AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,11,https://www.academia.edu/download/39990772/PRES15_0364_rev_M_v8_1440775779.pdf,15550839992494803661,/scholar?cites=15550839992494803661,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39990772/PRES15_0364_rev_M_v8_1440775779.pdf,0,0,0

This study evaluates the initiatives that can enhance the safety of slope by considering the remedial measures to deal with the factors causing slope instability and discusses the application of risk management strategies to address the problems that can cause the slope to fail. The methods for the remediation of slope include modification in slope geometry. drainage. use of retaining structures and internal slope reinforcement. This study also discusses the risk management process which is a hierarchical procedure that includes assessment and control of risk through different techniques in order to manage the uncertainties associated with the slope. It has been observed that the implementation of risk management strategy aids in the proper identification of risk and its severity which dictates the selection of appropriate remedial measure for the rectification of slope. For reducing the number of landslides. this study suggests the use of risk based strategies to curtail the chances of slope failure.,True,m0vCHn4AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,7,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/267923439.pdf,12183904227064474258,/scholar?cites=12183904227064474258,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/267923439.pdf,0,0,0

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is one of the most common hydrocarbon fuel produced in an offshore oil and gas platforms. LNG can cause different types of fires such as jet fire. pool fire. flash fire and fire ball. Among the various offshore accidents. pool fire is the most repeated phenomenon. It has the potential to cause significant injury to personnel. discontinuity of operations and damage to structure and equipment. Wind speed significantly affect the incident heat due to fuel radiation in case of pool fires in upwind and downwind direction. It is. therefore. requisite to quantify the hazards posed by pool fires in upwind and downwind direction at different wind speeds. The study is focused on modeling of pool fire using Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) with varying wind speed. For CFD modeling. Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and Pyrosim are used. Effect of wind speed on smoke movement in downwind direction is investigated. The incident heat flux due to pool fire heat radiation is determined in upwind and downwind direction. Furthermore. radiative heat flux is utilized to calculate the impact on human for 1st degree of burn. 2nd degree of burn and death in upwind and downwind direction. The results exhibited that incident heat flux and probability of injury varies significantly in downwind direction by increasing wind speed and minor variation have been found in upwind direction.,True,m0vCHn4AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,4,http://www.arpnjournals.org/jeas/research_papers/rp_2016/jeas_1116_5337.pdf,15622628134807799531,/scholar?cites=15622628134807799531,,http://www.arpnjournals.org/jeas/research_papers/rp_2016/jeas_1116_5337.pdf,0,0,0
1126027,Strengthening Techniques & Failure Modes of RC Beam Strengthened Using Fibre Reinforced Polymer. A Review,2014,Muhammad Imran and Nasir Shafiq and Ibrisam Akbar,2,GSTF Journal of Engineering Technology (JET),2,,,strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) beam using Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) revealed as the most efficient material due to its various mechanical properties. The previous experimental studies conducted to discuss strengthening schemes for RC beam. based on the observed crack pattern and failure mechanism for strengthening RC beam. The development of crack formation on RC beams under loading identifies the mode of failure and strengthening scheme required. such as to increase the flexural capacity of RC beam; FRP is applied at the tension zone. Similarly. for shear and torsion strengthening FRP wraps are being applied at the faces of the beam. The studies have shown the high strength in shear and torsion is achieved by applying U-shape wrap. Full warp gives high strength in torsion strengthening but practically the application of full wrap on RC beam is impossible and required more in-depth study to propose practical solutions. However. the combined effects of flexure. shear and torsion have not been discussed yet. Therefore. the strengthening schemes from literature are combined to propose new strengthening scheme for RC beam under combine the action of flexure. shear and torsion. However. experimental data are required to validate the proposed scheme.,True,m0vCHn4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,4,http://dl6.globalstf.org/index.php/jet/article/download/798/2388,12717125721213843307,/scholar?cites=12717125721213843307,,http://dl6.globalstf.org/index.php/jet/article/download/798/2388,0,0,0

The application of passive fire protection (PFP) is a costly solution. The PFP is applied only on critical structural members to optimise project cost. In some cases. beams cannot be protected from the top flange in order to accommodate for the placement of pipe supports and grating. It is important to understand the thermal and mechanical response of beam under such condition. This paper discusses the response of steel beam under ISO 834 fire protected. unprotected and three sides protected beams. The model validated against an experimental study. The experimental study has shown good agreement with FE model.

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is one of the most common hydrocarbon produced in offshore platforms. Leakage of LNG can cause pool fire. jet fire. flash fire or fire ball. Thermal radiations due to fire is the major source of damage to workers on board. But due to fire. various combustion product toxic gases are also produced that have both acute and chronic health effects. These toxic gases can cause incapacitation. increased heart rate. vomiting and even death. Predicting the human injury due to thermal radiations and concentration of toxic gases are the key issues.

Assessment of the existing slopes in relation with risks seems to be more meaningful when concerning with landslides. Probabilistic slope stability analysis (PSSA) is the best option in covering the landslides events. The intent here is to bid a probabilistic framework for quantified risk analysis with human uncertainties. In this regard. Fault Tree Analysis is utilized and for prediction of risk levels. consequences of the failures of the reference landslides have been taken.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is one of the most common hydrocarbon fuel produced in an offshore oil and gas platforms. LNG can cause different types of fires such as jet fire. pool fire. flash fire and fire ball. Among the various offshore accidents. pool fire is the most repeated phenomenon. It has the potential to cause significant injury to personnel. discontinuity of operations and damage to structure and equipment. Wind speed significantly affect the incident heat due to fuel radiation in case of pool fires in upwind and downwind direction. It is. therefore. requisite to quantify the hazards posed by pool fires in upwind and downwind direction at different wind speeds. The study is focused on modeling of pool fire using Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) with varying wind speed. For CFD modeling. Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and Pyrosim are used. Effect of wind speed on smoke movement in downwind direction is investigated. The incident heat flux due to pool fire heat radiation is determined in upwind and downwind direction. Furthermore. radiative heat flux is utilized to calculate the impact on human for 1st degree of burn. 2nd degree of burn and death in upwind and downwind direction. The results exhibited that incident heat flux and probability of injury varies significantly in downwind direction by increasing wind speed and minor variation have been found in upwind direction.,True,I16ZLk4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,4,http://www.arpnjournals.org/jeas/research_papers/rp_2016/jeas_1116_5337.pdf,15622628134807799531,/scholar?cites=15622628134807799531,,http://www.arpnjournals.org/jeas/research_papers/rp_2016/jeas_1116_5337.pdf,0,0,0

The application of passive fire protection (PFP) is a costly solution. The PFP is applied only on critical structural members to optimise project cost. In some cases. beams cannot be protected from the top flange in order to accommodate for the placement of pipe supports and grating. It is important to understand the thermal and mechanical response of beam under such condition. This paper discusses the response of steel beam under ISO 834 fire protected. unprotected and three sides protected beams. The model validated against an experimental study. The experimental study has shown good agreement with FE model.

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is one of the most common hydrocarbon produced in offshore platforms. Leakage of LNG can cause pool fire. jet fire. flash fire or fire ball. Thermal radiations due to fire is the major source of damage to workers on board. But due to fire. various combustion product toxic gases are also produced that have both acute and chronic health effects. These toxic gases can cause incapacitation. increased heart rate. vomiting and even death. Predicting the human injury due to thermal radiations and concentration of toxic gases are the key issues.

Unsurprisingly. 75% of fire and explosion accidents are caused by human error [1–5] and it is mostly in combination with other causes. On offshore platforms. one of the primary reasons for hydrocarbon releases is the combination of process upsets and human errors [1]. This study presents an integrated probability model that combines human and system reliabilities and utilises a Bayesian network (BN).

Inc.,Vapor cloud explosion (VCE) accidents have the potential to cause loss of life in offshore platforms. In order to quantify risk. quantitative risk assessment has served as a robust methodology. However. previous research focuses on macroscale assessment of risk which does not take into consideration the local specific details such as piping and equipment congestions. The overpressure developed by VCE is greatly influenced by local specific details. In addition. VCE occurs due to the ignition of vapor cloud that is influenced by parameters such as wind speeds and directions. This study investigates the effect of different wind conditions on VCE and resulting human injury and fatality risk by employing a grid‐based approach in an offshore platform.

1126055,Improved Analysis on the Fin Reliability of a Plate Fin Heat Exchanger for Usage in LNG Applications,2020,Mustansar Hayat Saggu and Nadeem Ahmed Sheikh and Usama Muhamad Niazi and Muhammad Irfan and Adam Glowacz and Stanislaw Legutko,13,Energies,14,3624,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,A plate fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is a critical part of the cryogenic industry. A plate fin heat exchanger has many applications. but it is commonly used in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry for the gasification/liquefaction process. During this gasification to the liquefaction process. there is a large temperature gradient. Due to this large temperature gradient. stresses are produced that directly influence the braze joint of PFHE. Significant work has been carried out on heat transfer and the flow enhancement of PFHE; however. little attention has been paid to structural stability and stresses produced in these brazed joints. Due to these stresses. leakages in PFHE are observed. mostly in braze joints. In the current study. standard fin design is analyzed. In addition. the structural stability of brazed joints under standard conditions is also tested. Two techniques are used here to analyze fins. using the finite element method (FEM). first by examining the whole fin brazed joint on the basis of experimentally calculated yield strength and second by dividing the braze seam into three sections and defining individual strength for each section of the seam to find stress magnitude on the basis of heat-affected zones. Moreover. by using two different techniques to analyze brazed joints. the stresses in the lower face of the brazed joint were increased by 13% and decreased by 18% in the upper face using different zone techniques as compared to standard full braze seam analysis. It can be concluded that different zone techniques are better in predicting stresses as compared to simple full braze seam analysis using the finite element method since stresses along …,True,I16ZLk4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/14/3624,1031628082607630820,/scholar?cites=1031628082607630820,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/14/3624/pdf,0,0,0

LNG processing for transportation at longer distances works under cryogenic conditions. especially when used for liquefaction and gasification applications. The supply chain of the eco-environmental friendly hydrocarbon is heavily dependent on the processing plant used for liquefaction and subsequent re-gasification of the natural gas. Plate-fin heat exchangers are extensively used in the LNG industry for both re-gasification as well as liquefaction processes. The exchange of heat during the process of natural gas phase change involves plate-fin heat exchangers working under cryogenic low-temperature conditions. The heat exchangers are designed to have brazed joints that are most vulnerable to failure under these temperature conditions. One failure of such a joint can not only hinder the supply chain but also may result in fire and life hazards. In almost all earlier studies. analytical and numerical methods were used to analyze these braze joints using finite element method methods and examining the stresses while keeping them at or near to ambient conditions. In this research. the plate-fin heat exchanger is investigated for its structural stability of brazed fins for three different fin configurations: plain. wavy and compound having different joint geometries. In addition. the analyses are carried out using experimentally measured brazed joint strength which is measured to be on average 22% lower than the base material strength owing to brazing process and resultant heat-affected zone (HAZ …,True,I16ZLk4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/9/2175,9014224194792342894,/scholar?cites=9014224194792342894,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/9/2175/pdf,0,0,0

1126059,Investigating Vapour Cloud Explosion Dynamic Fatality Risk on Offshore Platforms by Using a Grid-Based Framework,2020,Usama Muhammad Niazi and Mohammad Shakir Nasif and Masdi Muhammad and Faisal Khan,8,Processes,6,685,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The reliability of petroleum offshore platform systems affects human safety and well-being; hence. it should be considered in plant design and operation in order to determine its effect on human fatality risk. Methane Vapour Cloud Explosions (VCE) in offshore platforms are known to be one of the fatal potential accidents that can be attributed to failure in plant safety systems. Traditional Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA) lacks in providing microlevel risk assessment studies and are unable to update risk with the passage of time. This study proposes a grid-based dynamic risk analysis framework for analysing the effect of VCEs on the risk of human fatality in an offshore platform. Flame Acceleration Simulator (FLACS). which is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. is used to model VCEs. taking into account different wind and leakage conditions. To estimate the dynamic risk. Bayesian Inference (BI) is utilised using Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) data. The proposed framework offers the advantage of facilitating microlevel risk analysis by utilising a grid-based approach and providing grid-by-grid risk mapping. Increasing the wind speed (from 3 to 7 m/s) resulted in maximum increase of 21% in risk values. Furthermore. the integration of BI with FLACS in the grid-based framework effectively estimates risk as a function of time and space; the dynamic risk analysis revealed up to 68% increase in human fatality risk recorded from year one to year five.,True,I16ZLk4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/8/6/685,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/8/6/685/pdf,0,0,0

Simulation of the pump motor and its controllers tested by MATLAB/Simulink. Two Proportional plus Integral (PI) controllers are employed for controlling the rotational speed and torque of the motor. For controlling the suspension force a comparative study is presented between the Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative (PID) controller and two inputs PID-like Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). A particle swarm optimization technique is used to find the best values for the controller’s parameters. The results of the speed and torque controllers exhibit a good time response to reach the desired speed with a short period of time and to decrease the distorting effects of the load torque successfully. Under similar conditions. the PID-like FLC that controls the suspension forces shows a better time response compared to the PID controller.

1126072,Numerical investigation on the effect of blood flow induced vibration on bileflet artificial heart valve by using fluid structure interaction technique,2006,SK Kadhim and MS Nasif and HH Al-Kayiem and T Nagarajan and R Al Waked,,,,,,Surgeries for replacement of artificial heart valves became more common and frequently used because of artificial heart valve failure. Determining the reason of the failure and finding suitable solutions require deep knowledge about artificial heart valve behavior and operation. The reasons of valve failure are related to the patient’s body and the valve design. The compatibility of the valve to a human body is associated with the dynamics of blood flow and the materials used to manufacture the valve. When blood flows through the arteries and valves. blood exerts forces at the valve components. thereby causing flow-induced vibration. which may damage the valve. In this study. fluid–structure interaction techniques to computational fluid dynamics analysis were used to investigate the effects of vibrations occurring via computer simulation. To obtain the optimal design of shear stress. the shear stress of the connection pin of an artificial heart valve were calculated and compared with the shear stress of the connection pin in the literature. At Reynolds number of 250. the excitation frequencies increased from 94.24 rad/sec to 126.9 rad/sec. which resulted in a 75% increase in shear stress values at the connection pin valve at a fully closed angle of 85. The increase in frequency may cause resonance phenomenon. which will cause damage to the artificial heart valve components. Consequently. the blood components will also be damaged. thereby causing an increase in blood clogging occurrence downstream of the artificial heart valve.,True,R-5vldcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://www.arpnjournals.org/jeas/research_papers/rp_2017/jeas_0417_5939.pdf,,,,http://www.arpnjournals.org/jeas/research_papers/rp_2017/jeas_0417_5939.pdf,0,0,0

Wind forecasting could be performed for long or short time horizons. Given the volatile nature of wind and its dependent on many geographical parameters. it is difficult for traditional methods to provide a reliable forecast of wind speed time series. In this study. an attempt is made to establish an efficient adaptive network-based fuzzy interference (ANFIS) for short-term wind speed forecasting. Using the available data sets in the literature. the ANFIS network is constructed. tested and the results are compared with that of a regular neural network. which has been forecasted the same set of dataset in previous studies. To avoid trial-and-error process for selection of the ANFIS input data. the results of autocorrelation factor (ACF) and partial auto correlation factor (PACF) on the historical wind speed data are employed. The available data set is divided into two parts. 50% for training and 50% for testing and validation. The testing part of data set will be merely used for assessing the performance of the neural network which guarantees that only unseen data is used to evaluate the forecasting performance of the network. On the other hand. validation data could be used for parameter-setting of the network if required. The results indicate that ANFIS could not outperform ANN in short-term wind speed forecasting though its results are competitive. The two methods are hybridized. though simply by weightage. and the hybrid methods shows slight improvement comparing to both ANN and ANFIS results.

RC-DEBs generally are recessed at their end parts and supported by columns. cantilevers. inverted T-beams. or corbels. The geometric discontinuity of dapped-end beams evokes a severe stress concentration at reentrant corners that may lead to shear failure. Therefore. stress analysis is required at the reentrant vicinity for design requirement of these beams. Four large-scale RC-DEBs specimens were prepared. cast. and tested up to failure. Three parameters were investigated: amount of nib reinforcements. main flexural reinforcements. and concrete type at the dapped-end area. Finite element analysis using Vec2 was also conducted to predict the behavior of RC-DEBs. It has been found that highest stresses concentration factors occur at the reentrant corners and its vicinity. By using engineered cementitious composite (ECC) in the dapped-end area.  the failure load has increased by 51.9%. while the increment in the failure load was 62.2% and 46.7% as the amount of nib reinforcement and main flexural reinforcement increased. respectively.

Furthermore. RCC pavement does not support the use of dowel bars or reinforcement due to the way it is placed and compacted. these also aided in cracking and consequently increased maintenance cost. To address these issues. high volume fly ash (HVFA) RCC pavement was developed by partially replacing 50% cement by volume with fly ash. Crumb rubber was used as a partial replacement to fine aggregate in HVFA RCC pavement at 0%. 10%. 20%. and 30% replacement by volume.

The importance of the integration of water bodies to many cities is globally acknowledged. Over the years. many of these cities have lost their integration with their water bodies due to many factors such as the industrial revolution. development in transportation system and technology. In an attempt to achieve sustainable development. most cities have attempted to reintegrate the city with the water body even to the extent of removing highways which had been constructed parallel to the water body. These expensive approaches are some of the many efforts done due to the increasing awareness on the benefits gained through waterfront regeneration. This has. however. helped to secure the sense of place as well as increasing the quality of living and working environment of the urban community. The lost of integration between the city and the water bodies is also experienced by the capital city of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur. In the case of Kuala Lumpur city. the Klang and Gombak Rivers that run through the city centre act as the main water bodies. It used to be the life lines of the City when it was the main transportation mode for the people.

1126125,Optimal sensor placement for mode shapes using improved simulated annealing,2014,KH Tong and Norhisham Bakhary and ABH Kueh and AY Yassin,13,Smart Struct. Syst,3,389-406,,Optimal sensor placement techniques play a significant role in enhancing the quality of modal data during the vibration based health monitoring of civil structures. where many degrees of freedom are available despite a limited number of sensors. The literature has shown a shift in the trends for solving such problems. from expansion or elimination approach to the employment of heuristic algorithms. Although these heuristic algorithms are capable of providing a global optimal solution. their greatest drawback is the requirement of high computational effort. Because a highly efficient optimisation method is crucial for better accuracy and wider use. this paper presents an improved simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to solve the sensor placement problem. The algorithm is developed based on the sensor locations‟ coordinate system to allow for the searching in additional dimensions and to increase SA‟ s random search performance while minimising the computation efforts. The proposed method is tested on a numerical slab model that consists of two hundred sensor location candidates using three types of objective functions; the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). modal assurance criterion (MAC). and mean square error (MSE) of mode shapes. Detailed study on the effects of the sensor numbers and cooling factors on the performance of the algorithm are also investigated.

1126126,Thermal behavior of cylindrical buckling restrained braces at elevated temperatures,2014,Elnaz Talebi and Mahmood Md Tahir and Farshad Zahmatkesh and Airil Yasreen and Jahangir Mirza,2014,The Scientific World Journal,,,Hindawi,The primary focus of this investigation was to analyze sequentially coupled nonlinear thermal stress. using a three-dimensional model. It was meant to shed light on the behavior of Buckling Restraint Brace (BRB) elements with circular cross section. at elevated temperature. Such bracing systems were comprised of a cylindrical steel core encased in a strong concrete-filled steel hollow casing. A debonding agent was rubbed on the core’s surface to avoid shear stress transition to the restraining system. The numerical model was verified by the analytical solutions developed by the other researchers. Performance of BRB system under seismic loading at ambient temperature has been well documented. However. its performance in case of fire has yet to be explored. This study showed that the failure of brace may be attributed to material strength reduction and high compressive forces. both due to temperature rise. Furthermore. limiting temperatures in the linear behavior of steel casing and concrete in BRB element for both numerical and analytical simulations were about 196°C and 225°C. respectively. Finally it is concluded that the performance of BRB at elevated temperatures was the same as that seen at room temperature; that is. the steel core yields prior to the restraining system.,True,P_6-pH8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,14,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/672629/abs/,2605628832973600152,/scholar?cites=2605628832973600152,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/672629/abs/,0,0,0

This paper helps fill this gap because it is an experimental investigation of the behavior of CFRP shear strengthened RC beams under a marine environment. Specimens were exposed to cyclic (wet/dry) and full exposure to the elements for a 3-month period. Six strengthened beams and one unstrengthened beam were tested; the tested control beam failed due to a diagonal-tension crack. The increase in the concrete shear capacity of the strengthened specimens was in the range of 14–18% compared to the control beam. Thus. the results lead to the conclusion that CFRP strengthening increases the shear capacity of specimens considerably.,True,P_6-pH8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,2,https://www.geomatejournal.com/sites/default/files/articles/179-184-46816-Fazli-Nov-2017-g1.pdf,2713617649242139244,/scholar?cites=2713617649242139244,,https://www.geomatejournal.com/sites/default/files/articles/179-184-46816-Fazli-Nov-2017-g1.pdf,0,0,0

1126143,The importance of engineering mathematics,2009,Airil Yasreen Mohd Yassin and Norsarahaida Saidina Amin,,"Engineering Mathematics Research Group, UKM, Bangi (Orgs.), EMaS'09-Proceedings of Engineering Mathematics Seminar",,,,Engineers are problem solvers whose decisions are constrained by cost and time. Their ideal would be the simultaneous prevalence of the cheapest. the quickest and the safest'decisions'. However. since such an attainment is impossible. what is left is the endeavor for balance between accuracy. efficiency. sufficiency and safety. But. such a diversity. far from being liberating. astringes the engineers to the state of versatility-an engineer should be versatile enough to'satisfy the various conditions' and this demands ingenuity. Mathematics on the other hand. is the language used in the understanding and deliverance of scientific notions describing the physics of the problems. As far as the appearance ofthe mathematical terms is concerned. one could not distinguish between physical problems until the specification of certain parameters. In other words. the'same'mathematical expression would be representative of various equivalent physical problems and the understanding of the derivation and the solution of one typical mathematical statement would allow for the subsequent understanding of the other equivalent problems. Such generality and interconnection between subjects which can only be made possible by the marriage between mathematics and engineering knowledge is what is highly valued nowadays. especially in the advancement of computer technology and that is what this paper is about to venture.,True,P_6-pH8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/30774069/AirilYasreenMohdYassin2009_TheImportanceofEngineeringMathematics.pdf,16323862834285399632,/scholar?cites=16323862834285399632,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30774069/AirilYasreenMohdYassin2009_TheImportanceofEngineeringMathematics.pdf,0,0,0

The three dimensional numerical simulation of a fully developed laminar blood flow in a long horizontal cylinder (steady Navier-Stokes equation) was verified by the analytical solution of Poiseuille flow. In allowing for the effects of the magnetic fields. the steady Navier-Stokes equations of the flow are expanded to include the Lorentz and magnetization forces.

The partial differential equation is discretized using a Galerkin weighted residual method employing RPIM shape functions. A forward difference scheme is used for temporal discretization. while the direct substitution method is employed to solve the nonlinear system at each time step. The formulation is validated against solutions from conventional numerical techniques and physical observation. In all cases. excellent agreements are achieved and hence the validation of the proposed formulation. Optimum values of the multi-quadrics shape parameters were then determined before the assessment of the performance of the method.

Mohd Yassin,82,Jurnal Teknologi,2,23-34,PENERBIT UTM PRESS,Magnetic heating of crude oil mixed with nanoparticle for heat transfer mechanism enhancement has received much attention in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). In the present work. the heat transfer of Fe3O4. Al2O3. CuO. Cu nanoparticles mixed in crude oil is theoretically investigated. The mathematical model of magnetic field heating in reservoir is represented by the channel flow of crude oil-nanofluid subjected to a longitudinal spatially varying magnetic field. The viscous incompressible flow is bounded by nonisothermal walls. The coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved numerically using an unconditionally stable time integration and finite element method. The numerical results are validated against data available in literature. The physical aspects of the crude oil-nanofluid flow and heat transfer are discussed in terms of several pertinent parameters such as solid nano fraction. skin friction. magnetic. Hartmann and Nusselt numbers. It is found that the enhancement of heat transfer increases with the magnetic number and solid nano fraction while decreases with the increase in Hartmann number. It is shown that. the addition of nanoparticle and increment of magnetic number is effective in the localised heating. In addition. the heat transfer of Fe3O4. Al2O3. CuO. Cu nanoparticles in crude oil mixed are investigated and assessed against each other. It is observed that. the heating mechanism would not be as effective for high electrically conducting nanoparticles.

Maintenance cost. down time cost and acquisition costs are calculated. The main uncertainty in calculating these costs are prediction of number of failure and cumulative down time. Number of failure is determined using failure and repair time density function. According to the characteristic that the cumulative failure probability observed. a Weibull distribution model is used.

1126162,Comparative study between degradation analysis and first order reliability method for assessing piping reliability for risk-based inspection,2009,Ainul Akmar Mokhtar and Mokhtar Che Ismail and Masdi Muhammad,4,studies,,20,,Piping systems in refineries and petrochemical plants are exposed to corrosive environment causing various types of degradation mechanisms. One of the damage mechanisms experienced is gradual wall thinning that causes the pipe to leak. Since the piping systems carry hydrocarbons or other process fluids. the presence of small leak may lead to a hazardous situation. Therefore. proper inspection and maintenance of these systems is essential for maintaining a safe and continuous operation. Risk-based inspection (RBI) strategy has been adopted to establish the inspection strategy for piping systems where the strategy is based on risk calculated. Risk is defined as the product of the probability of failure and its consequences of failure.Assessing the failure probability for piping systems in RBI approach typically follows the guideline by American Petroleum Institute (API 581) where the method is deterministic. This study explores the available probabilistic analysis techniques in estimating the piping failure probability. namely. degradation analysis and first-order reliability method (FORM). The objective of this paper is to estimate the pipes failure probability using these two techniques where both models require different input data. Degradation analysis only uses the pipe wall thickness data that are usually being collected during inspection for pipes subject to wall thinning. Conversely. FORM model requires data on material properties and physical geometric of the piping system to estimate the failure probability. The failure probability estimated by these two techniques are then compared and discussed. The results showed that the degradation …,True,ruYODRwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,7,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.658.2975&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5999636192052142536,/scholar?cites=5999636192052142536,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.658.2975&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Malaysia,Air enhancement devices for air intake manifold systems of automotive engines have been widely available in the market with the claim that they can improve fuel-air mixing and thus bring more power to the engine performance and better fuel efficiency. However. there is lack of evidence to complement the claim. The objective of this study is to investigate the ability of an air enhancement device in improving the performance of a Spark Ignition (SI) engine. The investigation is performed by an experiment on a four-stroke single-cylinder engine test bed. in which the air enhancement device is installed at the downstream of the air intake manifold. The result is compared to the performance of the engine without the air enhancement device. It is shown that the brake power. brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and torque increase significantly with the engine speed when operated at 30% to 50% of the open throttle positions.

In the case of the airport runway. vortices are generated from the aeroplane bodies that exit and enter the runway during take-off and landing operations. These oscillations can be utilized to generate power due to the large fluctuations produced by the vortices. Vortexinduced vibration works on the principle of Kármán vortices where a cylindrical or bluff-body shaped object oscillates due to the alternate vortex formation on the boundary layers by adverse fluid pressure. The oscillation depends on the unsteady lift force generated. This mechanical oscillation is later converted to electrical energy. Five cylindrical crosssection cases are investigated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) k-ω turbulence model to identify the best case that will provide the largest lift force; hence the maximum power output generation. These cases are simulated using typical take-off air speeds for jetliners in order to finalize the overall performance. The observed results show that the elliptical cross-section with 3” height and 2” length provides the best cross-section in producing the greatest amount of energy.

The IAQ within a multi-level underground carpark of a shopping mall has been investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on ANSYS-FLUENT (18.1) software. The effects of car engines types. porosity of supply and exhaust air louvers and ventilation flow rates on IAQ were examined. A mesh sensitivity study was conducted and the CFD model was validated against the fully mixed mathematical formulations of IAQ with a maximum difference in values of 1.5 ppm and an error of 3.4%. The results showed that the ventilation system must be operated at ACH value of more than 2.7 in order to meet the required CO concentration of 50 ppm within the carpark and should be based on running cars within each level rather than the parking capacity of each level. Porosity of louvers affected air flow distribution between parking levels and led to higher dilution of CO. Therefore. modelling a multilevel underground carpark requires closer attention to cross level interaction across Ramps which could affect the CO concentration within a given level.

The further analysis of the grabbed images confirmed the strong influence of the input processing parameters on full cone spray patternation. It was also predicted that the heated starch adhesive solutions generate a dispersed spray pattern by utilizing the partial evaporation of the spraying medium. Below 40°C of heating temperature. the radial spray cone width and angle did not vary significantly with increasing Reynolds and Weber numbers at early injection phases leading to increased macroscopic spray propagation.

1126243,Design of advanced solar water heaters,2000,NK Groenhout and GL Morrison and M Behnia,,Proc. ANZSES Solar 2000 Conf,,295-303,,In the past decade there has been a significant increase in the use of domestic solar water heaters. Whilst the range and quality of products on the market have increased to meet this demand. flat plate solar collectors of the type used in many modern domestic hot water systems have not changed significantly in the past twenty years. These types of absorbers typically have high heat losses and low efficiency. particular throughout winter months. A novel type of solar collector has been proposed which addresses a number of issues including heat loss characteristics and seasonal performance. The project is investigating both design and production aspects of the new collector to provide an optimised design for an advanced domestic solar water heater.An indoors experimental program has commenced and has shown that considerable reductions in the overall heat loss may be possible with the proposed design and further experimental work is being undertaken to confirm this. It is believed that further reductions can also be achieved by the introduction of convective suppression barriers on the underside of the upper leading edge of the double sided plate. Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) will be used to visualise the flow inside the concentrator cavities and to experimentally determine the flow velocity profiles within the cavities. A computational fluid dynamics model has also been developed to assist in the design process.

1126244,Energy performance and CO2 emissions of HVAC systems in commercial buildings,2017,Rafat Al-Waked and Mohammad Shakir Nasif and Nathan Groenhout and Lester Partridge,7,Buildings,4,84,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Energy performance of buildings has attracted much attention among building physicists and engineers worldwide. The effects of building heating; ventilation; and air conditioning (HVAC) systems’ design upgrade on the building energy performance are the focus of the current study. The adopted HVAC system consisted of chilled ceiling and chilled beam systems served by a centrifugal water chiller. An energy simulation study was undertaken in accordance with the national Australian built environment rating system-rules for collecting and using data. A three-dimensional simulation study was carried out utilizing the virtual environment-integrated environmental solutions software. Results from the current study have shown the importance of utilizing energy-efficient HVAC systems and HVAC strategies for achieving a high building energy star rating. Recommended strategies in order to achieve the nominated star rating; as predicted by the simulation analysis; were presented. Moreover; the effects of solar radiation inside the building atrium were significant; which cannot be overcome by simply installing a low shading coefficient glazing type at the atrium skylight. In addition to providing chilled ceiling technology; a high efficiency chiller and low energy lighting; it is recommended that the building be well tuned during the commissioning period. The current approach could be extended to accommodate higher energy ratings of commercial buildings at different locations worldwide.

The required ventilation system design is generally based on local standards provided by local authorities. The purpose of the current study is to develop a performance based ventilation system for a shopping center carpark. The aim of the study is to undertake computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling of the carpark to determine the potential minimum ventilation exhaust rate levels. Results showed that the proposed carpark exhaust system was considered acceptable and no modifications were required. The CO concentration levels in all areas. except within the immediate vicinity of car exhaust plumes. were below 100 ppm. The average predicted CO rise was less than 25 ppm across the carpark which is in compliance with the current Worksafe Australia and WHO CO exposure limits. Moreover. results indicated that the 64.000 l/s exhaust air flowrate was sufficient. and could be reduced to 50.000 l/s. From a financial point of view. it was concluded that the removal of the outlet grilles located at the Southern wall of the Commuters section of the carpark was an acceptable alternative.

Life systems are the bioclimatic systems that operate within the ecosphere and interact with it. These are mainly active systems that include resource-producing systems. such as solar hot water. and climate control systems. such as air conditioning. Material systems are derived from the lithosphere and concern those materials that have environmentally friendly qualities. There is a strong political imperative to utilize green technologies to improve environmental performance of houses (AGO. 1999a. b; USDOE. 2003).

Further. carbon dioxide emissions associated with existing buildings are estimated to be increasing. and are now an important policy and design issue for all governments around the world. With the projected climate change effects associated with increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. combined with the demand for more comfortable indoor environments in offices. there is a growing concern about increasing energy consumption in existing commercial buildings and the likely adverse impacts on the environment as a consequence. With a large proportion of existing commercial buildings in major cities in the world being over 20 years old. much of the high rise building stock presents a high level of unrealised opportunity to improve energy efficiency and relieve pressure on energy supply markets. Exploring the unrealised potential for energy efficiency in existing commercial buildings is arguably the most significant action the commercial building sector can take to reduce dependency on non-renewable energy resources. and on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Design solutions for energy-efficient retrofitting which are based on a ‘bioclimatic approach’. that is. they address the effects. and mitigate the causes. of climate change. are currently needed if significant environmental impacts in the built environment are to be reduced and avoided in the future.,True,1_luiIAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Upendra_Rajapaksha/publication/287994671_Upendra_Rajapaksha_et_al_2013_Design_solution_sets_for_bio-climatic_retrofit_in_Hyde_R_ed_Sustainable_retrofitting_of_commercial_buildings_-_warm_climates_Routledge_Taylor_and_Francis_Group_UK/links/567bc30d08ae051f9ade74bf/Upendra-Rajapaksha-et-al-2013-Design-solution-sets-for-bio-climatic-retrofit-in-Hyde-R-ed-Sustainable-retrofitting-of-commercial-buildings-warm-climates-Routledge-Taylor-and-Francis-Group-UK.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Upendra_Rajapaksha/publication/287994671_Upendra_Rajapaksha_et_al_2013_Design_solution_sets_for_bio-climatic_retrofit_in_Hyde_R_ed_Sustainable_retrofitting_of_commercial_buildings_-_warm_climates_Routledge_Taylor_and_Francis_Group_UK/links/567bc30d08ae051f9ade74bf/Upendra-Rajapaksha-et-al-2013-Design-solution-sets-for-bio-climatic-retrofit-in-Hyde-R-ed-Sustainable-retrofitting-of-commercial-buildings-warm-climates-Routledge-Taylor-and-Francis-Group-UK.pdf,0,0,0

J. of Thermal & Environmental Engineering,1,27-34,,The current investigation involves carrying out dynamic thermal simulations and computational fluid dynamic analysis (CFD) analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to assist in designing a ventilation system to achieve an acceptable internal thermal environment of less than 28 º C dry bulb temperatures within the occupied space. The thermal performance of the facility over a period of time has been simulated taking into account the effect of thermal mass within the space which affects the average internal space temperatures. Results from the dynamic thermal simulation analysis were then used to provide the boundary conditions for the CFD analysis. The investigated warehouse has been simulated using four different roofs based mechanical ventilation strategies. The amount of goods stored in the warehouse has been found to play a significant role in keeping the warehouse temperature within the acceptable range. An almost empty warehouse tends to vary with the outside ambient temperature. However. a warehouse full of goods makes use of thermal mass to provide a passive cooling strategy. It is recommended that mechanical ventilation of 350 m3/s of air to be adopted using the smoking fans already exist in the warehouse.

Queensland Chapter,The concept of supplying 100% outdoor air at low level to serve Call Centres is by no means a new concept. However. the concept of combining the use of rock bed thermal storage with a low level supply air conditioning system provides an ideal opportunity in the right climate to reduce the reliance on refrigerative cooling and heating. There are few examples of such systems here in Australia which seems to indicate the reluctance of designers and owners to embark on designs which are considered as non-conventional or are perceived to provide a less than acceptable return on investment. This paper has been prepared to demonstrate the effectiveness of a rock bed thermal storage system when used in conjunction with a low level supply air system. The paper also discusses the method to size and design the rock bed thermal store and the resultant energy savings when the building is simulated and compared …,True,1_luiIAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=691962262849525;res=IELENG,,,,,0,0,0

These types of absorbers typically have high heat losses through convective and radiative heat transfer. A new solar collector design has been proposed that offers significant reductions in convective and radiative heat loss through the use of stationary concentrators. double sided absorber plates and high absorptance. low emittance selective surfaces. The new design also incorporates a seasonal bias to optimise output during winter months when demand for hot water is highest. A simulation model has been developed to assist in the design process. This model will be validated with experimental results.

1126265,Effects of different mineral admixtures on the properties of fresh concrete,2014,Sadaqat Ullah Khan and Muhammad Fadhil Nuruddin and Tehmina Ayub and Nasir Shafiq,2014,,,,Hindawi,This paper presents a review of the properties of fresh concrete including workability. heat of hydration. setting time. bleeding. and reactivity by using mineral admixtures fly ash (FA). silica fume (SF). ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS). metakaolin (MK). and rice husk ash (RHA). Comparison of normal and high-strength concrete in which cement has been partially supplemented by mineral admixture has been considered. It has been concluded that mineral admixtures may be categorized into two groups: chemically active mineral admixtures and microfiller mineral admixtures. Chemically active mineral admixtures decrease workability and setting time of concrete but increase the heat of hydration and reactivity. On the other hand. microfiller mineral admixtures increase workability and setting time of concrete but decrease the heat of hydration and reactivity. In general. small particle size and higher specific surface area of mineral admixture are favourable to produce highly dense and impermeable concrete; however. they cause low workability and demand more water which may be offset by adding effective superplasticizer.,True,azt9dh8AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,125,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/986567/abs/,9273305074491028595,/scholar?cites=9273305074491028595,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/986567/abs/,0,0,0

High-performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) is currently being used in the construction of airport runway and highway pavements but mostly it is used forrapid cure patching and where the early opening of the pavement is required. The reason for less use of HPFRC is its high cost as it employs higher cement content whichresults in thermal contraction problems due to high heat release during setting.

1126281,Effect of chopped basalt fibers on the mechanical properties and microstructure of high performance fiber reinforced concrete,2014,Tehmina Ayub and Nasir Shafiq and M Fadhil Nuruddin,2014,Advances in Materials Science and Engineering,,,Hindawi,This paper presents the mechanical properties and the microstructure of the high performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) containing up to 3% volume fraction of chopped Basalt fibers. Three types of the concrete were prepared. out of which. the first type was prepared by utilizing 100% cement content. The other two types of the concrete were prepared by replacing 10% cement content with silica fume and the locally produced metakaolin. Using each concrete type. four mixes were prepared in which Basalt fibers were added in the range of 0–3%; that is. total twelve mixes of the HPFRC concrete were prepared. From each of the twelve concrete mixes. total twelve specimens were cast to determine the mechanical properties of the HPFRC including compressive strength (cube and cylinder). splitting tensile strength. and the flexural strength. In this way. a total of 108 specimens were cast and tested in this study. Test results showed that the addition of the Basalt fibers significantly increased the tensile splitting strength and the flexural strength of the HPFRC. while there was slight improvement in the compressive strength with the addition of Basalt fibers. The microstructure of HPFRC was examined to determine the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between the aggregates and the paste by using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). which showed the improvement of the ITZ due to the addition of the Basalt fibers.,True,azt9dh8AAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,38,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/587686/abs/,9396241140016740138,/scholar?cites=9396241140016740138,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amse/2014/587686/abs/,0,0,0

Durability related properties reviewed include permeability. resistance to sulfate attack. alkali-silica reaction (ASR). carbonation. chloride ion penetration. freezing and thawing. abrasion. fire. acid and efflorescence. From review of existing literature. it is found that permeability of concrete depends upon the content of alumina in mineral admixtures. ie higher the alumina content. lesser the permeability which results higher resistance to sulfate and chloride ion penetration. Highly reactive mineral admixtures prevent more ASR and reduce efflorescence. The carbonation increases with the mineral admixtures because higher water binder ratio and lesser content of portlandite in concrete due to pozzolanic reaction.

1126293,Numerical modeling of wet steam flow in steam turbine channel,2012,Hasril Hasini and Mohd Zamri Yusoff and Norhazwani Abd Malek,,,,,,In power station practice. work is extracted from expanding steam in three stages namely High Pressure (HP). Intermediate Pressure (IP) and Low Pressure (LP) turbines. During the expansion process in the LP turbine. the steam cools down and at some stages. it nucleates to become a two-phase mixture. It is well-acknowledged in the literature that the nucleating and wet stages in steam turbines are less efficient compared to those running with superheated steam. With the advent of water-cooled nuclear reactor. the problem becomes more prominent due to the fact that in water-cooled nuclear reactor. the steam generated is in saturated condition. This steam is then supplied to the HP steam turbine which therefore has also to operate on wet steam. One of the tangible problems associated with wetness is erosion of blading. The newly nucleated droplets are generally too small to cause erosion damage but some of the droplets are collected by the stator and rotor blades to form films and rivulets on the blade and casing walls. On reaching the trailing edges or the tips of the blades. the liquid streams are re-entrained into the flow in the form of coarse droplets. It is these larger droplets that cause the erosion damage and braking loss in steam turbine. However. the formation and behaviour of the droplets have other important thermodynamic and aerodynamic consequences that lower the performance of the wet stages of steam turbines.Interest in wet steam research was sparked by the need for efficient steam turbines used in power generation. The subject has become increasingly important in current decades with the steep increase in fuel cost.

Emphasis is given towards the determination of suitable methods of calculation of suspended droplets in superheated steam. The one dimensional calculation is applied to a duct where superheated steam is allowed to supercool instantaneously as it enters the duct. At the same instance the formation of droplet embryos begins and subsequently. if the surrounding condition permits. it will grow by collecting its surrounding molecules. This process continue for a limited range of time and stops when the supercooling drops. at which the droplets can no longer survives and begins to evaporate. The accumulation of water droplets increases the level of wetness inside the duct.

The effects of two parameters. namely the Reynolds number and the blockage ratio. are the main focus for this study. The threedimensional flow is simulated where the circular cylinder is placed symmetrically in a planar channel with a blockage ratio of β= 0.5 at Re= 200. 300 and 500. Quantitative analysis of the flow is conducted where the lift. CL and drag coefficient. CD and Strouhal number. St are investigated as β and Re are systematically varied. In the present study. it is found that different instability regimes are observed as the Re of the flow increases. The presence of a distinct shedding frequency is observed at Re= 200. However. increasing the Reynolds number further. the contribution of a range of frequencies surrounding the peak frequency appears as shown in the spectral analysis of the lift coefficient. The confinement effects played an important role in changing the properties of the wake.

In general. the main objective of using the winglet longitudinal vortex-generators with the corrugated surfaces is to obtain an increase in the rate of heat exchange by generating vortex and reverse flow which in turn increases the efficiency of the thermal process. leading to save operating costs. To achieve this purpose. four amplitude heights are introduced: a= 1. 2. 3 and 4 mm. Furthermore. the arrangement of winglet longitudinal vortex-generator is placed at the entrance of each wave existing with the same as the slant angle of the waves in the trapezoidal channel. A constant heat flux is adopted to be the thermal condition for the lower and upper corrugated walls while the Reynolds numbers (Re) rate is in the range of 5.000 to 17.500. The effects of the trapezoidal amplitude heights with winglets longitudinal vortex-generator are studied and compared using the non-dimensional parameter performance evaluation criteria (PEC). Thermal and flow characteristics are explored with the help of the stream wise velocity and isotherms contours for trapezoidalcorrugated channels with winglet inserts and different amplitudes.

The main objective of the analysis is to gain insights on the occurrences in the boiler so as to understand the inherent steam temperature imbalance problem. The results show that the root cause of the problem comes from the residual swirl in the horizontal pass. The deflection of the residual swirl due to the sudden reduction and expansion of the flow cross-sectional area causes velocity deviation between the left and right side of the boiler. This consequently results in flue gas temperature imbalance which has often caused tube leaks in the superheater/reheater region.

In this context. we develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to schedule operation of distributed storage by coordinating provision of a range of system services which are rewarded at different market prices.

A key issue regarding their evolution is how the operation and planning standards should evolve to make efficient use of the existing assets while taking advantage of emerging. non-network (or non-wires) technologies. Deployment of the smart grid will require fundamental changes in the historical principles used for network security in order to ensure that integration of low-carbon generation is undertaken as efficiently as possible through the use of new information and communication technology (ICT). and new flexible network technologies that can maximize utilization of existing electricity infrastructure.

The proposed methodology can model degradation of a lithium-ion battery type subject to erratic charge/discharge cycles where degradation data under symmetrical charge/discharge cycles (namely. under a standard protocol) has been provided by the manufacturer. To do so we use the concepts of (i) SOC swing. (ii) average swing range and (iii) Coulombic efficiency to model the degradation process in a simple manner through interpolation techniques. We use both deterministic and Monte Carlo simulations to obtain capacity degradation as …,True,89X-iRwAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C,17,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8102703/,5970161266699098438,/scholar?cites=5970161266699098438,,http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/169096/Modelling-the-degradation-process-of-lithium-ion-batteries.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Sharing storage plant's energy and power capacity for multiple services portfolios leads to conflicting or synergic interactions among services. In this context. the proposed methodology determines interactions among services for distributed energy storage plants. including energy arbitrage. peak demand shaving and various balancing services. and assesses the impact that such interactions have on storage plant remunerability in a multiple service business model framework for distributed energy storage.

Rio de Janeiro, Brasil",,,,Ensuring generation adequacy is a critical problem for emerging countries in Latin America and Asia due to the combination of high load growth rates. constrained access to private equity and low generation security margins. Although market schemes designed solely around spot prices could in principle provide the correct economic signals for the entrance of new generation capacity [1]. their actual track record is somewhat mixed. For example. a 2005 World Bank report [2] surveyed the experiences of nineteen countries which implemented market reforms and faced supply difficulties afterwards. These difficulties. backed up by theoretical arguments [3]. contributed to a growing consensus that more effective measures to ensure supply adequacy are required. As a consequence. a number of countries early adopted some forms of capacity markets or payments. For instances. Chile. the United Kingdom. Argentina. Spain. Colombia. Peru. Italy. South Korea and US markets such as PJM. NEISO and NYISO have established regulated capacity payments at some stage [4].Furthermore. nowadays several emerging economies have adopted supplementary mechanisms to stimulate the entrance of new capacity. In South America. for example. Brazil (2004)[5]. Chile (2005)[6]. Peru (2006)[7] and Colombia (2008)[8] have implemented energy forward contract auctions. which are carried out from three to five years ahead of delivery–a highly desirable feature to foster the competition among new entrants and existing suppliers.

The system can work with different primary power sources like fuel-cells. microturbines. zinc-air batteries or other supply unable to recover energy from regenerative braking. or with scarce power capacity for fast acceleration. The ratings of the ultracapacitor bank are: nominal voltage: 300 Vdc; nominal current: 200 Adc; capacitance: 20 Farads. The amount of energy stored allows delivering 40 kW of power during 20 seconds. which is enough to accelerate the vehicle with minimum help of the primary power source. The vehicle uses a brushless dc motor with a nominal power of 32 kW. and a peak power of 53 kW.

The urban environment causes a local increase of temperature. a phenomenon known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). The purpose of this work is the study of the possible formation of an UHI and the evaluation of its magnitude. in the context of a small city. carried out with the ENVI-met® software. For this purpose. a simulation was needed. and this simulation is preparatory for a monitoring campaign on site. which will be held in the immediate future. ENVI-met® simulates the temporal evolution of several thermodynamics parameters on a micro-scale range. creating a 3D. non-hydrostatic model of the interactions between building-atmosphere-vegetation. The weather conditions applied simulate a typical Italian summer heat wave. Three different case-studies have been analyzed: Base Case. Cool Case and Green Case. Analysis of the actual state in the Base Case shows how even in an area with average building density. such as the old town center of a small city. fully developed UHI may rise with strong thermal gradients between built areas and open zones with plenty of vegetation.

The method is based on the projection of a Ronchi grating onto the surface to be analyzed. When viewed at an angle different from the projection angle. the grid pattern appears deformed by the surface shape. This pattern is digitized. by a high-resolution CCD camera. and then processed using a Fourier transform analysis. The technique is free from the errors caused by higher harmonic components of the grating pattern. Furthermore. the method relies on very simple equipment and it is therefore suitable for in situ measurements.

It may safely be assumed that wood. as a material for monumental sculpture. was much more commonly employed in the mediaeval period than existing examples would seem to indicate (Bulletin of the metropolitan Museum of Art. 2013). Wood is easily obtainable; it could be carved and put in place with less difficulty than stone. it is chemically stable when dry. and its surface offers a compatible substrate for paint application. However. the use of wood is not without pitfalls. and requires an understanding of its anisotropic and hygroscopic nature.

A key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC for complex systems such as buildings is related to the difficulties (cost. time and effort) associated with the identification of a predictive model of a building.

The method. based on an iterative algorithm. is able to estimate the parameter of the electrical single-diode model from the panel’s datasheet. Two iterative steps are used to estimate the five parameters starting from data provided by the manufacturer (nameplate values or I–V curves). The first step permits finding the optimal value of the diode ideality factor A. and the second step allows the calculation of the R p value to improve the accuracy. A model that takes into account variations in temperature and solar irradiance has been used to validate the behavior of the output parameters. Compared to other estimation work. the proposed method shows the best result in the standard test condition (STC) and with a variable solar irradiance. Indeed. the optimization of the A.

Nevertheless. if the structures have damages. it does not mean that they have a complete loss of functionality. but rather that the system is no longer in an optimal condition so that. if the damage increases. the structure can collapse. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). a process for the identification of damage. periodically collects data from suitable sensors that allow to characterize the damage and establishes the health status of the structure. Therefore. this monitoring will provide information on the structure condition. mostly about its integrity. in a short time. and. for infrastructures and civil structures. it is necessary to assess performance and health status. The aim of this work is to design an Internet of Things (IoT) system for Structural Health Monitoring to find possible damages and to see how the structure behaves over time.

It is well known that hybrid photovoltaic-thermal systems. able to produce electricity and thermal energy at the same time with better energetic performance in comparison with two separate systems. present many advantages for application in a residential building.A PV/T is constituted generally by a common PV panel with a metallic pipe. in which fluid flows. Pipe accomplishes two roles: it absorbs the heat from the PV panel. thus increasing. or at least maintaining its efficiency; furthermore. it stores the heat for sanitary uses.In this work. the thermal and electrical efficiencies of a commercial PV/T panel have been evaluated during the summer season in different days. to assess the effect of environmental conditions on the system total efficiency …,True,cHgcLTAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,5,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/923/1/012040/meta,13215807332276658325,/scholar?cites=13215807332276658325,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/923/1/012040/pdf,0,0,0
1126429,On field infrared thermography sensing for PV system efficiency assessment: Results and comparison with electrical models,2020,Mirco Muttillo and Iole Nardi and Vincenzo Stornelli and Tullio de Rubeis and Giovanni Pasqualoni and Dario Ambrosini,20,Sensors,4,1055,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The evaluation of photovoltaic (PV) system’s efficiency loss. due to the onset of faults that reduce the output power. is crucial. The challenge is to speed up the evaluation of electric efficiency by coupling the electric characterization of panels with information gathered from module diagnosis. amongst which the most commonly employed technique is thermographic inspection. The aim of this work is to correlate panels’ thermal images with their efficiency: a “thermal signature” of panels can be of help in identifying the fault typology and. moreover. for assessing efficiency loss. This allows to identify electrical power output losses without interrupting the PV system operation thanks to an advanced PV thermography characterization. In this paper. 12 faulted working panels were investigated. Their electrical models were implemented in MATLAB environment and developed to retrieve the ideal IV characteristic (from ratings). the actual (operative) IV characteristics and electric efficiency. Given the curves shape and relative difference. based on three reference points (namely. open circuit. short circuit. and maximum power points). faults’ typology has been evidenced. Information gathered from infrared thermography imaging. simultaneously carried out on panels during operation. were matched with those from electrical characterization. Panels’“thermal signature” has been coupled with the “electrical signature”. to obtain an overall depiction of panels’ health status.

The system. based on a general-purpose microcontroller and on a wireless sensors network. is able to fully control the thermal phenomena inside the chambers. as well as the heat flux that involves the specimen wall. Thanks to the continuous measurements of air and surfaces temperatures and energy input into the hot chamber. the thermal behavior of each hot box component is analyzed. A specific algorithm allows the post-process of the measured data for evaluating the specimen wall thermal quantities and for creating 2D and 3D thermal models of each component. The system reliability is tested on a real case represented by a double insulating X-lam wall. The results of the 72 h experiment show the system’s capability to maintain stable temperature set points inside the chambers and to log the temperatures measured by the 135 probes. allowing to know both the U-value of the sample (equal to 0.216±0.01 W/m 2 K) and the thermal models of all the hot box components. The U-value obtained via hot box method has been compared with the values gathered through theoretical calculation and heat flow meter measurements. showing differences of less than 20%. Finally. thanks to the data postprocessing. the 2D and 3D thermal models of the specimen wall and of the chambers have been recreated.

However. high electric fields can also deform and break up the drops. Under a high uniform electric field. a drop is usually a prolate spheroid. but it can also be of different forms such as a lamella penetrating into the continuous phase. or a drop with a flat surface on one side and a cone on the other side. The deformed drop shape depends greatly on the electrical conductivity. viscosity. surface tension and density of both liquid phases.

Using a three-phase direct contact heat exchanger instead of a surface type exchanger. such as a shell and tube heat exchanger. potentially makes the process more efficient and economic. This is because of its ability to work with a very low temperature driving force. as well as its low cost of construction. In this study. an experimental investigation of the heat transfer efficiency. and hence cost. of a three-phase direct contact condenser has been carried out utilising a short Perspex tube of 70 cm total height and 4 cm internal diameter. Only 48 cm was used for the direct contact condensation. Pentane vapour with three different initial temperatures (40 °C. 43.5 °C and 47.5 °C) was contacted with water with an inlet temperature of 19 °C.

Such plumes arise in e.g. industrial chimneys. where species can react and change the density of the plume material. These plumes with chemical reaction are the focus of this study. An integral model describing the behaviour of a plume undergoing a second-order chemical reaction between a component in the plume (A) and a component in the surrounding fluid (B). which alters the buoyancy flux. is considered. The behaviour of a reactive plume is shown to depend on four dimensionless groups: the volume and momentum fluxes at the source. the parameter ϵ which indicates the additional buoyancy flux generated by the reaction and γ which is a dimensionless rate of depletion of species B. Additionally. approximate analytical solutions are sought for a reactive plume rising from a point source of buoyancy when species B is in great excess. These analytical results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations. It is also shown that the behaviour of a reactive plume in the far field is equivalent to an inert plume issuing from a virtual source downstream of the real source. and the dependence of the location of the virtual source on ϵ and γ is discussed. The effects of varying the volume flux at the source and the Morton source parameter Γ0 are further investigated by solving the full governing equations numerically. These solutions indicate that ϵ is important in determining the buoyancy generated by the reaction …,True,QRVwJsgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,16,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/714178/,10226924452511718892,/scholar?cites=10226924452511718892,,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/714178/1/JFM-08-S-0475.R2%20Main%20Document.pdf,0,0,0

One example is an exothermic chemical reaction. which of course increases the local temperature of an unstirred reacting fluid and hence decreases the density. This can produce natural convection. Thus if the walls of the reactor are cooled. there is often toroidal motion in the reacting mixture and consequently enhanced mixing. Of course. the flow field depends on the shape of vessel. but usually natural convection moves fluid up the middle of the vessel and downwards near the cooler walls. Such convective motion influences. in turn. the temperature field and consequently local rates of reaction and heat release.

Cavitation inception marks the transition from single-phase to two-phase bubbly flow; choked cavitation marks the transition from two-phase bubbly flow to two-phase annular jet flow. It has been found that the inception of cavitation does not necessarily require that the minimum static pressure at the vena contracta downstream of the orifice. be equal to the vapour pressure liquid.

It is found that there is a dose-dependent relationship between viscosity and shear rate. viscosity reducing with radiation dose. this being related to polymer scissions via the action of radiation-induced free radicals. The dependency appears to become weaker at higher concentrations. possibly due to the contribution to viscosity from polymer …,True,BqlmeBEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969804309006393,5002705667369926070,/scholar?cites=5002705667369926070,,,0,0,0

The cavity remains attached to the sparger even in the presence of high liquid flow rates that would wash away a free slug bubble. Small bubbles are shed from the base of this cavity by the falling liquid film at the wall of the pipe and these bubbles are swept downwards forming a bubbly flow that is highly effective for mass transfer. The ventilated cavity is undesirable since it reduces the driving force for liquid circulation when the pipe is the downcomer of an external air loop fermenter or analogous gas/liquid reactors. The cavity also reduces the available interfacial area for mass transfer. It has been shown [Thorpe et al.. 1997.

A Wiley Company,The average velocity of isolated grains of sand was experimentally measured in smooth stratified flow in slightly declined pipes. Isolated particles in smooth stratified flow behave similarly to isolated particles propelled by both hydraulic conveying and intermittent gas/liquid flow. In all three cases. particle velocity is linear with respect to the average liquid velocity of the flow (or the average fluid velocity in the slug body for intermittent flow) and has a gradient of approximately one. The data in stratified flow are successfully correlated dimensionlessly (Eq. 7). The correlation is extrapolated to zero particle velocity to estimate the conditions required to ensure sand transport in a flowline in smooth stratified flow. The experimental results suggest that particle velocity is strongly governed by the size of a particle relative to the depth of the viscous sublayer at the pipe wall.

Transient Rayleigh numbers,1999,Ka Kheng Tan and Rex B Thorpe,54,Chemical Engineering Science,2,225-238,Pergamon,The onset of convection induced by transient heat conduction in deep fluid is examined for two boundary conditions. namely: fixed surface temperature (FST) and linear rate of change of surface temperature with respect to time (LTR). Transient Rayleigh numbers (Ra) for these boundary conditions are defined for each of the respective modes of heat transport. It is found that the onset of convection can be predicted from a maximum transient Ra if its corresponding Biot number (Bi) is known. Hence the critical times and critical depths for stable heat conduction in fluids are obtained. However. the Biot number for an interface in an unsteady-state experiment is difficult to determine.

The utilization of such LHSU is restricted by the poor conductivity of PCM. In the present work. a metal foam made of aluminium with PCM was used to produce a composite PCM as a thermal conductivity technique in PCM-LHSU and water was used as heat transfer fluid (HTF). An experimental investigation was carried out to evaluate the heat transfer characteristics of LHSU using pure PCM and composite PCM. The study included time-dependent visualization of the PCM during the melting and solidification processes. Besides. a thermocouple network was placed inside the heat storage to record the temperature profile during each process. Results showed that better performance could be obtained using composite PCM-LHSU for both melting and solidification processes. The melting time of composite PCM-LHSU was about 83% faster than that of a simple PCM-LHSU. and the percentage decreasing in the solidification time was about 85% due to the provision of metal foam.,True,Tvd0JdMAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,1,http://hit.alljournals.cn/html/jhit_cn/2020/1/20200105.html,15059605412761431038,/scholar?cites=15059605412761431038,,http://hit.alljournals.cn/html/jhit_cn/2020/1/20200105.html,0,0,0

The normal vertical motion of the bubbles due to buoyancy force leads to the entrainment of fluid from the shell side. thereby raising its velocity and turbulence level whilst improving the mix within the shell. Consequently. the thermal boundary layer that formed around the outer surface of the coil is disrupted. thus reducing heat transfer resistance and enhancing the heat transfer rate. Despite relatively considerable attention that has been given to assess this technique. numerous investigations have concentrated on only a few operational conditions. This consideration will be insufficient to understand the influence of air injection entirely on the thermal performance of a heat exchanger.

The variation of the thermal efficiency of the solar flat plate collector due to both different of the water flow rate and due to the air bubbles injection with air flow rates are evaluated. A new experimental procedure for injecting small air bubbles into the riser tubes of solar flat plate collector is proposed. The comparison between the effects of forced water flow rates and air bubbles injection on the solar flat plate thermal efficiencies with a variation of solar radiation intensity were investigated. Water and air flow rate were changed between 1.5-2.5 LPM with inlet water temperature ranged between 19-23.5 C. Observations showed that the injecting of air bubbles inside the solar flat plate tubes risers play key roles on the effect of thermal efficiency more than that of using the water flow rate without air bubbles injection. Small air bubbles injecting into the risers tubes of the flat solar collector causes enhancement of the thermal efficiency and it increased 3.5-5.25% depending on air flow rate.,True,5RVPclkAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Baqir2/publication/339935305_Effects_of_Air_Bubble_Injection_on_the_Efficiency_of_a_Flat_Plate_Solar_Collector_An_Experimental_Study_for_the_Open_Flow_System/links/5e7bbfe7299bf1a91b7a8259/Effects-of-Air-Bubble-Injection-on-the-Efficiency-of-a-Flat-Plate-Solar-Collector-An-Experimental-Study-for-the-Open-Flow-System.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Baqir2/publication/339935305_Effects_of_Air_Bubble_Injection_on_the_Efficiency_of_a_Flat_Plate_Solar_Collector_An_Experimental_Study_for_the_Open_Flow_System/links/5e7bbfe7299bf1a91b7a8259/Effects-of-Air-Bubble-Injection-on-the-Efficiency-of-a-Flat-Plate-Solar-Collector-An-Experimental-Study-for-the-Open-Flow-System.pdf,0,0,0

The dual PRO process. which has been previously suggested as efficient cycle for power generation. was used as stranded or reference power cycle. The assessment of the newly suggested PRO cycles was done based on the total water volume produced as permeate across a selective membrane and hence on the net power generated for an individual process. The results indicated that under the same operational conditions. the newly suggested PRO cycles were produced higher power than that produces by the standard one.

Experiments concerning the effects of air pollutants including red soil. ash. sand. calcium carbonate. and silica on the power generated are conducted and analyzed. The results show that the reduction in PV voltage and power is strongly depends on pollutant type and deposition level. The results show that the ash pollutant is the most effecting dust particle on the PV module voltage as compared to the other used dust pollutants.

In this study. the variation of the concentration of salt in a small experimental salinity gradient solar pond. consisting of the Upper Convective Zone (UCZ). Non-Convective Zone (NCZ) and Lower Convective Zone (LCZ). was investigated for 50 days. A model developed previously has been used to predict the temperature profiles of the UCZ and the LCZ. These profiles were compared with the temperature profiles obtained from the experimental pond. The experimental pond had a surface area of 1 m2 and layer thicknesses of 0.1. 0.5. and 0.4 m for the UCZ. NCZ and LCZ respectively. The pond was covered after 12 days with a 0.5 cm thin paraffin layer to suppress evaporation from the surface of the UCZ. The results indicated that the depth of the LCZ has a substantial effect on the stability of the layer and the entire pond; the deeper the LCZ more stable the pond. For the given dimensions of the solar pond considered in this study; the UCZ has to be replaced after about 50-60 days. The results also illustrated that the salt which accumulated in the UCZ due to diffusion during the 50 days was 4.1 kg/m2 of surface area. and this means that the annual average accumulation could be up to 29 kg/m2 year. A satisfactory agreement between the calculated and experimental temperatures was achieved for both the UCZ and the LCZ for the uncovered pond.

Determination of a functional relationship between the oxygen concentration in the air and meteorological parameters (temperature. pressure. humidity) in open areas.Methodology. The functional relationship between the oxygen concentration in the air and meteorological parameters is established on the basis of experimental gas laws. Approximating functions of the oxygen volume concentration changing in the air are obtained using mathematical statistics methods. The correction for the determination of the excess air ratio was determined on the basis of the theory of errors. Forecasting the oxygen volume concentration in the air was carried out on the basis of the inverse functional dependence established by means of the discrete Fourier transform.Findings. Approaches to measuring and predicting the oxygen volume concentration in the air based on meteorological parameters are substantiated.Originality. A method has been developed for determining the air gas concentration based on meteorological parameters of the environment. The method for determining the excess air ratio as an informative parameter for controlling the fuel combustion has been improved. A method for predicting the oxygen volume concentration in the air based on the discrete Fourier transform is proposed.Practical value. Technical solutions are proposed and new methods and means of measuring the oxygen volume concentration in the air are developed. including those for improving the accuracy of determining the excess air ratio during the fuel burning in boilers.

Наиболее общим подходом. обеспечивающим выполнение вышеприведенных требований. является доказательство однородности результатов измерений. полученных в различных лабораториях. в различное время. в различных условиях. различными методами и разными операторами. Особенностью проверки однородности результатов измерений в испытательных лабораториях (особенно при аналитических испытаниях) является ограниченное количество результатов (до 10-15). что приводит к определенным трудностям выбора и использования критериев однородности. Одними из наиболее мощных критериев проверки однородности независимых выборок являются критерий Фишера для проверки однородности дисперсий и критерий Стьюдента для проверки однородности математических ожиданий. Из литературных источников [2. 3] известно. что мощность критерия Фишера определяется степенью приближения закона распределения выборок к гауссовскому. Поэтому. использование данного критерия сопряжено с дополнительной проблемой идентификации закона распределения выборки и. в случае отличия закона распределения от гауссовского. использования модифицированных. робастных критериев.

У процесі життя і господарської діяльності збільшується використання людиною компонентів природи. внаслідок чого посилюється «тиск» на навколишнє природне середовище (НПС). В таких умовах постає важливе завдання-забезпечити раціональне використання природних ресурсів та охорону довкілля. Саме тому однією з основних задач державної політики має стати збереження природних комплексів. біологічного та ландшафтного різноманіття. створення нових і розширення меж існуючих об’єктів природно-заповідного фонду. а також розробка цільових програм з екологізації існуючих видів туристичної діяльності та заходів переходу туризму до раціонального природокористування [1].,True,eF9wJ-MAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC,5,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6522985265781062361&hl=en&oi=scholarr,6522985265781062361,/scholar?cites=6522985265781062361,,,0,0,0

Сучасний етап розвитку технологій. які застосовуються в енергетичному виробництві. характеризується суттєвим збільшення інформаційного обміну між всіма елементами енергосистеми на всіх її ієрархічних рівнях. Електроенергетичні системи (ЕС) розвинутих країн світу переходять до використання інтелектуальних мереж. побудованих на основі концепції Smart Grid. що ставить нові вимоги і перед засобами забезпечення надійності як енергосистеми в цілому. так і її компонентів. З’являється необхідність у формуванні цілісної багаторівневої системи керування. яка забезпечує високий рівень автоматизації та надійності всієї ЕС. охоплює виробників електроенергії. передавальні та розподільчі мережі. споживачів.

В результате вредные выбросы концентрируются под слоем инверсии у поверхности земли. образуя фотохимический туман (смог).

У монографії розглядаються теоретичні засади створення систем функціональної діагностики для контролю і діагностування теплоенергетичного устаткування в процесі його експлуатації. джерелом інформації в яких є шумові сигнали. що виникають у результаті природного функціонування об’єктів. Шумові сигнали є наслідком механічних. аеродинамічних. гідродинамічних і трибомеханічних процесів. що супроводжують роботу вузлів теплоенергетичного обладнання. і проявляються у вигляді акустичного. магнітного. електричного. теплового шуму або широкосмугових вібрацій. Більшість сучасних пасивних систем функціональної діагностики базується на кореляційно-спектральних методах статистичного аналізу діагностичних сигналів. які є вичерпними для гауссівських сигналів. Однак аналіз результатів теоретичних і експериментальних досліджень показав. що шумові сигнали. як правило. є негауссівськими випадковими процесами і часто мають рівномірну спектральну щільність. Це обмежує можливості існуючих пасивних систем діагностики. заснованих на методах кореляційного і спектрального аналізу.

Теплова енергетика України у ХХІ столітті опинилася перед необхідністю вирішення проблеми ресурсного забезпечення. Колись найдешевше паливо–природний газ–перейшло до розряду дефіцитних. за песимістичними прогнозами вичерпання його світових запасів прогнозується вже в 2040-2050 роках. Внаслідок цього має місце стійка тенденція зростання вартості природного газу. а відповідно теплової та електричної енергії. Зменшення дефіциту природного газу за рахунок використання традиційних викопних палив також має свої обмеження через зростання вимог до зменшення викидів в атмосферу парникових газів.Одним з перспективних напрямів розвитку світової енергетики є використання відновлюваних джерел енергії. що знімає ряд обмежень. пов’язаних з використанням традиційних палив. Відновлювана енергетика сьогодні одна з галузей світової енергетики. яка найбільш стрімко розвивається. Згідно Директив Європейської комісії до 2020 року частка відновлюваних джерел енергії в ЄС має підвищитись до 20%. При цьому кількість викидів парникових газів має зменшитись щонайменше на 20%(в порівнянні з рівнем 1990 року). а ефективність використання енергії має збільшитись на 20%.,True,NBMesWkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://faks.kpi.ua/attachments/article/865/%D0%97%D0%B1%D1%96%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%94%D0%BD%D1%96%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%90%D0%95%D0%94_2018.pdf#page=68,,,,https://faks.kpi.ua/attachments/article/865/%D0%97%D0%B1%D1%96%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%94%D0%BD%D1%96%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%90%D0%95%D0%94_2018.pdf#page=68,0,0,0

ГЄ Пухова НАН України,Предприятия топливно-энергетического комплекса наряду с автомобильным транспортом следует отнести к основным источникам техногенного загрязнения атмосферы в крупных городах [1]. Тепловые электростанции активно способствуют усилению парникового эффекта и выпадению кислотных осадков. При определенных погодных условиях в приземном слое воздуха концентрируются большие скопления вредных газообразных и аэрозольных примесей. Чаще всего это связано с явлением инверсии: непосредственно над источниками газопылевой эмиссии более холодный слой воздуха располагается под теплым. что препятствует перемешиванию воздушных масс и задерживает перемещение примесей вверх. В результате вредные выбросы концентрируются под слоем инверсии у поверхности земли. образуя фотохимический туман (смог). Фотохимический смог возникает в результате фотохимических реакций при наличии нескольких условий: высокой концентрации оксидов азота. углеводородов и других загрязнителей. интенсивной солнечной радиации и безветренной погоды.

Covalent binding of CS to the magnetite surface proceeds using a free -CH2OH group of CS and a NH2-group of magnetite with epichlorohydrin (ECH) as a cross-linker. The obtained nanocomposites were functionalized by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-groups. Composites were characterized by elemental analysis. FTIR. XPS and ASAP methods. The total content of organic phase (CS-DTPA) in the hybrid material. appreciated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). was 3.7%. Considering the atomic ratio between oxygen in CS and oxygen in ECH residue. the chemical structure of the hybrid material is proposed.

A degree of consensus for indicating how far a particular group of individuals is from consensus may be therefore very useful. We propose a new measure (degree) of consensus which is more human-consistent in the sense that it better reflects a real human perception of the essence of consensus in practice. Basically. our consensus measure expresses the degree to which. say. ‘most of the important individuals agree as to (their testimonies concerning) almost all of the relevant options’. The point of departure is the set of individual testimonies which are here the individual fuzzy preference relations.

They differ both by their motivations and their underlying mathematical structure. Furthermore. Atanassov's construct is isomorphic to interval-valued fuzzy sets and other similar notions. even if their interpretive settings and motivation are quite different. the latter capturing the idea of ill-known membership grade. while the former starts from the idea of evaluating degrees of membership and non-membership independently.

A metaheuristic is a generic algorithmic template that can be used for finding high quality solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. To arrive at a functioning algorithm. a metaheuristic needs to be configured: typically some modules need to be instantiated and some parameters need to be tuned. I call these two problems"" structural"" and"" parametric"" tuning. respectively. More generally. I refer to the combination of the two problems as"" tuning"".Tuning is crucial to metaheuristic optimization both in academic research and for practical applications.

One of the intermediate goals of the European Green Course is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50-55% by 2030. compared to 1990 levels. To this end. the document provides for the development and implementation of a number of tools. including the border carbon adjustment mechanism. The need for a European eco-tax was first discussed by the EC in 1991 in preparation for the signing of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. At the time. it was a European energy tax on energy. which aimed to regulate CO2 emissions by refusing to invest in polluting production methods. To implement this proposal. various measures were considered-grants. incentives to invest in the development of low-carbon technologies. energy efficiency. etc. This was the traditional EU approach of introducing environmental taxes combined with incentive regulation. However. some EU member states opposed it and the initiative was rejected.[1] The EGD provides an action plan to 1) boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean. circular economy; 2) restore biodiversity and cut pollution. The plan outlines the investments needed and financing tools available. It explains how to ensure a just and inclusive transition. The EU aims to be climate neutral in 2050.

Для решения задачи обнаружения утечек жидкости в трубопроводе в процессе его эксплуатации широкие возможности имеют методы акустического контактного течеискания [2–7]. Акустический сигнал утечки искажается шумами. создаваемыми движущимся потоком жидкости. поэтому задача обнаружения утечек в трубопроводах сводится к задаче обнаружения шумового сигнала утечки на фоне шумовой помехи. В настоящее время решение этой задачи базируется. как правило. на методах корреляционно-спектрального анализа. которые являются исчерпывающими. если считать. что сигнал и помеха имеют гауссовское распределение мгновенных значений.

In the first part. the SST of the Niño-3 region has been used to select extreme cold and warm ENSO events and periods that can be regarded as normal. The study was carried out for winter with the constraints that the ENSO events were well developed during the winter of study. and that they are extreme events.

A reconstruction of rainfall characteristics in Southern Spain from 1500 to the present is described. Weather information was taken from original documentary sources in the region. A numerical index was established to characterize the rainfall and its evolution. Results were calibrated with modern precipitation data and with the results of other studies of historical climate. The main objective is to obtain a long precipitation record. A preliminary analysis of the obtained series shows a fluctuating behavior with alternating dry and wet periods. The wettest periods occurred at the end of 16th century. the beginning of 17th century. and at the end of 19th century.

Ltd.,In this work a long rainfall series in Andalusia (southern Spain) is analysed. Methods of historical climatology were used to reconstruct a 500‐year series from historical sources. Different statistical tools were used to detect and characterize significant changes in this series. Results indicate rainfall fluctuations. without abrupt changes. in the following alternating dry and wet phases: 1501–1589 dry. 1590–1649 wet. 1650–1775 dry. 1776‐1937 wet and 1938–1997 dry. Possible causal mechanisms are discussed. emphasizing the important contribution of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) to rainfall variability in the region. Solar activity is discussed in relation to the Maunder Minimum period. and finally the past and present are compared.

An efficient use of this fluctuating energy source requires reliable forecast information for management and operation strategies. Due to the strong increase of solar power generation the prediction of solar yields becomes more and more important. As a consequence. in the last years various research organisations and companies have developed different methods to forecast irradiance as a basis for respective power forecasts. For the end-users of these forecasts it is important that standardized methodology is used when presenting results on the accuracy of a prediction model in order to get a clear idea on the advantages of a specific approach. In this paper we introduce a benchmarking procedure to asses the accuracy of irradiance forecasts and compare different approaches of forecasting. The evaluation shows a strong dependence of the forecast accuracy on the climatic conditions.

Temporal modes of variability of the NAO and temperatures are analysed using wavelet transform. Results show that the NAO presents a strong non-stationary behaviour. The most important feature is the existence of a quasi-periodic oscillation. with a period between 6–10 years and maximum amplitude of eight years. during the periods 1842–1868 and 1964–1994. Between 1875 and 1939 the spectra of the NAO is almost white. The possible relationship between the occurrence of extreme events of the NAO and its spectral behaviour has been analysed.

Two main problems arise in the use of remote sensing data for evaluation of LST. These are the atmospheric effect and the land emissivity effect.

It offers interesting characteristics for surface solar radiation and numerical weather modeling applications. However. most of the validation efforts so far have focused on Level-2 products and only rarely on Level 3. In this contribution. we compare the Level-3 Collection 5.1 MODIS AOD dataset from the Terra satellite available since 2000 against observed daily AOD values at 550 nm from more than 500 AERONET ground stations around the globe. Overall. the mean error of the dataset is 0.03 (17%. relative to the mean ground-observed AOD). with a root mean square error of 0.14 (73%. relative to the same). but these errors are also found highly dependent on geographical region. We propose new functions for the expected error of the Level-3 AOD. as well as for both its mean error and its standard deviation. Additionally. we investigate the role of pixel count vis-à-vis the reliability of the AOD estimates. and also explore to what extent the spatial aggregation from Level 2 to Level 3 influences the total uncertainty in the Level-3 AOD.

A case study is conducted for the region of Andalusia in Spain. To this end. spatiotemporal variability of modeled CSP and wind capacity factors in a 3-km spatial resolution grid were analyzed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Results reveal that renewable baseload power can be obtained in the study region by locating wind farms and CSP plants using balancing patterns derived from CCA and PCA.

Accurate forecasts of wind generation are therefore paramount for reducing such penalties and thus maximizing revenue.

1127205,Estimation of the uncertainty in wind power forecasting,2006,Pierre Pinson,,,,,,Wind power experiences a tremendous development in Europe. Though. the intermittence of wind generation causes difficulties in the management of power systems. Moreover. in the context of the deregulation of electricity markets. wind energy is penalized by its intermittent nature. It is recognized today that the forecasting of wind power for horizons up to 2/3-day ahead eases the integration of wind generation. Wind power forecasts are traditionally provided in the form of point predictions. which correspond to the most-likely power production for a given horizon. That sole information is not sufficient for developing optimal management or trading strategies. Therefore. we investigate on possible ways for estimating the uncertainty of wind power forecasts. The characteristics of the prediction uncertainty are described by a thorough study of the performance of some of the state-of-the-art approaches. and by underlining the influence of some variables e.g. level of predicted power on distributions of prediction errors. Then. a generic method for the estimation of prediction intervals is introduced. This statistical method is non-parametric and utilizes fuzzy logic concepts for integrating expertise on the prediction uncertainty characteristics. By estimating several prediction intervals at once. one obtains predictive distributions of wind power output. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of its reliability. sharpness and resolution. In parallel. we explore the potential use of ensemble predictions for skill forecasting. Wind power ensemble forecasts are obtained either by converting meteorological ensembles (from ECMWF and NCEP) to power or by …,True,8Ai6cssAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,271,https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00002187/,2317572160594779763,/scholar?cites=2317572160594779763,,https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00002187/file/Pinson_PhDThesis.pdf,0,0,0

This paper investigates the optimal bidding strategy for battery storage in power markets. Battery storage could increase its profitability by providing fast regulation service under a performance-based regulation mechanism. which better exploits a battery's fast ramping capability. However. battery life might be decreased by frequent charge-discharge cycling. especially when providing fast regulation service. It is profitable for battery storage to extend its service life by limiting its operational strategy to some degree. Thus. we incorporate a battery cycle life model into a profit maximization model to determine the optimal bids in day-ahead energy. spinning reserve. and regulation markets.

A community can also be formed by prosumers who want to collaborate. or in terms of operational energy management.

Given significant uncertainties involved in wind generation. probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks facing system operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated confidence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods.

1127210,Evaluating the quality of scenarios of short-term wind power generation,2012,Pierre Pinson and Robin Girard,96,Applied Energy,,12-20,Elsevier,Scenarios of short-term wind power generation are becoming increasingly popular as input to multistage decision-making problems e.g. multivariate stochastic optimization and stochastic programming. The quality of these scenarios is intuitively expected to substantially impact the benefits from their use in decision-making. So far however. their verification is almost always focused on their marginal distributions for each individual lead time only. thus overlooking their temporal interdependence structure. The shortcomings of such an approach are discussed. Multivariate verification tools. as well as diagnostic approaches based on event-based verification are then presented.

A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation. when only power and meteorological measurements are available. without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution of forecast errors do not follow any of the common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities. i.e.. for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead. with fast frequency updates.

Ltd.,The article introduces a new methodology for assessing on‐line the prediction risk of short‐term wind power forecasts. The first stage of this methodology consists in computing confidence intervals with a confidence level defined by the end‐user. The resampling approach is used. which. in contrast to existing methods for wind forecasting. does not need to make a restrictive hypothesis on the distribution of the errors. To account for the non‐linearity of the power curve and the cut‐off effect. the errors are classified using appropriate fuzzy sets. The confidence intervals are then fine‐tuned to reduce their width in the case of stable weather conditions. For this purpose an appropriate index. called the ‘meteo‐risk index’ (MRI). is defined reflecting the spread of the available numerical weather predictions. A linear relation between that index and the resulting prediction error is shown.

1127232,A multicriteria decision aid methodology for sorting decision problems: The case of financial distress,1999,Constantin Zopounidis and Michael Doumpos,14,Computational Economics,3,197-218,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Sorting problems constitute a major part of real world decisions. where a set of alternative actions (solutions) must be classified into two or more predefined classes. Multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) provides several methodologies. which are well adapted in sorting problems. A well known approach in MCDA is based on preference disaggregation which has already been used in ranking problems. but it is also applicable in sorting problems. The UTADIS (UTilités Additives DIScriminantes) method. a variant of the UTA method. based on the preference disaggregation approach estimates a set of additive utility functions and utility profiles using linear programming techniques in order to minimize the misclassification error between the predefined classes in sorting problems.

The results indicate that less cost efficient banks. with higher than average levels of provisions relatively to their income. and lower liquidity tend to have lower ratings. Larger and more profitable banks tend to obtain higher ratings. Higher equity to assets ratio results in higher ratings only when we do not control for bank supervision and regulations.

1127235,A multicriteria classification approach based on pairwise comparisons,2004,Michael Doumpos and Constantin Zopounidis,158,European Journal of Operational Research,2,378-389,North-Holland,Classification refers to the assignment of a set of alternatives into predefined homogenous classes. Most of the existing classification methodologies are based on absolute comparisons among the alternatives and some reference profiles (cut-off points) that discriminate the classes. This paper proposes a new approach that involves pairwise comparisons based on the multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) paradigm. The basis of the methodology is a preference relation that is used to perform pairwise comparisons among the alternatives. The criteria weights used to construct the preference relation are specified using a reference set of alternatives (training sample) on the basis of linear programming techniques.,True,TncjXE0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,180,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221703004909,5709499062654073205,/scholar?cites=5709499062654073205,,,0,0,0

The former issue is addressed by classifying the firms seeking credit into homogeneous groups representing different levels of credit risk. Classification/discrimination procedures commonly employed for such purposes include statistical and econometric techniques. This paper explores the performance of the M.H.DIS method (Multi-group Hierarchical DIScrimination). an alternative approach that originates from multicriteria decision aid (MCDA).

Within the recent financial turmoil. bank rating has become extremely important. Typically. bank rating is performed through empirical procedures that combine financial and qualitative data into an overall performance index. This paper presents a case study on the implementation of a multicriteria approach to bank rating.

1127239,Measuring customer satisfaction using a collective preference disaggregation model,1998,Yannis Siskos and Evangelos Grigoroudis and Constantin Zopounidis and Olivier Saurais,12,Journal of Global Optimization,2,175-195,Kluwer Academic Publishers,A new model to assess customer satisfaction is developed through this paper. The proposed model is based on the principles of multicriteria analysis. using ordinal regression techniques. The procedure uses survey's data on customer satisfaction criteria and disaggregates simultaneously all the global satisfaction judgments via a linear programming disaggregation formulation. The model provides collective global and partial satisfaction functions as well as average satisfaction indices. These results sufficiently describe customer behavior and they can be used in the strategic planning of an organization. The implementation of the model in three real world applications is used for illustration and for testing the model's reliability.

The main characteristic and a major advantage of the system is the incorporation into its model base of four MCDA methods originating from the preference-disaggregation approach. namely the UTADIS method (UTilités Additives DIScriminantes) and three of its variants. referred to as UTADIS I. UTADIS II and UTADIS III. Using these methods. the decision maker (DM) can develop interactively powerful additive utility models to sort a set of alternatives into two or more predefined classes as accurately as possible. based on different sorting techniques.

A sample of acquired firms and a sample of equivalent non-acquired firms are considered and the objective is to create patterns which would be able to distinguish between the two classes of firms. based upon differences in their financial characteristics (financial ratios). For this purpose. the rough set approach is used. The information about the firms is organized in a financial information table. In this table. financial characteristics of the firms correspond to condition attributes and the classification is defined by a decision attribute telling if a firm has been acquired or not.

Especially in emerging economies. predicting the future financial situation of individual corporate entities is even more significant. bearing in mind the general economic turmoil that can be caused by business failures. The research on developing quantitative financial distress prediction models has been focused on building discriminant models distinguishing healthy firms from financially distressed ones. Following this discrimination approach. this paper explores the applicability of a new non–parametric multicriteria decision aid discrimination method. called MH DIS. to predict financial distress using data concerning the case of Greece. A comparison with discriminant and logit analysis is performed using both a basic and a holdout sample. The results show that MH DIS can be considered as a new alternative tool for financial distress prediction. Its performance is superior to discriminant analysis and comparable to logit analysis (JEL G33. C61. C44.
