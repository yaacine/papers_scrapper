To search on a genome‐wide basis for genes under the direct control of Spo0A. we used chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with gene microarray analysis to identify regions of the chromosome at which an activated form of Spo0A binds in vivo. This information in combination with transcriptional profiling using gene microarrays. gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. using the DNA‐binding domain of Spo0A. and bioinformatics enabled us to assign 103 genes to the Spo0A regulon in addition to 18 previously known members.

Using cells in which the synthesis of Spo0A was under the control of an inducible promoter or in which production of the regulatory protein was impaired by a promoter mutation. we found that sporulation required a high (threshold) level of Spo0A and that many genes in the regulon differentially responded to high and low doses of the regulator. We distinguished four categories of genes. as follows: (i) those that required a high level of Spo0A to be activated. (ii) those that required a high level of Spo0A to be repressed. (iii) those that were activated at a low level of the regulator. and (iv) those that were repressed at a low dose of the regulator.

122606,The program of gene transcription for a single differentiating cell type during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis,2004,Patrick Eichenberger and Masaya Fujita and Shane T Jensen and Erin M Conlon and David Z Rudner and Stephanie T Wang and Caitlin Ferguson and Koki Haga and Tsutomu Sato and Jun S Liu and Richard Losick,2,,10,e328,Public Library of Science,Asymmetric division during sporulation by Bacillus subtilis generates a mother cell that undergoes a 5-h program of differentiation. The program is governed by a hierarchical cascade consisting of the transcription factors: σE. σK. GerE. GerR. and SpoIIID. The program consists of the activation and repression of 383 genes. The σE factor turns on 262 genes. including those for GerR and SpoIIID. These DNA-binding proteins downregulate almost half of the genes in the σE regulon. In addition. SpoIIID turns on ten genes. including genes involved in the appearance of σK. Next. σK activates 75 additional genes. including that for GerE. This DNA-binding protein. in turn. represses half of the genes that had been activated by σK while switching on a final set of 36 genes. Evidence is presented that repression and activation contribute to proper morphogenesis. The program of gene expression is driven forward by its hierarchical organization and by the repressive effects of the DNA-binding proteins. The logic of the program is that of a linked series of feed-forward loops. which generate successive pulses of gene transcription. Similar regulatory circuits could be a common feature of other systems of cellular differentiation.,True,WGNJsS4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,382,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020328,11183912197911847015,/scholar?cites=11183912197911847015,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020328,0,0,0

Spo0A. a member of the response regulator family of gene-control proteins. is activated by phosphorylation via a multicomponent phosphorelay in response to conditions of nutrient limitation. We now report that sporulation can be triggered with high efficiency in cells in the exponential phase of growth in rich medium by artificial induction of the synthesis of any one of three histidine kinases that feed phosphoryl groups into the relay. We further show that the levels of Spo0A protein and activity increase gradually over the first 2 h of sporulation both under conditions of nutrient limitation and in response to induction of kinase synthesis.

H2O2. desiccation. chemical disinfection. or starvation. Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032 survives standard decontamination procedures of the Jet Propulsion Lab spacecraft assembly facility. and both spores and vegetative cells of this strain exhibit elevated resistance to UV radiation and H2O2 compared to other Bacillus species.Principal FindingsThe genome of B. pumilus SAFR-032 was sequenced and annotated. Lists of genes relevant to DNA repair and the oxidative stress response were generated and compared to B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. Differences in conservation of genes. gene order. and protein sequences are highlighted because they potentially explain the extreme resistance phenotype of B. pumilus. The B. pumilus genome includes genes not found in B. subtilis or B. licheniformis and conserved genes with sequence divergence. but paradoxically lacks several genes that function in UV or H2O2 resistance in other Bacillus species.SignificanceThis study identifies several candidate genes for further research into UV and H2O2 resistance.

Spo0A is traditionally viewed as the master regulator for entry into development. We now report that Spo0A continues to function after the initiation phase of sporulation and that it becomes a cell-specific transcription factor when the sporangium is divided into a mother cell and forespore.

Anchoring is mediated by RacA. which acts as a bridge between a centromere-like element in the vicinity of the origin of replication and the cell pole. To define this element we mapped RacA binding sites by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation in conjunction with gene microarray analysis. RacA preferentially bound to 25 regions spread over 612 kb across the origin portion of the chromosome. Computational and biochemical analysis identified a GC-rich. inverted 14 bp repeat as the recognition sequence.

122613,An investigation into the compartmentalization of the sporulation transcription factor σE in Bacillus subtilis,2002,Masaya Fujita and Richard Losick,43,Molecular microbiology,1,27-38,Blackwell Science Ltd.,Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis involves the formation of a polar septum. which divides the sporangium into a mother cell and a forespore. The σE factor. which is encoded within the spoIIG operon. is a cell‐specific regulatory protein that directs gene transcription in the mother cell. σE is synthesized as an inactive proprotein pro‐σE. which is converted to the mature factor by the putative processing enzyme SpoIIGA. Processing of pro‐σE does not commence until after asymmetric division when σE is largely confined to the mother cell. Processing depends on the signalling protein SpoIIR. which delays proteolysis until after polar septation. but the mechanism by which σE is confined to the mother cell is not understood. Previous work favoured a model in which pro‐σE localizes to the mother cell face of the polar septum. such that σE would be selectively released into mother cell cytoplasm.

To account for the asymmetry in the electron charge density that arises from lone pairs. an electrostatic model is developed that is parametrically anisotropic at the atomic level. The model uses virtual interaction sites with partial charges that are associated but not coincident with the nuclei. In addition. the model incorporates anisotropic atomic polarizabilities. The protocol previously outlined in Anisimov et al. [J. Chem.

Changes in the saturation of hemoglobin S with carbon monoxide produced by varying the intensity of a photolytic laser beam were used to simulate changes in the saturation of oxyhemoglobin S produced by variations in oxygen pressure. The presence of polymer at steady-state saturation with carbon monoxide was determined by measurement of the kinetics of gelation after complete photodissociation. The kinetics are a very sensitive probe for polymer since small amounts of polymerized hemoglobin increase the rate of nucleation sufficiently to eliminate the delay period. First. the equilibrium gelation properties of partially photodissociated carbonmonoxyhemoglobin S were shown to be the same as partially oxygenated hemoglobin S …,True,yAE__g8AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,235,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/237/4814/500.abstract,8557353326880757708,/scholar?cites=8557353326880757708,,,0,0,0

Over the years. cooperative oxygen binding has been explained by different models predicting that the T state of hemoglobin binds oxygen either noncooperatively or with some degree of cooperativity or with strong cooperativity. Therefore. a critical test that discriminates among models is to determine the oxygen binding by the T state of hemoglobin. Fixation of hemoglobin in the T state has been achieved either by crystallization from polyethylene glycol solutions or by encapsulation in wet porous silica gels. Hemoglobin crystals bind oxygen noncooperatively with reduced affinity compared with solution. with no Bohr effect and with no influence of other allosteric effectors.

It is involved in regulating the expression of a number of key beta-cell genes as well as somatostatin. It also plays a pivotal part in the development of the pancreas and islet cell ontogeny. Thus homozygous disruption of the gene in mice and humans results in pancreatic agenesis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene result in impaired glucose tolerance and symptoms of diabetes as seen in MODY4 and late-onset Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.

Recent transcriptome-wide analysis of AS using RNA sequencing has revealed that AS is highly pervasive in plants. Pre-mRNAs from over 60% of intron-containing genes undergo AS to produce a vast repertoire of mRNA isoforms. The functions of most splice variants are unknown. However. emerging evidence indicates that splice variants increase the functional diversity of proteins. Furthermore. AS is coupled to transcript stability and translation through nonsense-mediated decay and microRNA-mediated gene regulation.

In Xenopus laevis a major ultrastructural change in the envelope at fertilization is the appearance of an electron-dense layer. termed the F layer. between the envelope and the inner-most jelly coat layer. J1. The F layer is derived. at least in part. from materials released from the cortical granules. Further definition of the origin and chemical nature of the F layer was sought by using isolated cortical granule (CG) exudate and jelly coat layer J1. In double diffusion experiments. the isolated components interacted in an agglutination reaction producing a band of precipitation.

Both the jelly coat layers and egg envelopes are required for fertilization in anurans.

The envelope forms differ in their ultrastructures. macromolecular compositions. and cellular functions. After the oocyte is released from the ovary. conversion of one envelope form to another is brought about by factors secreted by the oviduct prior to fertilization and by factors released from the egg in the sperm‐triggered cortical reaction.

The Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) play a key role in this metabolic shift by regulating the transcription of key enzymes of glucose metabolism. Here we show that oxygen regulates the expression of the muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1). Hypoxic GYS1 induction requires HIF activity and a Hypoxia Response Element within its promoter. GYS1 gene induction correlated with a significant increase in glycogen synthase activity and glycogen accumulation in cells exposed to hypoxia. Significantly. knockdown of either HIF1α or GYS1 attenuated hypoxia-induced glycogen accumulation. while GYS1 overexpression was sufficient to mimic this effect. Altogether. these results indicate that GYS1 regulation by HIF plays a central role in the hypoxic accumulation of glycogen. Importantly. we found that hypoxia also upregulates the expression of UTP:glucose-1-phosphate urydylyltransferase (UGP2) and 1.4-α glucan branching enzyme (GBE1). two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen. Therefore. hypoxia regulates almost all the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism in a coordinated fashion. leading to its accumulation. Finally. we demonstrated that abrogation of glycogen synthesis. by knock-down of GYS1 expression. impairs hypoxic preconditioning. suggesting a physiological role for the glycogen accumulated during chronic hypoxia.

PTEN tumor suppressor or PIK3CA oncogene mutations both direct PI3K-dependent tumorigenesis largely through activation of the AKT/PKB kinase. However. here we show through phosphoprotein profiling and functional genomic studies that many PIK3CA mutant cancer cell lines and human breast tumors exhibit only minimal AKT activation and a diminished reliance on AKT for anchorage-independent growth. Instead. these cells retain robust PDK1 activation and membrane localization and exhibit dependency on the PDK1 substrate SGK3. SGK3 undergoes PI3K- and PDK1-dependent activation in PIK3CA mutant cancer cells. Thus. PI3K may promote cancer through both AKT-dependent and AKT-independent mechanisms.

In xenograft experiments. overexpression of INPP4B resulted in reduced tumor growth. INPP4B preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-3.4-bisphosphate (PI(3.4)P2) with no effect on phosphatidylinositol-3.4.5-triphosphate (PI(3.4.5)P3). suggesting that PI(3.4)P2 and PI(3.4.5)P3 may cooperate in Akt activation and cell transformation.

In this study. we examined the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). a putative mediator of insulin actions. in the stimulation of hexose uptake in response to hormone and contraction. Phosphatidylinositol 3.4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3.4.5-triphosphate accumulate in skeletal muscle exposed to insulin but not hypoxia. which mimics stimulation of the contractile-dependent pathway of hexose transport activation. The fungal metabolite wortmannin. an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. completely blocks the appearance of 3′-phospholipids in response to insulin. Moreover. wortmannin entirely prevented the increase in hexose uptake in muscle exposed to insulin but was without effect on muscle stimulated by repetitive contraction or hypoxia.

Using a pharmacological and genetic approach. we show that the amount of PI 3-kinase associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins inversely correlates with the amount of PI 3-kinase lipid products present in the cell. An explanation for this observation is provided by our finding that phosphatidyl inositol (3.4.5)trisphosphate (Ptdlns [3.4.5]P3) binds directly and selectively to the SH2 domains of the 85 kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase and thereby blocks binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The SH2 domain of pp60c-src also specifically bound Ptdlns (3.4.5)P3. and the binding was competed by a phosphopeptide specific for the Src SH2 domain.

Pregnenolone sulfate. a neurosteroid. specifically enhances NMDA-gated currents in spinal cord neurons. while inhibiting receptors for the inhibitory amino acids glycine and ‘y-aminobutyric acid. as well as non-NMDA glutamate receptors. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that neurosteroids such as pregnenolone sulfate are involved in regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system.L-Glutamate is thought to be the major excitatory neuro-transmitter in the CNS. Two major pharmacological classes of glutamate-gated ion channels have been identified. NMDA receptors respond preferentially to the synthetic aspartate analog NMDA. whereas non-NMDA receptors respond preferentially to kainate and AMPA. NMDA receptors have attracted particular attention by virtue of their proposed role in long term potentiation(1). learning(2). hypoxic neuronal damage. and epilepsy(3).,True,fGyiCmEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,634,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Farb/publication/21500247_Pregnenolone_sulfate_A_positive_allosteric_modulator_at_the_N-methyl-D-aspartate_receptor/links/55f9e0e008aeba1d9f22a2b2.pdf,10406706491477924125,/scholar?cites=10406706491477924125,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Farb/publication/21500247_Pregnenolone_sulfate_A_positive_allosteric_modulator_at_the_N-methyl-D-aspartate_receptor/links/55f9e0e008aeba1d9f22a2b2.pdf,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,The γ‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor represents an elementary switching mechanism integral to the functioning of the central nervous system and a locus for the action of many mood‐and emotion‐altering agents such as benzodiazepines. barbiturates. steroids. and alcohol. Anxiety. sleep disorders. and convulsive disorders have been effectively treated with therapeutic agents that enhance the action of GABA at the GABAA receptor or increase the concentration of GABA in nervous tissue. The GABAA receptor is a multimeric membrane‐spanning ligand‐gated ion channel that admits chloride upon binding of the neurotransmitter GABA and is modulated by many endogenous and therapeutically important agents. Since GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. modulation of its response has profound implications for brain functioning.

We show here that in voltage-clamped neurons progesterone(1 0-i 00 zM) itself enhances GABA-induced chloride currents but. surprisingly. antagonizes those induced by glycine. Some. but not all. progesterone metabolites also display these effects. The effects of progesterone on GABA and glycine responses are dose dependent. with EC50 values of 26 and 16 M and maxima of+ 156 and _60%. respectively. Progesterone and its reduced metabolite 5a-pregnan-3a-ol-20-one potentiate GABA responses by acting through a common site. The site through which progesterone acts to inhibit glycine responses is distinct from the strychnine and glycine binding sites. These results not only provide an important distinction between chloride-mediated GABA and glycine responses but also suggest that endogenous progesterone or its metabolites may differentially modulate the inhibitory actions of these two neurotransmitters.GABA and glycine. two major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the vertebrate central nervous system. mediate fast synaptic inhibition via the activation of receptor-linked chloride ionophores (1. 2). Receptors for these two neurotransmitters share many properties(3-6) and are considered members of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels(7-9). However. the differences in the pharmacology of these channels indicate that the glycine receptor and the GABAA receptor are separate molecules (10).,True,fGyiCmEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,265,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.860.55&rep=rep1&type=pdf,17024180749354719584,/scholar?cites=17024180749354719584,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.860.55&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

122766,Sight-reading,2002,Andreas C Lehmann and Victoria McArthur,,The science and psychology of music performance,,135-150,,From a psychological viewpoint. sight-reading involves perception (decoding note patterns). kinesthetics (executing motor programs). memory (recognizing patterns). and problem-solving skills (improvising and guessing). Sight-reading skills seem to be highly trainable and differences in sight-reading ability can be explained through differences in the amount of relevant experience and the size of the knowledge base (eg. repertoire). The ability to perform with little or no rehearsal may be regarded as a reconstructive activity that involves higher-level mental processes. These are primarily initiated by visual input but also by conceptual knowledge and specific expectations. Common problems in sight-reading of pitches. rhythm. articulation. and expression are enumerated along with suggestions for their remediation through the use of technical equipment. practice of isolated parameters. and strategic preparations for playing.When musicians speak of sight-reading. not all of them have the same activity in mind. Some might consider only the very first time one reads or plays through an unfamiliar piece to be true sight-reading. while others would allow the definition of sight-reading to encompass play-throughs after more extensive preparation. A conductor might even consider sight-reading to be the activity of silently reading through a score while imagining or performing appropriate conducting movements.

122776,Transcriptional regulation by Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) in pathogenic bacteria,2013,Hosni M Hassan and Bryan Troxell,3,,,59,Frontiers,In the ancient anaerobic environment. ferrous iron (Fe2+) was one of the first metal cofactors. Oxygenation of the ancient world challenged bacteria to acquire the insoluble ferric iron (Fe3+) and later to defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the Fenton chemistry. To acquire Fe3+. bacteria produce low-molecular weight compounds. known as siderophores. which have extremely high affinity for Fe3+. However. during infection the host restricts iron from pathogens by producing iron- and siderophore-chelating proteins. by exporting iron from intracellular pathogen-containing compartments. and by limiting absorption of dietary iron. Ferric Uptake Regulator (Fur) is a transcription factor which utilizes Fe2+ as a corepressor and represses siderophore synthesis in pathogens. Fur. directly or indirectly. controls expression of enzymes that protect against ROS damage. Thus. the challenges of iron homeostasis and defense against ROS are addressed via Fur. Although the role of Fur as a repressor is well documented. emerging evidence demonstrates that Fur can function as an activator. Fur activation can occur through three distinct mechanisms 1) indirectly via small RNAs. 2) binding at cis regulatory elements that enhance recruitment of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP). and 3) functioning as an antirepressor by removing or blocking DNA binding of a repressor of transcription. In addition. Fur homologs control defense against peroxide stress (PerR) and control uptake of other metals such as zinc (Zur) and manganese (Mur) in pathogenic bacteria. Fur family members are important for virulence within bacterial pathogens …,True,iG2_kzAAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,256,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2013.00059/full?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Microbiology-w44-2013,12124724952032336667,/scholar?cites=12124724952032336667,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2013.00059/full?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Microbiology-w44-2013,0,0,0

A detailed study of the HP1 distribution pattern on polytene chromosomes by immunofluorescent staining. using monoclonal antibody C1A9. has been carried out. The results indicate that this protein is found within the centric beta-heterochromatin. in cytological regions 31. 41 and 80. and throughout polytene chromosome 4. Staining of telomeres is frequently observed. those of chromosome arms 2R and 3R and the X chromosome being the most conspicuous. Analysis of a fourth chromosome insertional translocation T (3; 4) f/In (3L) P confirms an autonomous interaction with chromosome 4 material. Similarly. the beta-heterochromatin distal to light on chromosome arm 2L. moved to position 97D2 on chromosome arm 3R in the rearrangement ltx13. is prominently stained using the C1A9 antibody. Staining of intact salivary glands indicates that this rearranged segment of beta-heterochromatin is not associated with the polytene chromocenter. but provides an independent structural reference point. HP1 is not observed in the nuclei of the early syncytial embryo. but becomes concentrated in the nuclei at the syncytial blastoderm stage (ca. nuclear division cycle 10). This suggests that heterochromatin formation occurs at approximately the same stage at which nuclei first become transcriptionally competent.

122791,The cell biology of synaptic plasticity: AMPA receptor trafficking,2007,Jason D Shepherd and Richard L Huganir,23,,,613-643,Annual Reviews,The cellular processes that govern neuronal function are highly complex. with many basic cell biological pathways uniquely adapted to perform the elaborate information processing achieved by the brain. This is particularly evident in the trafficking and regulation of membrane proteins to and from synapses. which can be a long distance away from the cell body and number in the thousands. The regulation of neurotransmitter receptors. such as the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. is a crucial mechanism for the modulation of synaptic transmission. The levels of AMPARs at synapses are very dynamic. and it is these plastic changes in synaptic function that are thought to underlie information storage in the brain. Thus. understanding the cellular machinery that controls AMPAR trafficking will be critical for understanding the cellular basis of behavior …,True,11LOZy0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,953,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.cellbio.23.090506.123516,4018611840707193104,/scholar?cites=4018611840707193104,,http://www.pai.utexas.edu/faculty/isaxena/BIO320/The%20cell%20biology%20of%20synaptic%20plasticity%20-%20AMPA%20receptor%20trafficking%20-%202007.pdf,0,0,0

Moreover. Arc/Arg3.1 is known to be required for durable forms of synaptic plasticity and learning. Despite these intriguing links to plasticity. Arc/Arg3.1's molecular function remains enigmatic. Here. we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 protein interacts with dynamin and specific isoforms of endophilin to enhance receptor endocytosis. Arc/Arg3.1 selectively modulates trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in neurons by accelerating endocytosis and reducing surface expression. The Arc/Arg3.1-endocytosis pathway appears to regulate basal AMPAR levels since Arc/Arg3.1 KO neurons exhibit markedly reduced endocytosis and increased steady-state surface levels.

This delicate balance between neuronal output and distributed synaptic weight may be necessary for maintaining efficient encoding of information across neuronal networks. Here. we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1. an immediate-early gene (IEG) that is rapidly induced by neuronal activity associated with information encoding in the brain. mediates homeostatic synaptic scaling of AMPA type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) via its ability to activate a novel and selective AMPAR endocytic pathway.

Here. we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 is translationally induced within 5 min of mGluR activation. and this response is essential for mGluR-dependent LTD. The increase in Arc/Arg3.1 translation requires eEF2K. a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase that binds mGluR and dissociates upon mGluR activation. whereupon it phosphorylates eEF2. Phospho-eEF2 acts to slow the elongation step of translation and inhibits general protein synthesis but simultaneously increases Arc/Arg3.1 translation. Genetic deletion of eEF2K results in a selective deficit of rapid mGluR-dependent Arc/Arg3.1 translation and mGluR-LTD.

Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of Arc mRNA into new target cells. where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer Arc mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins.

Extended deprivation also failed to elicit a shift in ocular dominance or open-eye potentiation. Moreover. Arc−/− mice lacked stimulus-selective response potentiation.

Nevertheless the exact mechanism of the preventive effects of these products is still far to be clearly established. being its knowledge necessary to successfully apply these therapies to avoid stone formation. The effect of oral lemon juice administration on calcium oxalate urolithiasis was studied in male Wistar rats. Rats were rendered nephrolithic by providing drinking water containing 0.75% ethylene glycol [v/v] (EG) and 2% ammonium chloride [w/v] (AC) for 10 days. In addition to EG/AC treatment. three groups of rats were also gavage-administered solutions containing 100%. 75% or 50% lemon juice [v/v] (6 μl solution/g body weight). Positive control rats were treated with EG/AC but not lemon juice. Negative control rats were provided with normal drinking water. and were administered normal water by gavage. Each group contained 6 rats. After 10 days. serum samples were collected for analysis. the left kidney was removed and assessed for calcium levels using flame spectroscopy. and the right kidney was sectioned for histopathological analysis using light microscopy. Analysis showed that the rats treated with EG/AC alone had higher amounts of calcium in the kidneys compared to negative control rats. This EG/AC-induced increase in kidney calcium levels was inhibited by the administration of lemon juice. Histology showed that rats treated with EG/AC alone had large deposits of calcium oxalate crystals in all parts of the kidney. and that such deposits were not present in rats also treated with either 100% or 75 …,True,0azNTzAAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,122,https://bmcurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2490-7-18,1675883533689462023,/scholar?cites=1675883533689462023,,https://bmcurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2490-7-18,0,0,0

Inc.. a Wiley company,The glycerophospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) account for greater than 50% of the total phospholipid species in eukaryotic membranes and thus play major roles in the structure and function of those membranes. In most eukaryotic cells. PC and PE are synthesized by an aminoalcoholphosphotransferase reaction. which uses sn‐1.2‐diradylglycerol and either CDP‐choline or CDP‐ethanolamine. respectively. This is the last step in a biosynthetic pathway known as the Kennedy pathway. so named after Eugene Kennedy who elucidated it over 50years ago.

National identity is the cohesive force that both holds nation states together and shapes their relationships with other states. National pride is the positive affect that the public feels towards their country. resulting from their national identity. It is both the pride or sense of esteem that a person has for one’s nation and the pride or selfesteem that a person derives from one’s national identity. National pride is related to feelings of patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism is love of one’s country or dedicated allegiance to same. while nationalism is a strong national devotion that places one’s own country above all others.

Working with a well-established mouse model. we discovered that adipose tissue constitutes a third major reservoir for T. brucei. Parasites from adipose tissue. here termed adipose tissue forms (ATFs). can replicate and were capable of infecting a naive animal. ATFs were transcriptionally distinct from bloodstream forms. and the genes upregulated included putative fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes. Consistent with this.

Since a rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme is the reduction of the ferrous oxygenated heme protein. subsequent reaction intermediates do not normally accumulate. Using 60Co γ-irradiation. the primary reduced oxy-P450 species at 77 K has been identified as a superoxo- or hydroperoxo-Fe3+-heme complex (Davydov. R.. Macdonald. I. D. G.. Makris. T. M.. Sligar. S.

However. there is confusion in the literature regarding the actual source of H2S production. Reactions catalyzed by the cystathionine β-synthase enzyme (CBS) are one possible source for the production of H2S. Here we show that the CBS enzyme can efficiently produce H2S via a β-replacement reaction in which cysteine is condensed with homocysteine to form cystathionine and H2S. The production of H2S by this reaction is at least 50 times more efficient than that produced by hydrolysis of cysteine alone via β-elimination. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the Km and Kcat for cysteine is 3-fold higher and 2-fold lower. respectively. than that for serine.

Prior studies show that reduced transcription of the HO gene in swi and snf mutants is partially relieved by mutations in the SIN1 and SIN2 genes. Here we show that SIN2 is identical to HHT1. one of the two genes coding for histone H3. and that mutations in either can result in a Sin- phenotype. These mutations are partially dominant to wild type and cause amino acid substitutions in three conserved positions in the structured domain of histone H3.

Yeast strains whose CTD contains ten heptamers are viable but defective for transcription of the INO1 gene and cold sensitive for growth. Deletion of the SIN1 gene. which codes for a DNA-binding protein that negatively regulates HO transcription. restores INO1 transcription and reduces the cold sensitivity of such strains. A SIN1 deletion suppresses the lethality of a CTD with nine heptamer repeats but not with seven repeats. These observations indicate a functional relationship between SIN1 and the CTD: the CTD might remove SIN1 from DNA. or removal of SIN1 may be a prerequisite for function of the CTD. The SWI1.

Over the last twenty-five years they have been studied in great detail because mutant Ras proteins are associated with many types of human cancer. Wild type Ras proteins play a central role in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of various cell types.

Plant‐derived ascorbate also provides the major source of vitamin C in the human diet. An understanding of how ascorbate metabolism is controlled should provide a basis for engineering or otherwise manipulating its accumulation. Biochemical and molecular genetic evidence supports synthesis from GDP‐d‐mannose via l‐galactose (d‐Man/l‐Gal pathway) as a significant source of ascorbate. More recently. evidence for pathways via uronic acids has been obtained: overexpression of myo‐inositol oxygenase. d‐galacturonate reductase and l‐gulono‐1.4‐lactone oxidase all increase leaf ascorbate concentration.

The tobacco plants transformed with constructs of antisense tAPXs from spinach and tobacco could not be obtained. suggesting that the suppression of tAPX in higher plants had a severe effect on the growth even under normal conditions. In contrast. the transgenic tobacco plants (TpTAP‐12) overexpressing tAPX. which had approximately 37‐fold higher activity than that of the wild‐type plants. were generated.

In plant cells. a major source of ROS is chloroplasts. in which thylakoid membrane-bound ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) plays a role in the regulation of H2O2 levels. Here. to clarify the signaling function of H2O2 derived from the chloroplast. we created a conditional system for producing H2O2 in the organelle by chemical-dependent tAPX silencing using estrogen-inducible RNAi.

The Ca2+ fluxes taking place during mCICR are a direct consequence of the mitochondrial depolarization spike (mDPS) caused by PTP opening. Both mDPS and mCICR can propagate from one mitochondrion to another in vitro. generating traveling depolarization and Ca2+ waves. Mitochondria thus appear to be excitable organelles capable of generating and conveying electrical and Ca2+ signals.

Switching from low-to high-conductance state,1998,Francois Ichas and Jean-Pierre Mazat,1366,,1-2,33-50,Elsevier,The permeability transition pore (PTP) is a channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane that appears to operate at the crossroads of two distinct physiological pathways. i.e.. the Ca2+ signaling network during the life of the cell. and the effector phase of the apoptotic cascade during Ca2+-dependent cell death. Correspondingly. two open conformations of the PTP can also be observed in isolated organelles. A low-conductance state. that allows the diffusion of small ions like Ca2+. is pH-operated. promoting spontaneous closure of the channel. A high-conductance state. that allows the unselective diffusion of big molecules. stabilizes the channel in the open conformation. disrupting in turn the mitochondrial structure and causing the release of proapoptotic factors.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon such as the appearance of a sporadic mutation in a given stem cell during embryogenesis or mitotic segregation. giving different degrees of heteroplasmy in tissues. However. these mechanisms cannot be the only ones involved in tissue specificity. In this paper. we propose an additional mechanism contributing to tissue specificity. It is based on the metabolic expression of the defect in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes that can present a biochemical threshold.

These metabolic effects could in part explain some of the toxic effects of local anesthetics. such as bupivacaine-induced myocardial depression. The aim of this study was to compare the bioenergetic effects of the local anesthetics bupivacaine and ropivacaine.The effects of both local anesthetics on mitochondrial energy metabolism were studied in rat heart isolated mitochondria and in saponin-skinned left ventricle fibers. Oxygen consumption. adenosine triphosphate synthesis. and enzymatic activities of the complexes of the respiratory chain were measured.Bupivacaine and ropivacaine acted. in isolated mitochondria. as uncouplers between oxygen consumption and phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate. Further. an inhibitory effect of mitochondrial respiration was evidenced with both anesthetics during maximal respiration and was assigned to a direct inhibition of complex I of the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis was decreased by both mechanisms. However. both in isolated mitochondria and in permeabilized heart fibers. ropivacaine was less potent than bupivacaine. Adenosine triphosphate synthesis was completely suppressed at 3 mM (approximately 0.1%) bupivacaine. whereas 3 mM ropivacaine induced only about a 40% inhibition.Ropivacaine disturbs mitochondrial energy metabolism less than bupivacaine does.

MitoVES inhibited the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of CII with IC50 of 80 μm. whereas the electron transfer from CII to CIII was inhibited with IC50 of 1.5 μm. The agent had no effect either on the enzymatic activity of CI or on electron transfer from CI to CIII. Over 24 h.

123117,Bioenergetic pathways in tumor mitochondria as targets for cancer therapy and the importance of the ROS-induced apoptotic trigger,2010,Stephen J Ralph and Sara Rodríguez-Enríquez and Jiri Neuzil and Rafael Moreno-Sánchez,31,,1,29-59,Pergamon,Mitochondria are emerging as idealized targets for anti-cancer drugs. One reason for this is that although these organelles are inherent to all cells. drugs are being developed that selectively target the mitochondria of malignant cells without adversely affecting those of normal cells. Such anti-cancer drugs destabilize cancer cell mitochondria and these compounds are referred to as mitocans. classified into several groups according to their mode of action and the location or nature of their specific drug targets. Many mitocans selectively interfere with the bioenergetic functions of cancer cell mitochondria. causing major disruptions often associated with ensuing overloads in ROS production leading to the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

123118,Metabolic control analysis: a tool for designing strategies to manipulate metabolic pathways,2008,Rafael Moreno-Sánchez and Emma Saavedra and Sara Rodríguez-Enríquez and Viridiana Olín-Sandoval,2008,,,,Hindawi,The traditional experimental approaches used for changing the flux or the concentration of a particular metabolite of a metabolic pathway have been mostly based on the inhibition or over-expression of the presumed rate-limiting step. However. the attempts to manipulate a metabolic pathway by following such approach have proved to be unsuccessful. Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) establishes how to determine. quantitatively. the degree of control that a given enzyme exerts on flux and on the concentration of metabolites. thus substituting the intuitive. qualitative concept of rate limiting step.  Moreover. MCA helps to understand (i) the underlying mechanisms by which a given enzyme exerts high or low control and (ii) why the control of the pathway is shared by several pathway enzymes and transporters. By applying MCA it is possible to identify the steps that should be modified to achieve a successful alteration of flux or metabolite concentration in pathways of biotechnological (e.g.. large scale metabolite production) or clinical relevance (e.g.. drug therapy).  The different MCA experimental approaches developed for the determination of the flux-control distribution in several pathways are described.

The enzyme is the mammalian homologue of the zeste‐white3 (shaggy) homeotic gene of Drosophila melanogaster and has been implicated in the regulation of the c‐Jun/AP‐1 transcription factor. In mammals this protein serine kinase is encoded by two related genes termed GSK‐3 alpha and beta. Here. we demonstrate that these two proteins and the fruit fly protein are phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo. Moreover. GSK‐3 beta activity and function are shown to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation.

However. owing to the fortuitous convergence of several disparate areas of biology. the enzyme now offers unique opportunities for study of the control of a variety cellular processes. While at first sight a role in transcriptional regulation appears unlikely for a protein first identified as acting on glycogen synthase. it is even more surprising that the same protein should be functionally interchangeable with a fruit fly homeotic gene. Such understandable scepticism. however. is based on teleological bias. Glycogen synthase is a critical enzyme regulating glucose storage.

The glycosidically bound volatiles amounted to 20 mg kg−1 in dried leaves and flowers of oregano. Fourteen volatile aglycones were identified with thymoquinone as the major component. Other important aglycones were benzyl alcohol. eugenol. 2-phenyl-ethanol. thymol. 3-hexen-1-ol and carvacrol. It was found that all of the aglycones have an antioxidant effect when tested by measuring peroxide values of lard stored at 60°C.

The total essential oil and selected compounds. specifically linalool and thymol. carvacrol and their derivatives thymoquinone and thymohydroquinone. were tested for AChE inhibition. Thymohydroquinone exhibited the strongest AChE inhibitory effect over the range of concentrations. The AChE inhibitory potential decreased in the following order: thymohydroquinone > carvacrol > thymoquinone > essential oil > thymol > linalool. It is interesting that the AChE inhibitory effect exerted by carvacrol was 10 times stronger than that exerted by its isomer thymol. although thymol and carvacrol have a very similar structure.

It has been hypothesized that the gastrointestinal microbiome of humans and other non-human primates may have played significant roles in host evolution by facilitating a range of dietary adaptations. We have undertaken a comparative sequencing survey of the gastrointestinal microbiomes of several non-human primate species. with the goal of better understanding how these microbiomes relate to the evolution of non-human primate diversity. Here we present a comparative analysis of gastrointestinal microbial communities from three different species of Old World wild monkeys.  Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed fecal samples from three different wild non-human primate species (black-and-white colobus [Colubus guereza]. red colobus [Piliocolobus tephrosceles]. and red-tailed guenon [Cercopithecus ascanius]). Three samples from each species were subjected to small subunit rRNA tag pyrosequencing. Firmicutes comprised the vast majority of the phyla in each sample. Other phyla represented were Bacterioidetes. Proteobacteria. Spirochaetes. Actinobacteria. Verrucomicrobia. Lentisphaerae. Tenericutes. Planctomycetes. Fibrobacateres. and TM7.

Methods Vaginal swabs were obtained from twelve pregnant women at 8-week intervals throughout their uncomplicated pregnancies. Patients with symptoms of vaginal infection or with recent antibiotic use were excluded. Swabs were obtained from the posterior fornix and cervix at 8–12. 17–21. 27–31. and 36–38 weeks of gestation. The microbial community was profiled using hypervariable tag sequencing of the V3–V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. producing approximately 8 million reads on the Illumina MiSeq.  Results Samples were dominated by a single genus. Lactobacillus. and exhibited low species diversity. For a majority of the patients (n = 8). the vaginal microbiome was dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus throughout pregnancy. Two patients showed Lactobacillus iners dominance during the course of pregnancy. and two showed a shift between the first and second trimester from L. crispatus to L. iners dominance. In all of the samples only these two species were identified. and were found at an abundance of higher than 1% in this study. Comparative analyses also showed that the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy is characterized by a marked dominance of Lactobacillus species in both Caucasian and African-American subjects.

Rlf exhibits guanine nucleotide exchange activity towards the small GTPase Ral and. importantly. Rlf‐induced Ral activation is stimulated by active Ras. In addition. RasV12 and RasV12G37 synergize with Rlf in the transcriptional activation of the c‐fos promoter. Rlf. when targeted to the plasma membrane using the Ras farnesyl attachment site (Rlf–CAAX). is constitutively active. inducing both Ral activation and c‐fos promoter activity. Rlf–CAAX‐induced gene expression is insensitive to dominant negative Ras and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. and involves activation of the serum response element.

TRAIL can also bind to decoy receptors (DcR1. DcR2. and osteoprotegerin receptor) that cannot induce apoptosis. The occurrence of DR5-responsive tumor cells indicates that a DR5 receptor-specific TRAIL variant will permit tumor-selective therapies. By using the automatic design algorithm FOLD-X. we successfully generated DR5-selective TRAIL variants. These variants do not induce apoptosis in DR4-responsive cell lines but show a large increase in biological activity in DR5-responsive cancer cell lines. Even wild-type TRAIL-insensitive ovarian cancer cell lines could be brought into apoptosis.

The biological function of Ral and the signaling pathway in which Ral is involved are largely unknown. Here we describe a novel method to measure Ral activation utilizing the Ral binding domain of the putative Ral effector RLIP76 as an activation-specific probe. With this assay we investigated the signaling pathway that leads to Ral activation in human platelets. We found that Ral is rapidly activated after stimulation with various platelet agonists. including α-thrombin. In contrast. the platelet antagonist prostaglandin I2 inhibited α-thrombin-induced Ral activation. Activation of Ral by α-thrombin could be inhibited by depletion of intracellular Ca2+. whereas the induction of intracellular Ca2+ resulted in the activation of Ral. Our results show that Ral can be activated by extracellular stimuli.

We screened a mouse embryonic cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system and isolated the cDNA of a novel Rap 1A-interacting protein. The open reading frame encodes for an 84 kDa protein with a Cdc25-homology domain which shares approximately 30% identity with Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) and RalGDS-like (Rg1). The C-terminal region reveals a striking conservation of sequences with the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS. We designated this protein Rlf. for RalGDS-like factor. In the yeast system. Rlf interacts with Rap 1A. H-Ras and R-Ras. but not with Rac and Rho. In addition. we found that Rlf interacts with Rap 1Aval12 but not with Rap 1AAsn17. In vitro binding studies revealed that a C-terminally located 91 amino acid region of Rlf is sufficient for direct association with the GTP-bound form of Ras and Rap 1A.

Two different anammox species rarely live in a single habitat. suggesting that each species has a defined but yet unknown niche. Here we describe a new anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacterium with a defined niche: the co-oxidation of propionate and ammonium. The new anammox species was enriched in a laboratory scale bioreactor in the presence of ammonium and propionate. Interestingly. this particular anammox species could out-compete other anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers for the oxidation of propionate in the presence of ammonium. nitrite and nitrate.

These bacteria derive their energy for growth from the conversion of ammonium and nitrite into dinitrogen gas in the complete absence of oxygen. These slowly growing microorganisms belong to the order Brocadiales and are affiliated to the Planctomycetes. Anammox bacteria are characterized by a compartmentalized cell architecture featuring a central cell compartment. the “anammoxosome”. Thus far unique “ladderane” lipid molecules have been identified as part of their membrane systems surrounding the different cellular compartments.
