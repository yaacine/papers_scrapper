1097626,Oxygen free radicals and systemic autoimmunity,2003,H Ahsan and A Ali and R Ali,131,,3,398-404,Blackwell Science Ltd,Reactive oxygen species generated during various metabolic and biochemical reactions have multifarious effects that include oxidative damage to DNA leading to various human degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The highly reactive hydroxy radical (·OH) can interact with chromatin and result in a wide range of sugar and base‐derived products. DNA–protein cross‐links and strand breaks. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that after modification the DNA becomes highly immunogenic and the induced antibodies exhibit variable antigen‐binding characteristics. Systemic lupus erythematosus. a prototype autoimmune disease. is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to multiple nuclear antigens. The detection of 8‐hydroxyguanosine in the immune complex derived DNA of systemic lupus erythematosus patients reinforces the evidence that reactive oxygen species may be involved in its …,True,GOyJfNwAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,333,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2249.2003.02104.x,12045497034036542189,/scholar?cites=12045497034036542189,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1046/j.1365-2249.2003.02104.x,0,0,0

Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in rodents (rats and mice) is an accepted experimental model for RA.   Methodology/Principal Findings Hydroxyl radicals were generated by the Fenton reaction. Collagen type II (CII) was modified by •OH radical (CII-OH) and analysed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS). fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The immunogenicity of native and modified CII was checked in female Lewis rats and specificity of the induced antibodies was ascertained by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The extent of CIA was evaluated by visual inspection. We also estimated the oxidative and inflammatory markers in the sera of immunized rats. A slight change in the triple helical structure of CII as well as fragmentation was observed after hydroxyl radical modification. The modified CII was found to be highly arthritogenic and immunogenic as compared to the native form. The CII-OH immunized rats exhibited increased oxidative stress and inflammation as compared to the CII immunized rats in the control group.   Conclusions/Significance Neo-antigenic epitopes were generated on •OH modified CII which rendered it highly immunogenic and arthritogenic as compared to the unmodified form.

The method employs plastic surface for immobilization of the antigen and alkaline phosphatase-linked rabbit anti-human IgG for the detection of immune complex using PNP-P and 4MU-P as substrates. The sensitivity of the assay increased by as much as 16-fold when fluorogenic substrate was used instead of conventional PNP-P and could therefore be employed for the detection of low avidity antibodies. Using PNP-P as substrate 57% of SLE patients were positive for DNA antibody. but if 4MU-P was introduced as substrate. 71% gave a positive response.

The genotoxic and the carcinogenic effects of 4-ABP are exhibited only when it is metabolically converted to a reactive electrophile. the aryl nitrenium ions. which subsequently binds to DNA and induce lesions. Although several studies have reported the formation of 4-ABP-DNA adducts. no extensive work has been done to investigate the immunogenicity of 4-ABP-modified DNA and its possible involvement in the generation of antibodies in bladder cancer patients.   Methodology/Principal Findings Human DNA was modified by N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP). a reactive metabolite of 4-ABP. Structural perturbations in the N-OH-AABP modified DNA were assessed by ultraviolet. fluorescence. and circular dichroic spectroscopy as well as by agarose gel electrophoresis. Genotoxicity of N-OH-AABP modified DNA was ascertained by comet assay. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of native and modified DNA samples confirmed the formation of N-(deoxyguanosine-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl (dG-C8-4ABP) in the N-OH-AABP damaged DNA. The experimentally induced antibodies against N-OH-AABP-modified DNA exhibited much better recognition of the DNA isolated from bladder cancer patients as compared to the DNA obtained from healthy individuals in competitive binding ELISA.

India,2009,Sanjay Premi and Jyoti Srivastava and Sebastian Padinjarel Chandy and Sher Ali,4,PloS one,2,e4541,Public Library of Science,Background The most frequently observed major consequences of ionizing radiation are chromosomal lesions and cancers. although the entire genome may be affected. Owing to its haploid status and absence of recombination. the human Y chromosome is an ideal candidate to be assessed for possible genetic alterations induced by ionizing radiation. We studied the human Y chromosome in 390 males from the South Indian state of Kerala. where the level of natural background radiation (NBR) is ten-fold higher than the worldwide average. and that from 790 unexposed males as control.  Results We observed random microdeletions in the Azoospermia factor (AZF) a. b and c regions in >90%. and tandem duplication and copy number polymorphism (CNP) of 11 different Y-linked genes in about 80% of males exposed to NBR. The autosomal homologues of Y-linked CDY genes largely remained unaffected. Multiple polymorphic copies of the Y-linked genes showing single Y-specific signals suggested their tandem duplication. Some exposed males showed unilocus duplication of DAZ genes resulting in six copies. Notably. in the AZFa region. approximately 25% of exposed males showed deletion of the DBY gene. whereas flanking genes USP9Y and UTY remained unaffected. All these alterations were detected in blood samples but not in the germline (sperm) samples.  Conclusions Exposure to high levels of NBR correlated with several interstitial polymorphisms of the human Y chromosome.

A better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic changes responsible for melanoma formation and progression could result in the development of more effective treatments. Advanced melanomas are known to exhibit widespread promoter region CpG island methylation leading to the inactivation of key tumor suppressor genes. Meta-analyses of relevant microarray data sets revealed the hematopoietic stem cell regulator gene latexin (LXN) to be commonly downregulated in approximately 50% of melanomas. The CpG island in the promoter region of LXN was almost universally hypermethylated in melanoma cell lines and tumors. and treatment of the cell lines with the demethylating drug 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine resulted in increased LXN expression.

In pigmented melanocytes. we found that CPDs arise both instantaneously and for hours after UV exposure ends. Remarkably. the CPDs arising in the dark originate by a novel pathway that resembles bioluminescence but does not end in light: First. UV activates the enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NADPH oxidase (NOX). which generate the radicals nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2−); these combine to form the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO−).

Owing to its haploid status and absence of recombination. the human Y chromosome is an ideal candidate to be assessed for possible genetic alterations induced by ionizing radiation. We studied the human Y chromosome in 390 males from the South Indian state of Kerala. where the level of natural background radiation (NBR) is ten-fold higher than the worldwide average. and that from 790 unexposed males as control.  Results We observed random microdeletions in the Azoospermia factor (AZF) a. b and c regions in >90%. and tandem duplication and copy number polymorphism (CNP) of 11 different Y-linked genes in about 80% of males exposed to NBR. The autosomal homologues of Y-linked CDY genes largely remained unaffected. Multiple polymorphic copies of the Y-linked genes showing single Y-specific signals suggested their tandem duplication. Some exposed males showed unilocus duplication of DAZ genes resulting in six copies. Notably. in the AZFa region. approximately 25% of exposed males showed deletion of the DBY gene. whereas flanking genes USP9Y and UTY remained unaffected. All these alterations were detected in blood samples but not in the germline (sperm) samples.  Conclusions Exposure to high levels of NBR correlated with several interstitial polymorphisms of the human Y chromosome.

Human melanomas often show hyperactivity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NADPH oxidase (NOX). which. respectively. generate nitric oxide (NO·) and superoxide (O 2·−). The NO· and O 2− react instantly with each other to generate peroxynitrite (ONOO−) which is the driver of melanin chemiexcitation. Melanoma precursors. the melanocytes. are specialized skin cells that synthesize melanin. a potent shield against sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However. melanin chemiexcitation paradoxically demonstrates the melanomagenic properties of melanin. In a loop. the NOS activity regulates melanin synthesis. and melanin is utilized by the chemiexcitation pathway to generate carcinogenic melanin-carbonyls in an excited triplet state. These carbonyl compounds induce UV-specific DNA damage without UV. Additionally. the carbonyl compounds are highly reactive …,True,Vn1NchkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7425655/,12208661067354251309,/scholar?cites=12208661067354251309,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7425655/,0,0,0

If the genome contains outlier DNA sequences hypersensitive to environmental agents such as ultraviolet light (UV). these would be genomic dosimeters for monitoring personal carcinogen exposure and would facilitate noninvasive measurements on small skin samples. Such DNA sites might also allow UV to drive direct changes in cell physiology rather than acting through rare mutations.

Singapore,Mammalian sex chromosomes are often uniquely different from each other in terms of their structural organization and genes related to sex determination and differentiation. For instance. ~78 genes identified on the male-specific region of human Y chromosome (MSY) express mostly in testis and code for ~27 distinct proteins. According to a largely believed hypothesis. human Y chromosome lost most of the genes during its evolution except the ones essential for male sex determination. This evolutionary degeneration of the Y chromosome is commonly linked to its inability to undergo homologous recombination with the X chromosome or any of the autosomes. Due to its “gene-poor” landscape and continuously decreasing size. Y chromosome was hypothesized to disappear in ~10 million years.

Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) is one of the carbonyl species which reacts rapidly with the free amino groups of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The highly reactive dihydroxyacetone phosphate is a derivative of dihydroxyacetone (DHA). and a product of glycolysis. having potential glycating effects to form AGEs. The formation of AGEs results in the generation of free radicals which play an important role in the pathophysiology of aging and diabetic complications. While the formation of DHA-AGEs has been demonstrated previously. no extensive studies have been performed to assess the inhibition of AGE inhibitors at all the three stages of glycation (early. intermediate and late) using metformin (MF) and pyridoxamine (PM) as a novel inhibitor.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we report glycation of human serum albumin (HSA) & its characterization by various spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore. inhibition of glycation products at all the stages of glycation was also studied. Spectroscopic analysis suggests structural perturbations in the HSA as a result of modification which might be due to generation of free radicals and formation of AGEs.

Proteins are susceptible to ROS modifications of amino acid side chains which alter protein structure. Among the amino acids. Cysteine (Cys) is more prone to oxidation by ROS because of its high nucleophilic property. The reactivity of Cys with ROS is due to the presence of thiol group. In the oxidised form. Cys forms disulfide bond. which are primary covalent cross-link found in proteins. and which stabilize the native conformation of a protein.

Collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in rodents (rats and mice) is an accepted experimental model for RA.   Methodology/Principal Findings Hydroxyl radicals were generated by the Fenton reaction. Collagen type II (CII) was modified by •OH radical (CII-OH) and analysed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS). fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The immunogenicity of native and modified CII was checked in female Lewis rats and specificity of the induced antibodies was ascertained by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The extent of CIA was evaluated by visual inspection. We also estimated the oxidative and inflammatory markers in the sera of immunized rats. A slight change in the triple helical structure of CII as well as fragmentation was observed after hydroxyl radical modification. The modified CII was found to be highly arthritogenic and immunogenic as compared to the native form. The CII-OH immunized rats exhibited increased oxidative stress and inflammation as compared to the CII immunized rats in the control group.   Conclusions/Significance Neo-antigenic epitopes were generated on •OH modified CII which rendered it highly immunogenic and arthritogenic as compared to the unmodified form.

The extraordinary antioxidant. hepatoprotective. antibiotic. antidiabetic and anticarcinogenic properties of B. diffusa have attracted pioneers in the field of science and medicine. Moreover. the therapeutic importance of this plant. which is due to presence of polyphenols and flavanoids. makes this plant medically more important to be exploited by clinicians and scientists to gain more insight into its biological and medicinal properties. The present review on B. diffusa focuses over the chemical compositions and its ethno-medicinal uses. linked from ancient times to the present with a scope of development in future. Furthermore. a recent update on mechanistic approaches of B. diffusa has also been discussed. which could be helpful for the researchers working in this field.

Insulin resistance in target tissues and a relative deficiency of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells are the major features of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Chronic low-grade inflammation in T2D has given an impetus to the field of immuno-metabolism linking inflammation to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Many factors advocate a causal link between metabolic stress and inflammation. Numerous cellular factors trigger inflammatory signalling cascades. and as a result T2D is at the moment considered an inflammatory disorder triggered by disordered metabolism. Cellular mechanisms like activation of Toll-like receptors. Endoplasmic Reticulum stress. and inflammasome activation are related to the nutrient excess linking pathogenesis and progression of T2D with inflammation.

In this study we examined 5083 Kashmiri adults to determine the prevalence of obesity. METHODS: In this epidemiological study. after multistage sampling procedure from all the six districts of Kashmir Valley. 5083 Kashmiri adults (males and non-pregnant females of> or= 40 years age) were examined for body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio (WHR). RESULTS: Out of 5083 study subjects. 2496 were males and 2587 were females. BMI ranged between 14.6 to 38.5 kg/m2 in males and between 13.6 to 42.6 kg/m2 in females. BMI in females was comparatively more than that in males (23.88+/-3.94 Vs 22.30+/-3.11. p< 0.001). WHR ranged between 0.68 to 1.16 in males and between 0.65 to 1.16 in females. Again females had comparatively more WHR than their male counterparts (0.935+/-0.055 vs 0.926+/-0.055. P< 0.001). According to BMI. the overall prevalence of obesity in the study population was 15.01%; the prevalence of obesity in males was 7.01% and in females 23.69%.

Although the signaling pathways involved in tracheal development and the hypoxic response are well-studied. how adult tracheae interact with their target tissues is largely unknown. Here we show that the tracheae that serve the adult intestine are dynamic and respond to enteric infection. oxidative agents. and the development of gut tumors with increased terminal branching. Increased tracheation is necessary for efficient damage-induced intestinal stem cell (ISC)-mediated midgut regeneration and sufficient to drive ISC proliferation in the absence of damage. Gut damage or tumors induce Hif-1α/Sima. which. in turn. stimulates tracheole branching via the FGF(Brachless/Bnl)/FGFR(Breathless/Btl) signaling cascade. Bnl/Btl signaling is required both in the intestinal epithelium and the tracheal system for efficient damage-induced tracheal remodeling and ISC proliferation. We show that chemical or Pseudomonas-generated ROS directly affect the trachea and are necessary for branching and intestinal regeneration. Similarly. tracheole branching and the resulting increase in oxygen supply are essential for tumor growth in the midgut. Thus. we have identified a novel mechanism of visceral tracheal-intestinal tissue communication. whereby oxidative damage and tumors induce neo-tracheogenesis in adult Drosophila.

According to the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging. oxidative damage is causative for the process of aging and exacerbates age-associated pathologies.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been used as a tuberculosis (TB) vaccine since its development in 1921. BCG induces robust T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses but. for many individuals. this is not sufficient for host resistance against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection. Here we provide evidence that early secreted antigenic target protein 6 (ESAT-6). expressed by the virulent M. tb strain H37Rv but not by BCG. promotes vaccine-enhancing Th17 cell responses. These activities of ESAT-6 were dependent on TLR-2/MyD88 signalling and involved IL-6 and TGF-β production by dendritic cells. Thus. animals that were previously infected with H37Rv or recombinant BCG containing the RD1 region (BCG::RD1) exhibited improved protection upon re-challenge with virulent H37Rv compared with mice previously infected with BCG or RD1-deficient H37Rv (H37RvΔRD1). However. TLR-2 knockout (TLR-2-/-) animals neither showed Th17 responses nor exhibited improved protection in response to immunization with H37Rv. Furthermore. H37Rv and BCG::RD1 infection had little effect on the expression of the anti-inflammatory microRNA-146a (miR146a) in dendritic cells (DCs). whereas BCG and H37RvΔRD1 profoundly induced its expression in DCs. Consistent with these findings. ESAT-6 had no effect on miR146a expression in uninfected DCs. but dramatically inhibited its upregulation in BCG-infected or LPS-treated DCs.

Resistance of these organisms to drugs has emerged as an important health concern. Alternative approaches to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis are therefore urgently needed. Despite the generation of robust host immune responses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) successfully evades host immunity and establishes a persistent infection. The mechanism(s) by which M. tuberculosis manages to persist in the face of potent host immune responses remain(s) incompletely understood. Here. we demonstrate that M. tb suppresses T-lymphocyte responses by recruiting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the site of infection. We found that MSCs infiltrated tissues in mice containing M. tb organisms and T lymphocytes.

Upon interaction with its ligands. PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 inhibits activation of T cells and cytokine production. which has been documented in various viral and fungal infections as well as in vitro studies. Therefore. inhibition of T cell responses by PD-1 resulted in disease resistance in a variety of mouse infection models studied heretofore.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here. we report that PD-1 deficient (PD-1−/−) mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) H37Rv by the aerosol route have increased susceptibility as compared with their wild type littermates. Surprisingly. M. tb antigen-specific T cell proliferation was dramatically reduced in PD-1 deficient animals compared with wild-type littermates. and this was due to increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore. PD-1−/− mice exhibited decreases in the autophagy-induced LC3-B marker protein in macrophages.

The innate immune response protects some individuals to the extent that they remain uninfected. In others. the innate immune system is not sufficient and an adaptive immune response is generated. This is usually protective. but not sterilizing. and individuals remain latently infected. In susceptible individuals. M. tuberculosis successfully escapes immune surveillance. The interplay between the host innate immune response and the bacterial mechanisms in play to offset this response. is of considerable importance in dictating the course of the disease.

The persistence of the pathogenic mycobacteria inside the macrophage occurs through modulation of host cell signaling which allows them. unlike the other non-pathogenic species. to survive inside the host. The secretory proteins of M. tuberculosis have gained attention in recent years both as vaccine candidates and diagnostic tools; they target the immune system and trigger a putatively protective response; however. they may also be involved in the clinical symptoms of the disease. Our studies showed that RD-1-encoded secretory protein ESAT-6 is involved in modulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-signaling pathway inside the macrophage. ESAT-6 induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. which normally is the case for MAP kinases. ESAT-6 also antagonized LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the nucleus. Stimulation of cells by ESAT-6 along with sodium orthovanadate (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) restored phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus. suggesting active dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 by some putative phosphatase(s) in the nucleus. Further. ESAT-6 was found to down regulate the expression of LPS-inducible gene c-myc in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. This study showed the effect of secretory proteins of M. tuberculosis in the modulation of macrophage signaling pathways particularly ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway.

Understanding the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is important. We have demonstrated earlier that the PPE18 protein of Mtb induces IL-10 production in macrophages with subsequent downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 and TNF-α and favors a T-helper (Th) 2-type of immune response.   Methodology/Principal Findings Using a ppe18 genetic knock-out Mtb strain. we have now carried out infection studies in mice to understand the role of PPE18 in Mtb virulence. The studies reveal that lack of PPE18 leads to attenuation of Mtb in vivo.

The effect of physico-chemical parameters. namely pH and metal ion concentration on the removal efficiency were investigated. Behaviour of mixed metal ion biosorption and desorption using oil palm root were studied. Investigation and comparison were made for the metal-binding capacity and the performance of biosorbent in the function of aforesaid paraments. through isotherm models. namely Langmuir. Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The results show that the equilibrium data of Cu and Pb fit well to all isotherm models except that of Zn metal ion. The removal efficiency of metal ions is strongly affected by pH and metal ion concentration. The biosorption capacity increases sharply from pH 6.0 to 7.0 while the pH< 3.0 inhibits the biosorption of metal ions. The maximum biosorption is 31.11 mg/g at pH 7.0. The uptake capacity. qe of Cu and Pb increases from 50 mg/L to 200 mg/L. while the uptake capacity of Zn increases from 50 mg/L to 150 mg/L.

Since first observed in the winter of 2007. WNS has led to unprecedented mortality in several species of bats and may threaten more than 15 additional hibernating bat species if it continues across the continent. Although the exact means by which fungal infection causes mortality are undetermined. available evidence suggests a strong role of winter environmental conditions in disease mortality.2. By 2010. the fungus G. destructans was detected in new areas of North America far from the area it was first observed. as well as in eight European bat species in different countries. yet mortality was not observed in many of these new areas of North America or in any part of Europe.

The mean age of the patients was 42.9±11.1 yr. mean disease duration was 7.65±5.2 yr and the mean duration of MTX treatment was 26.1±20.6 months. Genotype analysis of MTHFR gene was done by PCR and restriction enzyme method. Primary endpoint for treatment efficacy was change in disease activity score 28 (DAS28) from baseline. Drug toxicity was evaluated by blood count. renal and liver function tests and a standardized questionnaire.Results: The mean DAS at baseline was 5.02±0.8. All patients received 10 mg/wk folic acid supplementation. Forty two per cent (63/150) of the patients had C677T polymorphism of which 4 were homozygous (T/T) and 59 were heterozygous (C/T). The baseline characteristics of the patients with or without polymorphism were comparable.

1097935,Water diplomacy: A negotiated approach to managing complex water networks,2013,Shafiqul Islam and Lawrence Susskind,,,,,Routledge,Water is the resource that will determine the wealth. welfare. and stability of many countries in the twenty-first century. This book offers a new approach to managing water that will overcome the conflicts that emerge when the interactions among natural. societal. and political forces are overlooked. At the heart of these conflicts are complex water networks. In managing them. science alone is insufficient and so is policy-making that doesn't take science into account. Solutions will only emerge if a negotiated or diplomatic approach that blends science. policy. and politics is used to manage water networks. The authors show how open and constantly changing water networks can be managed successfully using collaborative adaptive techniques to build informed agreements among disciplinary experts. water users with conflicting interests. and governmental bodies with countervailing claims. Shafiqul Islam is an engineer with over twenty-five years of practical experience in addressing water issues. Lawrence Susskind is founder of MIT's Environmental Policy and Planning Program and a leader of the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. Together they have developed a text that is relevant for students and experienced professionals working in a variety of engineering. science. and applied social science fields.

The yield of BR3 and BR14 boro varieties for the years 2008. 2030. 2050 and 2070 have been simulated for 12 locations (districts) of Bangladesh. Available data on soil and hydrologic characteristics of these locations. and typical crop management practices for boro rice were used in the simulations. The weather data required for the model (daily maximum and minimum temperatures. daily solar radiation and daily precipitation) were generated for the selected years and for the selected locations using the regional climate model PRECIS. The model predicted significant reduction in yield of both varieties of boro rice due to climate change; average yield reductions of over 20% and 50% have been predicted for both rice varieties for the years 2050 and 2070. respectively. Increases in daily maximum and minimum temperatures have been found to be primarily responsible for reduction in yield. Increases in incoming solar radiation and atmospheric carbon-di-oxide concentration have been found to increase rice yield to some extent. but their effect is not significant compared to the negative effects of temperature. Variations in rainfall pattern over the growing period have also been found to affect rice yield and water requirement.

A key difference between this and earlier approaches is that it evaluates the relative merits of daily assimilation of microwave measurements of surface soil wetness and measurements of rainfall for the estimation of soil moisture profile. We compare and contrast the profile estimation from assimilation of soil moisture and rainfall measurements using observed data sets from the Kansas prairie in the United States.

Despite several major studies on susceptibility to leprosy. few genomic loci have been replicated independently. We have conducted an association analysis of more than 1.500 individuals from different case-control and family studies. and observed consistent associations between genetic variants in both TLR1 and the HLA-DRB1/DQA1 regions with susceptibility to leprosy (TLR1 I602S. case-control P = 5.7×10−8. OR = 0.31. 95% CI = 0.20–0.48. and HLA-DQA1 rs1071630. case-control P = 4.9×10−14. OR = 0.43. 95% CI = 0.35–0.54). The effect sizes of these associations suggest that TLR1 and HLA-DRB1/DQA1 are major susceptibility genes in susceptibility to leprosy. Further population differentiation analysis shows that the TLR1 locus is extremely differentiated. The protective dysfunctional 602S allele is rare in Africa but expands to become the dominant allele among individuals of European descent. This supports the hypothesis that this locus may be under selection from mycobacteria or other pathogens that are recognized by TLR1 and its co-receptors. These observations provide insight into the long standing host-pathogen relationship between human and mycobacteria and highlight the key role of the TLR pathway in infectious diseases.,True,rHgVW2cAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,151,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000979,11277322409951306202,/scholar?cites=11277322409951306202,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000979,0,0,0

Recent findings revealed that microRNAs. a class of small noncoding RNAs. could regulate cell proliferation in many pathological conditions. Here. we showed that miR-10b was dramatically upregulated in degenerative nucleus pulposus tissues when compared with nucleus pulposus tissues isolated from patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Moreover. miR-10b levels were associated with disc degeneration grade and downregulation of HOXD10. In cultured nucleus pulposus cells. miR-10b overexpression stimulated cell proliferation with concomitant translational inhibition of HOXD10 whereas restored expression of HOXD10 reversed the mitogenic effect of miR-10b. MiR-10b-mediated downregulation of HOXD10 led to increased RhoC expression and Akt phosphorylation. Either knockdown of RhoC or inhibition of Akt abolished the effect of miR-10b on nucleus pulposus cell proliferation. Taken together. aberrant miR-10b upregulation in intervertebral disc degeneration could contribute to abnormal nucleus pulposus cell proliferation through derepressing the RhoC-Akt pathway by targeting HOXD10.

Global motion is modeled by a rigid transformation while local motion is described by a free-form deformation based on B-splines. An information theoretic measure. normalized mutual information. is used as an intensity-based image similarity measure. Registration is performed by searching for the deformation that minimizes a cost function consisting of a weighted combination of the image similarity measure and a regularization term. The novel regularization term is a local volume-preservation (incompressibility) constraint. which is motivated by the assumption that soft tissue is incompressible for small deformations and short time periods.

Beginning with one of the foundations of queer theory—his famous meditation on how sex leads to a shattering of the self.“Is the Rectum a Grave?”—this volume charts the inspired connections Bersani has made between sexuality. psychoanalysis. and aesthetics.Over the course of these essays. Bersani grapples with thinkers ranging from Plato to Descartes to Georg Simmel. Foucault and Freud recur as key figures. and although Foucault rejected psychoanalysis. Bersani contends that by considering his ideas alongside Freud’s. one gains a clearer understanding of human identity and how we relate to one another.

Comparisons between magnitude of hypertrophy. impairment of perfusion reserve. and extent of fibrosis may offer new insights for future clinical risk stratification in HCM but require multiparametric imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. Methods and Results—Degree of hypertrophy. myocardial blood flow at rest and during hyperemia (hMBF). and myocardial fibrosis were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging in 35 HCM patients (9 [26%] male/26 female) and 14 healthy controls (4 [29%] male/10 female). aged 18 to 78 years (meanSD. 4214 years) with the use of the American Heart Association left ventricular 16-segment model.

This possibility has driven the growing interest in quantifying T1. rather than just relying on its effect on image contrast. The techniques have advanced to where pixel-level myocardial T1 mapping has become a routine component of CMR examinations. Combined with the use of contrast agents. T1 mapping has led an expansive investigation of interstitial remodeling in ischemic and nonischemic heart disease.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Rapid MR imaging (MRI) during the first pass of an injected tracer is used to assess myocardial perfusion with a spatial resolution of 2–3 mm. and to detect any regional impairments of myocardial blood flow (MBF) that may lead to ischemia. The spatial resolution is sufficient to detect flow reductions that are limited to the subendocardial layer. The capacity of the coronary system to increase MBF severalfold in response to vasodilation can be quantified by analysis of the myocardial contrast enhancement. The myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) is a useful concept for quantifying the vasodilator response. The perfusion reserve can be estimated from the ratio of MBFs during vasodilation and at baseline. in units identical to those used for invasive measurements with labeled microspheres. or from dimensionless flow indices normalized by their value for autoregulated flow at rest.

The authors developed a non-breath-hold three-dimensional (3D) technique to accomplish this goal. Imaging was performed with voxel sizes of 1.50-4.50 mm3. This allows for excellent multiplanar reconstruction to view the coronary arteries from any angle. The short echo time usually makes blood isointense with surrounding tissue since inflow enhancement is weak with a thick-slab 3D method. This problem is overcome by applying fat saturation and magnetization transfer contrast techniques to suppress the signals of fat and myocardium surrounding the coronary arteries. Respiratory motion artifacts are reduced by taking four acquisitions and averaging the data.

Inc.,In magnetic resonance angiography. contrast agents are frequently used to help highlight arteries over background tissue. Unfortunately. enhancing veins hamper the visualization of arteries when data are collected over a long period of time after the arterial phase of the contrast agent. To overcome this problem. we have developed a novel imaging and postprocessing method that is capable of eliminating veins by utilizing the susceptibility difference between veins and surrounding tissue. This method was applied in the peripheral vasculature where the vessels are predominantly parallel to the main field and where the blood oxygen level‐dependent effect is most pronounced.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare two methods of reducing the effects of respiration in coronary artery MRI. Single-slice 2D imaging with breath-holding and a respiratory-gated 3D technique were used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparison was made in 10 normal subjects between a 2D multiple breath-holding approach and a 3D technique with and without retrospective respiratory gating in imaging the coronary arteries. RESULTS: Respiratory gating improved the image quality in 76% of the 3D images. Both the 2D and the 3D approaches were capable of visualizing the proximal parts of the coronary arteries. with comparable vessel length and diameter. The image quality was somewhat better for images obtained by breath-holding in 83% of the vessels. probably due to less blurring by remnant respiratory motion and higher inflow contrast.

Normal volunteers were studied using a segmented. interleaved. double‐echo. gradient‐echo sequence at baseline conditions and during pharmacological stress with either dipyridamole (n = 5) or dobutamine (n = 6). Changes in T2* in the myocardium during stress were calculated. Peak coronary flow velocity was measured at rest and during stress using a breath‐hold phase contrast technique.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,While three‐dimensional contrast‐enhanced MR angiography (MRA) is becoming the method of choice for clinical peripheral arterial disease (PAD) examinations. safety concerns with contrast administration in patients with renal insufficiency have triggered a renaissance of noncontrast MRA. In this work. a noncontrast‐MRA technique using electrocardiography‐triggered three‐dimensional segmented balanced steady‐state free precession with flow‐sensitive dephasing (FSD) magnetization preparation was developed and tested in the distal lower extremities. FSD preparation was used to induce arterial flow voids at systolic cardiac phase while having little effect on venous blood and static tissues. High‐spatial‐resolution MRA was obtained by means of magnitude subtraction between a dark‐artery scan with FSD preparation at systole and a bright‐artery scan without FSD preparation at mid‐diastole.

The 2SRI estimator is similar except that in the second-stage regression. the endogenous variables are not replaced by first-stage predictors. Instead. first-stage residuals are included as additional regressors. In a generic parametric framework. we show that 2SRI is consistent and 2SPS is not.

The field continues to develop new approaches and to evaluate the performance of the existing ones. Objectives: We discuss the strengths and limitations in existing methods for estimation and for model specification and checking. We suggest some areas that need fuller development or a better understanding of how the estimation approach performs when the outcome exhibits the skewness and heavy right tails that are typical of health care data.

We use a model based on a family utility function with altruistic linkages to show that there can be direct and indirect effects on the welfare of all family members. We focus specially on a model of how the spillover effects to the spouse in a two-person family might affect choice of treatments for prostate cancer. We then test the predictions of this model by analyzing treatment choices of prostate cancer patients using the linked SEER-Medicare database. We find that our results are consistent with the model's predictions. We conclude that cost-effectiveness analyses may better reflect the full costs and benefits of medical interventions if they incorporate these family effects.

However. the QR framework that has pervaded the applied economics literature is based on the conditional quantile regression method. It is used to assess the impact of a covariate on a quantile of the outcome conditional on specific values of other covariates. In most cases. conditional quantile regression may generate results that are often not generalizable or interpretable in a policy or population context. In contrast. the unconditional quantile regression method provides more interpretable results as it marginalizes the effect over the distributions of other covariates in the model.

Ethnic minority status and obesity are two independent risk factors for Type 2 diabetes (T2D). There is no clear understanding of how they may have interacted and influenced disparities in T2D prevalence over time. This study examined the trends in racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of T2D by weight status among US adults. Methods. We used nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys I (1971–1975).

Using substituted judgment. doctors and family members try to make the decision that the patient would have made if he or she were able to make decisions. However. empirical evidence suggests that the moral basis for substituted judgment is unsound. In spite of this. many physicians and bioethicists continue to rely on the notion of substituted judgment. Given compelling evidence that the use of substituted judgment has insurmountable flaws. other approaches should be considered.

Older adults experience the majority of cancer diagnoses and deaths and make up the majority of cancer survivors. Older adults are also the fastest growing segment of the US population. However. the evidence base for treating this population is sparse. because older adults are underrepresented in clinical trials. and trials designed specifically for older adults are rare. The result is that clinicians have less evidence on how to treat older adults. who represent the majority of patients with cancer. Clinicians and patients are forced to extrapolate from trials conducted in younger. healthier populations when developing treatment plans. This has created a dearth of knowledge regarding the risk of toxicity in the average older patient and about key end points of importance to older adults. ASCO makes five recommendations to improve evidence generation in this population:(1) Use clinical trials to improve the evidence base for treating older adults with cancer.(2) leverage research designs and infrastructure for generating evidence on older adults with cancer.(3) increase US Food and Drug Administration authority to incentivize and require research involving older adults with cancer.(4) increase clinicians’ recruitment of older adults with cancer to clinical trials. and (5) use journal policies to improve researchers’ reporting on the age distribution and health risk profiles of research participants.,True,_DCVkkwAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C,237,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Enrique_Soto-Perez-De-Celis/publication/280329358_Improving_the_Evidence_Base_for_Treating_Older_Adults_With_Cancer_American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology_Statement/links/56548db308ae4988a7b042ea.pdf,15402227422250331249,/scholar?cites=15402227422250331249,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Enrique_Soto-Perez-De-Celis/publication/280329358_Improving_the_Evidence_Base_for_Treating_Older_Adults_With_Cancer_American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology_Statement/links/56548db308ae4988a7b042ea.pdf,0,0,0

Cost-effectiveness analyses measure quality of life by associating utilities with specific health states. Utilities are often defined by single health states. such as incontinence or impotence in the case of prostate cancer treatments. Health conditions often occur simultaneously. yielding joint health states (e.g.. impotence with incontinence). Given the combinatorial mathematics involved. even a small number of conditions can result in large numbers of potential joint states. complicating utility elicitation for all relevant states.

Thus. we hypothesized that. when accounting for behaviors across the entire day. variability in the amount of time spent sitting would be independent of the inter-and intra-individual time engaged in sustained moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Ninety-one healthy women. aged 40–75 years. completed a demographic questionnaire and assessment of height and weight. Participants wore the activPAL activity monitor for one week and time (minutes/day) spent sitting. standing. stepping. and in sustained bouts (bouts ≥10 minutes) of MVPA were quantified.

Ltd.,Hot‐deck imputation offers advantages in reflecting salient features of data distributions in missing‐data problems. but previous implementations have lacked the appeal associated with modern Bayesian statistical‐computing techniques. We outline a strategy of iterative hot‐deck multiple imputation with distance‐based donor selection. With distance defined as a monotonic function of the difference in predictive means between cases. donors are chosen with probability inversely proportional to their distance from the donee. This method retains the implementation ease of ad hoc techniques. while incorporating the desirable features of Bayesian approaches. Special cases of our method include nearest‐neighbor imputation and a simple random hot‐deck. Iterating the procedure provides an analogy to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and is intended to mitigate dependence on starting values.

Currently. there is no accepted standard for identifying patients with LGIB in hospital administrative data. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a set of classification algorithms that use hospital administrative data to identify LGIB.   Methods Our sample consists of patients admitted between July 1. 2001 and June 30. 2003 (derivation cohort) and July 1. 2003 and June 30. 2005 (validation cohort) to the general medicine inpatient service of the University of Chicago Hospital. a large urban academic medical center. Confirmed cases of LGIB in both cohorts were determined by reviewing the charts of those patients who had at least 1 of 36 principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases. Ninth revision. Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes associated with LGIB. Classification trees were used on the data of the derivation cohort to develop a set of decision rules for identifying patients with LGIB. These rules were then applied to the validation cohort to assess their performance.   Results Three classification algorithms were identified and validated: a high specificity rule with 80.1% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity. a rule that balances sensitivity and specificity (87.8% sensitivity. 90.9% specificity). and a high sensitivity rule with 100% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity.   Conclusion These classification algorithms can be used in future studies to evaluate resource utilization and assess outcomes associated with LGIB without the use of chart review.,True,fUTI3pgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,11,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138987,6127472719303095895,/scholar?cites=6127472719303095895,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138987,0,0,0

While investors rely as much on their own threats as on their trading partner's promises. the latter are more credible. Building on recent work in psychology and behavioural economics. we then present a simple model within which agents are concerned about both fairness and consistency. The model can account for several of our experimental findings. Its most striking implication is that fairmindedness strengthens the credibility of promises to behave fairly. but weakens the credibility of threats to punish unfair behaviour.,True,4SpTe5gAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,485,https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/114/495/397/5085636,7896281177435741398,/scholar?cites=7896281177435741398,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.198.80&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this article. we report the results of two independently conceived and executed studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins. one in Sweden and one in the United States. The results from these studies suggest that humans are endowed with genetic variation that influences the decision to invest. and to reciprocate investment. in the classic trust game.

A seller has private information about her skill and is provided an opportunity to communicate this information to a buyer through a written message. Four different treatments are compared: one without communication. one with free-form communication. and two treatments with pre-specified communication in the form of promises of varying strength. Our results suggest that individuals have an aversion towards lying about private information and that the aversion to lying increases with the size of the lie and the strength of the promise.

This critique includes the following objections to CEA: First. they argue that CEA does not guarantee improvements in social welfare in situations where multiple health objectives exist (eg. survival and functional status). Second. they argue that CEA does not consider the health gains forgone by reallocating resources from existing programs to fund new programs. Third. they argue that incremental CEA can lead to inefficient resource allocation when there are alternative levels of programs which compete for budgetary resources.

1098442,Theory and methods of economic evaluation of health care,1996,Magnus Johannesson,4,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Most economic evaluations of health care programmes at the moment are cost effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. The problem with these methods is that their theoretical foundations are unclear. This has led to confusion about how to define the costs and health effects and how to interpret the results of these studies. In the environmental and traffic safety fields it is instead common to carry out traditional cost-bene: fit analyses of health improving programmes. This striking difference in how health programmes are assessed in different fields was the original motivation for writing this book. The aim of the book is to tty and provide a coherent framework within cost-bene: fit analysis and welfare economics for the different methods of economic evaluation in the health care field. The book is written in an easily accessible manner and several examples of applications of the different methods are provided. It is my hope that it will be useful both for teaching purposes and as a guide for practitioners in the field. Glenn C. Blomquist. John D. Graham.

1098498,Efficiency and technology gap in China's agriculture: A regional meta-frontier analysis,2008,Zhuo Chen and Shunfeng Song,19,China Economic Review,2,287-296,North-Holland,This paper utilizes a unique county-level dataset to examine technical efficiency and technology gap in China's agriculture. We classify the counties into four regions with distinctive levels of economic development. and hence production technologies. A meta-frontier analysis is used. We find that although the eastern counties have the highest efficiency scores with respect to the regional frontier but the northeastern region leads in terms of agricultural production technology nationwide. Meanwhile. the mean efficiency of the northeastern counties is particularly low. suggesting technology and knowledge diffusion within region might help to improve production efficiency and thus agricultural output.,True,ssD0rRwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,155,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X07000260,12926763771851482015,/scholar?cites=12926763771851482015,,http://202.121.129.208/conference/ces/paper/ces_pdf/8/8-3.pdf,0,0,0

The raw data from China show such an inverse relationship. However. the inverse relationship disappears after we instrument for land area using the fact that one of the objectives of the land allocation process in rural China is to ensure local households to meet their nutritional needs. The empirical inverse relationship is likely due to the failure to account for the unobserved land quality that is unevenly distributed across the farm size continuum. rather than inherent to China's agriculture.

In calculating concentration index (CI). assigning different fractional ranks to observations that have same values of the welfare measure leads to unstable and inconsistent CI estimates when the welfare variable is categorical or censored.

Figure 1.1 reports the trends in mean nominal and real minimum wage rates across states. weighted to reflect the distribution of population in our obesity data. which is intended to be representative of the US noninstitutionalized adult population. The pattern of changes in these average real minimum wages reflects a combination of federal nominal minimum wages increases in 1990 and 1996 (denoted by large squares) and multiple state increases over time. and the tendency for inflation to erode the average real minimum wage in the absence of legislated increases. Despite the two increases in the federal minimum wage and numerous increases in state minimum wages. the mean real minimum wage rate faced by respondents in our sample declined from $6.40 in 1984 to $5.82 in 2006. Although this overall change was modest. the powerful effect of the federal minimum wage caused much larger variations in average real minimum wages over shorter time periods.

The approach we take involves a two-stage process where output efficiency scores are first estimated using data envelopment analysis. and then in the second stage. variation in the resulting efficiency scores is explained using a truncated regression model with inference based on a semi-parametric bootstrap routine. Among the results we find that a heavy industrial presence is associated with reduced agricultural production efficiency and may be an indication that externalities from the industrial process. such as air and ground water pollution. affect agricultural production.

Several causal pathways have been hypothesized to explain associations between relative social position and health. For example. greater community income could increase the overall availability of health care in a community or decrease the availability for people for any given level of individual income. Relative social position could also create stress. resulting in adverse health outcomes through increased hypertension and other pathways.We explore yet another pathway by which relative social position may affect health.

Based on a survey of rural Chinese households. we extend the dynamic discrete choice model of Wooldridge (2002a. b) to a trichotomous setting and apply it to a five-year panel study. We observe statistically significant state dependence between the current period response and decisions of the previous time period.

This affects both young and elderly intensive care unit (ICU) survivors and is altering the landscape of society. Two-thirds of ICU patients develop delirium. and this is associated with longer stays. increased costs and excess mortality. In addition. over one-half of ICU survivors suffer a dementia-like illness that impacts their physical and cognitive functional abilities and which appears to be related to the duration of their ICU delirium. A new paradigm of how Intensivists handle the brain is required. We propose a 3-step approach to address this emerging epidemic. which includes Screening.

Although Bayesian methodology has been one of the most active areas of statistical development in the past 20 years. medical researchers have been reluctant to embrace what they perceive as a subjective approach to data analysis. It is little understood that Bayesian methods have a data-based core. which can be used as a calculus of evidence. This core is the Bayes factor. which in its simplest form is also called a likelihood ratio. The minimum Bayes factor is objective and can be used in lieu of the P value as a measure of the evidential strength. Unlike P values. Bayes factors have a sound theoretical foundation and an interpretation that allows their use in both inference and decision making. Bayes factors show that P values greatly overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis.

A corollary of this principle is that mutation of one gene abrogates the need for alteration of another gene in the same pathway and also that the coexistence in a single tumor of mutations in different genes implies their involvement in distinct tumor-suppressive pathways.We studied 42 pancreatic adenocarcinomas for genetic alterations in the K-ras oncogene and the p16. p53. and DPC4 tumor suppressor genes. All of them had the K-ras gene mutated. Thirty-eight % of the tumors had four altered genes. another 38% had three altered genes. 15% had two altered genes. and 8% of the tumors had one altered gene. Interestingly. we noted a high concordance of DPC4 and p16 inactivations (P = 0.007). suggesting that the genetic inactivation of p16 increases the selective advantage of subsequent …,True,jlBqYAQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,875,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/57/9/1731.short,2812536237187674355,/scholar?cites=2812536237187674355,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/57/9/1731.full.pdf,0,0,0

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result. the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued. a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning.

Its acceptance has been hindered by the greater duration of CRM designs compared to standard methods. as well as by concerns with excessive experimentation at high dosage levels. and with more frequent and severe toxicity. This paper presents the results of a simulation study in which one assigns more than one subject at a time to each dose level. and each dose increase is limited to one level. We show that these modifications address all of the most serious criticisms of the CRM. reducing the duration of the trial by 50–67 per cent. reducing toxicity incidence by 20–35 per cent. and lowering toxicity severity.

Whether all women should be screened for thyroid disease during pregnancy is controversial. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine whether treatment of thyroid disease during pregnancy decreases the incidence of adverse outcomes and compare the ability of universal screening vs. case finding in detecting thyroid dysfunction. Design: Women in the first trimester were randomly assigned to the universal screening group or case-finding group. Women in both groups were stratified as high risk or low risk based on risk factors for thyroid disease. All women in the universal screening group. and high-risk women in the case-finding group. were immediately tested for free T4. TSH. and thyroid peroxidase antibody.

In this article. we examine how pre- and postpurchase comparisons affect regret and satisfaction. and whether consumers learn to avoid decisions that result in regret. In the first two experiments. we show that information learned after the purchase has a greater impact on satisfaction than information learned before the purchase. In addition. negative price comparisons have a greater impact on satisfaction than positive comparisons. These results imply that if consumers who receive postpurchase information wish to avoid future feelings of regret. they should defer their purchases longer.

What is known about the process of diagnostic clinical reasoning? In this chapter we sketch our current understanding of answers to these questions by reviewing the cognitive processes and mental structures employed in diagnostic reasoning in clinical medicine and offering a selected history of research in the area. We will not consider the parallel issues of selecting a treatment or developing a management plan. For theoretical background. we draw upon two approaches that have been particularly influential in research in this field. The first is problem solving. exemplified in the work of Newell & Simon (1972). Elstein et al (1978). Bordage and his colleagues (Bordage & Lemieux 1991. Bordage & Zacks 1984. Friedman et al 1998. Lemieux & Bordage 1992) and Norman (2005). The second is decision making. including both classical and two-system approaches. illustrated in the work of Kahneman et al (1982). Baron (2000). and the research reviewed by Mellers etal (1998). Shafir & LeBoeuf (2002) and Kahneman (2003).Problem-solving research has usually focused on how an ill-structured problem situation is defined and structured (as by generating a set of diagnostic hypotheses). Psychological decision research has typically looked at factors affecting diagnosis or treatment choice in well defined. tightly controlled situations. A common theme in both approaches is that human rationality is limited.

The present study sought to investigate Indian truck-drivers initial commitment to PREP and circumcision utilizing the AIDS Risk Reduction Model. Ninety truck-drivers completed an in-depth qualitative interview and provided a blood sample for HIV and HSV-2 testing. Truck-drivers exhibited low levels of initial commitment towards PREP and even lower for circumcision. However. potential leverage points for increasing commitment were realized in fear of infecting family rather than self. self-perceptions of risk. and for PREP focusing on cultural beliefs towards medication and physicians. Cost was a major barrier to both HIV prevention interventions.

We use data from uConnect (2013–2016). a populationbased. longitudinal cohort study. We use an innovative approach to measure both sexual and confidant network stability at three time points. and examine the relationship between each type of stability and HIV risk and prevention behaviors. This approach is consistent with a co-evolutionary perspective in which behavior is not only affected by static properties of an individual’s network. but may also be associated with changes in the topology of his or her egocentric network. Our results indicate that although confidant and sexual network stability are moderately correlated. their dynamics are distinct with different predictors and differing associations with behavior. Both types of stability are associated with lower rates of risk behaviors. and both are reduced among those who have spent time in jail.

I argue for the complimentary adoption of an “enactive” perspective. which centers on how experts demonstrate and earn authority with individual clients and communities. I synthesize scholarship revealing the uses of communication in expert–client relationships to argue that an enactive perspective allows for the study of how experts use “reiterative multivocality” to demonstrate to clients that they possess expert knowledge that is tailored to their interests. stakes. and values.

LLC,In the late 1980s and early 1990s. the number of newly diagnosed prostate cancers in the United States increased dramatically. surpassing lung cancer as the most common cancer in men. Experts generally believe that these changes resulted from prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening that detected many early-stage prostate cancers. For example. the percentage of patients with low-risk disease has increased (45.3% in 1999–2001 vs. 29.8% in 1989–1992; P < .0001).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that occurs predominantly in the older white population. The incidence of MCC appears to have tripled during the past 20 years; an increase that is likely to continue because of the growing number of older Americans. The pathogenesis of MCC remains largely unknown. However. ultraviolet radiation and immunosuppression are likely to play a significant pathogenetic role. Many questions currently remain unanswered regarding the biologic behavior and optimal treatment of MCC.

In the absence of such studies. patients and physicians have used individual institution treatment results to evaluate the effectiveness of modern treatments. Despite a relatively large number of these retrospective studies. the comparison of surgery (radical prostatectomy [RP] or robotic RP). external beam radiation (EBRT)(conformal. intensity modulated radiotherapy. protons). brachytherapy (low dose rate and high dose rate). cryotherapy or high intensity focused ultrasound is complicated by the non-uniformity of reporting results and the use of varied disease outcome endpoints. Technical advances in these treatments have also made long-term comparisons difficult. The Prostate Cancer Results Study Group (PCRSG) was formed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of prostate cancer treatments using current modern literature results as a basis. The ongoing task of the group is to find comparable studies and present these studies and outcomes in an easily understandable form to interested groups.

Mutations or variants that impair function of RNase L. particularly R462Q. have been proposed as susceptibility factors for prostate cancer. Given the role of this gene in viral defense. we sought to explore the possibility that a viral infection might contribute to prostate cancer in individuals harboring the R462Q variant. A viral detection DNA microarray composed of oligonucleotides corresponding to the most conserved sequences of all known viruses identified the presence of gammaretroviral sequences in cDNA samples from seven of 11 R462Q-homozygous (QQ) cases. and in one of eight heterozygous (RQ) and homozygous wild-type (RR) cases. An expanded survey of 86 tumors by specific RT-PCR detected the virus in eight of 20 QQ cases (40%). compared with only one sample (1.5%) among 66 RQ and RR cases. The full-length viral genome was cloned and sequenced independently from three positive QQ cases. The virus. named XMRV. is closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs). but its sequence is clearly distinct from all known members of this group. Comparison of gag and pol sequences from different tumor isolates suggested infection with the same virus in all cases. yet sequence variation was consistent with the infections being independently acquired.

HRQOL among controls was compared with therapy groups. Comparison between therapy groups was performed using regression models to control covariates. HRQOL effects of cancer progression were evaluated.Results: One thousand fourteen subjects partici-pated. Compared with controls. each therapy group reported bothersome sexual dysfunction; radical prostatectomy was associated with adverse urinary HRQOL; external-beam radiation was associated with adverse bowel HRQOL; and brachytherapy was associated with adverse urinary. bowel. and sexual HRQOL (P<. 0002 for each).

In the absence of such studies. patients and physicians have used individual institution treatment results to evaluate the effectiveness of modern treatments. Despite a relatively large number of these retrospective studies. the comparison of surgery (radical prostatectomy [RP] or robotic RP). external beam radiation (EBRT)(conformal. intensity modulated radiotherapy. protons). brachytherapy (low dose rate and high dose rate). cryotherapy or high intensity focused ultrasound is complicated by the non-uniformity of reporting results and the use of varied disease outcome endpoints. Technical advances in these treatments have also made long-term comparisons difficult. The Prostate Cancer Results Study Group (PCRSG) was formed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of prostate cancer treatments using current modern literature results as a basis. The ongoing task of the group is to find comparable studies and present these studies and outcomes in an easily understandable form to interested groups. This initiative is designed to provide physicians. their patients and healthcare providers such as Medicare with comprehensive. evidence-based prostate cancer treatment comparisons in an understandable form. Importantly. uniform pretreatment staging criteria are used (rather than the postoperative stage) as this is the information that the patients and clinicians rely on when choosing between the different options.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-seven patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas were treated with curative intent by limb-sparing surgery and postoperative radiation therapy at the Fox Chase Cancer Center or the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. between October 1970 and March 1991. Follow-up ranged from 4-218 months. The median external beam dose was 60.4 Gy. In 13 patients. interstitial brachytherapy was used as a component of treatment.

To test this hypothesis. it is necessary first to estimate the incidence of morbidity for both standard and conformal fields. In this study. we examine factors that influence the incidence of late Grade 3 and 4 morbidity in patients treated with conformal and standard radiation treatment for prostate cancer.

To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features. we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR). which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data. we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and …,True,doUAlykAAAAJ:SEKBqlyTJecC,710,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418302290,2527781944865127420,/scholar?cites=2527781944865127420,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418302290,0,0,0

Hippocampal avoidance (HA) using intensity-modulated radiotherapy during whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is hypothesized to preserve cognition. METHODS This phase III trial enrolled adult patients with brain metastases to HA-WBRT plus memantine or WBRT plus memantine. The primary end point was time to cognitive function failure. defined as decline using the reliable change index on at least one of the cognitive tests. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS). intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). toxicity. and patient-reported symptom burden. RESULTS Between July 2015 and March 2018. 518 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up for alive patients was 7.9 months. Risk of cognitive failure was significantly lower after HA-WBRT plus memantine versus WBRT plus memantine (adjusted hazard ratio. 0.74; 95% CI. 0.58 to 0.95; P=. 02). This difference was attributable to less deterioration in executive function at 4 months (23.3% v 40.4%; P=. 01) and learning and memory at 6 months (11.5% v 24.7%[P=. 049] and 16.4% v 33.3%[P=. 02]. respectively). Treatment arms did not differ significantly in OS. intracranial PFS. or toxicity. At 6 months. using all data. patients who received HA-WBRT plus memantine reported less fatigue (P=. 04). less difficulty with remembering things (P=. 01). and less difficulty with speaking (P=. 049) and using imputed data. less interference of neurologic symptoms in daily activities (P=. 008) and fewer cognitive symptoms (P=. 01).
