Two different bi-stage scenarios for the treatment of such effluents are proposed. The first scenario includes the pretreatment in aerated lagoons and the final stage at the wastewater treatment plants after appropriate dilution with municipal sewages. The second scenario also includes the first stage in aerated lagoons with a tertiary treatment at the plant for cyanobacteria cultivation with the use of obtained biomass for biofuels production. The effects of the aeration periodicity on the leachate treatment efficiency and also on the composition of microbiocenosis in the aerated lagoons were investigated. The leachates of the Lviv landfill of municipal solid waste (MSW) were used in experimental investigations. The Lviv landfill of MSW was used for domestic and industrial wastes deposition for almost six decades. since the 1960s. It was found that the highest effect of ammoniacal nitrogen removal was obtained in the mode of periodic aeration. with the cycle duration of two hours including the one-hour aeration. It was found that the microorganisms extracted from the leachates of the Lviv MSW landfill are prospective for the new biotechnologies of treatment of the highly concentrated wastewaters. since this microbiocenosis is resistant to the widespread pollutants. in particular to heavy metal ions.,True,Obk9OGYAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,13,https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-8619f667-8c21-4a60-a871-a4ba4362a1c9,7671394395171370395,/scholar?cites=7671394395171370395,,https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-8619f667-8c21-4a60-a871-a4ba4362a1c9/c/2_Malovanyy_et_al._Perspective_Technologies_8-15.pdf,0,0,0

We randomly divided forty rats into four different groups: nontreated control (Ctrl). nontreated diabetic (Diabetic). Diabetic+GB (4-week treatment). and Diabetic+MW (4-week treatment). After the experiment was finished. serum and kidney tissue samples were gathered. Blood levels of glucose. triglycerides. cholesterol. creatinine. and urea were markedly elevated in the diabetic group than in the control group. In all animals treated with GB and MW. the levels of urea. creatinine. and glucose were significantly reduced (all ). GB and MW attenuated glomerular and tubular injury as well as the histological score. Furthermore. they normalized the contents of glutathione reductase and SOD2.

The arterial blood supply of the uterus comes from three arteries: the uterine branch of the ovarian artery. the uterine artery of the external iliac artery. and the uterine branch of the urogenital artery. All arteries enter the uterus at its mesometrial border and divide into smaller ones. Segmentally constricted arteries are seen to circumscribe large veins at the perimetrium which become highly convoluted in the intermuscular vascular layer of the myometrium. Small arteries and arterioles originate at the borderline between the myometrium and the endometrium and radiate to the surface of the endometrium to constitute a system of numerous ridges and grooves by a widely meshed plexus of subepithelial capillary network. The post-capillary venules of the endometrium arise from the subepithelial capillary plexus to form slightly larger veins than the concurrent arteries which join up to the large tortuous veins in the intermuscular vascular layer of the uterus. This arrangement of blood vessels in the donkey uterus and particularly in the endometrium provides the requirement for instant blood flow on the arterial side and for the slow flow rate on the venous side to ameliorate the process of substances exchange.,True,rFCyOZ0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,9,https://europepmc.org/article/med/11732590,10207795466862020551,/scholar?cites=10207795466862020551,,,0,0,0

Anatomically. the epididymal duct of a camel consists of three parts head. body and tail. Histomorphologically. the epididymal duct is subdivided into initial. middle and terminal segments. of which the middle segment is further subdivided into proximal. intermediate and distal parts. There is a gradual decrease in the epithelial height of the epididymal duct from the initial to the terminal segments. This mechanically facilities passage of the sperms toward the terminal segment. High epithelium in the initial segment may indicate a more absorptive power of the epithelium in this segment. The seasonal reproductivety of the epididymal duct in the camel expressed by variations in the weight and volume of the epididymis. total diameter of the epididymal duct. epithelial height. length of the stereocilia. thickness of the muscular coat and cellular distributions in different segments. The spring months offer ideal circumstances for maximal reproductive activity in this species. The cellular components of the epididymal duct epithelium of the camel displays important morphological changes from season to another showing signs of increasing activity during spring in comparison to decreasing activity in other seasons.

Analyzed samples were from an    iron-wood tree (Gymnocladus canadensis Lam.) that grew in the Mužljanski Rit    area. of the Srpska Crnja municipality in Serbia. According to previous    research. it was deduced that Gymnocladus canadensis Lam. belongs to    ring-porous species with big vessel lumen in the earlywood zone and thicker    cell walls in the latewood. Vessels were more numerous in the latewood zone.    and the same was true for heartwood and sapwood. For both layers. sapwood    possessed a few more vessels than heartwood. and a statistically significant    difference was confirmed by t-test during the early phase. The greatest    negative value of correlation coefficient was between the number of vessels    and growth-ring width during the early phase for sapwood. The number of    vessels decreased in the wider growth rings. The correlation between    growth-ring width and the area of vessels had a statistically significant    positive value of correlative coefficient. which means that wider growth    rings had larger vessel areas in the early phase for sapwood.,True,UGMa-l8AAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC,10,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0354-46641500118J,991173681497290272,/scholar?cites=991173681497290272,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-46641500118J,0,0,0

Both EHV-1 and EHV-9 infections of non-definitive hosts often result in neuronal infection and high case fatality rates. Hence. EHV-1 and EHV-9 are somewhat unusual herpesviruses and lack strict host specificity. and the true extent of their host ranges have remained unclear. In order to determine the seroprevalence of EHV-1 and EHV-9. a sensitive and specific peptide-based ELISA was developed and applied to 428 sera from captive and wild animals representing 30 species in 12 families and five orders. Members of the Equidae. Rhinocerotidae and Bovidae were serologically positive for EHV-1 and EHV-9. The prevalence of EHV-1 in the sampled wild zebra populations was significantly higher than in zoos suggesting captivity may reduce exposure to EHV-1. Furthermore. the seroprevalence for EHV-1 was significantly higher than for EHV-9 in zebras. In contrast. EHV-9 antibody prevalence was high in captive and wild African rhinoceros species suggesting that they may serve as a reservoir or natural host for EHV-9. Thus.

They then predict where the population’s language is moving and speak according to that prediction. which represents a social force encouraging children not to sound out-dated.

All humans have a built-in learning mechanism known as universal grammar or UG. Languages change in regular yet unpredictable ways due to many factors. including properties of UG and contact with other languages. This dissertation extends the standard replicator equation used in evolutionary biology to include a learning process. The resulting language dynamical equation models language change at the population level. In a further extension. members of the population may have different UGs. It models evolution of the language faculty itself.We begin by examining the language dynamical equation in the case where the parameters are fully symmetric. When learning is very error prone. the population always settles at an equilibrium where all grammars are present. For more accurate learning. coherent equilibria appear. where one grammar dominates the population. We identify all bifurcations that take place as learning accuracy increases.

We consider a stochastic model that reproduces this pattern of fluctuations via large deviations. We begin with a Markov chain that represents an age-structured population in which children learn which of two grammars their community prefers but are aware of age-correlated usage patterns and will use the dispreferred grammar more often if they infer that its use is spreading.

1055187,A mathematical model of the loss of verb-second in Middle English,2006,W Garrett Mitchener,,,,,na,Lightfoot (1999) proposes the following explanation for the loss of the verb-second rule in Middle English: There were two regional dialects of Middle English. a northern dialect influenced by Old Norse with a verbsecond rule. and a southern dialect with a slightly different word order. Children acquire the verb-second rule based on hearing some critical fraction of cue sentences requiring such a rule. As the dialects experienced increased contact. northern children were less likely to hear enough cue sentences. and consequently acquired a different grammar. resulting in the extinction of the northern dialect.This hypothesis can be modeled with differential equations. By using dynamical systems methods. the catastrophe in question may be modeled by a mathematical event known as a saddle-node bifurcation. A key part of the model is the function that gives the probability of learning the northern dialect given that a fraction of the local population uses it. Other model acquisition algorithms. such as memoryless learner (Niyogi & Berwick 1996). give the mysterious result that verb-second languages should be extremely stable. in contrast to the history of English. This new model provides an explanation for that behavior: Memoryless learners are more sensitive to noise. resulting in a differently shaped function that does not allow the northern grammar to disappear.

Body feather total length is shorter in aquatic than in terrestrial birds. and this difference between groups is due to the shorter plumulaceous feather section in aquatic birds.

Monitoring data from the Florida Everglades were used to test whether spatial data can be substituted for temporal data in forecasting models. Spatial models that predicted bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei) population response to a drying event performed comparably and sometimes better than temporal models. Models worked best when results were not extrapolated beyond the range of variation encompassed by the original dataset. These results were compared to other studies to determine whether ecosystem features influence whether space-for-time substitution is feasible.

However. a previous experimental test of this assumption using the northern clade of Poeciliopsis showed no evidence for abortion. To distinguish between the alternatives that placental species either sacrifice body condition to maintain reproduction when resources are restricted. or that the previously documented pattern of resource allocation is a function of other life‐history correlates of placentation rather than placentation alone. we perform a similar experiment on the southern clade of Poeciliopsis.

Reznick and Miles (1989a) made one of the first systematic attempts to gather information from a widely scattered literature on poeciliid life histories. They focused on two important female reproductive traits:(1) the ability to carry multiple broods at different developmental stages (superfetation; Turner 1937. 1940b. 1940c). which tends to cause females to produce fewer offspring per brood and to produce broods more frequently. and (2) the provisioning of eggs and developing embryos by the mother. which may occur prior to (lecithotrophy) or after (matrotrophy) fertilization. Their review documented the distribution of these two reproductive traits among poeciliids and their correlates with other life-history traits. including mean and minimum reproductive size. reproductive allocation. brood size. offspring dry weight at birth. interbrood interval. and mean adult size. Their study yielded several new insights. One was that superfetation may have evolved multiple times within the family and appeared to be largely confined to the closely allied genera Heterandria. Neoheterandria. and Poeciliopsis. The authors cautioned. however. that their data set was limited by uneven representation of genera. Further knowledge of other. hitherto-uninvestigated genera was required before reaching a conclusion that superfetation is confined to these three genera.

We would like to renew the call to set aside the arboreal–cursorial debate and to draw attention to the common ground shared by both sides.

1055222,The effects of hypoxia and inflammation on synaptic signaling in the CNS,2016,Gatambwa Mukandala and Ronan Tynan and Sinead Lanigan and John J O’Connor,6,,1,6,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Normal brain function is highly dependent on oxygen and nutrient supply and when the demand for oxygen exceeds its supply. hypoxia is induced. Acute episodes of hypoxia may cause a depression in synaptic activity in many brain regions. whilst prolonged exposure to hypoxia leads to neuronal cell loss and death. Acute inadequate oxygen supply may cause anaerobic metabolism and increased respiration in an attempt to increase oxygen intake whilst chronic hypoxia may give rise to angiogenesis and erythropoiesis in order to promote oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues. The effects of hypoxia on neuronal tissue are exacerbated by the release of many inflammatory agents from glia and neuronal cells. Cytokines. such as TNF-α. and IL-1β are known to be released during the early stages of hypoxia. causing either local or systemic inflammation. which can result in cell death. Another growing body of evidence suggests that inflammation can result in neuroprotection. such as preconditioning to cerebral ischemia. causing ischemic tolerance. In the following review we discuss the effects of acute and chronic hypoxia and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines on synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system.

Tumor heterogeneity and the existence of distinct cell subpopulations exhibiting different genotypes and biological behaviors raise difficulties to eradicate all tumorigenic cells. Recent evidence indicates that a distinct population of tumor cells. called cancer stem cells (CSC). is involved in tumor initiation and recurrence and is a putative cause of tumor radioresistance. There is an urgent need to identify the intrinsic molecular mechanisms regulating the generation and maintenance of resistance to radiotherapy. especially within the CSC subset.

Outcome of sepsis critically depends on macrophage activation by extracellular ATP-release and associated autocrine signalling via purinergic receptors. ATP-release mechanisms. however. are poorly understood. Here. we show that TLR-2 and −4 agonists trigger ATP-release via Connexin-43 hemichannels in macrophages leading to poor sepsis survival. In humans. Connexin-43 was upregulated on macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavity in patients with peritonitis but not in healthy controls. Using a murine peritonitis/sepsis model. we identified increased Connexin-43 expression in peritoneal and hepatic macrophages. Conditional Lyz2cre/creGja1flox/flox mice were developed to specifically assess Connexin-43 impact in macrophages. Both macrophage-specific Connexin-43 deletion and pharmacological Connexin-43 blockade were associated with reduced cytokine secretion by macrophages in response to LPS and CLP. ultimately resulting in increased survival.

To test this hypothesis. the deposit-feeding epibenthic amphipod Melita plumulosa was exposed to nontoxic or reproductively toxic concentrations of copper via the overlying water. via ingestion of sediment. or via a combination of the two. Rates of copper uptake from the two exposure routes were predicted using a biokinetic model.

1055251,Roles of aquaporins in Setaria viridis stem development and sugar storage,2016,Samantha A McGaughey and Hannah L Osborn and Lily Chen and Joseph L Pegler and Stephen D Tyerman and Robert T Furbank and Caitlin S Byrt and Christopher PL Grof,7,Frontiers in plant science,,1815,Frontiers,Setaria viridis is a C4 grass used as a model for bioenergy feedstocks. The elongating internodes in developing S. viridis stems grow from an intercalary meristem at the base. and progress acropetally towards fully expanded cells that store sugar. During stem development and maturation. water flow is a driver of cell expansion and sugar delivery. As aquaporin proteins are implicated in regulating water flow we analysed elongating and mature internode transcriptomes to identify putative aquaporin encoding genes that had particularly high transcript levels during the distinct stages of internode cell expansion and maturation. We observed that SvPIP2;1 was highly expressed in internode regions undergoing cell expansion. and SvNIP2;2 was highly expressed in mature sugar accumulating regions. Gene co-expression analysis revealed SvNIP2;2 expression was highly correlated with the expression of five putative sugar transporters expressed in the S. viridis internode. To explore the function of the proteins encoded by SvPIP2;1 and SvNIP2;2 we expressed them in Xenopus laevis oocytes and tested their permeability to water. SvPIP2;1 and SvNIP2;2 functioned as water channels in X. laevis oocytes and their permeability was gated by pH. Our results indicate that SvPIP2;1 may function as a water channel in developing stems undergoing cell expansion and SvNIP2;2 is a candidate for retrieving water and possibly a yet to be determined solute from mature internodes. Future research will investigate whether changing the function of these proteins influences stem growth and sugar yield in S. viridis.,True,Ir6RNOMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,10,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01815/full,3719271362083633972,/scholar?cites=3719271362083633972,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01815/full,0,0,0

The immense task of quantifying human imprints on global ecosystems has been greatly simplified by developments in high-throughput DNA sequencing technology (HTS). Approaches like DNA metabarcoding enable the study of biological communities at unparalleled detail. However. current protocols for HTS-based biodiversity exploration have several drawbacks. They are usually based on short sequences. with limited taxonomic and phylogenetic information content. Access to expensive HTS technology is often restricted in developing countries. Ecosystems of particular conservation priority are often remote and hard to access. requiring extensive time from field collection to laboratory processing of specimens. The advent of inexpensive mobile laboratory and DNA sequencing technologies show great promise to facilitate monitoring projects in biodiversity hot-spots around the world. Recent attention has been given to portable DNA sequencing studies related to infectious organisms. such as bacteria and viruses. yet relatively few studies have focused on applying these tools to Eukaryotes. such as plants and animals.

We have developed a multiphoton femtosecond laser-based 3D printing platform. which generates complex protein microstructures in minutes. Here. we used the platform to test a series of fabrication and reagent parameters in precisely controlling the mechanical properties of protein micropillars. Atomic force microscopy was utilized to measure the reduced elastic modulus of the micropillars and transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize the porosity of the structures. The reduced elastic modulus of the micropillars associated positively and linearly with the scanning power. On the other hand. the porosity and pore size of the micropillars associated inversely and linearly with the scanning power and reagent concentrations.

Tests involving constant-rate loading often yield results that are rate dependent. due to the viscous component of the deformation. In this work. a rate-jump indentation method was employed in an optical tweezers system to measure the stiffness of non-adherent blood cells. which are the softest types of cells. Compared to the traditional Hertzian method of indentation. the rate-jump method is found to be able to yield invariant elastic modulus from K562 myelogenous leukemia cells. The optical tweezers indentation method proposed can therefore serve as a standard protocol for obtaining the intrinsic elastic modulus of extremely soft cells. with applied forces in the pico-newton range.

However. the influence of the drugs on the biomechanical properties of leukemia cells. which are related to the risk of leukostasis. is still unknown. Moreover. accurate measurement of biomechanical properties of leukemia cells is still a challenging task because of their non-adherent nature and high sensitivity to the surrounding physiological conditions. In this study. a protocol to measure the biomechanical properties of leukemia cells by performing indentation tests using optical tweezers is proposed.

However. the proper establishment of such a conclusion would require biophysical understanding of the underlying mechanism of the cell stiffness. In this work. we compared the elastic moduli of the actin cytoskeletons of Hey A8 ovarian carcinoma cells with and without metastasis (HM and NM). as measured by 2D atomic force microscopy (AFM) with low-depth nanoindentation via a rate-jump method. The results indicate clearly that HM cells showed lower actin cytoskeleton stiffness atop of their nucleus position and higher actin cytoskeleton stiffness at their rims. compared to NM cells. suggesting that the local stiffness on the cytoskeleton can reflect actin filament distribution.

Beyond the tumor suppressor TP53. the POLR2A gene encoding the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is also included in a~ 20-megabase deletion region of 17p in 63% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Using a focused CRISPR-Cas9 screen. we discovered that heterozygous loss of 17p confers a selective dependence of CRPC cells on the ubiquitin E3 ligase Ring-Box 1 (RBX1). RBX1 activates POLR2A by the K63-linked ubiquitination and thus elevates the RNAP2-mediated mRNA synthesis.

Specifically. membrane pores in a number of pairs of cancer and normal cell lines originated from nasopharynx. lung and intestine were introduced by nano-mechanical puncturing. Interestingly. such nanometer-sized holes in tumor cells can reseal~ 2–3 times faster than those in the corresponding normal cells. Furthermore. the membrane resealing time in cancer cell lines exhibiting resistance to several leading chemotherapeutic drugs was also found to be substantially shorter than that in their drug-sensitive counterparts. demonstrating the potential of using this quantity as a novel marker for future cancer diagnosis and drug resistance detection.

An inherent challenge of processing viscous liquids arises from their large resistance to deform.

The applied electric force can induce a straight viscous jet to coil and the resulting coiling characteristics are governed by the electric stress. We demonstrate the promising use of electrical coiling in the rapid and efficient mixing of viscous liquids.

Franzbecker Verlag,The lack of coordination between the curricula of physics and mathematics is in one of the primary cause of students’ difficulty of application of mathematics in physics. It is difficult for the students to transfer concepts. ideas and procedures learned in mathematics to a new and unanticipated situation. eg in physics lessons. An alternative to this traditional transfer method stresses the importance of modelling activities in an interdisciplinary context between physics and mathematics. Physics provides mathematics with interesting problems to investigate. and mathematics provides physics with powerful tools in analyzing data and theorizing. In this paper a modelling approach to the concepts of variable and function in upper secondary school is introduced. The approach introduces the notion of functions as a tool to model relationships from physics in which two quantities vary before teaching the formal mathematics.,True,j0qhK-kAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,37,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.115.3678&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16955760772870927026,/scholar?cites=16955760772870927026,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.115.3678&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This role is brought about predominantly through the building. employment. and assessment of mathematical models. and teachers and educators should capture this relationship in the classroom in an effort to improve students' achievement and attitude in both physics and mathematics. But although there are overwhelming amounts of literature on modeling in science and mathematics education. the interdisciplinary position is seldom addressed explicitly. Furthermore. there has been a striking lack of exposure of the question of how future teachers. who are largely educated in a mono-disciplinary fashion. can best become equipped to introduce genuinely interdisciplinary teaching activities to their future pupils.

The course is centered around the concept of exponential functions. The starting point is that concepts are rooted in practice and gain their meaning through application. and the concept of a function is regarded as a tool for modelling real-world situations. It is the intention to teach a course that emphasizes factors that promote transfer of the concept and use of the various representations of the concept. to make it more practical and meaningful for the students.

Reformens krav om øget samspil mellem fagene lægger op til omfattende ændringer af de gymnasiale uddannelsers matematikundervisning. Erfaringerne med en bevidst inddragelse af matematiske kompetencer i andre fag er begrænsede. Det skyldes bl. a. at der mangler såvel en konceptuel ramme som en didaktisk model for samspillet mellem matematik og andre fag samt konkrete og veldokumenterede eksempler på undervisningsforløb med et for både lærere og elever udbytterigt samspil. I artiklen præsenteres en række positioner vedrørende matematikundervisningen som vi lader spille sammen med en analyse af relevant forskning inden for matematikkens didaktik der mere eller mindre eksplicit inddrager matematikfagets relationer til andre fag. På baggrund heraf udvikles et koncept for matematiks samspil med andre fag bestående af tværfaglige kompetencer som den konceptuelle ramme og en didaktisk model hvor samspillet opfattes som en iterativ bevægelse mellem (1) horisontal sammenkædning af fagene og (2) vertikal strukturering i fagene.

Aims To compare the safety and preliminary efficacy of orally administered lyophilized microbiota product compared with frozen product by enema.   Methods In a single center. adults with ≥ 3 episodes of recurrent CDI were randomized to receive encapsulated lyophilized fecal microbiota from 100–200 g of donor feces (n = 31) or frozen FMT from 100 g of donor feces (n = 34) by enema. Safety during the three months post FMT was the primary study objective. Prevention of CDI recurrence during the 60 days after FMT was a secondary objective. Fecal microbiome changes were examined in first 39 subjects studied.   Results Adverse experiences were commonly seen in equal frequency in both groups and did not appear to relate to the route of delivery of FMT. CDI recurrence was prevented in 26 of 31 (84%) subjects randomized to capsules and in 30 of 34 (88%) receiving FMT by enema (p = 0.76). Both products normalized fecal microbiota diversity while the lyophilized orally administered product was less effective in repleting Bacteroidia and Verrucomicrobia classes compared to frozen product via enema.   Conclusions The route of delivery. oral or rectal. did not influence adverse experiences in FMT.

In particular. the effect of SMF exposure during anticancer therapies still needs to be fully elucidated. Here. we evaluate the effects of SMF at induction levels that cisPt-treated cancer patients experience during the imaging process conducted in Low field (200–500 mT). Open field (300–700 mT) and/or inhomogeneous High field (1.5–3 T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines. Human adrenergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with 0.1 µM cisPt (i.e. the lowest concentration capable of inducing apoptosis) were exposed to SMF and their response was studied in vitro. Exposure of 0.1 µM cisPt-treated cells to SMF for 2 h decreased cell viability (30%) and caused overexpression of the apoptosis-related cleaved caspase-3 protein (46%). Furthermore. increase in ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) production (23%) and reduction in the number of mitochondria vs controls were seen. The sole exposure of SMF for up to 24 h had no effect on cell viability but increased ROS production and modified cellular shape. On the other hand. the toxicity of cisPt was significantly prevented during 24 h exposure to SMF as shown by the levels of cell viability. cleaved caspase-3 and ROS production. In conclusion. due to the cytoprotective effect of 31.7–232.0 mT SMF on low-cisPt-concentration-treated SH-SY5Y cells. our data suggest that exposure to various sources of SMF in cancer patients under a cisPt regimen should be strictly controlled.,True,vpcttN8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113530,11901963502067029114,/scholar?cites=11901963502067029114,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113530,0,0,0

The neural basis of vocal communication has been investigated in monkeys. songbirds. rats. bats and invertebrates resulting in deep insights into motor control. neural coding and learning. Mice. which recently became very popular as a model system for mammalian neuroscience. also utilize ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during mating behavior. However. our knowledge is lacking of both the behavior and its underlying neural mechanism. We developed a novel method for head-restrained male mice (HRMM) to interact with non-restrained female mice (NRFM) and show that mice can emit USVs in this context. We first recorded USVs in free arena with non-restrained male mice (NRMM) and NRFM. Of the NRMM. which vocalized in the free arena. the majority could be habituated to also vocalize while head-restrained but only when a female mouse was present in proximity. The USVs emitted by HRMM are similar to the USVs of NRMM in the presence of a female mouse in their spectral structure. inter syllable interval distribution and USV sequence length. and therefore are interpreted as social USVs. By analyzing vocalizations of NRMM. we established criteria to predict which individuals are likely to vocalize while head fixed based on the USV rate and average syllable duration. To characterize the USVs emitted by HRMM. we analyzed the syllable composition of HRMM and NRMM and found that USVs emitted by HRMM have higher proportions of USVs with complex spectral representation. supporting previous studies showing that mice social USVs are context …,True,do4_pAYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00236/full,10019239051668665691,/scholar?cites=10019239051668665691,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00236/full,0,0,0

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are naturally divided into distinct syllables and thus are useful for studying the neural control of complex sequences production. However. little is known about the rules governing their temporal order. We recorded USVs during male-female courtship (460.000 USVs grouped into 44.000 sequences) and classified them using three popular algorithms. Modeling the sequences as Markov processes revealed a significant temporal structure which was dependent on the specific classification algorithm. To quantify how syllable misclassification obscures the true underlying sequence structure. we used information theory. We developed the Syntax Information Score and ranked the syllable classifications of the three algorithms. Finally. we derived a novel algorithm (Syntax Information Maximization) that utilized sequence statistics to improve the classification of individual USVs with respect to the underlying sequence structure.,True,do4_pAYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/728477v2.abstract,7767288198176689790,/scholar?cites=7767288198176689790,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/08/07/728477.full.pdf,0,0,0

1055628,Drosophila melanogaster acetyl-CoA-carboxylase sustains a fatty acid–dependent remote signal to waterproof the respiratory system,2012,Jean-Philippe Parvy and Laura Napal and Thomas Rubin and Mickael Poidevin and Laurent Perrin and Claude Wicker-Thomas and Jacques Montagne,8,PLoS Genet,8,e1002925,Public Library of Science,Fatty acid (FA) metabolism plays a central role in body homeostasis and related diseases. Thus. FA metabolic enzymes are attractive targets for drug therapy. Mouse studies on Acetyl-coenzymeA-carboxylase (ACC). the rate-limiting enzyme for FA synthesis. have highlighted its homeostatic role in liver and adipose tissue. We took advantage of the powerful genetics of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the role of the unique Drosophila ACC homologue in the fat body and the oenocytes. The fat body accomplishes hepatic and storage functions. whereas the oenocytes are proposed to produce the cuticular lipids and to contribute to the hepatic function. RNA–interfering disruption of ACC in the fat body does not affect viability but does result in a dramatic reduction in triglyceride storage and a concurrent increase in glycogen accumulation. These metabolic perturbations further highlight the role of triglyceride and glycogen storage in controlling circulatory sugar levels. thereby validating Drosophila as a relevant model to explore the tissue-specific function of FA metabolic enzymes. In contrast. ACC disruption in the oenocytes through RNA–interference or tissue-targeted mutation induces lethality. as does oenocyte ablation. Surprisingly. this lethality is associated with a failure in the watertightness of the spiracles—the organs controlling the entry of air into the trachea. At the cellular level. we have observed that. in defective spiracles. lipids fail to transfer from the spiracular gland to the point of air entry.

Specific CHCs can also act as pheromones. which are important for successful mating. Oenocytes are abdominal cells thought to act as specialized units for CHC biogenesis that consists of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) synthesis. optional desaturation(s). elongation to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). and removal of the carboxyl group. By investigating CHC biogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. we showed that VLCFA synthesis takes place only within the oenocytes. Conversely. several pathways. which may compensate for one another. can feed the oenocyte pool of LCFAs. suggesting that this step is a critical node for regulating CHC synthesis.

Therefore. FA-metabolic enzymes are potential targets for drug therapy. although the consequence of these treatments must be precisely evaluated at the organismal and cellular levels. In healthy organism. synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs)—composed of three FA units esterified to a glycerol backbone—is increased in response to dietary sugar. Saturation in the storage and synthesis capacity of TAGs is associated with type 2 diabetes progression. Sugar toxicity likely depends on advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) that form through covalent bounding between amine groups and carbonyl groups of sugar or their derivatives α-oxoaldehydes. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive α-oxoaldehyde that is derived from glycolysis through a non-enzymatic reaction. Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) works to neutralize MG. reducing its deleterious effects. Here. we have used the power of Drosophila genetics to generate Fatty acid synthase (FASN) mutants. allowing us to investigate the consequence of this deficiency upon sugar-supplemented diets. We found that FASN mutants are lethal but can be rescued by an appropriate lipid diet. Rescued animals do not exhibit insulin resistance. are dramatically sensitive to dietary sugar and accumulate AGEs. We show that FASN and Glo1 cooperate at systemic and cell-autonomous levels to protect against sugar toxicity. We observed that the size of FASN mutant cells decreases as dietary sucrose increases.

During mitosis. sister chromatids separate. whereas during the first meiotic division. homologous chromosomes pair and then segregate from each other. In most organisms. germ cells do both programs sequentially. as they first amplify through mitosis. before switching to meiosis to produce haploid gametes. Here. we show that autosomal chromosomes are unpaired at their centromeres in Drosophila germline stem cells. and become paired during the following four mitosis of the differentiating daughter cell. Surprisingly. we further demonstrate that components of the central region of the synaptonemal complex are already expressed in the mitotic region of the ovaries. localize close to centromeres. and promote de novo association of centromeres.

However. it remains generally unknown how the number of stem cell niches is controlled. In the insect ovary. each germline stem cell (GSC) niche is embedded in a functional unit called an ovariole. The number of ovarioles. and thus the number of GSC niches. varies widely among species. In Drosophila. morphogenesis of ovarioles starts in larvae with the formation of terminal filaments (TFs). each made of 8–10 cells that pile up and sort in stacks. TFs constitute organizers of individual germline stem cell niches during larval and early pupal development. In the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. the number of ovarioles varies interspecifically from 8 to 20. Here we show that pipsqueak. Trithorax-like. batman and the bric-à-brac (bab) locus. all encoding nuclear BTB/POZ factors of the Tramtrack Group. are involved in limiting the number of ovarioles in D. melanogaster. At least two different processes are differentially perturbed by reducing the function of these genes. We found that when the bab dose is reduced. sorting of TF cells into TFs was affected such that each TF contains fewer cells and more TFs are formed. In contrast. psq mutants exhibited a greater number of TF cells per ovary. with a normal number of cells per TF. thereby leading to formation of more TFs per ovary than in the wild type.

This program of cell death is under antagonistic effects of the Notch and the EGFR pathways. In addition. uncharacterized positional cues may underlie death versus survival choices among IOCs. Our results provide new genetic evidences that cell death is regulated in a position-dependent manner in the eye. We show that mutations in Trithorax-like (Trl) and lola-like/batman specifically block IOC death during eye morphogenesis. These genes share characteristics of both Polycomb-Group and trithorax-Group genes. in that they are required for chromatin-mediated repression and activation of Hox genes. However. Trl function in triggering IOC death is independent from a function in repressing Hox gene expression during eye development. Analysis of mosaic ommatidiae containing Trl mutant cells revealed that Trl function for IOC death is required in cone cells. Strikingly. cell death suppression in Trl mutants depends on the position of IOCs. Our results further support a model whereby death of IOCs on the oblique sides of ommatidiae requires Trl-dependent reduction of a survival signal. or an increase of a death signal. emanating from cone cells. Trl does not have the same effect on horizontal IOCs whose survival seems to involve additional topological constraints.,True,3Ha0PHwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,15,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/072406nd/drosophila-retinal-pigment-cell-death-is-regulated-in-a-position-dependent-manner-by-a-cell-memory-gene,10374988961527131233,/scholar?cites=10374988961527131233,,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/072406nd,0,0,0

How homolog pairing is maintained in early meiosis to ensure synapsis occurs exclusively between homologs is unknown. We aimed to further understand this process by examining the meiotic defects of a unique Drosophila mutant. Mcm5A7. We found that Mcm5A7 mutants are proficient in homolog pairing at meiotic onset yet fail to maintain pairing as meiotic synapsis ensues. causing seemingly normal synapsis between non-homologous loci. This pairing defect corresponds with a reduction of SMC1-dependent centromere clustering at meiotic onset. Overexpressing SMC1 in this mutant significantly restores centromere clustering. homolog pairing. and crossover formation. These data indicate that the initial meiotic pairing of homologs is not sufficient to yield synapsis exclusively between homologs and provide a model in which meiotic homolog pairing must be stabilized by centromeric SMC1 to ensure proper synapsis.,True,3Ha0PHwAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008412&rev=2,4590828860586244604,/scholar?cites=4590828860586244604,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008412&rev=2,0,0,0
1055637,How to pre-pair chromosomes for meiosis,2016,Thomas Rubin and Nicolas Christophorou and Jean-René Huynh,15,Cell Cycle,5,609,Taylor & Francis,Meiosis is a special type of cell division specific to germ cells. whereby diploid germ cells produce haploid gametes for sexual reproduction. At the beginning of meiosis. chromosomes need to pair with their homologous partner and initiate recombination events that will ensure exchange of genetic information and proper segregation during anaphase I. Pairing events differ significantly between species. 1 Indeed it is initiated at telomeres in mammals. at specific sequences called pairing centers in C. elegans. and at centromeres in Drosophila. In most species studied. chromosomes adopt a specific configuration upon entry into meiosis called the telomere bouquet where telomeres aggregate on one side of the nucleus. Finally. divergent dynamic chromosome movements take place that promote pairing. C. elegans pairing centers and budding yeast telomeres display rapid saltatory movements. while fission yeast meiotic nuclei undergo horsetail motions and telomeres of mouse spermatocytes perform rotational movements. 1 In Drosophila the dynamic events that drive homologous pairing were unknown. Indeed. it was always thought that meiotic pairing was a continuation of a phenomenon observed in several insects called somatic pairing whereby homologous chromosomes are paired in both somatic and germline cells. So. chromosomes were expected to be always paired in every cell. We and others have recently shown that homologous chromosomes are not paired in primordial germ cells (PGCs). which are the first germ cells to be formed in the embryo; and that this absence of pairing is maintained for the autosomes until PGCs become …,True,3Ha0PHwAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,3,http://germcells.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-to-pre-pair-chromosomes-for-meiosis.pdf,2066693583714245401,/scholar?cites=2066693583714245401,,http://germcells.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-to-pre-pair-chromosomes-for-meiosis.pdf,0,0,0

1055645,New synchronization method for Plasmodium falciparum,2010,Lisa C Ranford-Cartwright and Abhinav Sinha and Georgina S Humphreys and Jonathan M Mwangi,9,Malaria journal,1,170,BioMed Central,Plasmodium falciparum is usually asynchronous during in vitro culture. Although various synchronization methods are available. they are not able to narrow the range of ages of parasites. A newly developed method is described that allows synchronization of parasites to produce cultures with an age range as low as 30 minutes. Trophozoites and schizonts are enriched using Plasmion. The enriched late stage parasites are immobilized as a monolayer onto plastic Petri dishes using concanavalin A. Uninfected erythrocytes are placed onto the monolayer for a limited time period. during which time schizonts on the monolayer rupture and the released merozoites invade the fresh erythrocytes. The overlay is then taken off into a culture flask. resulting in a highly synchronized population of parasites. Plasmion treatment results in a 10- to 13-fold enrichment of late stage parasites. The monolayer method results in highly synchronized cultures of parasites where invasion has occurred within a very limited time window. which can be as low as 30 minutes. The method is simple. requiring no specialized equipment and relatively cheap reagents. The new method for parasite synchronization results in highly synchronized populations of parasites. which will be useful for studies of the parasite asexual cell cycle.,True,9mjA6CEAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC,18,https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-9-170,7248106738812408325,/scholar?cites=7248106738812408325,,https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-9-170,0,0,0
1055646,Characterisation of Species and Diversity of Anopheles gambiae Keele Colony,2016,Lisa C Ranford-Cartwright and Sion McGeechan and Donald Inch and Graeme Smart and Lenka Richterová and Jonathan M Mwangi,11,PLOS ONE,12,e0168999,Public Library of Science,Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was recently reclassified as two species. An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s.. in wild-caught mosquitoes. on the basis of the molecular form. denoted M or S. of a marker on the X chromosome. The An. gambiae Keele line is an outbred laboratory colony strain that was developed around 12 years ago by crosses between mosquitoes from 4 existing An. gambiae colonies. Laboratory colonies of mosquitoes often have limited genetic diversity because of small starting populations (founder effect) and subsequent fluctuations in colony size. Here we describe the characterisation of the chromosomal form(s) present in the Keele line. and investigate the diversity present in the colony using microsatellite markers on chromosome 3. We also characterise the large 2La inversion on chromosome 2. The results indicate that only the M-form of the chromosome X marker is present in the Keele colony. which was unexpected given that 3 of the 4 parent colonies were probably S-form. Levels of diversity were relatively high. as indicated by a mean number of microsatellite alleles of 6.25 across 4 microsatellites. in at least 25 mosquitoes. Both karyotypes of the inversion on chromosome 2 (2La/2L+a) were found to be present at approximately equal proportions. The Keele colony has a mixed M- and S-form origin. and in common with the PEST strain. we propose continuing to denote it as an An. gambiae s.s. line.,True,9mjA6CEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168999,1062624992193572976,/scholar?cites=1062624992193572976,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168999,0,0,0
1055647,Genetic and genomic approaches for the discovery of parasite genes involved in antimalarial drug resistance,2013,Jonathan M Mwangi and Lisa C Ranford-Cartwright,140,Parasitology,12,1455-1467,Cambridge University Press,The biggest threat to the war on malaria is the continued evolution of drug resistance by the parasite. Resistance to almost all currently available antimalarials now exists in Plasmodium falciparum which causes the most suffering among all human malaria parasites. Monitoring of antimalarial efficacy and the development and subsequent spread of resistance has become an important part in the treatment and control of malaria. With recent reports of reduced efficacy of artemisinin. the current recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria. there is urgent need for better methods to recognize and monitor drug resistance for effective treatment. Molecular markers have become a welcome addition to complement the more laborious and costly in vitro and in vivo methods that have traditionally been used to monitor drug resistance. However. there are currently no molecular markers for resistance to some antimalarials. This review highlights the role of the various genetic and genomic approaches that have been used in identifying the molecular markers that underlie drug resistance in P. falciparum. These approaches include; candidate genes. genetic linkage and genome-wide association studies. We discuss the requirements and limitations of each approach and use various examples to illustrate their contributions in identifying genomic regions of the parasite associated with antimalarial drug responses.,True,9mjA6CEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,12,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/87051,3879170721420940809,/scholar?cites=3879170721420940809,,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/87051/1/87051.pdf,0,0,0

Kenya,2011,Laura N Wangai and Muriira Geoffrey and Sabah Omar and Gabriel Magoma and Francis T Kimani and Jonathan M Mwangi and Marion W Burugu and Naomi Maina,12,African Journal of Clinical and Experimental Microbiology,3,,AJCEM Life line Publishers,Artemisinins-based combination therapies (ACTs) are being recommended against uncomplicated malaria in endemic areas of Africa. However. in these areas data on their long term usefulness is limited. It has been demonstrated that ACTs resistance may be due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chemotherapeutic target. the SERCA-type ATPase protein (PfATPase6). This study analyzed PfATPase6 mutations in asymptomatic infections from samples collected from Mbita. a malaria endemic region in Kenya. Mutations in A623E and S769N residues were screened with gene specific primers followed by sequencing. The study demonstrates that there is no mutation in Mbita. Kenya because neither A623E nor S769N PfATPase6 mutations were detected. Resurgence of infections in this area could be due to re-infections and not drug failure. The study recommends that other sites be assessed for PfATPase 6 mutations to verify the long-term usefulness of ACT and monitor any emergency of resistance.,True,9mjA6CEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcem/article/view/66909,8420251027065068670,/scholar?cites=8420251027065068670,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajcem/article/view/66909/54906,0,0,0

Australia. Using an 18 m long still water canal in conjunction with respirometry. we determined the energy requirements while diving. Using electronic devices measuring dive depth or swimming speed. we investigated the foraging behaviour at sea. Cost of Transport was calculated to be minimal at the speed the birds prefer at sea (1.8 m/s) and averaged 11.1 J/kg/m (power requirements at that speed: 20.0 W/kg). Metabolic rate of little penguins resting in water was found to be 8.5 W/kg.

However. in respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). there is excessive infiltration and activation of neutrophils. subsequent production of reactive oxygen species. and release of serine proteases. matrix metalloproteinases. and myeloperoxidase—resulting in collateral damage as the cells infiltrate into the tissue. Increased neutrophil survival through dysregulated apoptosis facilitates continued release of neutrophil-derived mediators to perpetuate airway inflammation and tissue injury. Several target mechanisms have been investigated to address pathologic neutrophil biology and thereby provide a novel therapy for respiratory disease. These include neutrophil influx through inhibition of chemokine receptors CXCR2. CXCR1. and PI3Kγ signaling and neutrophil weaponry by protease inhibitors. targeting matrix metalloproteinases and neutrophil serine proteases. In addition. neutrophil function can be modulated using selective PI3Kδ inhibitors.

To address how PTEN functions in early embryos. we overexpressed one of the four zebrafish PTEN isoforms at the 1–2‐cell stage. Overexpression of Ptena454 alters phospho‐Akt levels and impairs cell movements associated with gastrulation. Heat shocking embryos increases phospho‐Akt levels and lowers phospho‐Ptena454 levels.

MPs are a newly evolving. important part of cell-to-cell communication and signaling machinery. Because of their size and the nature of their release. until recently MP existence was overlooked. However. with improved technology and analytical methods their function in health and disease is now emerging. The protocols presented here are aimed at isolating and characterizing PMN-MPs by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. Moreover. several implementation examples are given. These protocols for MP isolation are fast. low-cost. and do not require the use of expensive kits. Furthermore. they allow for the labeling of MPs following isolation. as well as pre-labeling of source cells prior to MP release. using a membrane-specific fluorescent dye for visualization and analysis by flow cytometry.

1055717,Longevity of arctic and alpine clonal plants,2011,Lucienne Claudine de Witte,,,,,,Arctic and alpine regions. characterized by cold climates. are expected to be vulnerable to climate warming and land use change. In these habitats. vegetative reproduction and slow growth enable most plants to survive long periods of time. in which harsh environmental conditions hamper sexual reproduction. Based on the discovery of extremely old plants and the presence of Ôremnant populationsÕ that were found to persist despite negative growth rates. extended longevity of plants is believed to enlarge persistence of populations and to have a positive relationship with ecosystem functioning. The main objectives of this PhD thesis were to assess present knowledge on longevity of clonal plants and the methods used to measure it. as well as to generate high-quality lifespan data for clonal plant species that dominate late-successional alpine-arctic vegetation based on genet size data and annual horizontal growth measurements. Additionally. the results were used to assess population persistence. community stability and ecosystem resilience under past and future global change. The annual horizontal growth measured in the field was compared among species. successional stage. regions and years to investigate the influence of geographically or temporally variable climates.  The lifespan investigations conducted during this thesis revealed extreme longevity for several plants in late-successional vegetation as well as in pioneer sites.

1055739,A TIRF microscopy technique for real-time. simultaneous imaging of the TCR and its associated signaling proteins,2012,Travis J Crites and Lirong Chen and Rajat Varma,,JoVE (Journal of Visualized Experiments),61,e3892,,Signaling is initiated through the T Cell Receptor (TCR) when it is engaged by antigenic peptide fragments bound by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) proteins expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). The TCR complex is composed of the ligand binding TCRαβ heterodimer that associates non-covalently with CD3 dimers (the εδ and εγ heterodimers and the ζζ homodimer)1. Upon engagement of the receptor. the CD3 ζ chains are phosphorylated by the Src family kinase. Lck. This leads to the recruitment of the Syk family kinase. Zap70. which is then phosphorylated and activated by Lck. After that. Zap70 phosphorylates the adapter proteins LAT and SLP76. initiating the formation of the proximal signaling complex containing a large number of different signaling molecules2.  The formation of this complex eventually results in calcium and Ras-dependent transcription factor activation and the consequent initiation of a complex series of gene expression programs that give rise to T cell differentiation2. TCR signals (and the resulting state of differentiation) are modulated by many other factors. including antigen potency and crosstalk with co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory. chemokine. and cytokine receptors 3-4.

To predict the variability in the distribution of coating mass in a batch operation. information on the cycle-time distribution (CTD) of particles in the bed is required. The current work presents a compartment model to describe the CTD for the Wurster process. The basic model uses a plug flow compartment with dispersion. a mixed tank. and a second mixed tank with bypass. all connected in series. The resulting CTD is asymmetric with a sharp leading edge and a broader trailing edge with a significant tail.

1055741,On the issue of peptide recognition in T cell development,2010,Travis J Crites and Rajat Varma,1,,1,55-61,Taylor & Francis,CD4-CD8 double positive (DP) thymocytes undergo a differentiation process in the thymus where they are selected based on their ability to recognize peptide antigens presented on self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.  The first stage of this process is positive selection. a quality-control mechanism which ensures that the T cell receptors (TCR) presented on developing thymocytes can transmit signals via peptides presented on either MHC class I (MHC1) or MHC class II (MHC2) molecules.  Work over the past decade has revealed that the peptides that drive positive selection of both CD4 and CD8 lineage cells deliver only weak TCR signals.  In line with these observations. specialized protein degradation machineries have been discovered in the thymic cortex that presumably generate specialized low-affinity peptide repertoires for presentation on MHC1 and MHC2 molecules.

1055742,A TIRF Microscopy Technique for Real-time,2012,TJ Crites and L Chen and R Varma,,Simultaneous Imaging of the TCR and its Associated,,,,Signaling is initiated through the T Cell Receptor (TCR) when it is engaged by antigenic peptide fragments bound by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) proteins expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). The TCR complex is composed of the ligand binding TCRαβ heterodimer that associates non-covalently with CD3 dimers (the εδ and εγ heterodimers and the ζζ homodimer) 1. Upon engagement of the receptor. the CD3 ζ chains are phosphorylated by the Src family kinase. Lck. This leads to the recruitment of the Syk family kinase. Zap70. which is then phosphorylated and activated by Lck. After that. Zap70 phosphorylates the adapter proteins LAT and SLP76. initiating the formation of the proximal signaling complex containing a large number of different signaling molecules2.The formation of this complex eventually results in calcium and Ras-dependent transcription factor activation and the consequent initiation of a complex series of gene expression programs that give rise to T cell differentiation2.

While there has been much work on coalescing jets of fluid and non-coalescence in other systems like drop-drop. drop on a bath. jet on a bath. non-coalescence of fluid jets has been little studied. A simple experimental setup was developed to stably demonstrate and study the non-coalescence of jets upon collision.

Herts. AL10 9AA. UK,Students. as well as teachers. often learn what makes sense to them. even when it is wrong. These misconceptions are a problem. The authors sought a quick. quantitative way of identifying student misconceptions in secondary science. Using the University of Toronto’s National Biology Competition test data. this article presents a method of quickly identifying misconceptions that agree with many facets of the extant misconception literature (ubiquity across subject areas. pervasiveness regardless of question difficulty. and distractive power). Seeking students’ most common wrong answer on a multiple-choice test is found to be a fast. reliable. and data-driven way to identify misconceptions.The original naïve ideas students bring to a science classroom have been well documented and studied (Driver et al.. 1994; Galvin. Simmie and O’Grady. 2015; Piaget and Inhelder. 1948). Students. as well as teachers. often learn what makes sense to them. even when it is wrong (Sadler and Sonnert. 2016). This is a problem. If teachers carry such misconceptions themselves. or are unaware of common misconceptions their students may have. their attempts at effective teaching may be undermined (Ausubel. Novak and Hanesian. 1978). Our primary goal was to find common misconceptions in secondary (ages 14–19) science in a quick and powerful manner to support teachers who do not want to create or perpetuate misconceptions. However. before we could confirm existing (or identify new) misconceptions. we needed a sound methodology. Therefore. for this article. we wanted to provide a proof of concept.

Most chemotherapeutic agents ultimately cause cell death through cell-intrinsic pathways as an indirect consequence of DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor gene (TRP53) configures the cell deaths induced by chemotherapeutic agents. In this study. we show that the transcription factor ATF4. a component of the mammalian circadian clock. functions in circadian accumulation of p53 protein in tumor cells. In murine fibroblast tumor cells. ATF4 induced the circadian expression of p19ARF (Cdkn2a). Oscillation of p19ARF interacted in a time-dependent manner with MDM2. a specific ubiquitin ligase of p53. resulting in a rhythmic prevention of its degradation by MDM2.

Here. we show that Akt phosphorylation is not exclusively responsible for acquired TRAIL resistance. Akt catalytic activation is known to increase during metabolic oxidative stress. but we show that TRAIL also dramatically induces the catalytic activation of Akt in TRAIL-sensitive cells. but not in TRAIL-resistant cells. This suggests that Akt catalytic activation during TRAIL-induced apoptosis is likely to play a compensatory role in the maintenance of cell homeostasis.

These epigenetic variegations can influence IR response and shape tumor aggressiveness. However. epigenetic disturbance of histones after IR. implicating in IR responsiveness. has been elusive. Here. we investigate whether altered histone modification after IR can influence radiation responsiveness. The oncogenic CXCL12 mRNA and protein were more highly expressed in residual cancer cells from a hepatoma heterotopic murine tumor microenvironment and coculture of human hepatoma Huh7 and normal IMR90 cells after radiation. H3K4 methylation was also enriched and H3K9 methylation was decreased at its promoter region. Accordingly. invasiveness and the subpopulation of aggressive CD133+/CD24− cells increased after IR.

Nonthermal atmospheric-pressure plasma-activated medium produced by jetting air plasma above a liquid surface shows advantages over direct plasma such as storage and delivery to tissues inside the body. In this study. we demonstrated that plasma-activated medium can be stored for up to 6 months in a freezer and that the stored plasma-activated medium has anticancer effects similar to those of direct plasma. Plasma-activated medium stored for 6 months showed cytocidal effects on human cervical cancer HeLa cells that were comparable to the effects of fresh plasma-activated medium or direct plasma. Furthermore. the levels of reactive species in plasma-activated medium persisted for up to 6 months. These results indicate that therapeutic application of plasma-activated medium is applicable in plasma medicine and is a promising anticancer strategy.

1055796,Non-Thermal Plasma Couples Oxidative Stress to TRAIL Sensitization through DR5 Upregulation,2020,Soon Young Hwang and Ngoc Hoan Nguyen and Tae Jung Kim and Youngsoo Lee and Mi Kang and Jong-Soo Lee,21,International journal of molecular sciences,15,5302,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in various tumor cells without affecting most normal cells. Despite being in clinical testing. novel strategies to induce TRAIL-mediated apoptosis are in need to overcome cancer cell unresponsiveness and resistance. Plasma-activated medium (PAM) markedly stimulates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. We investigate the capability of PAM and TRAIL (PAM/TRAIL) combination therapy to overcome TRAIL resistance and improve the anticancer efficacy of TRAIL. The combinatorial treatment of PAM and TRAIL shows synergistic effects on growth inhibition in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells via augmented apoptosis by two attributes. DR5 (TRAIL-R2) transcription by CHOP is upregulated in a PAM-generated ROS/RNS-dependent manner. and PAM itself upregulates PTEN expression mediated by suppression of miR-425 which is involved in Akt inactivation. leading to increased apoptosis induction. Treatment of cancer cell lines with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reduces the extent of membrane dysfunction and the expression of both CHOP-DR5 and miR-425-PTEN axes. attenuating PAM/TRAIL-induced cancer cell apoptosis. These data suggest that PAM/TRAIL treatment is a novel approach to sensitizing cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and overcoming TRAIL resistance. PAM is a promising candidate for further investigations as a chemotherapeutic sensitizer in the treatment of cancer.

Previously. we observed that TRAIL induced the catalytic activation of Akt in TRAIL-sensitive cells and here. the catalytic activation of Akt was reversely decreased by curcumin pretreatment followed by TRAIL. We also found that significant increase of p38 phosphorylation was deeply linked to the decrease of Akt catalytic activity by regulation of the level of phosphorylated HSP27. which leads to the change of interaction between TRAF6 and Src. and subsequent Src-Akt inactivation.

However. not all flower-visiting insects are equally well known. especially in the biodiverse Southeast Asian region. One group is the orthopterans. comprising of grasshoppers. crickets. and katydids. Natural history observations were made around Southeast Asia to document flower-visiting orthopterans. Owing to the limited studies on the ecology of orthopterans in Southeast Asia. we provide here the first documentation of flower-visiting orthopterans from Southeast Asia and the most extensive one for the Tropics. Based on 140 incidences of orthopteran visiting flowers. 41 orthopteran species have so far been recorded to visit 35 different plant species. in mainly Singapore.

However. little is known about their distribution patterns within forest ecosystems. We examined how species diversity and community composition of phyllosphere fungi change along a vertical structure in a tropical forest in Thailand. Fungal communities in 144 leaf samples from 19 vertical layers (1.28–34.4 m above ground) of 73 plant individuals (27 species) were investigated by metabarcoding analysis using Ion Torrent sequencing. In total. 1.524 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected among 890.710 reads obtained from the 144 leaf samples. Taxonomically diverse fungi belonging to as many as 24 orders of Ascomycota and 21 orders of Basidiomycota were detected. most of which inhabited limited parts of the lowest layers closest to the forest floor. Species diversity of phyllosphere fungi was the highest in the lowest layers closest to the forest floor. decreased with increasing height. and lowest in the canopy; 742 and 55 fungal OTUs were detected at the lowest and highest layer. respectively. On the layers close to the forest floor. phyllosphere fungal communities were mainly composed of low frequency OTUs and largely differentiated among plant individuals. Conversely. in the canopy. fungal communities consisted of similar OTUs across plant individuals. and as many as 86.1%–92.7% of the OTUs found in the canopy (≥22 m above ground) were also distributed in the lower layers.

Chinese Academy of Sciences,Wild King Cobras. Ophiophagus hannah. are known to prey almost exclusively on snakes. We observed opportunistic ingestion of a plastic bag by a radio-tracked adult male O. hannah. which was detrimental to the health of the individual and likely lead to its death. Our observation demonstrates that improper disposal of food and plastic waste can be a threat to snakes. highlighting the need to maintain a waste-free environment. especially in areas inhabited by vulnerable species. dominated habitats. such as agricultural fields. degraded forests and near human residences. Pollution. in the form of solid plastic waste. is common in these ecologically degraded areas. and previous studies have documented the entanglement of terrestrial snakes in synthetic materials. such as nets. plastic and metal fencing (Miranda. 2013). Lizards have also been known to consume plastic waste. and plastic bags containing meat seem to be particularly attractive to large carnivorous species (eg. Varanus varius; Gillett and Jackson. 2010). Because plastic is extremely durable. it easily accumulates in ecosystems. Consumption of plastic can result in impaired movement and feeding. reduced growth. and even death. perhaps due to starvation or suffocation (Miranda. 2013). This note represents the first reported case of a wild O. hannah consuming plastic waste. and the first reported case of any snake species consuming plastic.

Despite functional conservation. centromere DNA sequences are diverse and often repetitive. making them challenging to assemble and identify. Here. we describe centromeres in an oomycete Phytophthora sojae by combining long-read sequencing-based genome assembly and chromatin immunoprecipitation for the centromeric histone CENP-A followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). P. sojae centromeres cluster at a single focus at different life stages and during nuclear division. We report an improved genome assembly of the P. sojae reference strain. which enabled identification of 15 enriched CENP-A binding regions as putative centromeres. By focusing on a subset of these regions. we demonstrate that centromeres in P. sojae are regional. spanning 211 to 356 kb. Most of these regions are transposon-rich. poorly transcribed. and lack the histone modification H3K4me2 but are embedded within regions with the heterochromatin marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. Strikingly. we discovered a Copia-like transposon (CoLT) that is highly enriched in the CENP-A chromatin. Similar clustered elements are also found in oomycete relatives of P. sojae. and may be applied as a criterion for prediction of oomycete centromeres.

Phytophthora. a genus of filamentous oomycetes. contains many devastating plant pathogens. causing multibillion-dollar damage to crops. ornamental plants. and natural environments. The genomes of several oomycetes including Phytophthora species such as the soybean pathogen P. sojae. have been sequenced. allowing evolutionary analysis of small RNA-processing enzymes. This study examined the evolutionary origins of the oomycete small RNA-related genes Dicer-like (DCL). and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) through broad phylogenetic analyses of the key domains. Two Dicer gene homologs. DCL1 and DCL2. and one RDR homolog were cloned and analyzed from P. sojae.

Oomycete DCL1 homologs clustered with animal and plant Dicer homologs in evolutionary trees. whereas oomycete DCL2 homologs clustered basally to the tree along with Drosha homologs.

By establishing a reliable in vivo NLS assay based on confocal microscopy. we found that many canonical monopartite and bipartite classical NLSs (cNLSs) mediated nuclear import poorly in P. sojae. We found that efficient localization of P. sojae nuclear proteins by cNLSs requires additional basic amino acids at distal sites or collaboration with other NLSs. We found that several representatives of another well-characterized NLS. proline-tyrosine NLS (PY-NLS) also functioned poorly in P. sojae. To characterize PY-NLSs in P. sojae. we experimentally defined the residues required by functional PY-NLSs in three P. sojae nuclear-localized proteins. These results showed that functional P. sojae PY-NLSs include an additional cluster of basic residues for efficient nuclear import.

We explored the redundancy and diversity functions of the phytochrome family in the control of seed responsiveness to light and gibberellins (GA) by using a set of phytochrome mutants of Arabidopsis.

Light is an essential source of environmental information throughout the plant’s life cycle. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana possesses five phytochromes (phyA-phyE) with important roles in germination. seedling establishment. shade avoidance. and flowering. However. our understanding of the phytochrome signaling network is incomplete. and little is known about the individual roles of phytochromes and how they function cooperatively to mediate light responses. Here. we used a bottom-up approach to study the phytochrome network. We added each of the five phytochromes to a phytochrome-less background to study their individual roles and then added the phytochromes by pairs to study their interactions. By analyzing the 16 resulting genotypes. we revealed unique roles for each phytochrome and identified novel phytochrome interactions that regulate germination and the onset of flowering. Furthermore. we found that ambient temperature has both phytochrome-dependent and -independent effects. suggesting that multiple pathways integrate temperature and light signaling. Surprisingly. none of the phytochromes alone conferred a photoperiodic response. Although phyE and phyB were the strongest repressors of flowering. both phyB and phyC were needed to confer a flowering response to photoperiod. Thus. a specific combination of phytochromes is required to detect changes in photoperiod. whereas single phytochromes are sufficient to respond to light quality. indicating how phytochromes signal different light cues.,True,g-OEQEIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,24,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006413,11020255328269045471,/scholar?cites=11020255328269045471,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006413,0,0,0

These plants are designed to maximize energy capture. In green plants. their morphology changes to maximize energy capture as well. but also to avoid light in excess. which can damage plant tissues. Contrary to mirrors in thermosolar plants. located in desert land and organized in regular arrays. most green plants grow surrounded of vegetation and their own tissues are not regularly spaced. new leaves tend to shade older leaves. Hence. plants need to use light as a source of information in order to properly locate their “sunlight collectors” and be able to efficiently use light as an energy source for photosynthesis. To monitor environmental light conditions. plants are equipped with several families of photoreceptors: the cryptochromes. the phytochromes and the LOV-domain bearing photoreceptors. While phytochromes perceive light most effectively in the red/far-red region of the spectrum. cryptochromes and LOV photoreceptors detect blue and UV-A light. Downstream these photoreceptors. plants have evolved sophisticated transcriptional networks that mediate metabolic and developmental changes in response to light. These light-regulated processes include seed germination. seedling photomophogenesis. greening. shade avoidance. photoperiodic responses and senescence.

Using a simple in vivo assay in bacterial culture. in the present study we demonstrate that ATP7B can confer resistance to cisplatin by sequestering the drug in its N-terminal metal-binding domain without active drug extrusion from the cell. Expression of a protein fragment containing four N-terminal MBRs (metal-binding repeats) of ATP7B (MBR1–4) protects cells from the toxic effects of cisplatin. One MBR1–4 molecule binds up to three cisplatin molecules at the copper-binding sites in the MBRs. The findings of the present study suggest that suppressing enzymatic activity of ATP7B may not be an effective way of combating cisplatin resistance.

These compounds may be detrimental to consumers. but can also protect herbivores against parasites. Floral nectar commonly contains secondary metabolites. but little is known about the impacts of nectar chemistry on pollinators. including bees. We hypothesized that nectar secondary metabolites could reduce bee parasite infection. We inoculated individual bumblebees with Crithidia bombi. an intestinal parasite. and tested effects of eight naturally occurring nectar chemicals on parasite population growth. Secondary metabolites strongly reduced parasite load. with significant effects of alkaloids. terpenoids and iridoid glycosides ranging from 61 to 81%.

The consumption of plant secondary compounds can be toxic to herbivores in large doses. but can also improve survival in parasitized herbivores. In addition. recent studies have found that consuming nectar secondary compounds may decrease parasite loads in pollinators. However. the effect of compound dose on bee survival and parasite loads has not been assessed. To determine how secondary compound consumption affects survival and pathogen load in Bombus impatiens. we manipulated the presence of a common gut parasite. Crithidia bombi. and dietary concentration of anabasine. a nectar alkaloid produced by Nicotiana spp. using four concentrations naturally observed in floral nectar. We hypothesized that increased consumption of secondary compounds at concentrations found in nature would decrease survival of uninfected bees. but improve survival and ameliorate parasite loads in infected bees. We found medicinal effects of anabasine in infected bees; the high-anabasine diet decreased parasite loads and increased the probability of clearing the infection entirely. However. survival time was not affected by any level of anabasine concentration. or by interactive effects of anabasine concentration and infection. Crithidia infection reduced survival time by more than two days. but this effect was not significant. Our results support a medicinal role for anabasine at the highest concentration; moreover. we found no evidence for a survival-related cost of anabasine consumption across …,True,V6UQ3UoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,19,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142496,6424819711591267045,/scholar?cites=6424819711591267045,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142496,0,0,0

The tree nut crop macadamia has a remarkable domestication history. from subtropical rain forests in Australia through Hawaii to global cultivation all within the last century. The industry is based primarily on Macadamia integrifolia and M. integrifolia-M. tetraphylla hybrid cultivars with Hawaiian cultivars the main contributors to world production. Sequence data from the chloroplast genome assembled using a genome skimming strategy was used to determine population structure among remnant populations of the main progenitor species. Macadamia integrifolia. Phylogenetic analysis of a 506 bp chloroplast SNP alignment from 64 wild and cultivated accessions identified phylogeographic structure and deep divergences between clades providing evidence for historical barriers to seed dispersal. High levels of variation were detected among wild accessions. Most Hawaiian cultivars. however. shared a single chlorotype that was also present at two wild sites at Mooloo and Mt Bauple from the northernmost distribution of the species in south-east Queensland.

Two loci for extreme resistance to PVY. one on chromosome XI and the other on XII. have been identified and used in breeding. The latter corresponds to a well-known source of resistance (Solanum stoloniferum). whereas the one on chromosome XI was reported from S. stoloniferum and S. tuberosum group Andigena as well. To elucidate its taxonomic origin in our breeding lines. we analyzed the nucleotide sequences of tightly linked markers (M45.

Identifying the active ingredient of Henna species grown in different regions of the world will definitely advance its therapeutic application. The in vitro antimicrobial screening of the Algerian henna leaves (Lawsonia inermis Linn.) was assessed against four strains of pathogenic bacteria. namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. and one multidrug resistant yeast namely C. albicans ATCC 10231. The henna DMSO. ethanolic and ethyl acetate leaves extracts were found to be the most active fractions against gram positive bacteria S. aureus and E. faecalis and the yeast C. albican. Such data suggests that this activity is strongly related to the presence of Lawsone in henna leaves.

This is of critical importance to space radiation. which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study. the γ-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation. which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p (66)/Be (40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that γ-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum γ-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65±0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29±0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation. remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h. the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.

Although there are enough historical evidence to support the theory that climate change is a natural phenomenon. many research scientists are widely in agreement that the increase in temperature in the 20th century is anthropologically related. The associated effects are the variability of rainfall and cyclonic patterns that are being observed globally.

However. we know little about the effectiveness of the games on students’ experiences and knowledge acquisition. Many current games are supplemental games (SG) that have no meaningful interaction with the subject matter. We adapted the experiential gaming (EG) model where students were immersed in goal-orientated tasks found in real-life situations. and they tackled questions to complete actions for their main task. Classroom-based games were created for eight different conservation topics for an annual Wildlife Conservation Course and an annual Diploma in International Wildlife Conservation Practice. Data were collected over two cycles. a total sample size of 55 multinational students. We used a combination of repeated-measures design and counterbalanced measures design; each student was subjected at least twice to each of the EG and didactic instruction (DI) treatments. and at least once to the SG approach. We compared students’ perception. learning and behavioural responses to the treatments. including measures of student personality types and learning styles as explanatory variables. Findings revealed multiple benefits of the classroom EG compared to the DI approach. such as increased attention retention. increased engagement and added intrinsic motivation. The improved level of intrinsic motivation was mainly facilitated by increased social bonding between participants. Further. we show that this EG approach appeals to a wide range of learning styles and personalities.

Agonistic behaviour between heterospecifics. in which individuals of one species are aggressive towards another. can elucidate direct and indirect inter-species competition and threats. New Zealand forests. with their unique avian communities. offer an ideal system to study these aggressive interactions. Several native New Zealand birds. such as the bellbird (korimako. Anthornis melanura; Withers 2009) and brown creeper (pīpipi. Mohoua novaeseelandiae; Gray 1969). are known to show aggression towards rifleman (tītitipounamu. Acanthisitta chloris). the smallest New Zealand bird. Here. we describe the vocal and physical behaviours of rifleman in response to aggression from other New Zealand bird species. in particular the grey warbler (riroriro. Gerygone igata; Stidolph 1939). tūī (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae). and North Island robin (toutouwai. Petroica longipes). Because aggression from grey warblers was the most commonly observed. we then focus on grey warbler aggression and contrast it with the levels of aggression observed from other species (bellbird. tūī. and North Island robin) towards rifleman. In addition. grey warblers are a similar size to rifleman (rifleman 5–7 g. grey warblers 6 g). Finally. we suggest possible explanations for the aggressive behaviour of grey warbler towards rifleman fledglings.From September 2018 to February 2019. we monitored a rifleman population throughout their breeding season in Boundary Stream Mainland Island Reserve.

Acanthisitta chloris) is a small (5–7 g) New Zealand endemic bird that lives in forested areas throughout the country. It is socially monogamous. with occasional cooperative breeding behaviour. It builds dome-shaped nests with a single entrance (~ 2.5 cm) in a variety of locations. including tree cavities. the dead fronds of tree fern trunks. and on the ground underneath leaf residues or roots (Sherley 1990). It breeds from September to February and can successfully rear several broods a year (Gray 1969; Sherley 1985). Predators include native New Zealand species like the morepork (ruru. Ninox novaeseelandiae)(Denny 2009). as well as introduced mammalian predators such as rats (Rattus spp.) and stoats (Mustela erminea)(Robertson 1985; Gill 2019). However. predation by long-tailed cuckoos (koekoeā. Eudynamys taitensis) on rifleman has not previously been reported. Here we describe observations of long-tailed cuckoo predation on rifleman nestlings and the vocal response of rifleman towards long-tailed cuckoos.

Although the ‘Hill-Robertson (HR) interference’ model was suggested as an explanation for the correlation. we present an alternative explanation for the relationship between gene length and evolutionary rate. First. genes with longer coding sequences were significantly more essential and evolved more slowly than genes with shorter CDSs. and they contained more functional domains within the gene. Surprisingly. the same trends held for the lengths of other subcomponents; genes that carried longer 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and introns were more essential.

The kernels are designed during the training phase of the SVM using optimal spectral weights estimated using the Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm. a popular modern stochastic optimization algorithm. The optimized kernel functions are then in the SVM paradigm for bi-classification of pixels in hyperspectral images. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by implementing it on three widely used benchmark hyperspectral data sets. two of which were taken over agricultural sites at Indian Pines. Indiana. and Salinas Valley. California. by the Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

However. the quality of crystalline semiconductors is highly sensitive to the substrate upon which it is grown. preventing multiple materials from being directly grown on single substrates. To circumvent this challenge. many complex growth strategies have been developed. such as strain relaxation buffer-layers. nanostructure growth. and template selective epitaxy. However. even with these advanced growth techniques. the growth of manufacturable crystalline materials is still limited to crystalline surfaces.

However limitations arise in the form of cold junction compensation and non-linearity of the thermocouple emf. The present paper proposes an analog signal conditioning circuit that performs the dual task of cold junction compensation and linearization. Cold junction compensation is done using a thermistor based circuit to emulate the output voltages of the thermocouple at different ambient temperatures with respect to 0°C. and linearization is performed by employing a temperature-compensated dual-input logarithmic amplifier.

Orthologues of BST-2 have been identified in several species. including human. monkeys. pig. mouse. cat and sheep. All have been reported to possess antiviral activity. Duplication of the BST-2 gene has been observed in sheep and the paralogues are referred to as ovine BST-2A and BST2-B. although only a single gene corresponding to BST-2 has been identified in most species. In this study. we identified three isoforms of bovine BST-2. named bBST-2A1. bBST-2A2 and bBST-2B. in bovine cells treated with type I interferon. but not in untreated cells. Both bBST-2A1 and bBST-2A2 are posttranslationally modified by N-linked glycosylation and a GPI-anchor as well as hBST-2. while bBST-2B has neither of these modifications. Exogenous expression of bBST-2A1 or bBST-2A2 markedly reduced the production of bovine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus from cells. while the antiviral activity of bBST-2B was much weaker than those of bBST-2A1 and bBST-2A2.

BCSH1 and bPRP1 are members of the growth hormone (GH)/prolactin (PRL) gene family. which are expressed simultaneously in BNC and are central to placentation and the progression of pregnancy in cattle. However. there is a paucity of information on the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of both the bCSH1 and bPRP1 genes. Recent studies. however. have demonstrated that the expression of a number of genes is controlled by the methylation status of their promoter region. In the present study. we examined the cell-type-specific epigenetic alterations of the 5'-flanking region of the bCSH1 and bPRP1 genes to gain an insight into their regulatory mechanisms. Analysis of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment demonstrated that bCSH1 expression is moderately induced in fibroblast cultures but enhanced in BT-1 cells. Sodium bisulfite based sequencing revealed that bCSH1 is hypomethylated in the cotyledonary tissue but not in the fetal skin. and this pattern was not altered with the progression of pregnancy. On the other hand. the methylation status of bPRP1 was similar between the cotyledon and fetal skin. The bPRP1 gene was exclusively hypermethylated in a bovine trophoblast cell-derived BT-1 cell-line.

These components include a RCAR/PYR/PYL family of ABA receptors. a group of PP2C phosphatases. and three SnRK2 kinases. However. how the interactions between the receptors and their targets are regulated by other proteins remains largely unknown. In a companion paper published in this issue. we showed that ROP11. a member of the plant‐specific Rho‐like small GTPase family. negatively regulates multiple ABA responses in Arabidopsis.

1056056,Release of GTP exchange factor mediated down-regulation of abscisic acid signal transduction through ABA-induced rapid degradation of RopGEFs,2016,Zixing Li and Rainer Waadt and Julian I Schroeder,14,PLoS biology,5,e1002461,Public Library of Science,The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is critical to plant development and stress responses. Abiotic stress triggers an ABA signal transduction cascade. which is comprised of the core components PYL/RCAR ABA receptors. PP2C-type protein phosphatases. and protein kinases. Small GTPases of the ROP/RAC family act as negative regulators of ABA signal transduction. However. the mechanisms by which ABA controls the behavior of ROP/RACs have remained unclear. Here. we show that an Arabidopsis guanine nucleotide exchange factor protein RopGEF1 is rapidly sequestered to intracellular particles in response to ABA. GFP-RopGEF1 is sequestered via the endosome-prevacuolar compartment pathway and is degraded. RopGEF1 directly interacts with several clade A PP2C protein phosphatases. including ABI1. Interestingly. RopGEF1 undergoes constitutive degradation in pp2c quadruple abi1/abi2/hab1/pp2ca mutant plants. revealing that active PP2C protein phosphatases protect and stabilize RopGEF1 from ABA-mediated degradation. Interestingly. ABA-mediated degradation of RopGEF1 also plays an important role in ABA-mediated inhibition of lateral root growth. The presented findings point to a PP2C-RopGEF-ROP/RAC control loop model that is proposed to aid in shutting off ABA signal transduction. to counteract leaky ABA signal transduction caused by “monomeric” PYL/RCAR ABA receptors in the absence of stress. and facilitate signaling in response to ABA.,True,HbrKwr4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,30,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002461,17031486428258614193,/scholar?cites=17031486428258614193,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002461,0,0,0

Studies have revealed that RopGEFs associate with receptor-like kinases to convey developmental signals to small ROP GTPases. However. how the activities of RopGEFs are modulated is not well understood. Type 2C protein phosphatases stabilize the RopGEF1 protein. indicating that phosphorylation may trigger RopGEF1 trafficking and degradation.

The EJC plays crucial post-splicing roles in export. translation. localization. and nonsense-mediated decay of mRNAs.

This requires prior deposition of the EJC in close proximity to either an upstream or downstream splicing event. If present in isolation. EJC-dependent introns are splicing-defective also in wild-type cells.

It is also important to understand the biology of these species. including. for bees. establishing their patterns of floral use and nesting-site preferences. Many introduced species share floral resources and compete for nesting sites with native species (Barthell et al. 1998). especially in urban settings (Matteson et al. 2008).

1056074,THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLLINATORS,2016,Laurence Packer and Erica Ali and Sheila Dumesh and Ken Walker,,Pollination Services to Agriculture: Sustaining and enhancing a key ecosystem service,,57,Routledge,The identification of a pollinating insect opens a path to a great wealth of information about it; however. obtaining that identification is rarely straightforward. Here we assess the current state of pollinator identification technologies with particular reference to bees.The origin of the saying “keys are written by people who don’t need them for people who can’t use them” has been disputed. This statement. or something similar. has a long currency (Walter and Winterton (2007) traced it to Lobanov (2003). but similar statements were made orally at least as early as the 1950s). The apparently numerous independent originations of this sentiment tell us a lot about the quality of the keys of the past. Fortunately. modern approaches to identification are a great improvement and. in the near future. promise to permit almost anyone to identify accurately almost any important pollinator for which sufficient taxonomic background work has been completed. In this chapter we compare some identification keys and discuss standard dichotomous and matrix-based approaches. Packer et al.(2009a) discuss some criticisms of traditional identification keys; their points are not reiterated here. We introduce facetted search as an alternative to both of these methods. We also present an update on the state of DNA barcoding as a tool for pollinator identification. As our expertise is with bees. we mostly restrict ourselves to them. although our assessment of key quality compares two bee and two flower fly publications. We should state at the outset that our comments are aimed at facilitating identifications by novices and should not be needed by experts.

1056089,Application of buckling restrained braces for seismic strengthening of irregular gravity load designed reinforced concrete frame buildings,2011,Jimmy Chandra and Pennung Warnitchai,13,Civil Engineering Dimension,2,65-74,,Past earthquake disasters have shown that irregular gravity load designed (GLD) reinforced concrete (RC) frame buildings were very vulnerable to strong ground shaking. Many of them collapsed and caused loss of human lives as well as materials. Hence. in order to prevent future disasters. this type of buildings needs to be strengthened against earthquake. This paper presents a case study of an innovative approach for seismic strengthening of a typical six story residential building with a soft/weak first story using buckling restrained braces (BRBs). The seismic performance of the original GLD building and the retrofitted one are compared using three dimensional nonlinear dynamic time history analysis in OpenSees. The analysis results show that the innovative seismic strengthening approach for irregular GLD RC frame buildings using BRBs can significantly reduce maximum story drifts as well as building damages which benefits in reducing the risk of buildingâ€™ s collapse during earthquake.,True,v0Ad-I4AAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C,4,https://ojs.petra.ac.id/ojsnew/index.php/civ/article/view/18226,17148231895703791038,/scholar?cites=17148231895703791038,,https://ojs.petra.ac.id/ojsnew/index.php/civ/article/download/18226/18095,0,0,0

However. there are still many errors with INDEL variant calling. driven by library preparation. sequencing biases. and algorithm artifacts. We characterized whole genome sequencing (WGS). whole exome sequencing (WES). and PCR-free sequencing data from the same samples to investigate the sources of INDEL errors. We also developed a classification scheme based on the coverage and composition to rank high and low quality INDEL calls. We performed a large-scale validation experiment on 600 loci. and find high-quality INDELs to have a substantially lower error rate than low-quality INDELs (7% vs. 51%). Simulation and experimental data show that assembly based callers are significantly more sensitive and robust for detecting large INDELs (>5 bp) than alignment based callers. consistent with published data. The concordance of INDEL detection between WGS and WES is low (53%). and WGS data uniquely identifies 10.8-fold more high-quality INDELs. The validation rate for WGS-specific INDELs is also much higher than that for WES-specific INDELs (84% vs. 57%). and WES misses many large INDELs.

Existing CNV detection methods mostly rely on read depth or alignment characteristics (paired-end distance and split reads) to infer gains/losses. while neglecting allelic intensity ratios and cannot quantify copy numbers. Additionally. most CNV callers are not scalable to handle a large number of WGS samples.To facilitate large-scale and rapid CNV detection from WGS data. we developed a Dynamic Programming Imputation (DPI) based algorithm called HadoopCNV. which infers copy number changes through both allelic frequency and read depth information. Our implementation is built on the Hadoop framework. enabling multiple compute nodes to work in parallel.Compared to two widely used tools – CNVnator and LUMPY. HadoopCNV has similar or better performance on both simulated data sets and real data on the NA12878 individual. Additionally. analysis on a 10-member pedigree showed that HadoopCNV has a Mendelian precision that is similar or better than other tools. Furthermore.

The aim of the study was to analyze the replication-capacity and susceptibility to maraviroc of HIV-1 clinical isolates with different tropism characteristics in primary monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDM). peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMC). and CD4+T-lymphocytes.  Methods Twenty-three HIV-1 isolates were phenotipically and genotipically characterized as R5. X4 or dual (discriminated as R5+/X4. R5/X4. R5/X4+). Phenotypic-tropism was evaluated by multiple-cycles-assay on U87MG-CD4+-CCR5+−/CXCR4+-expressing cells. Genotypic-tropism prediction was obtained using Geno2Pheno-algorithm (false-positive-rate [FPR] = 10%). Replication-capacity and susceptibility to maraviroc were investigated in human-primary MDM.

Canada,2004,MC Van Zyll de Jong and RJ Gibson and IG Cowx,11,Fisheries Management and Ecology,3‐4,183-193,Blackwell Science Ltd,Stocking and introduction of fishes began in Newfoundland and Labrador in the early 1880s. Introduced non‐native fishes and stocking of native fishes beyond their local range have established populations in many areas. Competition. predation and the possible introduction of parasites and diseases have all resulted from such stocking and introductions. Direct genetic effects have been caused by interbreeding with native species. Indirect genetic effects may have resulted from selective forces. genetic drift and inbreeding. Aquaculture and the creation of transgenic fish also pose a new threat to native fish. The effects of introductions as mitigation or enhancement tools are discussed. Although Newfoundland and Labrador is still relatively pristine. safeguards must be introduced to reduce the potential detrimental effects of these management practices.,True,vUxBsOYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,38,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2004.00390.x,8891365457795579693,/scholar?cites=8891365457795579693,,,0,0,0

Concern among ecological economists and other critics that economic growth results in loss of natural capital and ecosystem services led to introduction of the concept of “uneconomic growth.” defined as “growth of the macro economy that costs us more than it is worth” (Daly and Farley. Ecological economics principles and applications. Washington: Island Press; 2004). This paper proposes the concept of “unjust uneconomic growth” to pinpoint the additional costs of policies that promote uneconomic growth to the neglect of other considerations and uses the case of Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries policies since 1992 to document it. Newfoundland and Labrador fisheries experienced uneconomic growth in the 1980s leading to the collapse of ground fish stocks.

Olusanya and M. van Zyll de Jong,13,PLos ONE,12,e0208182,PLos ONE,Freshwater fish populations are rapidly declining globally due to the impacts of rapid climate change and existing non-climatic anthropogenic stressors. In response to these drivers. freshwater fishes are responding by shifting their distribution range. altering the timing of migration and spawning and through demographic processes. By 2050. the mean daily air temperature is predicted to increase by 2 to 3 degrees C in insular Newfoundland and by 3 to 4 degrees C in Labrador. Mean daily precipitation is also projected to increase in all locations. with increased intensity projected for several regions. To mitigate negative consequences of these changes. managers require analytical approaches that describe the vulnerability of fish to climate change. To address this need. the current study adopts the National Marine Fisheries Service vulnerability assessment framework to characterize the vulnerability of freshwater fishes in Newfoundland and Labrador. Twelve vulnerability indicators were developed from an extensive literature review and applied to the assessment. Experts were solicited using an online questionnaire survey and scores for exposure. sensitivity and adaptive capacity were collated and analyzed to derive a final vulnerability score and rank for each species. The analysis showed one species to be of high—very high vulnerability. two species were highly vulnerable while four species were moderately vulnerable to climate change.

During the insect life cycle. molts and metamorphosis delineate transitions from one developmental stage to the next. In most insects. pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone drive these developmental transitions by activating signaling cascades in target tissues. In holometabolous insects. ecdysone triggers metamorphosis. the remarkable remodeling of an immature larva into a sexually mature adult. The input from another developmental hormone. juvenile hormone (JH). is required to repress metamorphosis by promoting juvenile fates until the larva has acquired sufficient nutrients to survive metamorphosis.Ecdysone and JH act together as key endocrine timers to precisely control the onset of developmental transitions such as the molts. pupation. or eclosion.

Smc6 and Non-Smc-Element (Nse) proteins and is important for genome stability in many species. To identify novel components in the DNA repair pathway. we carried out a genetic screen to identify mutations that confer reduced resistance to the genotoxic effects of caffeine. which inhibits the ATM and ATR DNA damage response proteins. This approach identified inactivating mutations in CG5524 and MAGE. homologs of genes encoding Smc6 and Nse3 in yeasts. The fact that Smc5 mutants are also caffeine-sensitive and that Mage physically interacts with Drosophila homologs of Nse proteins suggests that the structure of the Smc5/6 complex is conserved in Drosophila. Although Smc5/6 proteins are required for viability in S. cerevisiae. they are not essential under normal circumstances in Drosophila. However. flies carrying mutations in Smc5. Smc6 and MAGE are hypersensitive to genotoxic agents such as ionizing radiation. camptothecin. hydroxyurea and MMS. consistent with the Smc5/6 complex serving a conserved role in genome stability. We also show that mutant flies are not compromised for pre-mitotic cell cycle checkpoint responses. Rather. caffeine-induced apoptosis in these mutants is exacerbated by inhibition of ATM or ATR checkpoint kinases but suppressed by Rad51 depletion. suggesting a functional interaction involving homologous DNA repair pathways that deserves further scrutiny.

Dysfunctional peroxisomes in gut epithelial cells activate Tor kinase-dependent autophagy that increases cell death and epithelial instability. which ultimately alter the composition of the intestinal microbiota. compromise immune pathways in the gut in response to infection. and affect organismal survival …,True,Bo-Ra5cAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,19,https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.E18-07-0434,14691565458398453466,/scholar?cites=14691565458398453466,,https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/pdf/10.1091/mbc.E18-07-0434,0,0,0

An organism’s overall metabolic status is now recognized as an important and long-overlooked mediator of immunity and has spurred new explorations of immune-related metabolic abnormalities. Peroxisomes are essential metabolic organelles with a central role in the synthesis and turnover of complex lipids and reactive species. Peroxisomes have recently been identified as pivotal regulators of immune functions and inflammation in the development and during infection. defining a new branch of immunometabolism. This review summarizes the current evidence that has helped to identify peroxisomes as central regulators of immunity and highlights the peroxisomal proteins and metabolites that have acquired relevance in human pathologies for their link to the development of inflammation. neuropathies. aging and cancer. This review then describes how peroxisomes govern immune signaling strategies such as phagocytosis and cytokine production and their relevance in fighting bacterial and viral infections. The mechanisms by which peroxisomes either control the activation of the immune response or trigger cellular metabolic changes that activate and resolve immune responses are also described.

1056145,The intestine of Drosophila melanogaster: an emerging versatile model system to study intestinal epithelial homeostasis and host-microbial interactions in humans,2019,Florence Capo and Alexa Wilson and Francesca Di Cara,7,,9,336,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In all metazoans. the intestinal tract is an essential organ to integrate nutritional signaling. hormonal cues and immunometabolic networks. The dysregulation of intestinal epithelium functions can impact organism physiology and. in humans. leads to devastating and complex diseases. such as inflammatory bowel diseases. intestinal cancers. and obesity. Two decades ago. the discovery of an immune response in the intestine of the genetic model system. Drosophila melanogaster. sparked interest in using this model organism to dissect the mechanisms that govern gut (patho) physiology in humans. In 2007. the finding of the intestinal stem cell lineage. followed by the development of tools available for its manipulation in vivo. helped to elucidate the structural organization and functions of the fly intestine and its similarity with mammalian gastrointestinal systems. To date. studies of the Drosophila gut have already helped to shed light on a broad range of biological questions regarding stem cells and their niches. interorgan communication. immunity and immunometabolism. making the Drosophila a promising model organism for human enteric studies. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the structure and functions of the Drosophila melanogaster intestine. asserting its validity as an emerging model system to study gut physiology. regeneration. immune defenses and host-microbiota interactions.

They define a novel gene family. showing identical time and tissue‐specificity limited to male germ cells where their transcription starts during meiotic prophase. These two genes encode for two slightly basic proteins highly homologous to each other and fairly rich in leucine and glutamic acid. Although strictly clustered. these genes utilize different promoter regions as revealed by examination of transgenic flies bearing mst36F‐promoter‐lacZ reporter constructs and by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assays.

The marina site is located on the east side of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) on the north and south sides of the Las Olas Boulevard bridge in Fort Lauderdale. Florida. Basically. the proposed marina development plan includes removing the existing marina and replacing it with piers and slips extending further waterward toward the ICW. At least three previous seagrass surveys had been conducted at the marina site and indicated that Halophila decipiens occurs in varying densities within the site between years (ie. over time). This species of Halophila has been described as an annual seagrass species regrowing each year from seed. Regrowth each year may be controlled by light (photoperiod); ßowering is primarily controlled by temperature. This seasonal regrowth may explain some of the variability between past investigations at the site.The intent of the seagrass investigation is to determine whether a statistically signiÞcant change in the distribution and abundance of H. decipiens occured as a direct result of demolition of the existing structures. construction of the new waterfront facility. and subsequent operations of the marina.

Louisiana. USA were oiled. sometimes heavily. in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Previous studies indicate that fiddler crabs (in the genus  Uca) and the salt marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) were negatively impacted in the short term by the spill. Here. we detail longer-term effects and recovery from moderate and heavy oiling over a 3-year span. beginning 30 months after the spill. Although neither fiddler crab burrow density nor diameter differed between oiled and reference sites when combined across all sampling events. these traits differed among some individual sampling periods consistent with a pattern of lingering oiling impacts. Periwinkle density. however. increased in all oiling categories and shell-length groups during our sampling period. and periwinkle densities were consistently highest at moderately oiled sites where  Spartina alterniflora aboveground biomass was highest. Periwinkle shell length linearly increased from a mean of 16.5 to 19.2 mm over the study period at reference sites. In contrast. shell lengths at moderately oiled and heavily oiled sites increased through month 48 after the spill. but then decreased. This decrease was associated with a decline in the relative abundance of large adults (shell length 21–26 mm) at oiled sites which was likely caused by chronic hydrocarbon toxicity or oil-induced effects on habitat quality or food resources. Overall. the recovery of  S. alterniflora facilitated the recovery of fiddler crabs and periwinkles.

Gene regulatory networks are typically constructed from gene expression data acquired following genetic perturbation or environmental stimulus. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) captures the gene expression state of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. offering advantages in combinatorial experimental design. large numbers of independent measurements. and accessing the interaction between the cell cycle and environmental responses that is hidden by population-level analysis of gene expression. To leverage these advantages. we developed a method for scRNAseq in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We pooled diverse transcriptionally barcoded gene deletion mutants in 11 different environmental conditions and determined their expression state by sequencing 38.285 individual cells. We benchmarked a framework for learning gene regulatory networks from scRNAseq data that incorporates multitask learning and constructed a global gene regulatory network comprising 12.228 interactions.,True,-fudS5IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,27,https://elifesciences.org/articles/51254,15375554404357810682,/scholar?cites=15375554404357810682,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/51254.pdf,0,0,0

In spite of such efforts. no consensus on best practices has been established and all current approaches vary substantially based on the available data and empirical tests. The k-Nearest Neighbor Graph (kNN-G) is often used to infer the identities of. and relationships between. cells and is the basis of many widely used dimensionality-reduction and projection methods. The kNN-G has also been the basis for imputation methods using. e.g.. neighbor averaging and graph diffusion. However. due to the lack of an agreed-upon optimal objective function for choosing hyperparameters. these methods tend to oversmooth data. thereby resulting in a loss of information with regard to cell identity and the specific gene-to-gene patterns underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this paper. we investigate the tuning of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods with a novel non-stochastic method for optimally preserving biologically relevant informative variance in single-cell data. The framework. Denoising Expression data with a Weighted Affinity Kernel and Self-Supervision (DEWÄKSS). uses a self-supervised technique to tune its parameters. We demonstrate that denoising with optimal parameters selected by our objective function (i) is robust to preprocessing methods using data from established benchmarks.

GABA initiates a transcriptional synapse remodeling program within these specialized microglia. which in turn sculpt inhibitory connectivity without impacting excitatory synapses. Ablation of GABA B receptors within microglia impairs this process and leads to stereotyped repetitive behavior and hyperactivity.

However. the molecular basis of biofilm formation and its regulation are not completely understood. Here. we describe an important role of the ClpP protease in biofilm development and virulence of S. epidermidis.

Biofilm forming ability of the mutant strain could be restored by expressing clpP on a plasmid. but not when a catalytically inactive allele of clpP gene was introduced.

The inactivation of PPE38 altered the bacterial cell surface properties and led to deficiencies in cord formation. sliding motility. and biofilm formation.

Using a highly discriminatory screening procedure for genes that influence biofilm formation. we identified the transcriptional regulator SarZ as a novel important determinant of biofilm formation and biofilm-associated infection. on the basis of the significant impact of sarZ on the transcription of the biosynthetic operon for biofilm exopolysaccharide. In addition. sarZ influenced the expression of a series of virulence genes. including genes that influence the expression of lipases and proteases. resistance to an important human antimicrobial peptide. and hemolysis.

However. little is known about how the immune system responds to these strains. To explore this issue. here we used reverse engineering and genome-wide expression profiling of human macrophage-like THP-1 cells infected by different Mtb strains of the W-Beijing family. as well as by the reference laboratory strain H37Rv. Detailed data mining revealed that host cell transcriptome responses to H37Rv and to different strains of the W-Beijing family are similar and overwhelmingly induced during Mtb infections. collectively typifying a robust gene expression signature (“THP1r2Mtb-induced signature”). Analysis of the putative transcription factor binding sites in promoter regions of genes in this signature identified several key regulators. namely STATs. IRF-1. IRF-7. and Oct-1. commonly involved in interferon-related immune responses. The THP1r2Mtb-induced signature appeared to be highly relevant to the interferon-inducible signature recently reported in active pulmonary tuberculosis patients. as revealed by cross-signature and cross-module comparisons. Further analysis of the publicly available transcriptome data from human patients showed that the signature appears to be relevant to active pulmonary tuberculosis patients and their clinical therapy. and be tuberculosis specific.

1056231,GCN5 opens the door for the IRF-4-mediated cascade of B cell differentiation,2014,Amanda J Moore and Michele Kay Anderson,95,,3,386-387,,Bcell development is a multilay-ered process that involves the restructuring of the transcriptional landscape of progenitor cells. As B cells progress through differentiation. they pass through discrete stages. during which. alternative lineage potential is lost. and a mature phenotype is acquired. The sequential orchestration of shifting cellular transcriptomes during this process is delicately controlled. Whereas the presence of transcriptional activators and repressors are important players in genetic programming during development. their functions are intertwined with and dependent on the chromatin configuration of the genes that they control. Transcriptome analysis has enabled many groups to determine important gene sets present in developing and mature subsets. including those of the T and B cell lineages [1]. However. to fully elucidate the gene regulatory networks of cells of a specific lineage at a defined developmental stage. the status of DNA occupancy must be assessed. in addition to the levels of mRNA for each regulator-target gene pair. Furthermore. the histone signatures that mark “open”.“closed”. and “poised” chromatin configurations are important for understanding how genes change over developmental time. even before mRNA expression commences. Thus. assessing the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during B cell development will be critical for a full picture of how these processes are regulated. Here.

We discovered that Paneth cells. specialized secretory cells in the small intestine. react to bacterial invasion by rerouting a critical secreted antibacterial protein through a macroautophagy/autophagy-based secretion system termed secretory autophagy. Mice harboring a mutation in an essential autophagy gene. a mutation which is common in Crohn disease patients. cannot reroute their antimicrobial cargo during bacterial invasion and thus have compromised innate immunity.

It was initially identified as a DNA-binding factor and a coactivator of the Androgen receptor. It was also characterized as a Golgi-associated protein. which is essential for acrosome formation during functional sperm development. However. the molecular roles of TMF in this intricate process have not been revealed. Here. we show that during spermiogenesis. TMF undergoes a dynamic change of localization throughout the Golgi apparatus. Specifically. TMF translocates from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network and to the emerging vesicles surface. as the round spermatids develop. Notably. lack of TMF led to an abnormal spatial orientation of the Golgi and to the deviation of the trans-Golgi surface away from the nucleus of the developing round spermatids. Concomitantly. pro-acrosomal vesicles derived from the TMF-/- Golgi lacked targeting properties and did not tether to the spermatid nuclear membrane thereby failing to form the acrosome anchoring scaffold. the acroplaxome. around the cell-nucleus. Absence of TMF also perturbed the positioning of microtubules. which normally lie in proximity to the Golgi and are important for maintaining Golgi spatial orientation and dynamics and for chromatoid body formation. which is impaired in TMF-/- spermatids. In-silico evaluation combined with molecular and electron microscopic analyses revealed the presence of a microtubule interacting domain (MIT) in TMF. and confirmed the association of TMF with microtubules in spermatogenic cells.

An association between elevated esterase activities and isozyme intensities has also been reported for resistance to the Cry1Ac toxin of Helicoverpa armigera.

Ltd,The widely accepted paradigm for the development of insecticide resistance in field populations of insects is of selection for one or a very few genes of major effect. Limited genetic mapping data for organophosphate and pyrethroid resistance in heliothine and spodopteran pests generally agrees with this paradigm. However. other biochemical and transcriptomic data suggest a more complex set of changes in multiple P450 and esterase gene/enzyme systems in resistant strains of these species. We discuss possible explanations for this paradox. including the likely embedding of these genes in regulatory cascades and emerging evidence for their arrangement in large clusters of closely related genes. We conclude that there could indeed be an unusually large number of genetic options for evolving resistance in these species. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry,True,PUMcnKgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,33,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ps.3542,9111879856965459039,/scholar?cites=9111879856965459039,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ps.3542,0,0,0

One mutation converts a Glycine to an Aspartate. and the other converts a Tryptophan to a Leucine in the enzymes’ active site. One of the dipteran enzymes with the Leucine mutation also shows enhanced activity against pyrethroids. Introduction of the two mutations in vitro into eight esterases from six other widely separated insect groups has also been reported to increase substantially the OP hydrolase activity of most of them. These data suggest that the two mutations could contribute to OP. and possibly pyrethroid. resistance in a variety of insects. We therefore introduced them in vitro into eight Helicoverpa armigera esterases from a clade that has already been implicated in OP and pyrethroid resistance. We found that they do not generally enhance either OP or pyrethroid hydrolysis in these esterases but the Aspartate mutation did increase OP hydrolysis in one enzyme by about 14 fold and the Leucine mutation caused a 4–6 fold increase in activity (more in one case) of another three against some of the most insecticidal isomers of fenvalerate and cypermethrin.

Thirteen of the enzymes obtained in sufficient yield for further analysis all showed tight binding to organophosphates and low but measurable organophosphate hydrolase activity. However there was no clear difference in activity between the isozymes from regions associated with resistance and those from elsewhere in the zymogram. or between eight of the isozymes from a phylogenetic clade previously associated with resistance in proteomic and quantitative rtPCR experiments and five others not so associated. By contrast. the enzymes differed markedly in their activities against nine pyrethroid isomers and the enzymes with highest activity for the most insecticidal isomers were from regions of the gel and. in some cases. the phylogeny that had previously been associated with pyrethroid resistance.

This study examined the extent to which barriers to gene flow contribute to cross-shelf patterns by examining the mitochondrial DNA of gobies (genus Eviota). The genus Eviota was selected due to its extreme life history characteristics (shortest vertebrate lifespan) and cross-shelf distribution patterns (E. queenslandica. inner- and mid-shelf. and E. albolineata mid- and outer-shelf).

This thesis examines the contribution of metabolic enzymes to resistance. with a focus on the carboxylcholinesterases (CCEs. or esterases). CCEs have been implicated in metabolic resistance to several insecticide classes (including SPs and OPs) in a range of species. The large number of recently radiated esterases found in those species within available sequenced genomes suggests the potential for them to play some role in xenobiotic detoxification. Of particular interest is the recently radiated 'Clade 1' (as proposed by Teese et al. 2010). Cytochrome P450s (P450s) are also crucial players in the metabolic detoxification story. P450s have been proposed to be involved in resistance through active site mutations. upregulation and/or duplication and amplification. In an attempt to characterise the esterases of H. amigera that might be involved in resistance I first used a baculovirus system to express 14 full length midgut esterases sequences.  Thirteen of the enzymes yielded sufficient quantity to conduct OP and SP activity assays. All showed tight binding to OPs and low but measurable OP hydrolase activity.

Production of larger rainbow trout provides a distinguishable product. Research that describes the growth performance and fillet quality of large rainbow trout is limited. particularly for trout cultured in recirculating aquaculture systems. A study was conducted evaluating the growth performance and fillet quality attributes of allfemale rainbow trout reared using freshwater recirculating systems operated at a mean water temperature of 13 C. under constant lighting. and with around-the-clock feeding. Rainbow trout grew to 4.8 kg in 22 months post-hatch. Growth rates declined with the onset of reproductive maturity. Rainbow trout weighed 5.2 kg at 26 months. The mean ratio of feed provided to biomass gain was 1.36: 1 from first feeding to 22 months but increased substantially from 23-25 months. As rainbow trout approached reproductive maturity. 10 fish were collected at specified intervals for assessment of fillet quality attributes. Fillet yield peaked at 20-22 months when trout were 3.8-4.8 kg. Cook yield. cooked fillet firmness. and crude fat decreased; while fillet moisture and raw fillet firmness increased from 24-26 months. Changes in fillet quality coincided with reduced growth rates. decreased feed efficiency. and increasing gonadosomatic index.

1056307,Molecular analysis of genes involved in the synthesis of proanthocyanidins in theobroma cacao,2009,Yi Liu,,,,,,The flavonoids catechin and epicatechin. and their polymerized oligomers. the proanthocyanidins (PAs. also called condensed tannins). accumulate to levels of up to 15% of the total weight of dry seeds of Theobroma cacao L. These compounds have been associated with several health benefits in humans including antioxidant activity. improvement of cardiovascular health and reduction of cholesterol levels. They also play important roles in pest and disease defense throughout the plant. This research focuses on molecularly dissecting the proanthocyanidin biosynthetic pathway of Theobroma cacao. To this end. I first isolated candidate genes from T. cacao (Tc) encoding key structural enzymes of this pathway which include. anthocyanidin reductase (ANR). leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX. also called anthocyanidin synthase. ANS) and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR). I performed gene expression profiling of candidate TcANR. TcANS and TcLAR in various tissues through different developmental stages and also evaluated PA accumulation levels in those tissues. My results suggested that all PA candidate genes are co-regulated and positively correlated with PA synthesis. To functionally analyze the candidate genes. I used the model plants Arabidopsis and tobacco as expression platforms. Results from Arabidopsis mutant complementation tests and transgenic tobacco plants constitutively overexpressing cacao genes demonstrate that the candidate structural genes isolated from cacao are true ANS.

We now document that protoporphyrin IX (PPIX)‐ as well as Zinc‐protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP)‐treated hepatocytes. cellular models of acute hepatic protoporphyria and/or oxidative stress. showed an even greater loss of CYP2B. This loss is associated with a significant oligomerization and crosslinking of SQSTM1/p62. a cellular protein scaffold that selects substrate‐cargo for autophagy. This CYP2B loss can also be partially reversed by the autophagic/lysosomal inhibitors 3‐methyladenine and NH4Cl. These observations suggest that p62 mediates the autophagic‐lysosomal degradation of CYP2B. To test this possibility. we co‐expressed p62 together with CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in HEK297T cells.

We present the results of a field study. conducted in February 2009. Salamandra in fraimmaculata was found at six localities. ranging from 228 to 960 m asl. and co-occurred with O. vittatus at three localities. All localities were near small. clear streams or springs. Temperatures ranged from 9.4 to 16.4 C. pH 7.5–8.5. GH 3–18 and KH 3–18. The distribution model of S. infraimmaculata reveals that the distribution of this species is nearly entirely shaped by precipitation in the coldest quarter “92.9% contribution to the model”. The rarity of suitable surface waters is probably the main reason for the supposed scarcity of this species in northwestern Syria. Tapping a water source for drinking water resulted in one case in extensive mortality of larvae. Ommatotriton vittatus was found at nine different localities. ranging from 172 to 960 m asl Habitat characteristics. water quality and morphological data were recorded. The average total length of adult O. vittatus was 116 mm (range 93–138 mm. n= 22) for males and 93 mm (range 86–108 mm. n= 34) for females. Mean weight was 6.7 g for males and 3.9 for females. The mean body condition index of females was comparable to that of males. Water temperatures ranged from 8.7 to 14.6 C. pH 7.5–8.5. GH 3–18 and KH 3–18.

Another critical audience is undergraduate students in introductory biology and genetics courses. To improve the learning of genetics. there is a need to first assess students' understanding of genetics concepts and their level of genetics literacy (i.e.. genetics knowledge as it relates to. and affects. their lives). We have developed and evaluated a new instrument to assess the genetics literacy of undergraduate students taking introductory biology or genetics courses.

Such developmental plasticity may be adaptive and positively correlate with environmental heterogeneity. However. the evolution of developmental plasticity among closely related taxa is not well understood. To determine the evolutionary pattern of plasticity. we compared plasticity in time to and size at metamorphosis in response to water desiccation in tadpoles among spadefoot species that differ in breeding pond and larval period durations. Like most tadpoles. spadefoot tadpoles possess the remarkable ability to accelerate development in response to pond drying to avoid desiccation. Here. we hypothesize that desert spadefoot tadpoles have evolved reduced plasticity to avoid desiccation in ephemeral desert pools compared to their nondesert relatives that breed in long‐duration ponds.

A dramatic vertebrate example is during frog metamorphosis. where transformation of the hind limb. brain. intestine. liver. and tail are completely dependent on thyroid hormone (TH) but occurs asynchronously during development. TH transporters (THTs) and cytosolic TH binding proteins (CTHBPs) have been proposed to affect the timing of tissue transformation based on expression profiles and in vitro studies. but they have not been previously tested in vivo. We used a combination of expression pattern. relative expression level. and in vivo functional analysis to evaluate the potential for THTs (LAT1. OATP1c1. and MCT8) and CTHBPs (PKM2.

Oxford University Press, Oxford",,87-97,,A vast body of work exists on the endocrine regulation of frog metamorphosis (Dodd and Dodd 1976. Shi 1999. Denver et al. 2002. Buchholz et al. 2006. Furlow and Neff 2006. Brown and Cai 2007). and a separate set of literature describes the dramatic larval period diversity found among amphibians (Duellman and Trueb 1994. McDiarmid and Altig 1999). This chapter begins to unite these topics by addressing endocrine and molecular mechanisms underlying life history evolution in larval amphibians. Amphibian metamorphic life history diversity includes species differences in time to. and size at. metamorphosis. evolution of direct developing forms from typical free-living larvae. and neoteny. Ecological aspects of this diversity are not covered. nor is the diversity of reproductive modes. Metamorphic life history parameters are under neuroendocrine control. including both central and peripheral control mechanisms (Fig. 7-1). Despite limited evidence. theory suggests mechanistic changes at the central level of control. whereas evolution of control at the peripheral level has been more adequately demonstrated.

Investigations of Undergraduate Genetic Literacy,2007,CHRISTINE LAUREN MOSKALIK,,,,,,This research extends previous studies of undergraduate genetic literacy in two ways:(1) we assessed a 2006 undergraduate genetics education workshop for college faculty teaching genetics using three different measures. Based on participants’ feedback from immediate and long-term evaluations. we determined that the workshop was effective at meeting its objectives. However. meaningful conclusions regarding the workshops’ impact on course modifications and student learning could not be established due to limited data.(2) At one university. genetic literacy of biology majors was assessed. and compared with that of non-science majors. using two different instruments. The observed trendline was that increased biology experience yields increased genetic literacy; however the level of genetic literacy attained was lower than expected. Assuming the goals of these courses are consistent with our definition of genetic literacy. and how we measured it. the results suggest a need to modify both the content and pedagogy in these courses.,True,JL9icDoAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=ucin1195583851,17112267680177945114,/scholar?cites=17112267680177945114,,https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=ucin1195583851&disposition=inline,0,0,0

1056351,Session 3f: Little Changes: Evolving Your Lessons with Kid-Friendly Text and Inquiry Activities,2018,Christine L Moskalik and Nicole Ross,,,,,,Limited instructional time and resources often make it difficult to meet both Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in the elementary classroom. Further. many elementary school teachers have no formal training in the STEM disciplines making it challenging to find connections and integrate complex topics. In the middle school classroom. disciplines are often taught in silos. allowing different content areas to be addressed independently. but potentially losing opportunities to integrate natural connections that lend context to the content. Kid-friendly text can aid in satisfying multiple standards across disciplines while engaging students and challenging them to own the content and encouraging them to “think like a scientist”. In this session we explore the use of text sources in example activities focused on the complex topic of heredity and natural selection. Through these examples. we address how learning one topic can evolve as children progress not just through a unit. but through their many years of schooling.

Here. we show that the RNA-binding protein Pumilio2 (PUM2). which is a translation repressor. is induced upon aging and acts as a negative regulator of lifespan and mitochondrial homeostasis. Multi-omics and cross-species analyses of PUM2 function show that it inhibits the translation of the mRNA encoding for the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). thereby impairing mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. This mechanism is conserved in C. elegans by the PUM2 ortholog PUF-8. puf-8 knock-down in old nematodes and Pum2 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout in the muscles of elderly mice enhances mitochondrial fission and mitophagy in both models. hence improving mitochondrial quality control and tissue homeostasis.

1056359,Enhancing mitochondrial quality control to fight neuromuscular degeneration in aging and disease,2021,Mario Romani,,,THESIS,,EPFL,Loss of mitochondrial function and proteostasis typify aging and age-associated degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and muscle aging. To date. no cure or preventive measure is available to manage these conditions. Alterations of cellular proteostasis. such as accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins. can directly affect mitochondrial homeostasis leading to activation of specific mitochondrial stress pathways capable of maintaining mitochondrial function. However. the contribution of these pathways in age-associated diseases characterized by proteotoxic aggregates is largely unknown. My thesis aims to understand the connection between cellular and mitochondrial proteostasis with a particular focus on mitochondrial stress pathways involved in the response to proteotoxic stress. To this end. I performed 2 studies: Reduction of Amyloid-beta proteotoxicity through activation of mitochondrial quality control: Accumulation of Amyloid-beta (Aß) peptidic aggregates. generated by the miscleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). is often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However. it is largely unknown how mitochondria react to these proteotoxic insults. We identified a cross-species conserved mitochondrial stress response. from nematodes to humans. activated during Aß proteotoxic stress. This response entails key mitochondrial quality control pathways such as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and mitophagy.

1056383,Effect of Cigarette Smoking on Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in Lung Cancer.,2016,Trung Vu and Jin Lin and Pran K Datta,5,Journal of Clinical Medicine,4,,,Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that allows an epithelial cell to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype through multiple biochemical changes resulting in an increased migratory capacity. During cancer progression. EMT is found to be associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. In this review. we focus on the discussion of recent studies about the regulation of EMT by cigarette smoking. Various groups of active compounds found in cigarette smoke such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK). and reactive oxygen specicies (ROS) can induce EMT through different signaling pathways. The links between EMT and biological responses to cigarette smoke. such as hypoxia. inflammation. and oxidative damages. are also discussed. The effect of cigarette smoke on EMT is not only limited to cancer types directly related to smoking. such as lung cancer. but has also been found in other types of cancer. Altogether. this review emphasizes the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms of the induction of EMT by cigarette smoking and will help in identifying novel small molecules for targeting EMT induced by smoking.

Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here. we show the molecular mechanism by which STRAP induces CRC metastasis by promoting β-catenin signaling through its stabilization. We have genetically engineered a series of murine and human CRC and lung cancer cell lines to investigate the effects of STRAP on cell migration and invasion in vitro. and on tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Downregulation of STRAP inhibits invasion. tumorigenicity. and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically.

STRAP that plays a role in maintenance of mesenchymal morphology by regulating E-cadherin and that enhances tumorigenicity partly by downregulating CDK inhibitor p21Cip1. However. the functional mechanism of regulation of E-cadherin and p21Cip1 by STRAP is unknown. Here. we have employed STRAP knock out and knockdown cell models (mouse embryonic fibroblast. human cancer cell lines) to show how STRAP downregulates E-cadherin and p21Cip1 by abrogating the binding of Sp1 to its consensus binding sites. Moreover. ChIP assays suggest that STRAP recruits HDAC1 to Sp1 binding sites in p21Cip1 promoter.

METHODS: The proliferation-inhibiting capability of K562 cells was investigated by MTT assay and colony conform test. The apoptosis effect of Berberine on K562 cells were analyzed by Wright's-Giemsa staining; DNA fragmentation was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The cell cycle distribution and the cell surface marker-cluster of differentiation were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Berberine effectively inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. In addition. when combined with different concentrations of Ara-C. the cells' viability percentage was prominently higher than only Berberine used. Treated with Berberine for 48 hours. the cells could be induced differentiation towards erythrocyte. granulocyte and megakaryocyte and with the treated time extending. the percentage of apoptosis cells gradually increased.

Xanthomonas spp. manipulate plant signaling by using a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into host cells. We examined the ability of 33 Xanthomonas effectors to inhibit cell death induced by overexpression of components of MAPK cascades in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Five effectors inhibited cell death induced by overexpression of MAPKKKα and MEK2. but not of MAP3Kε. In addition. expression of AvrBs1 in yeast suppressed activation of the high osmolarity glycerol MAPK pathway. suggesting that the target of this effector is conserved in eukaryotic organisms.

Budding yeast serves as a powerful system to understand the fundamental regulatory mechanisms that allow these pathways to combine multiple signals and deliver an appropriate response. To fully comprehend the variability and dynamics of these signaling cascades. dynamic and quantitative single cell measurements are required.

Combination of fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis allows the quantification of the dynamics of kinase activity in hundreds of single cells. A large heterogeneity in the dynamics of MAPK activity between individual cells was measured. The variability in the mating pathway can be accounted for by differences in cell cycle stage. while. in the cell wall integrity pathway. the response to cell wall stress is independent of cell cycle stage.

While rhythmic gene expression of circadian genes is well-described in populations of cells. the single-cell mRNA dynamics of multiple core-clock genes remain largely unknown.

While transcript number scales with cell size for all genes. gene-to-gene correlations of mRNA number depends on the gene pair. To account for these features of the data. we develop a probabilistic model for multivariate smFISH mRNA counts that quantifies changes in transcriptional bursting across genes and over circadian time. We identify a mixture model of negative binomials as the preferred model of the mRNA count distributions. which accounts for cell-to-cell heterogeneity. notably in cell size. The paired count data and modelling allows the decomposition of mRNA variability into distinct noise sources. showing that circadian clock time contributes only a small fraction of the total variability in mRNA number between cells.

This cell-to-cell heterogeneity results from a complex process of differentiation initiated by the interpretation of intra and extracellular cues by signalling cascades. Therefore. it becomes fundamental to study the signal processing driven by signalling cascades. in order to understand how cells organise during development. but also to comprehend how and why signals are some- times misinterpreted and lead to diseases such as cancer.  MAPK pathways belong to a very well-conserved family of signalling cascades. known to be mostly implicated in the adaptation to environmental stimuli and to regulate various key physiological processes.

It induces drastic changes in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Actually. translation is strongly affected with a blockade of the classical cap-dependent mechanism. whereas alternative mechanisms are activated to support the translation of specific mRNAs. A major mechanism involved in stress-activated translation is the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-driven initiation. IRESs. first discovered in viral mRNAs. are present in cellular mRNAs coding for master regulators of cell responses. whose expression must be tightly controlled. IRESs allow the translation of these mRNAs in response to different stresses. including DNA damage. amino-acid starvation. hypoxia or endoplasmic reticulum stress. as well as to physiological stimuli such as cell differentiation or synapse network formation. Most IRESs are regulated by IRES trans-acting factor (ITAFs). exerting their action by at least nine different mechanisms. This review presents the history of viral and cellular IRES discovery as well as an update of the reported ITAFs regulating cellular mRNA translation and of their different mechanisms of action.

In particular. combined gene therapy has shown improved therapeutic efficiency. Internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). RNA elements naturally present in the 5’untranslated regions of a few mRNAs. constitute a powerful tool to co-express several genes of interest. IRESs are translational enhancers allowing the translational machinery to start protein synthesis by internal initiation. This feature allowed the design of multi-cistronic vectors expressing several genes from a single mRNA. IRESs exhibit tissue specificity. and drive translation in stress conditions when the global cell translation is blocked. which renders them useful for gene transfer in hypoxic conditions occurring in ischemic diseases and cancer.

Effective design of TALENs requires a combination of selecting appropriate genetic features. finding pairs of binding sites based on a consensus sequence. and. in some cases. identifying endogenous restriction sites for downstream molecular genetic applications. We present the web-based program Mojo Hand for designing TAL and TALEN constructs for genome editing applications (                     http://www.talendesign.org                                        ).

(2) analysis of any DNA sequence to reveal pairs of binding sites based on a user-defined template. (3) selection of restriction-enzyme recognition sites in the spacer between the TAL monomer binding sites including options for the selection of restriction enzyme suppliers. and (4) output files designed for subsequent TALEN construction using the Golden Gate assembly method. Mojo Hand enables the rapid identification of TAL binding sites for use in TALEN design. The assembly of TALEN constructs. is also simplified by using the TAL-site prediction program in conjunction with a spreadsheet management aid of reagent concentrations and TALEN formulation.

Energy transduction is the definitive systemic feature of the myosin motor performed by coordinating in a time ordered sequence: ATP hydrolysis at the active site. actin affinity modulation at the actin binding site. and the lever-arm rotation of the power stroke.

Heat tolerance increased rapidly after exposing plants or cells to acclimation temperatures. reaching a maximum after 10 to 16 hours and 10 to 12 hours for leaves and cultured cells. respectively. Free and bound ABA levels increased sharply during the first hour of heat acclimation. before leaves and cultured cells reached their maximum beat tolerance. The increase in ABA during heat acclimation was 2- to 3-fold that of the nonacclimated control. and the time of the ABA accumulation peak in tissue roughly corresponded to the maximum heat tolerance in leaves and cultured cells. Heat tolerance was induced in cultured cells by exogenous ABA application. Heat tolerance increased significantly after 24 hours of ABA application at 7.6 or 9.5 μm.

The response of six rice (Oryza sativus L.) cultivars to different sodium chloride levels; 0. 30. 60. 90. 120. and 150 mM were investigated during germination and early seedling stages. Germination percent. mean germination time (MGT). shoot and root length and dry weight were all decreased as the levels of NaCl used increased. Percent reduction in dry weight over control was increased as the NaCl levels increased. Forat and Amber 33 were more salt tolerant cultivars with regard to germination percent. while Hwazawi cultivar was more sensitive. Hwazawi cultivar recorded the lower MGT while Amber 33 cultivar showed the higher MGT. Length of radicle and plumule of all cultivars were differently affected by salt. as Hwazawi and Mushkab cultivars showed more reduction in length while Amber 33 was less affected. Forat cultivar dry weight was more affected by salt compare to other cultivars. The effect of NaCl on salt tolerance index of cultivars was significant. The ranges of salt tolerance indices among salt levels were very wide. ranging from 95.42 at 30 mM of NaCl to 71.38 at 150 mM of NaCl.

The numerical simulation (ANSYS CFX software Release 12) can be use to detect the cavitation in centrifugal pump. The total pressure at inflow boundary is reduced in small increment to meet the beginning cavitation. The CFD results computed by ANSYS CFX software can be shown that the formation bubble form in a lower pressure area which caused by high velocity fluid. Inception cavitation occurs on the blade surface where the leading edge meets the tip. For lower NPSH values the cavitation zones move from leading to trailing edge.

The friction stir welding was carried out by using milling machine at different tool rotation speeds and welding travel speeds. The microstructure of weld or stir nugget (SN). thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ). heated affected zone (HAZ) and base metal were observed by optical microscopy. The corrosion tests of base alloy and welded joints were carried out in 3.5% NaCl solution. Corrosion current was found using potentiostatic polarization measurements of all samples at a temperature of 30 C. The polarization diagrams indicated that pitting corrosion would be controlled by aluminum passivation in 3.5% NaCl solution.

Carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced materials were the composite materials that joined with the conventional steel and aluminium. Adhesive bonding joint and a combination of adhesive and mechanical fastener joints were used as a joining approach. It is found that adhesive bonding joint provided a better performance compared to the hybrid joint. where the holes created in the specimens for inserting mechanical fasteners caused a lower strength. It is observed that the adhesive joining of the glass fiber and steel obtained a maximum load of 35.5 KN. which is the highest strength among all other combinations examined in this study. while the similar combination joined using adhesive bonding and mechanical fastener showed a maximum load less than the adhesive joining by 21.4 %.,True,H18bGqoAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC,8,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/469/1/012051/meta,12271316029920087212,/scholar?cites=12271316029920087212,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/469/1/012051/pdf,0,0,0

Apart from actively eliminating intracellular intruders. autophagy is also responsible for cell survival. for example by reducing the deleterious effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress. At the same time. autophagy can contribute to cellular suicide. The concurrent engagement of autophagy in these processes during infection may sometimes mask its contribution to differing pro-survival and pro-death decisions. The importance of autophagy in innate immunity in mammals is well documented. but how autophagy contributes to plant innate immunity and cell death is not that clear. A few research reports have appeared recently to shed light on the roles of autophagy in plant–pathogen interactions and in disease-associated host cell death. We present a first attempt to reconcile the results of this research.,True,GljiNRkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,94,https://www.nature.com/articles/cdd201143,6037617221137327714,/scholar?cites=6037617221137327714,,https://www.nature.com/articles/cdd201143,0,0,0

Autophagy has been proposed to negatively regulate plant immunity-associated cell death related to the hypersensitive response (HR). as older autophagy-deficient mutants are unable to contain this type of cell death 5 to 10 d after infection. Such spreading cell death was found to require NPR1 (nonexpressor of PR genes 1). but surprisingly did not occur in younger atg mutants. In contrast. we find that npr1 mutants are not impaired in rapid programmed cell death activation upon pathogen recognition. Furthermore. our molecular evidence suggests that the NPR1-dependent spreading cell death in older atg mutants may originate from an inability to cope with excessive accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and ER stress which derive from salicylic acid …,True,GljiNRkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,58,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/auto.29406,3877169810078329801,/scholar?cites=3877169810078329801,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/auto.29406,0,0,0

Early prediction can be helpful in preventing the development of myocardial infarction with appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Artificial neural networks have opened new horizons in learning about the natural history of diseases and predicting cardiac disease. Methods: A total of 935 cardiac patients with chest pain and nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) were enrolled and followed for 2 weeks in two groups based on the appearance of myocardial infarction. Two types of data were used for all patients: nominal (clinical data) and quantitative (ECG findings). Two different artificial neural networks–radial basis function (RBF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)–were used to classify the two groups. Results: The RBF neural network had an accuracy of 83% with ECG findings and an accuracy of 78% with clinical features. When and clinical data were used in an MLP neural network trained with a genetic algorithm. ECG results led to a classification accuracy of 96% and clinical data yielded an accuracy of 84.5%. Conclusion: Both neural network structures predicted MI within about 2 weeks of hospital referral with an acceptable degree of accuracy in patients with nondiagnostic ECG. The MLP neural network significantly outperformed the RBF network because of the use of the genetic algorithm. which provided a global strategy to accurately determine MLP weights (clinical trials registry: NCT01870258).,True,IeKeLTMAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,30,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.895.9747&rep=rep1&type=pdf,9224682006091550018,/scholar?cites=9224682006091550018,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.895.9747&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Conformational flexibility of the ATP-binding site in the CDK2 and ERK2 kinases was identified using molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energy (ΔG) of twenty-four ATP-competitive inhibitors toward these kinases was assessed using an alchemical free energy perturbation method. MP-CAFEE. However. large calculation errors of 2–3 kcal/mol were observed using this method. where the free energy simulation starts from a single equilibrated conformation.

Methods Between April 2004 and September 2014. 4.997 patients with cancer who had received systemic chemotherapy were registered in a prospective cohort database at the Kyoto University Hospital. Of these. 2.693 patients with a death record were eligible for inclusion and divided into training (n = 1.341) and test (n = 1.352) cohorts. In total. 3.471.521 laboratory data at 115.738 time points. representing 40 laboratory items [e.g.. white blood cell counts and albumin (Alb) levels] that were monitored for 1 year before the death event were applied for constructing prognosis prediction models. All possible prediction models comprising three different items from 40 laboratory items (40C3 = 9.880) were generated in the training cohort. and the model selection was performed in the test cohort. The fitness of the selected models was externally validated in the validation cohort from three independent settings.   Results A prognosis prediction model utilizing Alb. lactate dehydrogenase. and neutrophils was selected based on a strong ability to predict death events within 1–6 months and a set of six prediction models corresponding to 1.2. 3. 4. 5. and 6 months was developed.

To address this issue. we propose a machine learning approach that enables identification of both chemical substructures and amino acid properties that are associated with ligand binding. which can be applied to virtual ligand screening on a GPCR-wide scale.

Although in vivo measures of muscle strain. activity and force can indicate mechanical function. similar muscle-level measures of energy use are challenging to obtain. Without this information locomotor systems are essentially a black box in terms of the distribution of metabolic energy. Although in situ measurements of muscle metabolism are not practical in multiple muscles. the rate of blood flow to skeletal muscle tissue can be used as a proxy for aerobic metabolism. allowing the cost of particular muscle functions to be estimated. Axial. undulatory swimming is one of the most common modes of vertebrate locomotion. In fish. segmented myotomal muscles are the primary power source. driving undulations of the body axis that transfer momentum to the water. Multiple fins and the associated fin muscles also contribute to thrust production. and stabilization and control of the swimming trajectory. We have used blood flow tracers in swimming rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to estimate the regional distribution of energy use across the myotomal and fin muscle groups to reveal the functional distribution of metabolic energy use within a swimming animal for the first time. Energy use by the myotomal muscle increased with speed to meet thrust requirements. particularly in posterior myotomes where muscle power outputs are greatest. At low speeds. there was high fin muscle energy use. consistent with active stability control.

However. recently it has been demonstrated that. when applied directly via the nasal passages in the rat. dopamine exerts neurochemical and behavioural action. including increases of dopamine in striatal subregions. antidepressive-like action. and increased behavioral activity. These effects could potentially be mediated by exogenous dopamine acting as a direct agonist at postsynaptic dopamine receptors. However. it is also possible that intranasally applied dopamine acts indirectly via the modulation of the activity of dopaminergic cell bodies.

This study examined the effect of zinc chloride administration on anxiety in gonadectomized male rats.Methods: For this purpose. adult male Wistar rats (weighing 200-250 g) were castrated. One month after surgery. different doses of zinc chloride (0. 5. 7.5 and 10 mg/kg; IP) were administered 30 min before the elevated plus maze test. Time spent and the number of entries in open arms was recorded as measures of anxiety and the number of closed arm entries recorded as locomotor activity.Results: 1) Zinc chloride significantly decreased the time spent and the number of entries in the open arms in gonadectomized rats compared to the control group. 2) Zinc chloride administration could not decrease anxiety. even in the testosterone pretreated gonadectomized male rats.Conclusion: Our findings showed that zinc significantly increased anxiety in gonadectomized rats.

Allosteric sites on the GABAA receptor are targets for widely prescribed drugs that are used for a variety of pathophysiological states including insomnia and epilepsy. Modulators might be especially valuable to control receptors for which the design of selective orthosteric drugs has proven difficult due to safety issues (e.g.. α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and might have several advantages over orthosteric ligands.

This can be attributed to it involving numerous genetically distinct mechanisms that all result in self-fertility; including primary homothallism. pseudohomothallism. mating type switching. and unisexual reproduction. This review highlights the need to classify these homothallic mechanisms based on their molecular determinants and illustrates what is currently known about the multifaceted behaviours associated with homothallism.,True,sj3T5lEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,50,https://imafungus.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.5598/imafungus.2015.06.01.13,15748060974321977737,/scholar?cites=15748060974321977737,,https://imafungus.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.5598/imafungus.2015.06.01.13,0,0,0

The MAT locus exists as two alternative idiomorphs in ascomycetous fungi and sexual reproduction is initiated when genes from both idiomorphs are expressed. Thus. the gene content of this locus determines whether a fungus is heterothallic (self-sterile) or homothallic (self-fertile). Recently. a unique sub-class of homothallism has been described in fungi. where individuals possessing a single MAT idiomorph can reproduce sexually in the absence of a partner.

Unisexual reproduction. a form of homothallism. is a process whereby a fungus can progress through sexual reproduction in the absence of mating genes previously considered essential for self-fertility. In this study. we consider the molecular mechanisms that allow for this unique sexual behaviour in the saprotrophic ascomycete; Huntiella moniliformis. These molecular mechanisms are also compared to the underlying mechanisms that control sex in Huntiella omanensis. a closely related. but self-sterile. species. The main finding was that H. omanensis displayed mating-type dependent expression of the a- and α-pheromones. This was in contrast to H. moniliformis where both pheromones were co-expressed during vegetative growth and sexual development. Furthermore. H. moniliformis also expressed the receptors of both pheromones. Consequently. this fungus is likely able to recognize and respond to the endogenously produced pheromones. allowing for self-fertility in the absence of other key mating genes.

This technology can be used for a variety of genome editing approaches. from gene knockouts and knockins to more specific changes like the introduction of a few nucleotides at a targeted location. Genome editing can be used for a multitude of applications. including the partial functional characterization of genes. the production of transgenic organisms and the development of diagnostic tools. Compared to previously available gene editing strategies. the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been shown to be easy to establish in new species and boasts high efficiency and specificity. The primary reason for this is that the editing tool uses an RNA molecule to target the gene or sequence of interest. making target molecule design straightforward. given that standard base pairing rules can be exploited.

Basic research and clinical science,2,162-175,,Background & Aims. New schemes of the antitumor therapy of CLL resulted in improvement of survival of relatively young patients. However. the therapy outcomes of elderly patients are still unsatisfactory. Erroneous overestimation of expected toxicity of standard therapeutic regimens in some elderly patients may play a certain role. thus leading to prescription of less effective regimens. Therefore. the urgent problem is to find objective criteria for risk stratification in CLL. The aim of the study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of patient’s age and the CIRS-G index in elderly patients treated with fludarabine-containing regimens in first line treatment outside clinical trials.Methods. A retrospective analysis of 90 elderly CLL patients. treated with standard FC and FCR regimens in the clinic of internal medicine of the First St. Petersburg State Medical University from 2001 till 2011. The age median was 59 years (range from 43 to 78 years). The comorbidity index was determined for each patient using the CIRS-G score.Results. The overall response rate did not significantly differ between FC and FCR groups and was equal to 81.6% and 93.4%. respectively (p= 0.109). Complete remissions were achieved in 72.3% of FCR group patients and only in 46.5% of FC group patients (p= 0.018). The retrospective analysis of treatment tolerability in primary elderly patients with different CIRS-G scores in the routine clinical practice demonstrated that the index has no independent prognostic significance.

Much of this data comes from psychophysical studies on humans. precluding the possibility of direct measurements of receptor or receptor neuron activation. Remarkably. we find that many of the perceptual classifications used by human subjects translate well enough to mouse that we can apply cellular methods to better understand the molecular mechanism. that leads to odor discrimination and perception. Using a well studied and well recognizable odor percept of bitter almond. we have tested an odorant panel of aldehydes and ketones that were reported to share such perceptual qualities. These odorants include aromatic and aliphatic. as well as cyclic and allylic features.

Ek. is converted into gravitational potential energy. Ep. and then back into kinetic energy. To move the centre of mass. the locomotory muscles must supply only the power required to overcome the losses occurring during this energy transduction. African women carry loads of up to 20% of their body weight on the head without increasing their energy expenditure. This occurs as a result of an unexplained. more effective energy transduction between Ek and Ep than that of Europeans. In this study we measured the value of the Ek to Ep transduction at each instant in time during the step in African women and European subjects during level walking at 3.5-5.5 km h-1. both unloaded and carrying loads spanning 20-30% of their body weight.

We investigate what are the effects of this phenomenon on the mechanics of running. We hypothesized that the deficit in force would result in a lower push. causing reduced amplitude of the vertical oscillation. with smaller elastic energy storage and increased step frequency. To test this hypothesis. we measured the mechanical energy of the centre of mass of the body during running in old and young subjects. The amplitude of the oscillation is indeed reduced in the old subjects. resulting in an approximately 20% smaller elastic recovery and a greater step frequency (3.7 versus 2.8 Hz. p=1.9×10−5. at 15–17 km h−1). Interestingly. the greater step frequency is due to a lower aerial time. and not to a greater natural frequency of the system. which is similar in old and young subjects (3.6 versus 3.4 Hz. p=0.2).

In old age. muscular force is reduced. but the deficit in force is less during stretching than during shortening. The greater loss in concentric versus eccentric strength with aging led us to hypothesize that older versus younger adults would increase the landing–take-off asymmetry in running. To test this hypothesis. we measured the within-step changes in mechanical energy of the centre of mass of the body in old and young subjects. The difference between the peaks in kinetic energy attained during the fall and during the lift of the centre of mass is greater in the old subjects.

This landing–takeoff asymmetry is consistent with the force–velocity relation of the ‘motor’ (i.e. with the basic property of muscle to resist stretching with a force greater than that developed during shortening). but it may also be due to the ‘machine’ (e.g. to the asymmetric lever system of the foot operating during stance).

This landing–takeoff asymmetry has been thought to be a consequence of the force–velocity relation of the muscle. resulting in a greater force exerted during stretching after landing and a lower force developed during shortening before takeoff. However. the asymmetric lever system of the human foot during stance may also be the cause. Here. we measure the landing–takeoff asymmetry in bouncing steps of running. hopping and trotting animals using diverse lever systems.

It has been suggested that this is due to a more elastic step in larger animals. Here. we show in running. hopping and trotting animals. and in human running during growth. that the resonant frequency of the bouncing system decreases with increasing body mass and is. surprisingly. independent of species or gait. Step frequency roughly equals the resonant frequency in trotting and running. whereas it is about half the resonant frequency in hopping.

The tanning process was performed with different concentrations of active titanium tanning material such as 1%. 2.5%. 5%. 7.5%. and 10%. The titanium content. chromium oxide content. formaldehyde content. shrinkage temperature. pH value. ash content. and fat content of the tanned leathers were investigated for the determination of chemical characterization. The tensile strength. elongation at break. tear strength. and colour measurement tests were also carried out for investigating the physical properties. The titanium tanned leathers had a mean shrinkage temperature of 79.5oC and more yellowish colour than the chromium tanned leathers. Their tensile strength properties were found similar with chromium leathers. while the elongation at break was found to be lower and tearing resistance was higher. The usage amount of 2.5% could be perfectly advised for the tanning process based on the titanium tanning material for achieving optimal properties required from different leather types such as upholstery. automotive and shoe upper leathers.

Japanese Journal of Infectious Diseases Editorial Committee,Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe form of dengue fever (DF). Recent in vitro studies indicate that complement reduces the infection-enhancing activity of dengue antibodies. suggesting its in vivo role in controlling viremia levels and disease severity. In this study. the complement hemolytic activity (CH50) and levels of complement components and related factors in dengue patients in Indonesia were assessed. Based on the number of days since fever onset. DF patients were compared with patients at the DHF pre-critical phase who showed deterioration within 2 days. The mean CH50 values and levels of C2. C4. and factors B and H in the DHF pre-critical phase group were significantly lower than those in the DF group. The mean CH50 values were significantly correlated with C4. factor B. or factor H levels. indicating their responsibility for reduced CH50 values. Furthermore. a significantly higher proportion of the DHF pre-critical phase group (78z) than the DF group (33z) was positive for the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen. These results suggested that antibody-dependent enhancement of infection occurs during a period of low complement activity. which is associated with NS1 levels during the acute phase in some patients. thereby leading to increased viremia levels and greater disease severity.,True,y9OJu9gAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,9,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yoken/66/5/66_366/_article/-char/ja/,15725631047666844442,/scholar?cites=15725631047666844442,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yoken/66/5/66_366/_pdf,0,0,0

The need to increase yields is commonly achieved by agricultural intensification that often comes along with negative impacts on the environment. In 2011. the interdisciplinary LEGATO project was launched with the aim to advance sustainable rice production. A key feature for sustainable rice production is silicon (Si) availability. Si can e.g. improve rice crop resistance against pathogens and prevent the uptake of toxic metals. Herein. we introduce the characteristics of the seven LEGATO study regions in Vietnam and the Philippines (i.e.. climate. geology. soils. agricultural practices) ranging from lowlands with intensive production to mountain regions with extensive and traditional production systems. Secondly. we show data on concentrations of plant-available Si (Sipa) in topsoils of paddy fields (Ap + Arp horizons) and of sites with an alternative land-use …,True,yDtrYckAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179114000905,9444915911163943003,/scholar?cites=9444915911163943003,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45605541/Plant-available_silicon_in_paddy_soils_a20160513-15243-198r09o.pdf,0,0,0

Schmidt and M. Schädler and D. Vetterlein,398,Plant and Soil,1-2,153-163,springer,Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) contain large quantities of silicon (Si) in form of phytoliths. which increase their resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. The Si cycle through rice fields is hardly studied. We tested how increasing Si availability affects rice growth and the decomposability of the straw. Secondly we tested the role of straw recycling for Si availability.In a field experiment. we applied three levels of silica gel during one rice cropping season. In a follow-up laboratory experiment. we used straw produced in the field experiment. having different Si concentrations. and studied straw decomposition. straw Si release. and Si uptake by plants.Silicon fertilization increased Si contents. biomass production. and grain yield of rice plants. Increased Si uptake by rice decreased …,True,yDtrYckAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,75,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11104-015-2645-8.pdf,4334005314403460268,/scholar?cites=4334005314403460268,,https://www.ufz.de/export/data/2/95392_Marxen%20et%20al%202016%20Plant%20Soil.pdf,0,0,0

Furthermore. over the last couple of years. the need for the integration of other kinds of knowledge (experience based or indigenous knowledge) is increasingly acknowledged. For instance. the incorporation of such knowledge is indispensable for place-based approaches to sustainable land management. which require that the specific ecological and social context is addressed. However. desirable as it may be. such an engagement of the holders of tacit knowledge is not easy to achieve. It demands reconciling well-established scientific procedural standards with the implicit or explicit criteria of relevance that apply in civil society — a process that typically causes severe tensions and comes up against both habitual …,True,yDtrYckAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,32,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/0308018814Z.00000000095,16263191502478384978,/scholar?cites=16263191502478384978,,,0,0,0

Previously we revealed that CrfC homo-oligomers bind the clamp. a DNA-binding subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. promoting colocalization of the sister replication forks. which ensures the nucleoid equipartition. In addition. CrfC localizes at the cell pole-proximal loci via an unknown mechanism. Here. we demonstrate that CrfC localizes to the distinct subnucleoid structures termed nucleoid poles (the cell pole-proximal nucleoid-edges) even in elongated cells as well as in wild-type cells. Systematic analysis of the nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) and related proteins revealed that HU. the most abundant NAP. and SlmA. the nucleoid occlusion factor regulating the localization of cell division apparatus. promote the specific localization of CrfC foci. When the replication initiator DnaA was inactivated. SlmA and HU were required for formation of CrfC foci. In contrast. when the replication initiation was inhibited with a specific mutant of the helicase-loader DnaC. CrfC foci were sustained independently of SlmA and HU. H-NS. which forms clusters on AT-rich DNA regions. promotes formation of CrfC foci as well as transcriptional regulation of crfC. In addition.

1056709,A unique arginine cluster in PolDIP2 enhances nucleotide binding and DNA synthesis by PrimPol,2020,Kazutoshi Kasho and Gorazd Stojkovič and Cristina Velázquez-Ruiz and Maria Isabel Martínez-Jiménez and Timothée Laurent and Aldo Emmanuel Pérez-Rivera and Louise Jenninger and Luis Blanco and Sjoerd Wanrooij,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Replication forks often stall at damaged DNA.  Resumption of DNA synthesis can occur by replacement of the replicative DNA polymerase with specialized. error-prone translesion DNA polymerases (TLS). that have higher tolerance for damaged substrates.  Several of these polymerases (Polλ. Polη and PrimPol) are stimulated in DNA synthesis through interaction with PolDIP2. however the mechanism of this PolDIP2-dependent stimulation is still unclear. Here we show that PrimPol uses a flexible loop to interact with the C-terminal ApaG-like domain of PolDIP2. and that this contact is essential for PrimPol′s enhanced processivity. PolDIP2 increases PrimPol′s primer-template and dNTP binding affinity. which concomitantly enhances PrimPol′s nucleotide incorporation efficiency. This activity is dependent on a unique arginine cluster in PolDIP2 and could be essential for PrimPol to function in vivo. since the polymerase activity of PrimPol alone is very limited. This mechanism. where the affinity for dNTPs gets increased by PolDIP2 binding. could be common to all other PolDIP2-interacting TLS polymerases. i.e. Polλ. Polη. Polζ and REV1. and might be critical for their in vivo function of tolerating DNA lesions at physiological nucleotide concentrations.,True,4WT-064AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.101550v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/05/20/2020.05.18.101550.full.pdf,0,0,0

If we consider a set of three candles as a component oscillator. two oscillators. that is. two sets of three candles. can couple with each other. resulting in both in-phase and antiphase synchronization depending on the distance between the two sets. The mathematical model indicates that the oscillatory combustion in a set of three candles is induced by a lack of oxygen around the burning point.

The scene portrays two white lines which outline a traffic lane on a road and converge to a vanishing point. In experiment 1. observers estimated the angle created by these converging lines in this scene or in its image projected onto a screen. Results showed strong underestimation of the angle. ie over 50% for observations of both the real scene and its projected image. Experiment 2 assessed how depth cues in projected images influence the angle illusion. Results showed that this angle illusion disappeared when scene information surrounding convergent lines was removed. In addition. the illusion was attenuated with projection of an inverted scene image.

Moreover. students may feel that abstract thinking in mathematics has a practical role in real life.Model classes in an elementary school (Kamiube elementary school.

Four tasks were created for the lessons:(1) to paint seven gray squares and arrange them in the order of brightness.(2) to find where the name of colors come from.(3) discriminate the brightness of chromatic colors.(4) to compose a combination of three geometric shapes. Students’ work were reviewed by the chief instructor at the end of each lesson. Observation in class. student interviews after class. and students’ work were all analyzed.

Here we report an unexpected role for the piRNA pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans sensory axon regeneration after injury. Loss of function in a subset of components of the piRNA pathway results in enhanced axon regrowth. Two essential piRNA factors. PRDE-1 and PRG-1/PIWI. inhibit axon regeneration in a gonad-independent and cell-autonomous manner. By smFISH analysis we find that prde-1 transcripts are present in neurons. as well as germ cells. The piRNA pathway inhibits axon regrowth independent of nuclear transcriptional silencing but dependent on the slicer domain of PRG-1/PIWI. suggesting that post-transcriptional gene silencing is involved.

Recent studies have identified the ubiquitous Ndc80 internal loop as a protein‐protein interaction platform. Binding partners include the Ska complex. the replication licensing factor Cdt1. the Dam1 complex. TACC‐TOG microtubule‐associated proteins (MAPs) and kinesin motors. We review the field and propose that the overproduction of Ndc80 may unfavourably absorb these interactors through the internal loop domain and lead to a change in the equilibrium of MAPs and motors in the cells.

However. how proper kinetochore–microtubule attachment leads to timely anaphase onset remains elusive. Furthermore. the molecular mechanisms of chromosome movement during anaphase A remain unclear. In this study. we show that the fission yeast Alp7/TACC protein recruits a protein complex consisting of the kinesin-8 (Klp5–Klp6) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the kinetochore upon kinetochore–microtubule attachment.

In many eukaryotes. spindle formation is driven by the plus-end–directed motor kinesin-5 that generates outward force to establish spindle bipolarity. Its inhibition leads to the emergence of monopolar spindles with mitotic arrest. Intriguingly. simultaneous inactivation of the minus-end–directed motor kinesin-14 restores spindle bipolarity in many systems. Here we show that in fission yeast. three independent pathways contribute to spindle bipolarity in the absence of kinesin-5/Cut7 and kinesin-14/Pkl1. One is kinesin-6/Klp9 that engages with spindle elongation once short bipolar spindles assemble. Klp9 also ensures the medial positioning of anaphase spindles to prevent unequal chromosome segregation. Another is the Alp7/TACC-Alp14/TOG microtubule polymerase complex.

We review recent findings on the regulation of MT dynamics during axon regeneration. focusing on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In C. elegans the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) promotes axon regeneration. whereas the exchange factor for Arf6 (EFA-6) inhibits axon regeneration. Both DLK and EFA-6 respond to injury and control axon regeneration in part via MT dynamics. How the DLK and EFA-6 pathways are related is a topic of active investigation. as is the mechanism by which EFA-6 responds to axonal injury.

However. several recent reports from different organisms have shed new light on this issue. A key player in microtubule-kinetochore interaction is the conserved Ndc80 outer kinetochore complex. In both yeast and human cells in particular. a ubiquitous internal ‘loop’ found in the Ndc80 molecule interrupting its C-terminal coiled-coil domain plays critical roles in protein-protein interaction. by recruiting microtubule-binding proteins to ensure proper kinetochore-microtubule attachment.

One of the main public health challenges facing many district governments is improving nutritional standards. particularly among poorer segments of the population. Developing effective policies and strategies for improving nutrition requires a multi-sectoral approach encompassing agricultural development policy. access to markets. food security (storage) programs. provision of public health facilities. and promotion of public awareness of nutritional health. This implies a strong need for a coordinated approach involving multiple government agencies at the district level. Due to diverse economic. agricultural. and infrastructure conditions across the country. district governments’ ought to be better placed than central government both to identify areas of greatest need for public nutrition interventions. and devise policies that reflect local characteristics. However. in the two districts observed in this study—Bantul and Gunungkidul—it was clear that local government capacity to generate. obtain and integrate evidence about local conditions into the policy-making process was still limited. In both districts. decision-makers tended to rely more on intuition.anecdote. and precedent in formulating policy.

Despite considerable advances in prostate cancer early detection and clinical management. validation of new biomarkers able to predict the natural history of tumor progression is still necessary in order to reduce overtreatment and to guide therapeutic decisions. MicroRNAs are endogenous noncoding RNAs which offer a fast fine-tuning and energy-saving mechanism for posttranscriptional control of protein expression. Growing evidence indicate that these RNAs are able to regulate basic cell functions and their aberrant expression has been significantly correlated with cancer development. Therefore. detection of microRNAs in tumor tissues and body fluids represents a new tool for early diagnosis and patient prognosis prediction. In this review. we summarize current knowledge about microRNA deregulation in prostate cancer mainly focusing on the different clinical aspects of the disease. We also highlight the potential roles of microRNAs in PCa management. while also discussing several current challenges and needed future research.,True,db577FwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,50,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/146170/abs/,14407156275340788452,/scholar?cites=14407156275340788452,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/146170/abs/,0,0,0

In this study. we have characterized the exosomes from IL2-or IL15-cultured human NK cells. Both cytokines induced comparable amounts of exosomes with similar cargo composition. Analysis of molecules contained within or exposed at the exosome surface. allowed the identification of molecules playing important roles in the NK cell function including IFN-γ.

One hour after tetanization (electrical stimulation of area dentata granular cells and recording from CA3 pyramids) an inverse translocation of these Ca++-binding proteins was observed: an increase in the calmodulin content in the water-soluble and a decrease in the Lubrol-soluble fractions. while an increase in S-100 protein in the Triton-soluble and a decrease in the water-soluble fractions occurred. The results are suggestive of a regulatory function of these proteins in events during repetitive stimulation of a synaptic input. The calmodulin increase in the cytosolic compartment may reflect the involvement of Ca++-calmodulin dependent intraneuronal metabolic processes underlying the induction and/or temporary maintenance of neuronal functional changes occurring after repeated or intense synaptic activity. The elevated S-100 protein level in the membrane compartment might be interpreted in terms of functionally induced redistribution in that neuronal cells are provided with additional amounts of S-100 protein originating from the surrounding glial cells which store large amounts of soluble S-100 protein.,True,aaM-X1EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,14,https://europepmc.org/article/med/3178784,283013146766178972,/scholar?cites=283013146766178972,,,0,0,0

Web site: http://acube. org,Effectively managing active learning classrooms (ALCs). particularly large ALCs. can present a variety of challenges for instructors. There is a rapidly growing body of research literature addressing the impact of ALCs on student engagement and learning. but fewer studies have focused on investigating instructional practices and instructors in ALCs. Moreover. little to no information on best practices for multiple instructors in these learning spaces has been reported. although the presence of multiple instructors or facilitators simultaneously seems to be frequently implemented in these spaces. Many unanswered questions remain regarding optimizing the opportunities afforded by ALCs and collaborative teaching models while minimizing difficulties that may arise when multiple instructors facilitate student learning concurrently. In an effort to begin reporting faculty experiences and student perspectives of team teaching models at the college or university level. this paper provides an overview of collaborative teaching models described in the literature. describes collaborative teaching models in two undergraduate biology courses. and reports student responses to questions addressing their experience with collaborative teaching in those courses.

ToxR is a transmembrane DNA-binding protein first discovered in Vibrio cholerae. where it regulates a considerable number of genes involved in environmental adaptation and virulence. In P. profundum the abundance and activity of this protein is influenced by hydrostatic pressure and its role is related to the regulation of genes in a pressure-dependent manner. To better characterize the ToxR regulon. we compared the expression profiles of wt and toxR strains in response to pressure changes. Our results revealed a complex expression pattern with a group of 22 genes having expression profiles similar to OmpH that is an outer membrane protein transcribed in response to high hydrostatic pressure. Moreover. RNA-seq allowed a deep characterization of the transcriptional landscape that led to the identification of 460 putative small RNA genes and the detection of 298 protein-coding genes previously unknown. We were also able to perform a genome-wide prediction of operon structure. transcription start and termination sites. revealing an unexpected high number of genes (992) with large 5′-UTRs. long enough to harbour cis-regulatory RNA structures. suggesting a correlation between intergenic region size and UTR length. This work led to a better understanding of high-pressure response in P. profundum.

The plasmid of Alteromonas macleodii HOT1A3 is a vector for inter-specific transfer of a flexible genomic island,2016,Eduard Fadeev and Fabio De Pascale and Alessandro Vezzi and Sariel Hübner and Dikla Aharonovich and Daniel Sher,7,Frontiers in microbiology,,248,Frontiers,Genome sequencing is rapidly becoming a staple technique in environmental and clinical microbiology. yet computational challenges still remain. leading to many draft genomes which are typically fragmented into many contigs. We sequenced and completely assembled the genome of a marine heterotrophic bacterium. Alteromonas macleodii HOT1A3. and compared its full genome to several draft genomes obtained using different reference-based and de-novo methods. In general. the de-novo assemblies clearly outperformed the reference-based or hybrid ones. covering>99% of the genes and representing essentially all of the gene functions. However. only the fully closed genome (~4.5Mbp) allowed us to identify the presence of a large. 148 kbp plasmid. pAM1A3. While HOT1A3 belongs to Alteromonas macleodii. typically found in surface waters (“surface ecotype”). this plasmid consists of an almost complete flexible genomic island. containing many genes involved in metal resistance previously identified in the genomes of Alteromonas mediterranea (“deep ecotype”). Indeed. similar to A. mediterranea. A. macleodii HOT1A3 grows at concentrations of zinc. mercury and copper that are inhibitory for other A. macleodii strains.

This goal was achieved by evaluating high-throughput microRNA (miRNA) profiles during GC treatment. integrated with the assessment of expression changes in GC receptor (GR) heterocomplex genes. Furthermore. we tested the hypothesis that differentially expressed miRNAs could be directly regulated by GCs through investigating the presence of GC responsive elements (GREs) in their gene promoters. Ten IBD paediatric patients responding to GCs were enrolled. Peripheral blood was obtained at diagnosis (T0) and after four weeks of steroid treatment (T4). MicroRNA profiles were analyzed using next generation sequencing. and selected significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In detail. 18 miRNAs were differentially expressed from T0 to T4. 16 of which were upregulated and 2 of which were downregulated. Out of these. three miRNAs (miR-144. miR-142. and miR-96) could putatively recognize the 3’UTR of the GR gene and three miRNAs (miR-363. miR-96. miR-142) contained GREs sequences. thereby potentially enabling direct regulation by the GR. In conclusion. we identified miRNAs differently expressed during GC treatment and miRNAs which could be directly regulated by GCs in blood cells of young IBD patients.

As a result. growth parameters may be greatly affected. Noteworthy. Saccharomyces cerevisiae M2n[pBKD2-Pccbgl1]-C1. previously developed by multiple δ-integration of the β-glucosidase BGL3. did not show any detectable metabolic burden. This work aims to test the hypothesis that the metabolic burden and the metabolomic perturbation induced by the δ-integration of a yeast strain. could differ significantly. The engineered strain was evaluated in terms of metabolic performances and metabolomic alterations in different conditions typical of the bioethanol industry. Results indicate that the multiple δ-integration did not affect the ability of the engineered strain to grow on different carbon sources and to tolerate increasing concentrations of ethanol and inhibitory compounds. Conversely. metabolomic profiles were significantly altered both under growing and stressing conditions. indicating a large extent of metabolic reshuffling involved in the maintenance of the metabolic homeostasis.

Also. the implementation of the hardware and software for speed control and protection with the results obtained from tests on induction motor performance is provided. The PLC correlates the operational parameters to the speed requested by the user and monitors the system during normal operation and under trip conditions. Tests of the induction motor system driven by inverter and controlled by PLC prove a higher accuracy in speed regulation as compared to a conventional V/f control system. The efficiency of PLC control is increased at high speeds up to 95% of the synchronous speed. Thus. PLC proves themselves as a very versatile and effective tool in industrial control of electric drives.,True,IlBXJ7kAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,53,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.533.6689&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1388217974318950870,/scholar?cites=1388217974318950870,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.533.6689&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1056807,Modification of a PEF source that produce both wide and narrow pulses,2006,Yasar Birbir and Serkan Elver,,WEAS/IASME International Conference on ElectricPower System,,52-57,,_ Treatment of the foods with the pulse electric fields (PEF) is an important technique to kill microorganisms and denature enzymes with only a small increase in temperature. High voltage pulsed electric fields can be used for pasteurization or sterilization of fluid foods. In this present study. a new modified PEF source with both narrow and wide pulses was designed to kill microorganisms. This modified PEF source is a power supply which has a pulse width modulation (PWM) controlled quasi resonant flyback converter topology to generate pulsed electric fields. Converter topology can employ output transformer parasitic in the resonant tank which makes it attractive for the high voltage switched mode power supply applications. A very broad range of operating frequency is required to control the output power. Therefore. the highly efficient PWM control technique in this resonant topology looks very promising. This PWM controlled quasi resonant flyback converter topology combines the advantages of both resonant power conversion and pulse with modulation control techniques. Owing to operating high frequency using fast switching device MOSFET. this modified power supply is light and compact device. Adopting the inverter power supply with a microprocessor unit had been enabled by PWM control technique to generate pulsed electric fields. A PEF device was fabricated and waveforms were measured. New modified PEF source which produce both wide and narrow pulses may be advantageous. easy and effective in use to sterilize foods.,True,IlBXJ7kAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,10,http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2006tenerife/papers/541-404.pdf,5553524657541960681,/scholar?cites=5553524657541960681,,http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2006tenerife/papers/541-404.pdf,0,0,0

Zoological Studies 51 (7): 1094-1104. The composition of anuran communities is influenced by deterministic and/or stochastic factors. In this study. we tested whether the occurrence of anuran species in ponds differed from a null model of random placement. hypothesizing that environmental heterogeneity and spatial distribution of ponds have an influence on the structure of anuran communities in southern Brazil. Data were collected for 7 months from 14 ponds located in Turvo State Park. Rio Grande do Sul. To test whether distributions of species in the sampled ponds varied from random. the null model. SIM 2. was applied. while the roles of pond heterogeneity and proximity were evaluated by a redundancy analysis using environmental and spatial descriptors. Distributions of the 15 anuran species recorded in the studied ponds were clearly not random. corroborating our hypothesis that the species composition is influenced by environmental heterogeneity. Geographical proximity did not affect pond species compositions. However. the environmental descriptors had varying effects on anuran communities at different locations. indicating the need for studies to be carried out at local and/or regional levels in order to determine which environmental characteristics are most important for the conservation of anuran species. http://zoolstud. sinica. edu. tw/Journals/51.7/1094. pdf,True,NV2oRdIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,24,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.654.8669&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11422890599584048396,/scholar?cites=11422890599584048396,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.654.8669&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In addition to isolated visual and acoustic signals. some species may emit multimodal displays characterized by the association of these signals. Through the analysis of focal recordings obtained in situ in southern Brazil. we investigated the visual and multimodal communication in the diurnal stream frog Crossodactylus schmidti. We found a complex visual repertoire of nine signals used in intraspecific communication. of which the signal Both legs kicking was described for the first time.

However. many studies have demonstrated that some species display remarkable and stereotyped visual signals used in different social contexts (Lindquist and Hetherington 1996. 1998. Haddad and Giaretta 1999. Preininger et al. 2009). indicating that visual signalling in anurans is diverse. wide‑spread. and has evolved independently in several families (Hödl and Amézquita 2001). Most recently. visual displays have been documented even for nocturnal species (Bertoluci 2002. Hartmann et al. 2005. Giasson and Haddad 2006. Toledo et al. 2007. Barros and Feio 2011). suggesting that nocturnal anurans have visual acuity for visual stimulus. possibly dependent on the optimum ambient illumination of the species (Hartmann et al. 2005). Thus. data on the repertoire of visual signals of different species. including information on the behaviors and the social context in which they are performed. constitute a primary source of information to understand the evolution of visual communication in anurans (Amézquita and Hödl 2004).

IL-17 treatment of fibroblasts stimulated increased MCPIP1 expression. whereas MCPIP1 silencing enhanced IL-17-mediated signal transduction. Conversely. reconstitution of MCPIP1-/- cells restricted IL-17 signaling. which was dependent on the MCPIP1 endonuclease domain. not its deubiquitinase domain. In vivo. MCPIP1 deficiency enhanced IL-17-dependent autoimmunity and host resistance to infection. Namely. susceptibility to candidiasis was reduced in MCPIP1 haploinsufficient mice. whereas IL-17 …,True,7tg1vw0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/194/1_Supplement/49.1.short,3288192578689815479,/scholar?cites=3288192578689815479,,,0,0,0

These possible mixtures are also defined as an explosive atmosphere. To cause an explosion it is necessary the occurrence of a so called ‘trigger’. which can be for example: a spark due to production processes. a breakdown of the electrical system. an inconsiderate use of open flames or a hot surface in contact with the explosive atmosphere. In absence of such ‘triggers’ the explosive atmosphere is no longer a possible risk. As specified in the ATEX (Atmosphère Explosible) regulation. the presence of ‘triggers’ is expressed on a probabilistic basis. For this probability evaluation. it is necessary to consider the overall available historical data and perform a statistical survey. The aim of this study was to discuss explosion prevention during biogas production and to determine if inside agricultural biogas plants are present areas in which explosive atmospheres may occur. These risk areas should be classified determining several parameters such as the volume of explosive atmosphere (Vz). the risk distance (dz) and the dispersion time (t). For these evaluation was designed a software named BiogasAgriAtex developed in Microsoft Excel program following the CEI 31-35 2007 regulation (third edition). which applies the CEI EN 60079-10 (CEI 31-30) regulation.

Ocelots need native forests. but also might benefit from the local extirpation of larger cats such as pumas and jaguars through mesopredator release. We used a standardized camera trap protocol to assess ocelot populations in six protected areas of the Atlantic forest in southeastern Brazil where over 80% of forest remnants are < 50 ha. We tested whether variation in ocelot abundance could be explained by reserve size. forest cover. number of free-ranging domestic dogs and presence of top predators. Ocelot abundance was positively correlated with reserve size and the presence of top predators (jaguar and pumas) and negatively correlated with the number of dogs. We also found higher detection probabilities in less forested areas as compared to larger. intact forests. We suspect that smaller home ranges and higher movement rates in smaller. more degraded areas increased detection. Our data do not support the hypothesis of mesopredator release.

A critical examination of fish resources from this area allows us to conclude that the large commercial species have decreased in number and are qualitatively reduced in that area of Tocantins. This fact may be a result of breaking the main channel of Tocantins. first by the hydroelectric power dam of Tucurui. twenty years ago. followed by the formation of the hydroelectric reservoirs of Lageado. Peixe Angical and Serra da Mesa. that transformed the main channel of Tocantins into a successive cascade of reservoirs. Those events may perhaps modify the profile of the fish community in that area. The obtained data also permit an examination of fisheries in the area. providing an appraisal on forthcoming problems that will be faced by fishermen of Colônia de Pesca Z-35.,True,WW58yr4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,12,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1519-69842010000300014&script=sci_arttext,8669260584944835467,/scholar?cites=8669260584944835467,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1519-69842010000300014&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

To this end. a randomised. crossover study was conducted in fourteen healthy. young men to test the two dairy products. For a subset of seven subjects. RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression in blood collected during postprandial tests and after two weeks daily intake. We found that the postprandial response in insulin was different for probiotic yoghurt as compared to that of acidified milk. Moreover changes in several clinical biomarkers were associated with changes in the expression of genes representing six metabolic genesets. Assessment of the postprandial effects of each dairy product on gene expression by geneset enrichment analysis revealed significant. similar modulation of inflammatory and glycolytic genes after both probiotic yoghurt and acidified milk intake. although distinct kinetic characteristics of the modulation differentiated the dairy products. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor was a major contributor to the down-regulation of the inflammatory genesets and was also positively associated with changes in circulating insulin at 2h after yoghurt intake (p = 0.05).

Consequently. lactose in blood or urine has mostly been associated with specific cases in which the gastrointestinal barrier is damaged. On the other hand. lactose appears in the blood of lactating women and has been detected in the blood and urine of healthy men. indicating that the presence of lactose in the circulation of healthy subjects is not incompatible with normal physiology.

A better vision of how food is broken down in the gastrointestinal tract and further metabolized is essential to clarify this link. The recent development of the ‘omics’ technologies now allows a more comprehensive view of the food-derived compounds released in the gut during digestion and the metabolites present in body fluids after intestinal absorption. The objective of the present paper is to give an overview on the latest research describing the digestion process and its relationship with food bioactivity using different ‘omics’ technologies. It emphasizes the complementarity of the ‘omics’ disciplines. i.e. transcriptomics. proteomics. metabolomics. etc. (gathered under the more generic term of ‘foodomics’) and the added value of integrating such datasets.,True,4heGUioAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799317300826,11331475741261874087,/scholar?cites=11331475741261874087,,,0,0,0

Recent studies have brought the phloem tissue. the quintessential conduit for energy metabolites and inter-organ communication. into focus as an instructive developmental system. Those studies have clarified long-standing questions about essential aspects of phloem development and function. such as the pressure flow hypothesis. mechanisms of phloem unloading. and source–sink relationships. Interestingly. plants with impaired phloem development show characteristic changes in body architecture. thereby highlighting the capacity of the phloem to integrate environmental cues and to fine-tune plant development. Therefore. understanding the plasticity of phloem development provides scenarios of how environmental stimuli are translated into differential plant growth.

Cell Type-Specific Expression in Arabidopsis thaliana Through LhGR-Mediated Trans-Activation.,2019,Vadir López-Salmerón and Ann-Kathrin Schürholz and Zhenni Li and Theresa Schlamp and Christian Wenzl and Jan U Lohmann and Thomas Greb and Sebastian Wolf,,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,146,,,Inducible. tissue-specific expression is an important and powerful tool to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of genetic perturbation. Combining the flexible and efficient GreenGate cloning system with the proven and benchmarked LhGR system (here termed GR-LhG4) for the inducible expression. we have generated a set of transgenic Arabidopsis lines that can drive the expression of an effector cassette in a range of specific cell types in the three main plant meristems. To this end. we chose the previously developed GR-LhG4 system based on a chimeric transcription factor and a cognate pOp-type promoter ensuring tight control over a wide range of expression levels. In addition. to visualize the expression domain where the synthetic transcription factor is active. an ER-localized mTurquoise2 fluorescent reporter under control of the pOp4 or pOp6 promoter is encoded in driver lines. Here. we describe the steps necessary to generate a driver or effector line and demonstrate how cell type specific expression can be induced and followed in the shoot apical meristem. the root apical meristem and the cambium of Arabidopsis. By using several or all driver lines. the context specific effect of expressing one or multiple factors (effectors) under control of the synthetic pOp promoter can be assessed rapidly. for example in F1 plants of a cross between one effector and multiple driver lines. This approach is exemplified by the ectopic expression of VND7. a NAC transcription factor capable of inducing ectopic secondary cell wall deposition in a cell autonomous manner.,True,LQECas8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/med/31058906,,,,,0,0,0
1056885,OBERON3 and SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE proteins form a regulatory module specifying phloem identity,2019,Eva-Sophie Wallner and Nina Tonn and Friederike Wanke and Vadir Lopéz-Salmerón and Michael Gebert and Christian Wenzl and Jan U Lohmann and Klaus Harter and Thomas Greb,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,The phloem tissue mediates long-distance transport of energy metabolites along plant bodies and. therefore. is central for plant performance. However. mechanisms initiating the transition of undifferentiated stem cells to cells specialized in metabolite transport are unknown. Here we identify the ubiquitously expressed PHD-finger protein OBERON3 (OBE3) to be essential for phloem formation. We show that OBE3 directly interacts with the SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE 5 (SMXL5) protein specifically expressed during early phloem development. Both proteins co-localize in nuclei of phloem stem cells and. together with the SMXL5 homologs SMXL3 and SMXL4. promote the establishment of phloem-specific cellular signatures in a cell-autonomous manner. These signatures include expression of OCTOPUS (OPS). BREVIS RADIX (BRX). BARELY ANY MERISTEM3 (BAM3). and COTYLEDON VASCULAR PATTERN2 (CVP2) genes acting as mediators of phloem differentiation. Consistently. genetic analyses show that SMXL5 acts upstream and independently of OPS and BRX functions. Based on our findings. we conclude that the formation of an OBE3/SMXL5 protein complex specifically in nuclei of early phloem cells is essential for establishing a phloem-specific developmental program.,True,LQECas8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.885863v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/12/23/2019.12.21.885863.full.pdf,0,0,0
1056886,ELF3 regulates cotyledon expansion and hypocotyl growth rhythmicity,2013,Vadir López Salmerón,,,,,,Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs) play a key role in hypocotyl elongation by integrating light. clock and hormonal signals to mediate rhythmic growth (Leivar and Quail 2011). These transcription factors bind G-box (CACGTG) and E-box (CANNTG) elements in the promoters of a diverse set of genes with auxin-related and cell wallremodeling function and activate their expression (Castillon. Shen et al. 2007). Increased expression of these genes contributes to loosen cell wall. an essential step for elongation growth. Transcriptional activity of these factors is tightly regulated. to prevent excessive growth. Light is the most prominent cue regulating their activity. as it induces rapid destabilization of these factors. via interaction with photoactivated PHYB. This promotes PIFs phosphorylation and marks these factors for proteasomal degradation (Castillon. Shen et al. 2007). GA signaling plays an additional in PIFs regulation. with DELLAs being reported to bind the bHLH region of these factors to block DNA recognition ability (de Lucas. Daviere et al. 2008). However. how light and GA signals are coordinated to restrain PIFs activity to the end of the night. hence determining the rhythmic growth pattern observed under SD photoperiodic conditions remains largely unclear.Interestingly. in a yeast two hybrid screen using the GAI protein as bait. the clock ELF3 protein was uncovered as a new interacting partner of these repressors. This protein. exclusive of plants. plays an important role in the circadian clock by feed-back loop regulating different core components of the clock.

We have previously shown that titania nanotubes modified Ti surfaces (Ti/TiO 2) mitigate the immune response. compared with flat Ti surfaces; however. little is known regarding the underlying mechanism. Therefore. the aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism (s) by which this nanotopography attenuates the inflammatory activity of macrophages.

In this study. a novel Mg-based alloy exhibiting an elastic modulus E= 42 GPa. Mg-1Ca-0.2 Mn-0.6 Zr. was synthesized and thermo-mechanically processed. In order to improve its performance as a temporary bone implant. a coating based on cellulose acetate (CA) was realized by using the dipping method. The formation of the polymer coating was demonstrated by FT-IR. XPS. SEM and corrosion behavior comparative analyses of both uncoated and CA-coated alloys. The potentiodynamic polarization test revealed that the CA coating significantly improved the corrosion resistance of the Mg alloy. Using a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. the biocompatibility of both groups of biomaterials was assessed. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the media containing their extracts showed good cytocompatibility on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts in terms of cell adhesion and spreading. viability. proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo studies conducted in rats revealed that the intramedullary coated implant for fixation of femur fracture was more efficient in inducing bone regeneration than the uncoated one.

Our results demonstrate that hypercapnia (950 and 1800 μatm CO2) elicits higher intestine epithelial HCO3- secretion ex vivo and a subsequent parallel increase of intestinal precipitate presence in vivo when compared to present values (440 μatm CO2). Intestinal gene expression analysis in response to environmental hypercapnia revealed the up-regulation of transporters involved in the intestinal bicarbonate secretion cascade such as the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter slc4a4. and the apical anion transporters slc26a3 and slc26a6 of sea bream. In addition. other genes involved in intestinal ion uptake linked to water absorption such as the apical nkcc2 and aquaporin 1b expression. indicating that hypercapnia influences different levels of intestinal physiology. Taken together the current results are consistent with an intestinal physiological response leading to higher bicarbonate secretion in the intestine of the sea bream paralleled by increased luminal carbonate precipitate abundance and the main related transporters in response to ocean acidification.,True,KIRN70oAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218473,2795178774701313144,/scholar?cites=2795178774701313144,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218473,0,0,0

We find that melanocytes do not produce collagen VI yet they bind it at the cell surface. suggesting that this protein may play a trophic role and that its absence may cause lesions similar to those seen in skeletal muscle. We show that mitochondria in melanocytes of Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myooathy patients display increased size. reduced matrix density and disrupted cristae. findings that suggest a functional impairment. In keeping with this hypothesis. mitochondria (i) underwent anomalous depolarization after inhibition of the F-ATP synthase with oligomycin. and (ii) displayed decreased respiratory reserve capacity. The non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor NIM811 prevented mitochondrial depolarization in response to oligomycin in melanocytes from both Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy patients. and partially restored the respiratory reserve of melanocytes from one Bethlem myopathy patient.

Mutations in collagen VI genes cause two major clinical forms. Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). In addition to congenital muscle weakness. patients affected by collagen VI myopathies show axial and proximal joint contractures and distal joint hypermobility. which suggest the involvement of the tendon function. We examined a peroneal tendon biopsy and tenocyte culture of a 15-year-old patient affected by UCMD with compound heterozygous COL6A2 mutations. In patient's tendon biopsy. we found striking morphological alterations of tendon fibrils. consisting in irregular profiles and reduced mean diameter. The organization of the pericellular matrix of tenocytes. the primary site of collagen fibril assembly. was severely affected. as determined by immunoelectron microscopy. which showed an abnormal accumulation of collagen VI and altered distribution of collagen I and fibronectin. In patient's tenocyte culture. collagen VI web formation and cell surface association were severely impaired; large aggregates of collagen VI. which matched with collagen I labeling. were frequently detected in the extracellular matrix. In addition. metalloproteinase MMP-2. an extracellular matrix-regulating enzyme. was increased in the conditioned medium of patient's tenocytes. as determined by gelatin zymography and western blot.

Human miR-146 family members are known as inflammation-inducible miRNAs involved in negative feedback regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling. Dysregulation of the miR-146 family has often been linked to inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This study reports on miR-146a and miR-146b as infection-inducible miRNAs in zebrafish. which has emerged as a model species for human disease. Using a custom-designed microarray platform for miRNA expression we found that both members of the zebrafish miR-146 family. miR-146a and miR-146b. were commonly induced by infection of zebrafish embryos with Salmonella typhimurium and by infection of adult fish with Mycobacterium marinum. The induction of these miRNAs was confirmed by Taqman miRNA assays. Subsequently. we used zebrafish embryos. in which adaptive immunity is not yet active. as an in vivo system to investigate the role of miR-146 in the innate immune response to S. typhimurium infection. Knockdown of traf6 and use of myd88 mutants demonstrated that the induction of miR-146a and miR-146b by S. typhimurium infection was affected by disruption of the MyD88-Traf6 pathway that mediates transduction of TLR signals and cytokine responses. In turn. knockdown of miR-146 itself had no major effects on the expression of known targets of MyD88-Traf6 signalling. Instead.

Here. we investigate the role of the Drosophila melanogaster protein Corto's chromodomain. The Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb Corto is involved in both silencing and activation of gene expression. Over-expression of the Corto chromodomain (CortoCD) in transgenic flies shows that it is a chromatin-targeting module. critical for Corto function. Unexpectedly. mass spectrometry analysis reveals that polypeptides pulled down by CortoCD from nuclear extracts correspond to ribosomal proteins. Furthermore. real-time interaction analyses demonstrate that CortoCD binds with high affinity RPL12 tri-methylated on lysine 3. Corto and RPL12 co-localize with active epigenetic marks on polytene chromosomes. suggesting that both are involved in fine-tuning transcription of genes in open chromatin. RNA–seq based transcriptomes of wing imaginal discs over-expressing either CortoCD or RPL12 reveal that both factors deregulate large sets of common genes. which are enriched in heat-response and ribosomal protein genes. suggesting that they could be implicated in dynamic coordination of ribosome biogenesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that Corto and RPL12 bind hsp70 and are similarly recruited on gene body after heat shock. Hence.

However. the (epi) genetic regulation of zebrafish intestinal development remains largely uncharacterized. We performed RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing for activating (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) chromatin marks on isolated intestines at 5. 7. and 9 days post-fertilization (dpf). during which zebrafish transit from yolk dependence to external feeding. RNA-sequencing showed the enrichment of metabolic maintenance genes at all time points and a significant increase in lipid metabolism between 5 and 9 dpf. A strong correlation was observed between gene expression and presence of chromatin marks on gene promoters; H3K4me3-marked genes were expressed higher than H3K27m3-marked genes. Next. we studied a key epigenetic player. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2). Ezh2 places the repressive H3K27me3 mark on the genome and is highly conserved in vertebrates. We used the nonsense mutant allele ezh2 (hu5670) to study the effect of ezh2 loss on intestinal development. These mutants survived gastrulation and died around 11 dpf. showing severe morphological defects in the intestine and liver. accompanied by decreased intestinal (fabp2) and hepatic (fabp10a) marker expressions.

Henr.,2010,A Wafa’a,7,American Journal of Applied Sciences,5,640-646,,Problem statement: Water stress due to drought and salinity is probably the most significant abiotic factor limiting plant and also crop growth and development. Salinity and drought stresses are physiologically related. because both induce osmotic stress and most of the metabolic responses of the affected plants are similar to some extent. Water deficit affects the germination of seed and the growth of seedlings negatively. Temperature is an exceedingly important factor in seed germination. It directly affects whether a plant can sprout and. if so. how long it will take to emerge from the ground. Approach: The objective of this investigation was to determine the effect of four alternating temperature regime. drought and salt stress on germination characteristics of Pennisetum divisum. Seeds were germinated at four alternating temperatures (10/20. 15/25. 20/35 and 25/40 C at 12 h light). Seeds were also germinated with the iso-osmotic concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) or in polyethylene glycol PEG8000 (0.-0.2.-0.4.-0.6 and-0.8 MPa) for 14 days. Concentrations were applied to determine their effects on seed germination and seedling growth under laboratory conditions. The effects of different osmotic concentrations of NaCl and PEG were compared to distilled water (control). Results: Optimum germination was attained at 15/25 C which corresponds to temperatures prevailing during spring time.

Unfortunately. as humans age. they become more prone to suffer from neurodegenerative diseases and neurotoxicity. Polyphenols can be cheaply and easily obtained as part of a healthy diet. They present a wide range of biological activities. many of which have relevance for human health. Compelling evidence has shown that dietary phytochemicals. particularly polyphenols. have properties that may suppress neuroinflammation and prevent toxic and degenerative effects in the brain. The mechanisms by which polyphenols exert their action are not fully understood. but it is clear that they have a direct effect through their antioxidant activities.

Several studies addressed the association of AD with MHC class-I polymorphisms without definite conclusions. Considering the remarkable linkage disequilibrium at the MHC region. it is not possible to assume if the reported associations result from a direct effect of the respective genes or result from associations with other closely linked genes transmitted in an extended conserved haplotype. Recent evidence pointed to CAT53. a newly described gene located at the MHC class-I region in the vicinity of HLA-C. as a candidate modifier gene in AD.

Sertoli cells (SCs) are responsible for the support of spermatogenesis. having unique metabolic characteristics strongly modulated by androgens. Consequently. disruptions in androgen synthesis compromise SCs function and hence male fertility. We aimed to evaluate the effects of DHEA and 7-oxo-DHEA in human SCs (hSCs) metabolism and oxidative profile. To do so. hSCs were exposed to increasing concentrations of DHEA and 7-oxo-DHEA (0.025. 1 and 50 μM) that revealed to be non-cytotoxic in these experimental conditions.

Live E. coli provides the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans with vital micronutrients. such as folates that cannot be synthesized by animals. However. the microbe also limits C. elegans lifespan. Understanding these interactions may shed light on how intestinal microbes influence mammalian aging. Serendipitously. we isolated an E. coli mutant that slows C. elegans aging. We identified the disrupted gene to be aroD. which is required to synthesize aromatic compounds in the microbe. Adding back aromatic compounds to the media revealed that the increased C. elegans lifespan was caused by decreased availability of para-aminobenzoic acid. a precursor to folate. Consistent with this result. inhibition of folate synthesis by sulfamethoxazole. a sulfonamide. led to a dose-dependent increase in C. elegans lifespan. As expected. these treatments caused a decrease in bacterial and worm folate levels. as measured by mass spectrometry of intact folates. The folate cycle is essential for cellular biosynthesis. However. bacterial proliferation and C. elegans growth and reproduction were unaffected under the conditions that increased lifespan. In this animal:microbe system. folates are in excess of that required for biosynthesis. This study suggests that microbial folate synthesis is a pharmacologically accessible target to slow animal aging without detrimental effects.,True,-ijShH8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,98,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-10-67,3959199499609220282,/scholar?cites=3959199499609220282,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-10-67,0,0,0

Dysfunction occurs in part because of altered regulation of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). which acts as a central metabolic node that mediates pyruvate oxidation after glycolysis and fuels the Krebs cycle to meet energy demands. Fine-tuning of PDC activity has been mainly attributed to post-translational modifications of its subunits. including the extensively studied phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of the E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). modulated by kinases (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase [PDK] 1-4) and phosphatases (pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase [PDP] 1-2). respectively.

A few decades ago. the discovery of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (MAM) was followed by the identification of its roles in regulating cellular homeostatic processes. ranging from cellular bioenergetics to apoptosis. MAM provides an excellent platform for numerous signaling pathways; among them. inflammatory signaling pathways associated with MAM play a critical role in cellular defense during pathogenic infections and metabolic disorders. However. induction of MAM causes deleterious effects by amplifying mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation through increased calcium transfer from the ER to mitochondria. thereby causing mitochondrial damage and release of mitochondrial components into the cytosol as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These mitochondrial DAMPs rapidly activate MAM-resident inflammasome components and other inflammatory factors. which promote inflammasome complex formation and release of proinflammatory cytokines in pathological conditions. Long-term stimulation of the inflammasome instigates chronic inflammation. leading to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. In this review. we summarize the current understanding of MAM and its association with inflammation-mediated metabolic diseases.,True,DxccCcEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,35,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2016/1851420/abs/,16378553926559613940,/scholar?cites=16378553926559613940,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2016/1851420/abs/,0,0,0

Here. we aimed to characterize NLP in fish. RT-qPCR showed NUCB1 expression in both central and peripheral tissues. Western blot analysis and/or fluorescence immunohistochemistry determined NUCB1/NLP in the brain. pituitary. testis. ovary and gut of goldfish. NUCB1 mRNA expression in goldfish pituitary and gut displayed a daily rhythmic pattern of expression. Pituitary NUCB1 mRNA expression was downregulated by estradiol. while testosterone upregulated its expression in female goldfish brain. High carbohydrate and fat suppressed NUCB1 mRNA expression in the brain and gut.

Polyglycerol behenic acid esters were added in an attempt to promote the crystallization of palm oil. Optical microscopy observation confirmed that palm-oil crystals with the addition of 1 wt% of polyglycerol behenic acid esters were smaller and the number of palm oil crystals larger than without the additives. This indicated that the polyglycerol behenic acid ester promoted nucleation and inhibited crystal growth of palm oil. X-ray diffraction patterns of palm oil without the additives revealed that palm oil crystallized in the a-form after rapid quenching of melted palm oil at 10℃. During the heating process from 10℃ to 45℃. the a-form transformed to the b-form around 15℃. and the b-form changed to the b-form around 40℃. The X-ray diffraction patterns of palm oil with the addition of polyglycerol behenic acid esters showed that palm oil crystallized in the b-form at 10℃. and did not transform to the b-form during the heating process.

This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed. a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made. we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila. and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies. but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed.

In this study. we show that hawkmoths preferentially feed on horizontally oscillating flowers. which have previously been shown to yield higher energy gains during feeding bouts than looming flowers. We also analyze natural flower motions exhibited by four hawkmoth-pollinated species. Our analysis shows these flowers have higher amplitude motions in the horizontal axis than that in the looming axis. This work demonstrates the potential for adaptation between the biomechanical determinates of flower motions and the feeding performance of hawkmoths.,True,dAKB53YAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,8,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11829-011-9150-7.pdf,18158088263819508788,/scholar?cites=18158088263819508788,,,0,0,0

Flies. who move in three dimensions while in flight. have evolved the fastest visual system in the animal kingdom to help them stabilize their flight posture and trajectories (Autrum. 1958). Partly for this reason. they have been the subject of extensive research on the neuronal basis of motion vision. the component of visual function involved in detecting movement within a scene. Using a variety of techniques. including electrophysiology. genetic manipulation. and behavioral analysis. researchers have started to unravel the earliest stages of motion processing (Clark et al.. 2011; Eichner et al.. 2011).

1057068,Sensory integration by descending interneurons in the flying fruit fly,2016,MP Suver and MH Dickinson,56,Integrative and Comparative Biology,S1,E216,Oxford University Press,A flying fly relies on many senses. including vision. olfaction. and mechanosensation. to navigate through the world and locate an attractive food source. How are these sensory signals integrated in the central brain and relayed to the motor system to guide behavior? Integration of multiple sensory signals can be performed by descending interneurons. which relay this information to motor systems via circuits in the thoracic ganglion. We have identified a group of three descending interneurons in the fruit fly that integrate information from discrete sets of visual interneurons. Each exhibits a distinct preference for optic flow corresponding to self-motion. We measured the tuning properties of the presynaptic visual interneurons. and found that a simple linear model based on these inputs can explain much of the response of the descending interneurons. Projection patterns of the three descending interneurons in the thoracic ganglion suggest that they deliver self-motion information to circuits that control movement of the head. wings. and abdomen. We monitored the output of these motor systems during tethered flight and found evidence that suggests that these three neurons are involved in distinct motor programs. This circuit may play a crucial role in sensory-motor tranformations used to guide stable flight. and provides insight into strategies employed by other flying insects.,True,dAKB53YAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,https://authors.library.caltech.edu/66445/,5971146684126486485,/scholar?cites=5971146684126486485,,,0,0,0
1057069,Octopamine neurons mediate flight-induced modulation of visual processing in Drosophila melanogaster,2014,Marie Patricia Suver,,,,,,Activity-dependent modulation of sensory systems has been documented in many organisms. and is likely to be essential for appropriate processing of information during different behavioral states. However. the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. and often their functional consequences. remain poorly characterized. I investigated the role of octopamine neurons in the flight-dependent modulation observed in visual interneurons in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The vertical system (VS) cells exhibit a boost in their response to visual motion during flight compared to quiescence. Pharmacological application of octopamine evokes responses in quiescent flies that mimic those observed during flight. and octopamine neurons that project to the optic lobes increase in activity during flight. Using genetic tools to manipulate the activity of octopamine neurons. I find that they are both necessary and sufficient for the flight-induced visual boost. This work provides the first evidence that endogenous release of octopamine is involved in state-dependent modulation of visual interneurons in flies. Further. I investigated the role of a single pair of octopamine neurons that project to the optic lobes. and found no evidence that chemical synaptic transmission via these neurons is necessary for the flight boost. However. I found some evidence that activation of these neurons may contribute to the flight boost. Wind stimuli alone are sufficient to generate transient increases in the VS cell response to motion vision. but result in no increase in baseline membrane potential. These results suggest that the flight boost originates not from a central command signal …,True,dAKB53YAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7923/,6808837632453478105,/scholar?cites=6808837632453478105,,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7923/1/suver_marie_2013_thesis.pdf,0,0,0

Martin Giurfa (UT 3 Paul Sabatier) Jury Dr. Anne-Sophie Darmaillacq (Maître de conférences. Université de Caen,Introduction Honeybees (Apis mellifera) constitute a privileged model system for the study of perception. learning and memory [1–5]. Despite their relatively small brain size. their perceptual and learning abilities are impressive. Foraging bees are able to navigate in complex environments. in which they can locate and repeatedly visit profitable food sources such as flowers [6]. Fundamental to these performances is their ability to associate certain environmental cues with food reward. namely the nectar or pollen found in flowers. In freely-flying bees. visually-driven performances of varying degrees of plasticity have been studied in controlled and carefully designed experiments in which a variety of sensory cues has been paired with a reward of sucrose solution [5]. In such free-flight conditions. it was possible to glean insights into sensory processing mechanisms. For example. honeybees. which possess trichromatic colour-vision [7]. are colour-blind for visual tasks that involve edge-detection or motion sensing. as they rely on the exclusive sensory input to long-wave photoreceptors for these tasks [8]. Further. bees use the apparent image speed across the retina to perceive their distance from a visual cue [9]. However. in the visual domain. detailed investigations into the neural correlates of such interesting behaviours and processes have been stalled until quite recently. largely due to the absence of an experimental procedure in which bees are immobilised but perform sufficiently well on visual tasks. The same problem exists for the study of visual learning: while freely-flying bees learn to efficiently solve simple as well as complex discrimination …,True,dAKB53YAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189831211.pdf#page=256,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189831211.pdf#page=256,0,0,0

Our laboratory has previously developed a retrospective method for reconstructing cell lineage trees from somatic mutations accumulated in microsatellites. This method was applied here to explore different aspects of stem cell dynamics in the mouse colon without the use of stem cell markers. We first demonstrated the reliability of our method for the study of stem cells by confirming previously established facts. and then we addressed open questions. Our findings confirmed that colon crypts are monoclonal and that. throughout adulthood. the process of monoclonal conversion plays a major role in the maintenance of crypts. The absence of immortal strand mechanism in crypts stem cells was validated by the age-dependent accumulation of microsatellite mutations. In addition. we confirmed the positive correlation between physical and lineage proximity of crypts. by showing that the colon is separated into small domains that share a common ancestor. We gained new data demonstrating that colon epithelium is clustered separately from hematopoietic and other cell types. indicating that the colon is constituted of few progenitors and ruling out significant renewal of colonic epithelium from hematopoietic cells during adulthood. Overall. our study demonstrates the reliability of cell lineage reconstruction for the study of stem cell dynamics. and it further addresses open questions in colon stem cells.

IRIS consists in a sudden change in the dominant T-helper responses to inflammation. which is not balanced by anti-inflammatory response. playing a critical role in microbial pathogenesis. A patient with restoration of host immunity during anti-tuberculosis treatment can become gravely ill with a paradoxical severe form of tuberculosis (TB) disease named TB immune reconstitution disease (IRD). The diagnosis of acute cryptic miliary TB is difficult and requires an accurate histopathology. We report a fatal association between a generalized lymphadenitis tuberculosis and IRD in a 34-year-old male patient. non-smoker. non-HIV immunocompromised. but with a previously co-morbid diabetes mellitus (DM) type I. The purpose of this report is to describe an unusual and rare case of a progressive extrapulmonary TB disease to a liver involvement. mimicking a hepatotoxicity secondary to anti-tuberculosis therapy. The diagnosis of disseminated miliary TB with cryptic pulmonary was confirmed later after performing necropsy.

An underlying assumption of these applications is that tissues grown at the same site share a similar isotopic signal. representative of the location of their origin. However. large variations in tissue isotopic compositions often exist even among conspecific individuals within local populations. which complicates origin and migration inferences. Field-data and correlation analyses have provided hints about the underlying mechanisms of within-site among-individual isotopic variance. but a theory explaining the causes and magnitude of such variance has not been established. Here we develop a mechanistic modeling framework that provides explicit predictions of the magnitude. patterns. and drivers of isotopic variation among individuals living in a common but environmentally heterogeneous habitat. The model toolbox includes isoscape models of environmental isotopic variability. an agent-based model of behavior and movement. and a physiology-biochemistry model of isotopic incorporation into tissues. We compare model predictions against observed variation in hatch-year individuals of the songbird Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) in Red Butte Canyon.

These changes were more prominent with the passage of time. After a longer period of exposure. the fish became sluggish and before dying occasionally became motionless and sometimes showed a vertical position. Internal hemorrhage was also obvious. CYP exposure resulted in a significant decrease in total protein content in different tissues while antioxidant enzymes. catalase (CAT). peroxidase (POD) and glutathione reductase (GR) showed a time-dependent increasing trend in their activities in liver. brain. gills and muscle tissues.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and cellular adhesion of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Biodentine (BD) on periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDL). Methods. PDL cells were obtained from nonerupted third molars and cultured; MTS cellular profusion test was carried out in two groups: MTA and BD. with respective controls at different time periods. Also. the LIVE/DEAD assay was performed at 24 h. For evaluation of cellular adhesion. immunocytochemistry was conducted to discern the expression of Integrin β1 and Vinculin at 12 h and 24 h. Statistical analysis was performed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results. MTA and BD exhibited living cells up to 7 days. More expressions of Integrin β1 and Vinculin were demonstrated in the control group. followed by BD and MTA. which also showed cellular loss and morphological changes. There was a significant difference in the experimental groups cultured for 5 and 7 days compared with the control. but there was no significant statistical difference between both cements. Conclusions. Neither material was cytotoxic during the time evaluated.

Pregnant mice were irradiated at 1.4 Gy on gestational day 7 (G7). Four hours after irradiation. extensive cell death was evident in the neuroepithelium and underlying mesoderm of the head region. and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-immunoreactive cells almost disappeared. Embryos with thinner lamina terminalis of the telencephalon. when compared with that of the control. were found in the irradiated group on G9. As early as G11 in some irradiated embryos the telencephalic wall was thinner and lateral ventricles were larger than those of the control. The choroid invagination from the lamina terminalis began on G11 in the control brain. but not in the affected brain. During the following development. fetuses with readily apparent hydrocephalus were consistently found among irradiated fetuses. In these brains the brain mantle was thinner. the corpus striatum and thalamic regions were smaller. and lateral ventricles were larger than those of the control. Even on G11 and G13 the frequencies of PCNA-positive cells in the brain mantle and other brain regions were lower in the hydrocephalic brain than those of the control. suggesting a decelerated proliferation of successive cell generations following exposure to X-rays. The cerebral aqueduct was open in the hydrocephalic brain during the fetal period when the lateral ventricles were dilated. The head was vaulted after birth but the cerebral aqueduct was not completely occluded even in these animals.

Since the morphological symptoms of SCMV are similar to other symptoms caused by Sugarcane streak mosaic virus (SCSMV) or nitrogen deficiency. the detection of SCMV is important through accurate diagnostic-like ELISA or RT-PCR. This research aimed to study the causative mosaic pathogen of SCMV in East Java. Indonesia. including mosaic development. The results showed that the mosaic symptom is present in all sugarcane plantations with 78% and 65% disease incidence and severity. respectively. Moreover. the detection procedure based on an amplification of cDNA of the coat protein gene sequence confirmed that SCMV was the causative agent of mosaic disease on sugarcane. Re-inoculation of healthy sugarcane plants with plant sap from a symptomatic leaf from the field showed similar mosaic or yellowish chlorotic areas on the leaf blade. and appeared on the fourth leaves upward from the inoculation leaf. in addition to showing different levels of peroxidase but not total phenol. Mosaic also correlated with the amount of total chlorophyll. Although Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) protein accumulation and activity were at a lower level in infected leaves. sucrose accumulation was at a higher level in the same leaves.

Haramaya University,Development of inbred lines is a routine activity in hybrid maize breeding program. Understanding the relative importance of general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability effects for different traits of newly developed maize lines is of paramount importance to design future breeding strategies for the development of hybrid. There are several types of mating designs available to study the combining abilities of maize inbred lines. of which line x tester mating scheme is one used to determine the combining abilities and also to categorize the lines into heterotic groups. The objectives of the study were. therefore. to estimate GCA and SCA of newly developed highland maize lines using line x tester mating design. to identify best promising hybrid crosses with desirable traits for further breeding and cultivar development. and to identify the heterotic groups of the lines involved in the crosses. Twelve lines and four testers were involved in the study. A total of 48 testcrosses along with two checks were made available for evaluation across locations. An alpha lattice design (10x5) with two replications at each location was used. Two lines (L6 and L5) showed highly significant and positive GCA effects for grain yield. Besides.

In the stony coral Favia fragum (Esper 1797). mothers produce larvae with highly variable amounts of endosymbiotic algae. and we examined the implications of this variation in symbiont density on the performance of F. fragum larvae under different environmental scenarios. High symbiont densities prolonged the period that larvae actively swam and searched for suitable settlement habitats. Thermal stress reduced survival and settlement success in F. fragum larvae. whereby larvae with high symbiont densities suffered more from non-lethal stress and were five times more likely to die compared with larvae with low symbiont densities.

SECORE uses sexually produced offspring (ie. more genetically diverse offspring) that are reared in nursery conditions at the Sea-Aquarium prior to their reintroduction to the reef. Since the beginning of this project. SECORE has succeeded in developing methods to culture coral larvae in a land-based nursery and has reintroduced several hundred recruits to the reef to date.,True,mMFpIAYAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/21986/stri_Caballero-George_2013_aaus_esdp_diving_for_science.pdf#page=45,16045052996332822820,/scholar?cites=16045052996332822820,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/21986/stri_Caballero-George_2013_aaus_esdp_diving_for_science.pdf#page=45,0,0,0

Despite control efforts targeting indoor malaria transmission. such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and deployment of indoor residual spraying. transmission of the parasite in western Kenya is still maintained. This study was carried out to determine the impact of ITNs on indoor vector densities and biting behaviour in western Kenya. Indoor collection of adult mosquitoes was done monthly in six study sites in western Kenya using pyrethrum spray collections from 2012 to 2014. The rotator trap collections were done in July–August in 2013 and May–June in 2014. Mosquitoes were collected every 2 h between 18.00 and 08.00 h. Human behaviour study was conducted via questionnaire surveys. Species within Anopheles gambiae complex was differentiated by PCR and sporozoite infectivity was determined by ELISA. Species distribution was determined and bed net coverage in the study sites was recorded. During the study a total of 5.469 mosquito vectors were collected from both PSC and Rotator traps comprising 3.181 (58.2%) Anopheles gambiae and 2.288 (41.8%) Anopheles funestus. Compared to all the study sites. Rae had the highest density of An. gambiae with a mean of 1.2 (P < 0.001) while Kombewa had the highest density of An. funestus with a mean of 1.08 (P < 0.001).

Vector resistance to insecticides has been extensively studied. however the insecticidal effects of the nets and sprayed walls on pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes has not been studied thoroughly. We evaluated the bioefficacy of LLINs of different ages and lambda-cyhalothrin (ICON 10cs) on the sprayed mud walls for a period of time on malaria vector survivorship. WHO tube bioassay was performed using diagnostic doses of lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05 %). permethrin (0.75 %) and deltamethrin (0.05 %). Cone bioassays were conducted on netting materials from 0 to 3 years old long-lasting insecticide-impregnated nets. Wall bioassays were performed monthly on mud slabs sprayed with lambdacyhalothrin over a period of seven months. All bioassays used An. gambiae mosquitoes collected from the field and the laboratory susceptible reference Kisumu strain. Concentration of the insecticides on the netting materials was examined using the gas chromatography method. Mosquitoes were identified to species level using PCR and genotyped for the kdr gene mutation frequencies. WHO bioassays results showed that populations from five sites were highly resistant to the pyrethroids (mortalities ranged from 52.5 to 75.3 %). and two sites were moderately resistant to these insecticides (80.4 – 87.2 %).

Climate variability as a result of events such as El Niño increases the highlands suitability for malaria transmission. Surveillance and monitoring is an important component of early transmission risk identification and management. However. below certain disease transmission thresholds. traditional tools for surveillance such as entomological inoculation rates may become insensitive. A rapid diagnostic kit comprising Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite surface protein and merozoite surface protein antibodies in humans was tested for early detection of transmission surges in the western Kenya highlands during an El Niño event (October 2009-February 2010). Indoor resting female adult malaria vectors were collected in western Kenya highlands in four selected villages categorized into two valley systems. the U-shaped (Iguhu and Emutete) and the V-shaped valleys (Marani and Fort Ternan) for eight months.

The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays a fundamental role in the onset and maintenance of the inflammatory cascade. Brilliant blue G (BBG). a P2X7R antagonist. has been shown to effectively promote neuroinflammatory protection. Here. we have investigated the long-term effects of the neonatal systemic inflammation on hippocampal oxidative stress. anxiety behavior and pain sensitivity in adulthood. We hypothesized that P2X7R blockade is able to modulate the effects of inflammation on these variables. Male and female rat pups received LPS and/or BBG solution intraperitoneally on the first. third. fifth and seventh postnatal days. The survival rate and body weight were evaluated during the experimental procedures. The animals were submitted to behavioral tests for anxiety (elevated plus maze) and nociception (hot-plate and tail flick) and the oxidative stress was measured by superoxide production in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus using dihydroethidium (DHE) probe. BBG increased the survival rate in lipopolysaccharide treated rats. No significant differences were found regarding anxiety behavior and pain sensitivity between the experimental groups. Systemic neonatal inflammation lead to a higher production of superoxide anion in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in adulthood and BBG inhibited that effect.

Cancer Sci. Ther,,213-215,,DNA oxidation by oxygen-radicals generated via an iron catalyzed Fenton reaction has been extensively investigated. but little is known about iron localization in the nuclei of mammalian cells. In vitro studies showed the presence of five oxygen and one nitrogen atoms in the inner coordination sphere of the Fe (II)-DNA complex using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS). The identification of ferritin in the nucleus of cultured cells. as well as iron-protein receptors in the nuclear membrane suggests that iron is actively transported into the nucleus. Therefore. pictures from energy-loss spectroscopic imaging (ESI) are included in this mini-review to illustrate the distribution of iron in a fibroblast cell line. These fibroblasts were iron-overloaded by being cultured in a medium containing Fe (III)-nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA). The elemental mapping of iron and phosphorus was coincident in ultrastructures and revealed a significant concentration of both in condensed chromatin; by contrast. the elemental mapping of nitrogen. used as a control. revealed a homogenous distribution across the entire cell. This observed preferential localization was surprising. considering the pro-oxidant status of iron and the importance of maintaining genome integrity. Interestingly. recent published works demonstrates that iron chelators such as genistein and daidzein. derived from soy isoflavones. can attenuate the expression of genes related to increased cancer risk and oxidative damage in the reproductive tract of female mice.

Much of this diversity has been cultivated through extensive hybridization of wild varieties since hybrids often exhibit dramatic phenotypic differences from the parents. This phenotypic diversity though has led to difficulties identifying and classifying the relatedness of Curcuma varieties particularly between hybrids.

However. the discovery of drugs targeting neurons is still hampered by the inability to accurately identify and quantify the phenotypic changes of multiple neurons in a single image (named multi-neuron image) of a high-content screen. Therefore. it is desirable to develop an automated image analysis method for analyzing multi-neuron images. We propose an automated analysis method with novel descriptors of neuromorphology features for analyzing HCS-based multi-neuron images. called HCS-neurons. To observe multiple phenotypic changes of neurons. we propose two kinds of descriptors which are neuron feature descriptor (NFD) of 13 neuromorphology features. e.g.. neurite length. and generic feature descriptors (GFDs). e.g.. Haralick texture. HCS-neurons can 1) automatically extract all quantitative phenotype features in both NFD and GFDs. 2) identify statistically significant phenotypic changes upon drug treatments using ANOVA and regression analysis. and 3) generate an accurate classifier to group neurons treated by different drug concentrations using support vector machine and an intelligent feature selection method. To evaluate HCS-neurons. we treated P19 neurons with nocodazole (a microtubule depolymerizing drug which has been shown to impair neurite development) at six concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 ng/mL.

So far. most studies have focused on how fast TFs diffuse. underestimating the role of nuclear architecture. We implemented a single-molecule tracking assay to determine TFs dynamics. We found that c-Myc is a global explorer of the nucleus. In contrast. the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb is a local explorer that oversamples its environment. Consequently. each c-Myc molecule is equally available for all nuclear sites while P-TEFb reaches its targets in a position-dependent manner. Our observations are consistent with a model in which the exploration geometry of TFs is restrained by their interactions with nuclear structures and not by exclusion. The geometry-controlled kinetics of TFs target-search illustrates the influence of nuclear architecture on gene regulation. and has strong implications on how proteins react in the nucleus and how their function can be regulated in space and time.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02230.001,True,mqHwfvgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,195,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02230,18284760341062100975,/scholar?cites=18284760341062100975,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02230.pdf,0,0,0

Using fast DNA tracking microscopy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and improved analysis of mean-squared displacements. we quantified DNA motion at time scales ranging from 10 ms to minutes and found that following DNA damage. DNA exhibits distinct subdiffusive regimes. In response to double-strand breaks. chromatin is more mobile at large time scales. but. surprisingly. its mobility is reduced at short time scales. This effect is even more pronounced at the site of damage. Such a pattern of dynamics is consistent with a global increase in chromatin persistence length in response to DNA damage. Scale-dependent nuclear exploration is regulated by the Rad51 repair protein. both at the break and throughout of the genome. We propose a model in which stiffening of the damaged ends by the repair complex …,True,mqHwfvgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,47,https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/abs/10.1091/mbc.e17-05-0317,12578356813581054716,/scholar?cites=12578356813581054716,,https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/pdf/10.1091/mbc.E17-05-0317,0,0,0

Measurements of nuclear chromatin compaction were recently used to understand how DNA is folded inside the nucleus and to detect cellular dysfunctions such as cancer. Super-resolution imaging opens new possibilities to measure chromatin organization in situ. Here. we performed a direct measure of chromatin compaction at the single cell level.

1057233,Single particle imaging in the cell nucleus: a quantitative approach,2013,Vincent Récamier,,,,,,The cell nucleus is a chemical reactor. Nuclear components interact with each other to express genes. duplicate the chromosomes for cell division. and protect DNA from alteration. These reactions are regulated along the cell cycle and in response to stress. One of the fundamental nuclear processes. transcription. enables the production of a messenger RNA from a template DNA sequence. While mandatory for the cell. transcription nevertheless may involve a very small number of molecules. Indeed. a single gene would have only few copies in the genome. During my PhD. I studied nuclear processes in human cells nuclei at the single molecule level with novel imaging techniques. I developed new statistical tools to quantify nuclear components movement that revealed a dynamic nuclear architecture. Since the 90s. simple methods have been developed for the observation of single molecules in the cell. These experiments can be conducted in an ordinary inverted microscope. We used these methods to monitor nuclear molecules called transcription factors (TF) that regulate transcription. From TF dynamics. we concluded that nuclear exploration by transcription factors is regulated by their chemical interactions with partners. The organization of the components of the nucleus guide transcription factors in their search of a gene. As an example of this organization. we then studied chromatin. the de-condensed form of nuclear DNA. proving that this folding displays the characteristics of a self-organized fractal structure. This structure changes in response to cellular fate and stress.

NY,Chromosome architecture needs to be investigated in relation with the chemical function of DNA. The kinetics of gene expression. DNA replication. and repair are driven by the mechanisms by which a functional nuclear protein finds its substrate in the nucleus. Single-particle tracking (SPT) is a method to quantify fluorescent molecules dynamics from the tracks of the single molecules recorded by high-resolution microscopes. SPT offers direct observation of the movement and single-molecule resolution. Usually SPT is performed on membranes because of higher contrast. Here. we introduce a novel method to record the trajectories of weakly fluorescent molecules in the nucleus of living cells.

The extraction efficiency using Ired-Irrad®. a newly-patented infrared apparatus (IR). was compared to water bath (WB) conventional extraction. Under optimal conditions. as suggested by the model and confirmed experimentally. the total phenolic content yield was enhanced by more than 30% using IR as contrasted to WB. which even required 27% more ethanol consumption. High Performance Liquid Chromatography analyses quantified the two major phenolic compounds of the leaves: Oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol. which were both intensified by 18% and 21%. respectively. IR extracts increased the antiradical activity by 25% and the antioxidant capacity by 51% compared to WB extracts. On the other hand. extracts of olive leaves obtained by both techniques exhibited equal effects regarding the inhibition of 20 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) varying between 3.125 and 12.5 mg/mL. Similarly. both extracts inhibited Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) secretion by Aspergillus flavus. with no growth inhibition of the fungus. Finally. optimization using RSM allowed us to suggest other IR operating conditions aiming at significantly reducing the consumption of energy and solvent. while maintaining similar quantity and quality of phenolic compounds as what is optimally obtained using WB.

Extensive studies have been detailed on how NK cells get activated and recognize cancer cells.

Consequently. the current development of new immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at inducing or optimizing the immune response directed against the tumor and opened the way to new treatments of cancers. Besides the several known classical strategies used by tumor cells to escape to immune surveillance. it should be noted that the evasion of immunosurveillance by tumor cells is also under the control of the tumor microenvironment complexity and plasticity [1. 2].Among the stromal cells. activated fibroblasts. termed cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs). play a critical role in the complex process of tumor-stroma interaction. CAFs. one of the prominent stromal cell population in most types of human carcinomas. are α-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin) positive. spindle-shaped cells. who closely resemble normal myofibroblasts but express specific markers (ie. FAP (fibroblast-associated protein). PDGFR-β (platelet-derived growth factor)) together with the fibroblastic marker FSP-1 (fibroblast specific protein 1) and vimentin (a mesenchymal marker). CAFs are also characterized by the absence of epithelial (cytokeratin. E-cadherin). endothelial (CD31) and fully differentiated smooth muscle (smoothelin) markers [3]. CAFs differentiate and proliferate in the tumor microenvironment in a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-dependent manner from other cell types such …,True,DuAQkogAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Salem_Chouaib/publication/291391934_Cancer-associated_Fibroblasts_and_Modulation_of_the_Antitumor_Immune_Response/links/56fa559a08ae81582bf4c029/Cancer-associated-Fibroblasts-and-Modulation-of-the-Antitumor-Immune-Response.pdf,16433643581381598951,/scholar?cites=16433643581381598951,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Salem_Chouaib/publication/291391934_Cancer-associated_Fibroblasts_and_Modulation_of_the_Antitumor_Immune_Response/links/56fa559a08ae81582bf4c029/Cancer-associated-Fibroblasts-and-Modulation-of-the-Antitumor-Immune-Response.pdf,0,0,0

Des preuves émergentes suggèrent que ces fibroblastes sont impliqués dans l'altération de la réponse immune anti-tumorale. Cependant. les mécanismes immuno-modulateurs sous-jacents dépendants de ces fibroblastes ne sont encore que très partiellement définis. Au cours de ma thèse. j’ai mis en évidence que les fibroblastes associés au mélanome diminuent la susceptibilité des cellules tumorales de mélanome à la lyse induite par les cellules Natural killer (NK) par un mécanisme dépendant de la sécrétion de métalloprotéinases matricielles (MMPs) actives. Cette sécrétion de MMPs réduit l'expression de deux ligands du récepteur activateur NKG2D. MICA/B. à la surface des cellules tumorales et diminue par conséquent l'activité cytotoxique des cellules NK dépendante de NKG2D contre les cellules tumorales de mélanome. D’autre part. grâce à une approche génomique globale. mon travail a montré que l’hypoxie au sein du stroma tumoral pourrait augmenter les capacités immuno-modulatrices des CAFs en modifiant l’expression d’un ensemble de gènes qui codent pour des protéines immunosuppressives. L’ensemble de ces résultats démontrent donc que les CAFs sont des déterminants essentiels modifiant la susceptibilité des cellules tumorales aux cellules tueuses mais qu’il existerait également un dialogue entre le microenvironnement hypoxique et les CAFs leur permettant d’augmenter leur potentiel immunosuppresseur.,True,DuAQkogAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.theses.fr/2017SACLS114,,,,https://www.theses.fr/2017SACLS114.pdf,0,0,0

If the balance of these effects is beneficial on average. we would expect cells to evolve high rates of acceptance of horizontally transferred genes. whereas if it is detrimental. cells should reduce the rate of HGT as far as possible. It has been proposed that the rate of HGT was very high in the early stages of prokaryotic evolution. and hence there were no separate lineages of organisms. Only when the HGT rate began to fall. would lineages begin to emerge with their own distinct sets of genes. Evolution would then become more tree-like.

We identify two novel Spok homologs located within a large (74–167 kbp) region (the Spok block) that resides in different chromosomal locations in different strains. We confirm that the SPOK protein performs both killing and resistance functions and show that these activities are dependent on distinct domains. a predicted nuclease and kinase domain.

In some species and/or some meiotic processes. aneuploid or diploid gametes can also be generated due to chromosomal non-disjunction and/or the co-packaging of two of the four haploid nuclei into the same gamete. Here we show that another process is involved in generating genotypes of sexual progeny from a hybrid cross between two divergent lineages of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Through micro-dissection of 1358 basidiospores from 194 basidia and genotyping using 33 co-dominant genetic markers. the genotypes of all 230 germinated basidiospores from 94 basidia were obtained. The minimum haploid genotypes required to constitute the observed genotypes from each basidium were then inferred. Our results demonstrated that more than four haploid nuclear genotypes are required to explain the observed genotypes of basidiospores in seven of the 94 basidia. Our results suggest that mitotic recombination within basidia must be involved to produce the observed genotypes in these seven basidia. The mitotic recombination likely includes both chromosomal loss and crossing over.

In the opportunistic basidiomycete pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. intervarietal hybrids are commonly found infecting patients. The two parental varieties C. neoformans var. grubii and C. neoformans var. neoformans mate readily under laboratory conditions. but the hybrid basidiospores have germination rates about four times lower than those from intravarietal crosses. Here. we used microdissection to collect basidiospores from a hybrid cross and analysed the genotypes of germinated basidiospores to identify potentially antagonistic allelic combinations between loci that impact basidiospore germination.

In fungi this phenomenon takes the shape of spore killing. and in the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora sitophila. the Sk-1 spore killer element is found in many natural populations. In this study. we identify the gene responsible for spore killing in Sk-1 by generating both long and short-read genomic data and by using these data to perform a genome wide association test. Through molecular dissection. we show that a single 412 nucleotide long open reading frame generates a product that both acts as a poison capable of killing sibling spores and as an antidote that rescues spores that produce it. By phylogenetic analysis. we demonstrate that the gene is likely to have been introgressed from the closely related species N. hispaniola. and we identify three subclades of N. sitophila. one where Sk-1 is fixed. another where Sk-1 is absent. and a third where both killer and sensitive strain are found. Finally. we show that spore killing can be suppressed through an RNA interference based genome defense pathway known as meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA. Spk-1 is not related to other known meiotic drive genes. and similar sequences are only found within Neurospora. These results shed new light on the diversity of genes capable of causing meiotic drive. their origin and evolution and their interaction with the host genome.,True,_GkEY58AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,7,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.923946v1.abstract,155706947435014356,/scholar?cites=155706947435014356,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.29.923946.full.pdf,0,0,0

Platelets are the major causative agents of this disease because their elevated activity and aggregation would increase the risk of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. as well as ischemia. A number of polymorphisms in platelet receptors can increase the risk of ischemia and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been detected in platelets. In addition. polymorphisms in other genes have been shown to cause platelet adhesion and aggregation that plays a role in ischemia. Patients respond differently to anti-platelet drugs which are used to treat patients with ischemia.

As plants are sessile. they have developed unique mechanisms to adjust with varied light intensities. Light is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules with the help of light harvesting proteins (LHCP) present in pigments-protein complexes of photosysten II and photosysten I. In this review emphasis has given on how plants adjust to changing light conditions by inducing changes in dynamic components of photosystems and dissipation of excess light as heat known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ).,True,PScym20AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satpal_Turan2/publication/230785717_Light_Acclimation_in_Plants_Photoinhibition_and_Photoprotection/links/0fcfd5045ca7de9867000000/Light-Acclimation-in-Plants-Photoinhibition-and-Photoprotection.pdf,8738039621206482018,/scholar?cites=8738039621206482018,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satpal_Turan2/publication/230785717_Light_Acclimation_in_Plants_Photoinhibition_and_Photoprotection/links/0fcfd5045ca7de9867000000/Light-Acclimation-in-Plants-Photoinhibition-and-Photoprotection.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,Plants face many challenges during biotic and abiotic stresses during their lifetime. Salinity stress is the most typical abiotic stress and combines water stress and ionic stress. It affects plants in many aspects at the molecular. cellular. and morphological levels. In response and adaptation to salt stress. plant gene regulation is modulated at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Efforts have been made to overcome salinity by traditional approaches such as breeding. priming. and modern techniques of genetic engineering. However. because salt tolerance depends on multigenic properties. it is hard to control this problem simply by a single gene transfer.

However. the disorganization of the cytoskeleton leads to form microparticles (MP) that carry membrane and cytoplasmic constituents from their parent cells they are released from. Therefore. authors investigated the effect of the occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation on MP levels. Material and Methods: The current study was conducted on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation and 29 controls matched by gender. age. and smoking habits. The MP levels measured by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS–). and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Results: Total MP (PS–/PS+) levels. regardless of phenotype. were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation than in healthy individuals (p= 0.0004). Negative phosphatidylserine microparticles were predominant in medical exposed workers and. to a lesser extent. in controls (68% and 57%. respectively). With regard to phenotypic characterization of cellular origin. MP derived from platelets (CD41a+). endothelial (CD146+). leucocytes (CD45+) and erythrocytes (CD235a+) MP were significantly enhanced in exposed workers compared with controls (p< 0.0001).

In this study. we discover that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection results in the accumulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) protein and GFP-LC3 puncta in vitro and an increase in autophagosomes/autolysosomes in vivo. The fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes is essential for virus replication. Knockdown of autophagy-related genes reduced JEV replication in vitro. as indicated by viral RNA and protein levels. We also note that JEV infection in autophagy-impaired cells displayed active caspases cleavage and cell death. Moreover. we find that JEV induces higher type I interferon (IFN) activation in cells deficient in autophagy-related genes as the cells exhibited increased phosphorylation and dimerization of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) aggregation. Finally. we find that autophagy is indispensable for efficient JEV replication even in an IFN-defective background.

We found that deletion of TRIM29 enhanced macrophage production of type I interferons and protected mice from infection with influenza virus. while challenge of Trim29−/− mice with Haemophilus influenzae resulted in lethal lung inflammation due to massive production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages.

It is widely accepted that the soluble oligomers of β‐PrP are neurotoxic and that they are more pathologically significant. To unravel the molecular mechanism under the conversion process. it is critical to identify the factors that can promote the conversion from PrPc to the β‐oligomers. By recording circular dichroism spectra and performing a size‐exclusion HPLC assay. we found that the conformation of the recombinant human prion protein (rPrPc) was converted from an α‐helical conformation into β‐sheet oligomers under a macromolecular crowding condition. The soluble β‐oligomers of rPrP were resistant to proteinase K digestion and could bind to the dyes thioflavin T and 8‐anilino‐1‐naphthalene sulfonate.

The development of reagents with high affinity and specificity for PreS1 is of great significance for early diagnosis and treatment of HBV infection.

Alignment of the positive phage clones revealed a putative consensus PreS1 binding motif of HXnHXmHP/R. Moreover. a peptide named P7 (KHMHWHPPALNT) was highly enriched and occurred with a surprisingly high frequency of 72%. A thermodynamic study revealed that P7 has a higher binding affinity to PreS1 than the other peptides. Furthermore.

Surveys in India. initially conducted in 1991–1993 and repeated in 2000. 2002. 2003 and 2007. revealed that the population of Gyps bengalensis had fallen by 2007 to 0.1% of its numbers in the early 1990s. with the population of Gyps indicus and G. tenuirostris combined having fallen to 3.2% of its earlier level. A survey of G. bengalensis in western Nepal indicated that the size of the population in 2009 was 25% of that in 2002.

Populations of all three species of vulture remained at a low level. but the decline had slowed and may even have reversed for G. bengalensis. both in India and Nepal. However. estimates of the most recent population trends are imprecise. so it is possible that declines may be continuing. though at a significantly slower rate. The degree to which the decline of G. bengalensis in India has slowed is consistent with the expected effects on population trend of a measured change in the level of contamination of ungulate carcasses with the drug diclofenac. which is toxic to vultures. following a ban on its veterinary use in 2006.

Despite this species being considered ‘Least Concern’on the IUCN Red List. the population in Upper Mustang had declined substantially in the early to mid-2000s. During that period. the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac was commonly used to treat illness and injury in domesticated ungulates throughout Nepal. The timing and magnitude of declines in Himalayan Griffon in Upper Mustang resemble the declines in resident populations of the ‘Critically Endangered’White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis and Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris in Nepal. both of which are also known to be highly sensitive to diclofenac.

Nepal once held one of the largest populations of breeding Bearded Vultures in the Himalaya (Gil et al. 2009). Two recent surveys of the species have taken place in the mountain district of Mustang. e first showed a 73–80% decline between 2002 and 2008 in Upper Mustang (Acharya et al. 2010) whilst the second showed a stable population in the Lower Mustang between 2002 and 2006 (Giri 2013). although the two surveys differed in their methods and therefore are not directly comparable. However. the number of individuals observed per day and per km in the Lower Mustang study—0.50–0.80 individuals/day and 0.03–0.05 individuals/km (Giri 2013)—were comparable with the rates observed at the end of the Upper Mustang study—0.76 individuals/day and 0.07 individuals/km (Acharya et al. 2010). e rates at the start of the Upper Mustang study were considerably higher—2.79 individuals/day and 0.35 individuals/km (Acharya et al. 2010).

Hypertension-related knowledge and practice such as life style modification. physical activity. nutrition etc. plays an important role in controlling and preventing its long-term complications of hypertension. Therefore the purpose of the study was to find out the awareness of hypertensive patients about their own disease and self care practices. A cross-sectional descriptive study was done in the Pokhara sub metropolitan-13 (10% of total toles). Data was collected with all the respondents who were taking anti-hypertensive medicine of that area. which included 67 respondents. Data was collected from July to August. 2015 with structured interview schedule and data analysis was done by using SPSS version 16. Eighty six percent of the respondents were aware about hypertension. Most of the respondents (64%) belonged to the age group of 60 and above with mean age of 65.21±11.92 years. 60% were male. 71.6% were literate and 38.8% were diagnosed as hypertension since 1 to 5 years. Fifty two percent of the respondents have positive family history of Hypertension. The awareness regarding hypertension seems good but less self care practices among the study population was revealed.

Conservation breeding programmes are expensive. time consuming. and long-term. and involve commitment of human and financial resources. They are taken up only when in situ actions may not save a species in the short and long term. and CBP is the only answer. as was the case 15 years ago for Gyps species of Asian vultures. As soon as we came to know that these vultures were dying due to extensive use of the killer drug diclofenac. and the rate of decline (30–40% every year) would exterminate the species in a few years. BNHS and RSPB. with the help of various state governments and organizations. started vulture breeding centres. During the last 10 years. we have been very successful in breeding vultures. and our programme is going on as planned. According to our master plan. the first batch of captive-bred vultures will be released in 2016. One of the crucial components of any conservation breeding and release programme is the removal of the cause (s) that made the species rare in the first instance. If the main cause (s) is not removed. the captive-bred individuals will die. Anyway. the mortality of captive-bred animals after release is from 40 to 60% as some individuals never learn how to live in the wild. If the main reasons for rarity are still prevalent. there could be 100% mortality among the released individuals.

1057391,Post-translational modifications of Ataxin-3. the protein involved in Machado-Joseph disease,2009,Carlos Matos,,,,,,Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). the most common form of autosomal dominantly-inherited ataxia. belongs to a group of neurodegenerative disorders sharing the attribute of being caused by unstable expansions of CAG codon repeats in the respective genes. These disorders are collectively named as polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion diseases. since that expansion is translated as a lengthy glutamine sequence in the otherwise unrelated proteins encoded by each gene. Ataxin-3 (atx3). the protein associated with MJD. is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) which mainly comprises a N-terminal catalytic domain. termed Josephin domain (JD). and a C-terminal tail that contains two or three ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) and the polyQ stretch. Though its concrete biological function remains to be elucidated. information regarding atx3 activity and molecular interactions points out some involvement with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and with transcription regulation. To this date. the experimentally observed deubiquitinating activity has been reported as being very low. being admitted that. as with many other DUBs. atx3 activity may be closely regulated and thus require external factors to reach optimal levels. The way expanded atx3 and every other polyQ-expanded proteins lead to the corresponding diseases also remains to be determined but. though it is admitted that there are some events common to all of the diseases (including formation of toxic protein aggregates). the different properties of each particular protein hosting the polyQ expansion are probably the cause of the different profiles exhibited by each polyQ expansion disease …,True,XY_iflQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://eg.uc.pt/handle/10316/27048,,,,https://eg.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/27048/1/Tese%20de%20Mestrado%20-%20Carlos%20Matos%20%28final%29.pdf,0,0,0

Abundantly expressed in the CNS. they have the peculiar characteristic of being activated by both voltage and intracellular calcium rise. The increase in intracellular calcium via voltage‐dependent calcium channels (Cav) during spiking triggers conformational changes and BK channel opening. This narrows the action potential and induces a fast after‐hyperpolarization that shuts calcium channels. The tight coupling between BK and Cav channels at presynaptic active zones makes them particularly suitable for regulating calcium entry and neurotransmitter release. While in most synapses.

Recently. selection/mutation genetic algorithms have been proposed to efficiently and automatically tune these parameters. Nonetheless. since similar firing patterns can be achieved through different combinations of Gi-max values. it is not clear how well these algorithms approximate the corresponding properties of real cells. Here we have evaluated the issue by exploiting a unique opportunity offered by the cerebellar granule cell (GrC). which is electrotonically compact and has therefore allowed the direct experimental measurement of ionic currents. Previous models were constructed using empirical tuning of Gi-max values to match the original data set. Here. by using repetitive discharge patterns as a template. the optimization procedure yielded models that closely approximated the experimental Gi-max values. These models. in addition to repetitive firing. captured additional features. including inward rectification. near-threshold oscillations and resonance. which were not used as features.

While it has been proven that CFs contact molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) via spillover mechanisms. it remains to be elucidated to what extent CFs contact the main type of interneuron in the granular layer. i.e. the Golgi cells (GoCs). This issue is particularly relevant. because direct contacts would imply that CFs can also control computations at the input stage of the cerebellar cortical network. Here. we performed a systematic morphological investigation of labeled CFs and GoCs at the light microscopic level following their path and localization through the neuropil in both the granular and molecular layer. Whereas the appositions of CFs to Purkinje cells. stellate cells and basket cells in the molecular layer were prominent and numerous. those to cell-bodies and dendrites of GoCs in both the granular layer and molecular layer were virtually absent.

Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However. little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously. we identified that translational control by eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al.. 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translation. cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover. selectively inhibiting eIF2α-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB. or knocking down oligophrenin-1—an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2α—in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively. our findings suggest that eIF2α-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17517.001,True,jalYbmoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,20,https://elifesciences.org/articles/17517,16119676097669765985,/scholar?cites=16119676097669765985,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/17517.pdf,0,0,0
1057399,Control of Cocaine Relapse: Lost in Translation,2018,Martina Sgritta,84,Biological psychiatry,3,e25-e26,Elsevier,Our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cocaine addiction remains superficial and incomplete. which presents enormous challenges to the development of novel pharmacotherapies for this behavior disorder. Thus far. the bulk of the studies in this field have been focused on targeting the initial effects of cocaine in the brain (1). Only recently attention has moved to discerning the process leading to relapse susceptibility. which represents the primary obstacle in the treatment of drug addiction (1). When chronic cocaine users experience a long abstinence from drug administration. they undergo a phenomenon that has been called the “incubation of craving.” Relapse often occurs when. after withdrawal. addicted individuals receive cocaine-associated cues (2). This triggers the subjective experience of drug craving. which has been proposed to be mediated by synaptic alterations in multiple brain regions involved in addiction and ultimately elicits drug-seeking behavior (3). One of the processes that plays a key role in relapse to cocaine use is messenger RNA translation (protein synthesis)(4). Translational control has been reported to be highly regulated by both metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the ventral tegmental area (3. 5). However. relatively little is known about the modulation of protein synthesis by glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). the region of the brain’s reward system linked to the behavioral reinforcement associated with dopamine release after cocaine self-administration (1).

Drought led to a similar but delayed host response. while the combined stress gave larger and earlier changes in transcripts than for the two stresses separately.

Preliminary data,2000,O Janne Kjønaas and Harald Aalde and Lars S Dalen and Helene A de Wit and Toril Eldhuset and Bernt-Håvard Øyen,,BASE,,,,Between 1990 and 2010 the projected emissions of greenhouse gases in Norway is assumed to increase 24%. As a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. Norway is supposed to limit the greenhouse gas emissions in the period 2008–2012 to 1% above the 1990 level. Potentially. forestry activities may contribute as a means to achieve the set target of emission reductions. The initial Norwegian views and proposals for definitions and accounting framework for activities under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol was reported to the UNFCCC August 1 2000 by the Norwegian Ministry of Environment. There was also an annex to the submission with preliminary data and information on Articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. This paper is based on this annex. and focuses mainly on data for forests and other woodlands. Preliminary data indicate that approximately 85% of the carbon (C) pool of forested systems is found in the soil. The major part of the annual C sequestration takes place in living biomass and soil. while sequestration in wood products and landfills etc. has been found to be of minor importance.

Here. we present structural and biochemical data revealing the organization of Hsp104 from Chaetomium thermophilum at 3.7 Å resolution. We show that the coiled-coil domains encircling the disaggregase constitute a ‘restraint mask’ that sterically controls the mobility and thus the unfolding activity of the ATPase modules. In addition. we identify a mechanical linkage that coordinates the activity of the two ATPase rings and accounts for the high unfolding potential of Hsp104.

Despite its importance for stress response and pathogenicity. it is still elusive how the bacterial degradation labelling is regulated. Here. we delineate the mechanism how McsB targets aberrant proteins during stress conditions. Structural data reveal a self-compartmentalized kinase. in which the active sites are sequestered in a molecular cage. The closed octamer interconverts with other oligomers in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and. contrary to these open forms. preferentially labels unfolded proteins. In vivo data show that heat-shock triggers accumulation of higher-order oligomers. of which the octameric McsB is essential for surviving stress situations. The interconversion of open and closed oligomers represents a distinct regulatory mechanism of a degradation labeler. allowing the McsB kinase to adapt its potentially dangerous enzyme function to the needs of the bacterial cell.,True,Xsix4w8AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287243v1.abstract,9874418770175573076,/scholar?cites=9874418770175573076,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/08/2020.09.08.287243.full.pdf,0,0,0

The central player here is the protein kinase McsB that is known to phosphorylate and regulate certain heat‐shock transcription factors.McsB is of great interest for at least two reasons. First. McsB is the only protein kinase shown to phosphorylate arginine residues and. consistently. displays no homology to classic protein kinases.

The presence of a cysteine residue and two metal ions in the active site of RTCB. the catalytic subunit of the tRNA-LC. suggests that the tRNA-LC could be susceptible to oxidative inactivation in aerobic conditions. Here. we report that the tRNA-LC is sensitive to oxidation and reveal a co-evolutionary association with PYROXD1. a conserved and essential. yet uncharacterizedoxidoreductase. We show that PYROXD1 preserves the activity of the tRNA-LC in mammalian cells by converting RTCB-bound NAD (P) H into NAD (P)+. thereby sustaining pre-tRNA splicing and UPR. NAD (P)+. typically an oxidative co-enzyme. acts here as an antioxidant by abrogating the local. copper-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species that inactivate the tRNA-LC. We also show that the ability of PYROXD1 to protect the tRNA-LC against oxidation is impaired in genetic variants that cause myopathies in humans. Thus. we have established that the tRNA-LC is a redox-regulated metalloenzyme. and PYROXD1 an oxidoreductase that preserves tRNA-LC activity in aerobic environments through a novel. protecting mechanism.

In the present review. we re-evaluate the models of transcription factories in the light of recent and older data. Based on this analysis. we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific. co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear space.

Based on degradome sequencing and prediction of target genes. it was found that the miRNAs might mediate the regulations of phagocytosis. apoptosis or pro-phenoloxidase system by targeting different genes.

1057466,The role of miR-100 in regulating apoptosis of breast cancer cells,2015,Yi Gong and Tianliang He and Lu Yang and Geng Yang and Yulei Chen and Xiaobo Zhang,5,Scientific reports,1,1-13,Nature Publishing Group,Breast cancer is a serious health problem worldwide. Inhibition of apoptosis plays a major role in breast cancer tumorigenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation of apoptosis. However. the regulation of breast cancer apoptosis by miRNAs has not been intensively investigated. To address this issue. the effect of miR-100 on the cell proliferation of different breast cancer cells was characterized in the present study. The results showed that miR-100 was significantly upregulated in SK-BR-3 cells compared with other human breast cancer cells (MCF7. MDA-MB-453. T47D. HCC1954 and SUM149). Silencing miR-100 expression with anti-miRNA-100 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-100) initiated apoptosis of SK-BR-3 cells in vitro and in vivo. However. the overexpression of miR-100 led to the proliferation inhibition of the miR-100-downregulated breast cancer cells.

However. a comprehensive view of apoptosis-associated miRNAs has not been intensively characterized. In this study. the shrimp miRNA microarray data showed that 199 miRNAs were involved in the regulation of apoptosis. among which 8 miRNAs were evolutionarily conserved in animals. The loss-of-function experiments in vivo in shrimp revealed that miR-100 was served as an anti-apoptosis miRNA through targeting the mRNA of trypsin gene. The results indicated that the silencing of miR-100 expression resulted in the increase of apoptotic activity of shrimp hemocytes and further led to the decreases of virus genome copies in shrimp and virus-infected shrimp mortality compared with the controls.

There are few examples where modification of a single CpG dinucleotide directly affects transcription factor binding and regulation of a target gene in vivo. Here. we show that the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1—that typically binds T/AGATA sites—can also recognise CGATA elements. but only if the CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated. We focus on a single CGATA site in the c-Kit gene which progressively becomes unmethylated during haematopoiesis. We observe that methylation attenuates GATA-1 binding and gene regulation in cell lines. In mice. converting the CGATA element to a TGATA site that cannot be methylated leads to accumulation of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors. Thus. the CpG dinucleotide is essential for normal erythropoiesis and this study …,True,6b2IrVgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,5,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16388-1,12162618033818131974,/scholar?cites=12162618033818131974,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16388-1,0,0,0

The onset. progression. and resolution of the inflammatory response to endotoxin are usually tightly controlled to avoid chronic inflammation. Members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors are key drivers of inflammation that activate sets of genes in response to inflammatory signals. Such responses are typically short-lived and can be suppressed by proteins that act post-translationally. such as the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) family. Less is known about direct transcriptional regulation of these responses. however.

Its headwaters originate about 40 km north of Lake Nyasa. The floodplain is about 260 km long and up to 52 km wide at its widest point. covers approximately 6.300 km2. and comprises a myriad of rivers and seasonally flooded marshes and swamps. It has a rich flora and fauna and is of immense importance for biodiversity and contains several endemics including three species of birds and a frog. The floodplain is rich in waterbirds and traditionally in large mammals but an increasing pressure from settlements and agriculture have blocked wildlife migration routes and the fishery is in decline.

By using point counts and playback. we found the species to be present in the marshland all around the lake. with preference for two clearly defined habitat types: one comprising extensively grazed tussocks of Festuca dolichophylla and the other of rather uniform stands of Juncus balticus with undergrowth. or smaller open spaces. with various low herbs. We estimate the suitable habitat of the species to be a minimum of 100 km2 and based upon our point count data we provide indicative population figures of 6.200 individuals. which is higher than previous estimates. No records were obtained without playback. although five minutes of silent listening prior to playback were used at each point. All records were in vegetation of at least 0.5 m tall and in the marshy edge on muddy ground with less than 20 cm of water depth.

Centrosomes also duplicate during cell division. but the mechanism controlling this process is incompletely understood. We describe an alternative splice form of SadB encoding a short SADB Ser/Thr kinase whose activity fluctuates during the cell cycle. localizes to centrosomes. and controls centrosome duplication.

Ltd,Cytosolic division in mitotic cells involves the function of a number of cytoskeletal proteins. whose coordination in the spatio‐temporal control of cytokinesis is poorly defined. We studied the role of p85/p110 phosphoinositide kinase (PI3K) in mammalian cytokinesis. Deletion of the p85α regulatory subunit induced cell accumulation in telophase and appearance of binucleated cells. whereas inhibition of PI3K activity did not affect cytokinesis. Moreover. reconstitution of p85α‐deficient cells with a Δp85α mutant. which does not bind the catalytic subunit. corrected the cytokinesis defects of p85α−/− cells. We analyzed the mechanism by which p85α regulates cytokinesis; p85α deletion reduced Cdc42 activation in the cleavage furrow and septin 2 accumulation at this site.

Activation of the SAC occurs through a series of ordered molecular events that result in recruitment of Mad1:Mad2 complexes to improperly attached kinetochores. The current model involves sequential phospho-dependent recruitment of Bub3:Bub1 to KNL1 followed by binding of Mad1:Mad2 to Bub1. Here. we show in non-transformed diploid human cells that the KNL1-Bub3-Bub1 (KBB) pathway is required during normal mitotic progression when kinetochores are misaligned but is nonessential for SAC activation and Mad2 loading when kinetochores are unattached from microtubules.

The PI3K pathway regulates cell survival. migration. and division. and is mutated in approximately half of human tumors. For this reason. it is important to define the function of the ubiquitous PI3K subunits. p110α and p110β. Whereas p110α is activated at G1-phase entry and promotes protein synthesis and gene expression. p110β activity peaks in S phase and regulates DNA synthesis. PI3K activity also increases at the onset of mitosis. but the isoform activated is unknown; we have examined p110α and p110β function in mitosis. p110α was activated at mitosis entry and regulated early mitotic events. such as PIP3 generation. prometaphase progression. and spindle orientation.

However. it is unknown whether there are differences in spindle or kinetochore composition or architecture which influence the efficiency chromosome segregation in different cell types. Here we show that the transition of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to a mesenchymal phenotype causes a stabilisation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments and an increase in the frequency of chromosome mis-segregation. due to inefficient error-correction. during mitosis. We find that this is caused by microtubule detyrosination during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and that parthenolide. a tubulin carboxypeptidase inhibitor. efficiently reverts mes-enchymal cells to the epithelial mode of chromosome segregation.

The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) is a leading vaccine candidate antigen against asexual blood stages of malaria parasite. To date. little is known about the extent of sequence variation in the Plasmodium vivax MSP-1 gene (Pvmsp-1) among Indian isolates. Since P. vivax accounts for >50% of malaria cases in India and in Colombia. it is essential to know the Pvmsp-1 gene variability in these two countries to sustain it as a vaccine candidate. The extent of polymorphism in Pvmsp-1 gene among Indian and Colombian isolates is described. The sequence variation in the region encompassing the inter-species conserved blocks (ICBs) five and six of Pvmsp-1 gene was examined. PCR was carried out to amplify the polymorphic region of Pvmsp-1 and the PCR products from twenty (nine Indian and 11 Colombian) isolates were sequenced and aligned with Belem and Salvador-1 sequences. Results revealed three distinct types of sequences among these isolates. namely. Salvador-like. Belem-like and a third type sequence which was generated due to interallelic recombination between Salvador-like sequences and Belem-like sequences. Existence of the third type in majority (44%) showed that allelic recombinations play an important role in PvMSP1 diversity in natural parasite population.

Although tRNA modifications seem to be more relevant for the ribosome function and cell physiology as a whole. some rRNA modifications have also been seen to play pivotal roles. essentially those located in central ribosome regions. RNA methylation at nucleobases and ribose moieties of nucleotides appear to frequently modulate its chemistry and structure. RNA methyltransferases comprise a superfamily of highly specialized enzymes that accomplish a wide variety of modifications. These enzymes exhibit a poor degree of sequence similarity in spite of using a common reaction cofactor and modifying the same substrate type. Relationships and lineages of RNA methyltransferases have been extensively discussed. but no consensus has been reached. To shed light on this topic. we performed amino acid and codon-based sequence analyses to determine phylogenetic relationships and molecular evolution. We found that most Class I RNA MTases are evolutionarily related to protein and cofactor/vitamin biosynthesis methyltransferases.

Cattle are the natural host of BLV where it integrates into B-cells. producing a lifelong infection. Most infected animals remain asymptomatic but following a protracted latency period about 5 % develop an aggressive leukemia/lymphoma. mirroring the disease trajectory of HTLV-1.

1057561,Elucidating the role of bovine leukemia virus encoded micro-RNAs,2014,Keith Durkin and Nicolas Rosewick and Mélanie Momont and Wannes Thys and Arsène Burny and Michel Georges and Anne Van den Broeke,11,Retrovirology,1,1-1,BioMed Central,Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) and its close relative Human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) display similar patterns of pathogenesis and genome organisation. The natural host of BLV is cattle. however it is possible to experimentally infect sheep with the virus. Infected sheep develop tumors following a significantly reduced latency period compared to cattle (20 months on average). making for an attractive cancer model. Like HTLV-1. BLV mRNAs/proteins transcribed from the 5’LTR are silenced in tumors. However. our group and others have recently reported the presence of five highly expressed micro-RNAs transcribed from the BLV genome via a noncanonical RNA polymerase III pathway in BLV induced tumors. It has been noted that one of these micro-RNAs (BLV-miR-B4-3p) shares a seed sequence with miR-29. a regulator of the tumor suppressor HBP1. This observation points to one potential role for a single micro-RNA. however the role of the remaining micro-RNAs remains to be uncovered. In order to further explore potential targets of the BLV micro-RNAs we have carried out high throughput RNA sequencing of a number of experientially induced ovine and natural bovine BLV tumors. in addition to ovine derived BLV tumor cell lines. As a result we have identified a target of the viral-microRNAs and have begun exploring its role in the life cycle of the virus and its potential contribution to tumorigenesis.

Using this outbred animal model of B-cell transformation. oncogenic modifications reflected in altered microRNA expression can be identified and compared as the disease progresses. We have analyzed the miRNome of transformed B-cells isolated from leukemic sheep. Using Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA) assays and High-Throughput (HT) sequencing of small RNA libraries. we identified differentially-expressed microRNAs associated with B-cell transformation. For miRBase database-matched sheep orthologs there was a good overall quantitative correlation between data generated with both techniques. Furthermore. deep sequencing identified variants of mature microRNA transcripts. indicating that isomir distribution might be of biological significance. Finally. HT sequencing revealed unknown candidate microRNAs which were confirmed both in silico using miRDeep and experimentally using stem-loop RT-QPCR methods. Target prediction tools (miRanda. targetscan) suggest that these microRNAs might target both cellular and viral mRNAs. Down-regulation of viral mRNAs might contribute to tumor-associated virus silencing and play a role in immune escape mechanisms. Ongoing work aims at the validation of bioinformatics predictions of micro-RNA targets.

We revise WT theory using a generalisation of the random phase approximation (RPA). This generalisation takes into account that not only the phases but also the amplitudes of the wave Fourier modes are random quantities and it is called the``Random Phase and Amplitude''approach. This approach allows to systematically derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum from the the Peierls-Brout-Prigogine (PBP) equation for the multi-mode probability density function (PDF). The PBP equation was originally derived for the three-wave systems and in the present paper we derive a similar equation for the four-wave case. Equation for the multi-mode PDF will be used to validate the statistical assumptions about the phase and the amplitude randomness used for WT closures. Further. the multi-mode PDF contains a detailed statistical information. beyond spectra. and it finally allows to study non-Gaussianity and intermittency in WT. as it will be described in the present paper.

Hybridization between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno region of the16S rRNA (CCUCCU) directs the ribosome to the start AUG of the mRNA for translation. Shine-Dalgarno-like motifs (AGGAGG in E. coli) are depleted from open reading frames of most prokaryotes. This may be because hybridization of the 16S rRNA at Shine-Dalgarnos inside genes would slow translation or induce internal initiation. However. we analyzed 128 species from diverse phyla where the 16S rRNA gene(s) lack the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence. and so the 16S rRNA is incapable of interacting with Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences. Despite this lack of an anti-Shine-Dalgarno. half of these species still displayed depletion of Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences when analyzed by previous methods. Depletion of the same G-rich sequences was seen by these methods even in eukaryotes. which do not use the Shine-Dalgarno mechanism. We suggest previous methods are partly detecting a non-specific depletion of G-rich sequences. Alternative informatics approaches show that most prokaryotes have only slight. if any. specific depletion of Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences from open reading frames. Together with recent evidence that ribosomes do not pause at ORF-internal Shine-Dalgarno motifs. these results suggest the presence of ORF-internal Shine-Dalgarno-like motifs may be inconsequential. perhaps because internal regions of prokaryotic mRNAs may be structurally “shielded” from translation initiation.,True,CRjh5gUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202768,15320892261811830540,/scholar?cites=15320892261811830540,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202768,0,0,0

1057583,Optimal codon pair bias design,2017,Nolan Donoghue and Justin Gardin and Bruce Futcher and Steven Skiena,,,,529-532,IEEE,Codon pair bias is the species-specific phenomenon that pairs of adjacent codons appear in genomes with frequencies different than would be predicted under an independence assumption. and thus is indicative of evolutionary selection. The synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) paradigm to design vaccines creates weak viruses by designing coding sequences that favor underrepresented codon pairs. Designing genes which achieve the absolute minimum codon pair bias with an arbitrary codon distribution is computationally difficult. In this paper. we develop new algorithms for constructing provably optimal codon pair designs under coding constraints of up to 186 codons in under one minute. We explore a variety of search mechanisms. lower bounds. and pruning strategies to optimize sequences.

1057584,The effect of Codon and Codon Pair Biases on Translation Speed and mRNA Stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,2016,Justin Gardin,,,,,,The genetic code uses 61 codons to store information for protein construction. Each protein is constructed using 20 amino acid building blocks. with the protein blueprint stored in each organism's DNA sequence. The lack of one-to-one correspondence between codons and amino acids causes redundancy. resulting in more than one codon being used for the same amino acid. termed synonymous codons. Bias in synonymous codon usage is well reported and investigated in the literature. In general. protein information stored in DNA by rare codons result in fewer protein molecules per gene copy when compared to similar or identical protein information encoded by abundant codons. I report the first measurement of codon level translation speed in vivo and show that translation speed for rare codons is slower as compared to the translation speed of abundant codons.,True,CRjh5gUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://search.proquest.com/openview/858f5b83af180b5375a25c1455d7aa74/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,,,,,0,0,0

Aphids commonly harbour the facultative bacterial endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa. which is known to increase their resistance to parasitoids. It is unknown how this resistance develops during the aphids’ ontogeny. following the transmission bottleneck between mother and offspring. and how specific symbiont‐conferred defences are.2. We addressed these issues in the black bean aphid. Aphis fabae. by exposing aphids of different age classes to the parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum. The susceptibility of aphids that were either naturally or experimentally infected with H. defensa was compared with that of uninfected aphids.3. Susceptibility to parasitoids decreased with aphid age. but aphids harbouring H. defensa …,True,HtjWWkwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,107,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01904.x,5130073324401334534,/scholar?cites=5130073324401334534,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01904.x,0,0,0

Even though pig farming is regarded as the main source of human infection or colonization with MRSA CC398. 10-15% of the human cases appear not to be linked to pigs. Following the recent reports of MRSA CC398 in horses in other European countries and the lack of knowledge on S. aureus carriage in this animal species. we carried out a study to investigate whether horses constitute a reservoir of MRSA CC398 in Denmark. and to gain knowledge on the frequency and genetic diversity of S. aureus in horses. including both methicillin-resistant and -susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Nasal swabs were collected from 401 horses originating from 74 farms. either at their farms or prior to admission to veterinary clinics.

In the current study. whole-genome sequences from 88 S. aureus isolates were subjected to bioinformatics analyses in relation to sequence types. antimicrobial resistance. and virulence profiles. Thirteen clone complex types were determined in these food products with the most commonly detected clonal lineages being clonal complex CC5 and CC398.

We discovered in male FVB/N mice that mild (~50%) transgenic overexpression of Mecp2 enhances aggression. Surprisingly. when the same transgene was expressed in C57BL/6N mice. transgenics showed reduced aggression and social interaction. This suggests that Mecp2 modulates aggressive social behavior. To test this hypothesis in humans. we performed a phenotype‐based genetic association study (PGAS) in >1000 schizophrenic individuals. We found MECP2 SNPs rs2239464 (G/A) and rs2734647 (C/T; 3′UTR) associated with aggression. with the G and C carriers. respectively. being more aggressive. This finding was replicated in an independent schizophrenia cohort.

RTT is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. which affects primarily girls during early childhood and it is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females. R270X is one of the most frequent recurrent MECP2 mutations among RTT cohorts. The R270X mutation resides within the TRD-NLS (Transcription Repression Domain-Nuclear Localization Signal) region of MeCP2 and causes a more severe clinical phenotype with increased mortality as compared to other mutations. To evaluate the functional role of the R270X mutation. we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing MeCP2270_EGFP (human mutation equivalent) by BAC recombineering.

1057601,Oligomerization of ZFYVE27 (Protrudin) is necessary to promote neurite extension,2011,DV Krishna Pantakani and Marta M Czyzewska and Anna Sikorska and Chiranjeevi Bodda and Ashraf U Mannan,6,PLoS One,12,e29584,Public Library of Science,ZFYVE27 (Protrudin) was originally identified as an interacting partner of spastin. which is most frequently mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia. ZFYVE27 is a novel member of FYVE family. which is implicated in the formation of neurite extensions by promoting directional membrane trafficking in neurons. Now. through a yeast two-hybrid screen. we have identified that ZFYVE27 interacts with itself and the core interaction region resides within the third hydrophobic region (HR3) of the protein. We confirmed the ZFYVE27's self-interaction in the mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies. To decipher the oligomeric nature of ZFYVE27. we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation and showed that ZFYVE27 oligomerizes into dimer/tetramer forms. Sub-cellular fractionation and Triton X-114 membrane phase separation analysis indicated that ZFYVE27 is a peripheral membrane protein. Furthermore. ZFYVE27 also binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate lipid moiety. Interestingly. cells expressing ZFYVE27ΔHR3 failed to produce protrusions instead caused swelling of cell soma. When ZFYVE27ΔHR3 was co-expressed with wild-type ZFYVE27 (ZFYVE27WT). it exerted a dominant negative effect on ZFYVE27WT as the cells co-expressing both proteins were also unable to induce protrusions and showed cytoplasmic swelling. Altogether. it is evident that a functionally active form of oligomer is crucial for ZFYVE27 ability to promote neurite extensions.,True,7HPduEYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029584,3127661376408089361,/scholar?cites=3127661376408089361,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029584,0,0,0

Here. we have compared Ifnb induction in mixed murine brain cell cultures by a panel of HSV1 mutants. each devoid of one mechanism to counteract the IFN-stimulating cGAS–STING pathway. We found that a mutant lacking the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of the VP1-2 protein induced particularly strong expression of Ifnb and IFN-stimulated genes. HSV1 ΔDUB also induced elevated IFN expression in murine and human microglia and exhibited reduced viral replication in the brain. This was associated with increased ubiquitination of STING and elevated phosphorylation of STING. TBK1. and IRF3. VP1-2 associated directly with STING. leading to its deubiquitination.

Inc.. publishers,Incoming viruses challenge the cell with diverse foreign molecules. which need to be sensed quickly to initiate immune responses and to remove the viral components. In this study. we investigate the cellular requirements for sensing and degradation of incoming viral DNA and capsids during herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections. Using click chemistry labeling of the viral genome. we found that HSV-1 DNA was released from a subset of capsids into the cytosol early in infection. By next-generation sequencing of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-bound DNA from HSV-1-infected cells. we show that HSV-1 DNA was bound by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS. Activation of cGAS enzymatic activity by viral DNA did not require proteasomal activity. indicating that viral DNA release into the cytosol is not proteasome-dependent.

STING resides on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffics following stimulation to the ERGIC/Golgi. where signaling occurs. Although STING ER exit is the rate-limiting step in STING signaling. the mechanism that drives this process is not understood. Here we identify STEEP as a positive regulator of STING signaling. STEEP was associated with STING and promoted trafficking from the ER. This was mediated through stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns (3) P) production and ER membrane curvature formation. thus inducing COPII-mediated ER-to-Golgi trafficking of STING. Depletion of STEEP impaired STING-driven gene expression in response to virus infection in brain tissue and in cells from patients with STING-associated diseases. Interestingly.
