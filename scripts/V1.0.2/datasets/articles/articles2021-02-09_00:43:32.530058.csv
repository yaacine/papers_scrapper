Literally. autophagy means ‘self-eating’. but before you start thinking ‘cannibalism’it refers to consumption at a subcellular level. In a very general sense. it is a process by which cytoplasm is delivered to the degradative organelle—the lysosome or its yeast equivalent. the vacuole—and degraded.

Autophagy has intracellular anti‐viral and anti‐bacterial functions. and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system responses to viral and bacterial infections. Some viruses encode virulence factors for blocking autophagy. whereas others utilize some autophagy components for their intracellular growth or cellular budding. The “core” autophagy‐related (Atg) complexes in mammals are ULK1 protein kinase. Atg9‐WIPI‐1 and Vps34‐beclin1 class III PI3‐kinase complexes. and the Atg12 and LC3 conjugation systems. In addition.

The formation of autophagosomes involves a dynamic rearrangement of the membrane for which two ubiquitin-like modifications (the conjugation of Apg12p and the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form) are essential. In yeast. Apg10p is an E2-like enzyme essential for Apg12p conjugation. The isolated mouse APG10 gene product interacts with mammalian Apg12p dependent on mammalian Apg7p (E1-like enzyme). and facilitates Apg12p conjugation. The interaction of Apg10p with Apg12p is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p.

EGFP or mWasabi) fused with another tag that emits red fluorescence (e.g. mCherry or TagRFP) were used for monitoring the maturation step of mammalian autophagosomes. A critical point for this tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 was the sensitivity of green fluorescence at an acidic pH. EGFP and mWasabi continue to emit a weak. but significant. fluorescence at a pH of approximately 6. To overcome this issue. we focused on super-ecliptic pHluorin. which is a more pH-sensitive GFP variation. The green fluorescence of EGFP and mWasabi in the cells was still observed at weakly acidic levels (pH 6.0–6.5). In contrast. the fluorescence of pHluorin was more significantly quenched at pH 6.5. and was almost completely abolished at pH 5.5–6.0. indicating that pHluorin is more suitable for use in a tandem fluorescent protein-tag for monitoring autophagy. A pHluorin-mKate2 tandem fluorescence protein showed pH-sensitive green fluorescence and pH-resistant far-red fluorescence. We therefore generated expression plasmids for pHluorin-mKate2-tagged human LC3 (PK-hLC3). which could be used as a modifier for LC3-lipidation. The green and far-red fluorescent puncta of PK-hLC3 were increased under starvation conditions.

CAA0225 inhibited rat liver cathepsin L with IC50 values of 1.9 nM. but not rat liver cathepsin B (IC50. 1000—5000 nM). To assess the contribution of cathepsin L to lysosomal proteolysis. we evaluated autophagy. which is the process of lysosomal self-degradation of cell constituents. In HeLa and Huh-7 cells cultured under nutrient-deprived conditions CAA0225 significantly inhibited degradation of long-lived proteins; however. the magnitude of inhibition was comparable to that in the presence of CA-074-OMe. which is a cathepsin B-specific inhibitor. Thus the contributions of cathepsin L and cathepsin B to autophagic protein degradation of cytoplasmic proteins are nearly equal.

One established cell clone. named OKH-4. had the OCLN gene truncated in the N-terminal region. and a complete defect of the OCLN protein was shown using immunoblot analysis. Infection of OKH-4 cells with various genotypes of HCV was abolished. and exogenous expression of the OCLN protein in OKH-4 cells completely reversed permissiveness to HCV infection. In addition. using a co-culture system of HCV-infected Huh7. 5.1-8 cells with OKH-4 cells. we showed that OCLN is also critical for cell-to-cell HCV transmission. Thus. we concluded that OCLN is essential for HCV infection of human hepatic cells. Further experiments using HCV genomic RNA-transfected OKH-4 cells or HCV subgenomic replicon-harboring OKH-4 cells suggested that OCLN is mainly involved in the entry step of the HCV life cycle.

Double-immunofluorescent staining and density step-gradient analyses showed that the KIF5B motor protein co-localized with insulin vesicles in Prip-knockdown MIN6 cells. Knockdown of GABAA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). a microtubule-associated PRIP-binding partner. by Gabarap silencing in MIN6 cells reduced the co-localization of insulin vesicles with KIF5B and the movement of vesicles. resulting in decreased insulin secretion.

92387,Phospholipase C-related catalytically inactive protein participates in the autophagic elimination of Staphylococcus aureus infecting mouse embryonic fibroblasts,2014,Kae Harada-Hada and Kana Harada and Fuminori Kato and Junzo Hisatsune and Isei Tanida and Michinaga Ogawa and Satoshi Asano and Motoyuki Sugai and Masato Hirata and Takashi Kanematsu,9,PloS one,5,e98285,Public Library of Science,Autophagy is an intrinsic host defense system that recognizes and eliminates invading bacterial pathogens. We have identified microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). a hallmark of autophagy. as a binding partner of phospholipase C-related catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) that was originally identified as an inositol trisphosphate-binding protein. Here. we investigated the involvement of PRIP in the autophagic elimination of Staphylococcus aureus in infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We observed significantly more LC3-positive autophagosome-like vacuoles enclosing an increased number of S. aureus cells in PRIP-deficient MEFs than control MEFs. 3 h and 4.5 h post infection. suggesting that S. aureus proliferates in LC3-positive autophagosome-like vacuoles in PRIP-deficient MEFs. We performed autophagic flux analysis using an mRFP-GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid and found that autophagosome maturation is significantly inhibited in PRIP-deficient MEFs. Furthermore. acidification of autophagosomes was significantly inhibited in PRIP-deficient MEFs compared to the wild-type MEFs. as determined by LysoTracker staining and time-lapse image analysis performed using mRFP-GFP-tagged LC3. Taken together. our data show that PRIP is required for the fusion of S. aureus-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles with lysosomes. indicating that PRIP is a novel modulator in the regulation of the innate immune system in non-professional phagocytic host cells.,True,C9H0DzcAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098285,4029344008123818973,/scholar?cites=4029344008123818973,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098285,0,0,0

The monomeric GFP mNeonGreen is about 3- to 5-times brighter than GFP and monomeric enhanced GFP and shows high photostability. The maturation half-time of mNeonGreen is about 3-fold faster than that of monomeric enhanced GFP. However. the cDNA sequence encoding mNeonGreen contains some codons that are rarely used in Homo sapiens. For better expression of mNeonGreen in human cells. we synthesized a human-optimized cDNA encoding mNeonGreen and generated an expression plasmid for humanized mNeonGreen under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resultant plasmid was introduced into HEK293 cells. The fluorescent intensity of humanized mNeonGreen was about 1.4-fold higher than that of the original mNeonGreen. The humanized mNeonGreen with a mitochondria-targeting signal showed mitochondrial distribution of mNeonGreen. We further generated an expression vector of humanized mNeonGreen with 3xFLAG tags at its carboxyl terminus as these tags are useful for immunological analyses. The 3xFLAG-tagged mNeonGreen was recognized well with an anti-FLAG-M2 antibody. These plasmids for the expression of humanized mNeonGreen and mNeonGreen-3xFLAG are useful tools for biological studies in mammalian cells using mNeonGreen.,True,C9H0DzcAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC,6,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191108,12108607356156205083,/scholar?cites=12108607356156205083,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191108,0,0,0

In the present report. we identified another coffee-related compound. tannic acid (TA). which also inhibits HCV infection. We systematically evaluated which steps of the viral lifecycle were affected by CA and TA. TA substantially inhibits HCV RNA replication and egression. while CA does not. The infectivity of the HCV pretreated with CA or TA was almost lost. Cellular attachment of HCV particles and their interaction with apolipoprotein E. which is essential for HCV infectivity. were significantly reduced by CA. These results indicate that CA inhibits HCV entry via its direct effect on viral particles and TA inhibits HCV RNA replication and particle egression as well as entry into host cells.

92395,Use of pHlurorin-mKate2-human LC3 to monitor autophagic responses,2017,I Tanida and T Ueno and Y Uchiyama,587,,,87-96,Academic Press,In this chapter. we introduce the usage of pHluorin-mKate2-human LC3 for monitoring autophagy. Using EGFP and RFP. tandem fluorescent protein-tagged LC3 has been generated for monitoring autophagic structures. A critical point for this purpose is the sensitivity of the green fluorescent protein to acidic pH. A super-ecliptic pHluorin is most sensitive to acidic pH among EGFP. mWasabi. and pHluorin. indicating pHluorin is most suitable for monitoring autophagic structures. During autophagy. green-positive and red-positive fluorescent puncta of pHluorin-mKate2-human LC3 indicate signals of preautophagosomes and autophagosomes. After fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. green fluorescence of this intraautophagosomal protein is abolished according to acidification of autolysosomes.

In the kidney. cathepsin D is enriched in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. and its levels increase during acute kidney injury. To investigate how cathepsin D-deficiency impacts renal proximal tubular cells. we employed a conditional knockout CtsD flox/−; Spink3 Cre mouse. Immunohistochemical analyses using anti-cathepsin D antibody revealed that cathepsin D was significantly decreased in tubular epithelial cells of the cortico-medullary region. mainly in renal proximal tubular cells of this mouse. Cathepsin D-deficient renal proximal tubular cells showed an increase of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3; a marker for autophagosome/autolysosome)-signals and an accumulation of abnormal autophagic structures.

92403,Autophagy deficiency in renal proximal tubular cells leads to an increase in cellular injury and apoptosis under normal fed conditions,2020,Chigure Suzuki and Isei Tanida and Juan Alejandro Oliva Trejo and Soichiro Kakuta and Yasuo Uchiyama,21,International journal of molecular sciences,1,155,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells are significantly damaged during acute kidney injury. Renal proximal tubular cell-specific autophagy-deficient mice show increased sensitivity against renal injury. while showing few pathological defects under normal fed conditions. Considering that autophagy protects the proximal tubular cells from acute renal injury. it is reasonable to assume that autophagy contributes to the maintenance of renal tubular cells under normal fed conditions. To clarify this possibility. we generated a knock out mouse model which lacks Atg7. a key autophagosome forming enzyme. in renal proximal tubular cells (Atg7 flox/flox; KAP-Cre+). Analysis of renal tissue from two months old Atg7 flox/flox; KAP-Cre+ mouse revealed an accumulation of LC3. binding protein p62/sequestosome 1 (a selective substrate for autophagy). and more interestingly. Kim-1. a biomarker for early kidney injury. in the renal proximal tubular cells under normal fed conditions. TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling)-positive cells were also detected in the autophagy-deficient renal tubular cells. Analysis of renal tissue from Atg7 flox/flox; KAP-Cre+ mice at different age points showed that tubular cells positive for p62 and Kim-1 continually increase in number in an age-dependent manner. Ultrastructural analysis of tubular cells from Atg7 flox/flox; KAP-Cre+ revealed the presence of intracellular inclusions and abnormal structures.

Among several methods for evaluating its activity. a fluorescent reporter GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3ΔG. in which GFP-LC3 is cleaved by ATG4 following autophagic induction and degraded in lysosome. has been used for monitoring autophagic flux. which is the amount of lysosomal protein degradation. In this study. we modified this reporter by exchanging GFP for pHluorin. which is more sensitive to low pH. and RFP to mCherry. to construct pHluorin-LC3-mCherry reporter. Following starvation or mTOR inhibition. the increase of autophagic flux was detected by a decrease of the fluorescent ratio of pHluorin to mCherry; our reporter was also more sensitive to autophagy-inducing stimuli than the previous one.

In addition. aberrant autophagy is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. cardiomyopathy. tumorigenesis. diabetes. fatty liver. Crohn’s disease. and more (Mizushima and Komatsu. 2011; Tanida. 2011). When autophagy is induced. PI (3) P-rich structures called omegasomes are formed (see Figure 2.1)(Axe et al.. 2008). After omegasome formation. the cup-shaped double-membraned isolation membranes known as preautophagosomes or phoagophores are initiated. The isolation membranes elongate to engulf cytosolic components. and finally enclose to form autophagosomes. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Intra-autophagsomal contents are digested by lysosomal hydrolases. A series of autophagic events occurs within ten minutes in the liver.For monitoring autophagy. several markers are characterized and employed. DFCP1 is a marker for omegasomes during autophagy. though it localized to the endoplasmic reticulum under nutrient-rich conditions (Axe et al.. 2008).

We have shown that deficiency of autophagy in pancreatic β cells leads to their failure and deterioration of glucose tolerance.

Recently. application of a novel autophagy flux. GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3ΔG. is reported. which enables us to evaluate autophagy flux by calculating ratio between the fluorescence of GFP and RFP. as GFP-LC3 is degraded specifically in autolysosomes. whereas RFP-LC3ΔG remains intact in cytosol as an internal control.

92414,A PRNP-Disrupted Human Neuroblastoma Cell Line and Its Stable Transformants Expressing Prion Protein Variants,2019,Yuko Okemoto-Nakamura and Isei Tanida and Toshiyuki Yamaji and Kentaro Hanada and Ken’ichi Hagiwara,2,BPB Reports,5,73-79,The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,A key event in prion diseases is the conformational conversion of a cellular normal form of the prion protein (PrP C) to disease-associated conformers (PrP Sc). Polymorphisms or mutations in the human prion protein gene (PRNP) are associated with acquired or hereditary human prion diseases. When human prion protein (PrP) variants are characterized by cDNA expression systems in cultured cells. the endogenous prion protein may affect the behavior of ectopically expressed prion variants. To eliminate this issue. we herein created a PRNP-disrupted mutant cell line from human neuroblastoma BE (2)-M17 cells. No morphological differences were observed between PRNP-null and parental cells. We stably introduced cDNAs encoding E196K-PrP and E200K-PrP (both of which are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)-related mutants). a non-pathogenic E219K-PrP. and wild-type control PrP into PRNP-null mutant cells using the PiggyBac system. and found that the glycosylation pattern of E196K-PrP differed from that of other PrPs. We also found that non-glycosylated PrPs for E196K-and E200K-PrPs had distinct electrophoretic mobilities from that of WT-PrP. and E219K-PrPs exhibited slightly different mobilities in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under endogenous PrP-null conditions. demonstrating that the PRNP-disrupted human neuroblastoma cell line serves as a useful tool for examining PrPs with mutations or polymorphisms.,True,C9H0DzcAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpbreports/2/5/2_73/_article/-char/ja/,,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpbreports/2/5/2_73/_pdf,0,0,0

The formation of autophagosomes involves a dynamic rearrangement of the membrane for which two ubiquitin-like modifications (the conjugation of Apg12p and the modification of a soluble form of MAP-LC3 to a membrane-bound form) are essential. In yeast. Apg10p is an E2-like enzyme essential for Apg12p conjugation. The isolated mouse APG10 gene product interacts with mammalian Apg12p dependent on mammalian Apg7p (E1-like enzyme). and facilitates Apg12p conjugation. The interaction of Apg10p with Apg12p is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p. Mutational analysis of the predicted active site cysteine (Cys161) within mouse Apg10p shows that mutant Apg10pC161S. which can form a stable intermediate with Apg12p. inhibits Apg12p conjugation even in the presence of Apg7p …,True,C9H0DzcAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2167657469094371409&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Similar to the ubiquitin-conjugating system. both Apg12p and Apg8p are activated by Apg7p. an E1-like enzyme. Apg12p is then transferred to Apg10p. an E2-like enzyme. and conjugated with Apg5p. whereas Apg8p is transferred to Apg3p. another E2-like enzyme. followed by conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine. Evidence is presented here that Apg7p forms a homodimer with two active-site cysteine residues via the C-terminal region. The dimerization of Apg7p is independent of the other Apg proteins and facilitated by overexpressed Apg12p.

High-resolution restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified ras sequences revealed the presence of both H-ras and K-ras oncogenes in normal mammary glands 2 weeks after carcinogen treatment and at least 2 months before the onset of neoplasia. These ras oncogenes can remain latent within the mammary gland until exposure to estrogens. demonstrating that …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:5kvG9DmRKWYC,324,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/248/4959/1101.abstract,1540586736993574226,/scholar?cites=1540586736993574226,,,0,0,0

Nanotechnology. nano particles and quantum dots (QD) have emerged as pivotal tool for detection of a particular biological marker with extreme accuracy. The possibilities in future as well as some success that have been achieved so far are discussed in this review. Diagnosis of a disease in its very early stage can play important role in treatment. Due to phenomenal advancement in nanotechnology. QDs have emerged as pivotal tool for detection of a particular biological marker with extreme accuracy. QDS being very photo-stable and optically sensitive can be used as labeling and can be easily traced with ordinary equipment. Early detection of tumor markers using quantum dots is proved to be boon for cancer diagnosis. Use of QDs has also helped in unlocking complex neurological phenomenon. such as molecular activities at synapse during neurotransmission. QDs also give important information about receptor movement if tagged with suitable antibodies.

Despite persistent doubts. governments. international agencies. NGOs. and private companies are pressing ahead to set up more such projects. This paper studies the financial sustainability of India's largest rural ICT initiative known as eChoupal. The eChoupals are distinct from other telecenter projects in that the value added is not in providing ICT infrastructure alone. but rather. in enabling efficiencies in the agricultural sector through greater information exchange and creation of an alternative market structure. An analysis of available data indicates that this project has a potential payback period of 3.9 years. Although several assumptions have been used in these calculations. a sensitivity analysis has been performed to provide a range of possible scenarios that show the profitability of the project. Through this analysis it seems that ICT projects can be financially sustainable when they are viewed not as an end in themselves but as tools to facilitate information exchange whereby. use of the technology enables higher efficiencies in another existing or new business setting. which provides the source of revenue to recover the initial investment.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C,172,https://itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/view/192/0.html,838735048932687553,/scholar?cites=838735048932687553,,https://itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/download/192/192-528-2-PB.pdf,0,0,0

To maintain a stable population. parents must live long enough to sustain the serial production of a sufficient number of young to replace themselves while allowing for the death of offspring before they can reproduce. However. in many species there is a large differential between the sexes in the care provided to offspring. Therefore. we hypothesize that in slowly developing species with single births. the sex that bears the greater burden in the care of offspring will tend to survive longer. Males are incapable of gestating infants and lactating. but in several species fathers carry their offspring for long periods.

We reviewed the literature to date regarding available therapies for depigmenting the normal skin in vitiligo universalis. Our review revealed that the threshold regarding what percentage of body surface area qualifies as depigmentation is variable among practitioners. Monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone (MBEH) is the most widely used depigmenting agent and has few side‐effects. Tretinoin in combination with MBEH is able to speed depigmentation of the skin. Monomethylether of hydroquinone has also been used successfully for depigmentation. Eighty‐eight per cent phenol is also effective in depigmenting the skin but its application on large areas is toxic for liver and kidney.

92512,Auditory processing in individuals with auditory neuropathy,2005,Ajith U Kumar and M Jayaram,1,Behavioral and Brain Functions,1,1-8,BioMed Central,Auditory neuropathy is a disorder characterized by no or severely impaired auditory brainstem responses in presence of normal otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonics. Speech perception abilities in these individuals are disproportionate to their hearing sensitivity and reported to be dependent on cortical evoked potentials and temporal processing abilities. The disproportionate loss of auditory percept in presence of normal cochlear function is suggestive of impairment of auditory neural synchrony.

The study intends to evaluate the degree of anthropogenic influence on heavy metal concentration in the sediments of the mangrove and adjacent estuarine stations using enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index. The inverse relationship of Cd and Zn with texture in the mangrove sediments suggested the anthropogenic enrichment of these metals in the mangrove systems. In the estuarine sediments. the absence of any significant correlation of the heavy metals with other sedimentary parameters and their strong interdependence revealed the possibility that the input is not through the natural weathering processes. The analysis of enrichment factor indicated a minor enrichment for Pb and Zn in mangrove sediments.

In fixed spectrum assignments there are many frequencies that are not being properly used. So cognitive radio helps us to use these unused frequency bands which are also called as “White Spaces”. This is a unique approach to improve utilization of radio electromagnetic spectrum. In establishing the cognitive radio there are 4 important methods. In this paper we are going to discuss about the first and most important method to implement cognitive radio ie.“spectrum sensing”. The challenges. issues and techniques that are involved in spectrum sensing will discussed in detail.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC,37,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17332430163502727715&hl=en&oi=scholarr,17332430163502727715,/scholar?cites=17332430163502727715,,,0,0,0

In an economic production quantity (EPQ) model. lead-time plays a significant role in ensuring that the manufacturing process starts on time. As we know. when both lead-time and demand rate are deterministic and constant. then demand during the lead-time is constant. and is referred to as zero lead-time. Moreover. when either or both of them are random variables. then lead-time demand (LTD) is a random variable.

Such small molecules are of considerable interest in chemistry. biology and medicine. Most of the anticancer drugs employed clinically exert their antitumor effect by inhibiting nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) or protein synthesis. Inhibition can occur for example through cross-linking of bases in DNA or binding to and inactivation of enzymes necessary for the synthetic processes. It is evident that DNA is an important cellular target for many anticancer agents. Much information has been obtained from molecular genetics. i.e. replication of DNA and its transcription to RNA. which provides the template for protein synthesis.

Economically. tea is an important plantation crop which earns considerable foreign exchange for our nation (India). Tea has gained popularity due to its palatability and comparatively low cost. Thus it is widely consumed next to water.“the Adams wine” by people of all ages. Tea is a perennial leafy crop planted over 5. 79.190 ha in India (Menon. 2010). Tea. Camellia sinensis. is indigenous to Asia. Its origin is considered to be the area around the Irrawaddy River. extending from south east China to Assam in north east India (Eden. 1958). The discovery of tea dates back to Chinese emperor Shen Nung in 2737 BC. an ancient Chinese legend. At that time. tea was used as a herbal medicine and has since evolved into a beverage for daily usage (Ahmad and Mukhtar. 1999).Tea is a heterogeneous plant with many overlapping morphological. biochemical and physiological attributes due to its free natural hybridization (Banerjee. 1988). Tea belongs to the family Camelliaceae (syn. Theaceae) and is a member of the genus Camellia. which consists of 82 species inclusive of ornamental Camellia’s (Ellis. 1995). Cultivated tea is classified into three distinct varieties. viz.. C. sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze (“China” type). C. assamica ssp. assamica (Masters) Wight (“Assam” jat) and the “Cambod” variety.

Since the radius of a drilled hole is the sum of the tool radius and radial overcut. one crucial aspect of dimensional accuracy is radial overcut. However. models of overcut in the literature are scarce and have primarily been restricted to shallow holes. Moreover these models were purely empirical and therefore restricted in scope. A fundamental mathematical model that uses STEM operating parameters (voltage. tool diameter and feed rate. bare tip length and electrolyte composition) as inputs to predict radial overcut has been developed. Predictions from the proposed radial overcut model are much closer to experimental data compared to those from the models available in the literature.

The development of a tilting disc prosthesis was successfully concluded in February 1995. when the third model completed its clinical trial. The tilting disc valve has an integrally machined cobalt alloy cage. an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene disc and a polyester suture ring. The choice of design was based on its superior hydrodynamics and the age distribution of patients. the majority of whom were below 30 years. The polymer-metal combination was selected for its extremely low wear rate and proven durability in the human body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hydrodynamic performance was tested under steady and pulsatile flow conditions. The accelerated durability of nine test valves was evaluated at 800-840 cycles/min for over 350 million cycles each. Size 23 mm valves mere implanted in the mitral position of five sheep. In a clinical trial. 306 patients with isolated mitral or aortic valve replacements were followed up for a total of 371 patient years (mean 1.37 years and range 0-4 years). RESULTS: The hydrodynamic performance was comparable to that of proven clinical models. The accelerated testing indicated lifetimes in excess of 50 years and the animal trials showed the valve to be safe.

This can have deleterious effects on skin such as darkening. skin damage. and aging. Plant-derived products having skin-protective effects are well-known traditionally. Triphala. a formulation of three fruit products. is one of the most important rasayana drugs used in Ayurveda. Several skin care products based on Triphala are available that claim its protective effects on facial skin. However. the skin protective effects of Triphala extract (TE) and its mechanistic action on skin cells have not been elucidated in vitro. Gallic acid. ellagic acid. and chebulinic acid were deduced by LC-MS as the major constituents of TE. The identified key compounds were docked with skin-related proteins to predict their binding affinity. The IC50 values for TE on human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT) were 204.90 ± 7.6 and 239.13 ± 4.3 μg/mL respectively. The antioxidant capacity of TE was 481.33 ± 1.5 mM Trolox equivalents in HaCaT cells. Triphala extract inhibited hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced RBC haemolysis (IC50 64.95 μg/mL). nitric oxide production by 48.62 ± 2.2%. and showed high reducing power activity. TE also rescued HDF from H2O2-induced damage; inhibited H2O2 induced cellular senescence and protected HDF from DNA damage. TE increased collagen-I. involucrin and filaggrin synthesis by 70.72 ± 2.3%. 67.61 ± 2.1% and 51.91 ± 3.5% in HDF or HaCaT cells respectively.

Site-specific empirical models for blast-induced vibration parameters like peak particle velocity (PPV). peak pressure (PP). peak particle displacement (PPD). and pore pressure ratio (PPR) are commonly used for blast-resistant designs. However. these empirical models do not consider the variation in soil properties. e.g.. the degree of saturation and uncertain in situ conditions. Hence. in this paper. a total of 120 pieces of blast data from various soil sites have been collected and used to propose a generalized empirical model for estimating blast-induced vibration parameters by considering three basic soil properties. namely. unit weight. degree of saturation. and Young’s modulus.

MSD risk factors can be an appropriate base for planning and implementing ergonomics intervention programs in the workplace. The present study is focused on identifying the occupational health and safety risks of workers in Indian sawmills. The workers in saw mills are exposed to MSD risks. hard environmental conditions (high temperatures. slippery and uneven ground). heavy works (manual handling of loads. awkward postures.) and dangerous tools and machineries such as chainsaws. band saw. chippers. etc.. In this study we have considered different logger groups working in saw mills in Karnataka State and analyzed their MSD risk exposure. occupational health hazards and noise exposure. In a developing country like India. where labor is cheap and most of the workers are economic migrants. proper occupational health. hygiene and ergonomic factors are neglected. The workers accept the adverse working conditions as part of the job and mostly work in such work environments. NORDIC musculoskeletal questionnaire was used to analyze areas of pain and their occurrence in the past. Postural analysis using REBA. RULA indicates that the workers are working above the safe limit. The average REBA score observed was 7.5.

The analysis of DNA microarray images allows the identification of gene expressions to draw biological conclusions for applications ranging from genetic profiling to diagnosis of cancer. The DNA microarray image analysis includes three tasks: gridding. segmentation and intensity extraction. Clustering algorithms have been applied for segmenting the microarray image. Among these approaches. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) method is simple and efficient one. However. microarray image contains noise and the noise would affect the segmentation results. In this paper. we propose to combine the FCM method with Bidimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition for segmenting the microarray image in order to reduce the effect of noise. We call this method as Fuzzy C-means with Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode decomposition (FCMBEMD). We use an adaptive local weighted averaging filter in the BEMD method for removing the noise in the image and finally K-means algorithm is used for segmentation of image. Using the FCMBEMD method on microarray image. we obtain better results than those using FCM only.

92633,Consolidation of a poroelastic half-space with anisotropic permeability and compressible constituents by axisymmetric surface loading,2009,Sarva Jit Singh and Raman Kumar and Sunita Rani,118,Journal of Earth System Science,5,563,Springer-Verlag,The fully coupled Biot quasi-static theory of linear poroelasticity is used to study the consolidation of a poroelastic half-space caused by axisymmetric surface loads. The fluid and solid constituents of the poroelastic medium are compressible and its permeability in the vertical direction is different from its permeability in the horizontal direction. An analytical solution of the governing equations is obtained by taking the displacements and the pore pressure as the basic state variables and using a combination of the Laplace and Hankel transforms.

92634,Application of liquid/solid fluidization technique in beneficiation of fines,2009,AK Mukherjee and BK Mishra and Ran Vijay Kumar,92,International Journal of Mineral Processing,1-2,67-73,Elsevier,Use of liquid/solid fluidization techniques for size classification is a common practice in mineral processing operations. Extending its application in gravity separation for finer feed particles (− 0.5 mm) is not straightforward as these fine size particles tend to remain in a mixed state during fluidization. In this paper an effort is made to explore the possibilities of adopting liquid/solid fluidization technique to beneficiate fine-size feed. The study shows that separation is effective within a limited range of size (ratio) with proper control on superficial water velocity. This study is relevant to beneficiation of low-grade ore which typically liberates at finer size where beneficiation has been a challenge.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:PV2Y7XyTJDgC,28,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751609000398,6375384244860177885,/scholar?cites=6375384244860177885,,,0,0,0

Two copies of the 72-bp repeat provided efficient activation of gene expression. Increasing the number of linked 72-bp units to four substantially improved the activation of gene expression. but further addition of enhancers diminished the activation of gene expression proportionally to the number of enhancers added.

92656,Dynamic mode decomposition analysis of detonation waves,2012,L Massa and R Kumar and P Ravindran,24,Physics of Fluids,6,066101,American Institute of Physics,Dynamic mode decomposition is applied to study the self-excited fluctuations supported by transversely unstable detonations. The focus of this study is on the stability of the limit cycle solutions and their response to forcing. Floquet analysis of the unforced conditions reveals that the least stable perturbations are almost subharmonic with ratio between global mode and fundamental frequency λi/ωf = 0.47. This suggests the emergence of period doubling modes as the route to chaos observed in larger systems. The response to forcing is analyzed in terms of the coherency of the four fundamental energy modes: acoustic. entropic. kinetic. and chemical. Results of the modal decomposition suggest that the self-excited oscillations are quite insensitive to vortical forcing. and maintain their coherency up to a forcing turbulent Mach number of 0.3.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC,25,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4727715,4730199055021773881,/scholar?cites=4730199055021773881,,,0,0,0

A similar approach is applied to achieve multi-level thresholding in both grayscale and color images. The paper discusses two methods of color image segmentation using RGB space as the standard processing space. The threshold for segmentation is decided by the maximization of conditional entropy in the two dimensional histogram of the color image separated into three grayscale images of R. G and B. The features are first developed independently for the three (R. G. B) spaces. and combined to get different color component segmentation. By considering local maxima instead of the maximum of conditional entropy yields multiple thresholds for the same image which forms the basis for multilevel thresholding.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:_09KEOFGu60C,25,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.3804&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8234051782637885035,/scholar?cites=8234051782637885035,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.3804&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Developing a computational model of face recognition is quit difficult. because faces are complex. multidimensional and meaningful visual stimuli. Different algorithms are developed to solve these challenges. The magic of matching suspects with the database faces does not works some times even though many face recognition algorithms are developed with high success rates. Face recognition software fails some time despite the fact that the suspects image were present in public and private record database.

It is the dominant means of transport aspired to throughout the world; indeed. many a politician throughout this century has furthered his or her career by promising constituents a greater economic ability to own an automobile. Furthermore. there are more automobiles on the road than any other motorized vehicle. As of 1986. almost half a billion vehicles were on the road throughout the world; over three-quarters of these were cars. With this comes the responsibility of making safety a primary concern in vehicle technologies. Technologies like Anti lock braking system and Vehicle stability Control System are being used to monitor vehicular safety. Similarly. a new type of speed control. called adaptive cruise control. is being used on some new model vehicles. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is an automotive feature that allows a vehicle's cruise control system to adapt the vehicle's speed to the traffic environment. It is basically an extension of conventional cruise control systems. These systems allow you to set a following distance. or time interval. between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead. as well as a maximum speed.

92719,Association between antioxidant enzymes and breast cancer,2011,B Prabasheela and Anuj Kumar Singh and Asra Fathima and Kumar Pragulbh and Nayan Jyoti Deka and Ranjan Kumar,3,Recent Research in Science and Technology,11,,,Breast caner is one of the most common malignant tumors in our country. Recently. patients suffering from it and dying of it are increased. Though breast cancer could be found early. some patients still died of metastasis and recurrence [1]. Alteration in the oxidant-antioxidant profile is known to occur in cancer [2]. Oxidative stress is due to a disturbance in the balance between the production of ROS and the efficiency of the antioxidant defense. In other words. oxidative stress results if excessive production of ROS overwhelms the antioxidant defense system or when there is a significant decrease or lack of antioxidant defense [3]. Experimental evidence revels that ROS (reactive oxygen species) are involved in initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis. where inactivation or loss of certain tumor suppressor genes is occurred [4]. Free radicals are formed in both physiological and pathological conditions in mammalian tissues. Free radicals are capable of altering all major classes of biomolecules. such as lipid. nucleic acid and protein. with changes in their structure and function [5]. Prime targets of free radicals are poly unsaturated fatty acid in cell membranes and their interaction results in lipid peroxidation.

92721,How does storage affect the quality and quantity of organic carbon in sewage for use in the bioremediation of acidic mine waters?,2011,R Naresh Kumar and Clint D McCullough and Mark A Lund,37,Ecological Engineering,8,1205-1213,Elsevier,Pit lakes (abandoned flooded mine pits) represent a potentially valuable water resource. However. acid mine drainage (AMD) generation due to mining activities often results in pit lake waters with low pH. high sulphate and dissolved metal concentrations. Sulphate reduction-based bioremediation offers tremendous scope for removal of acidity and metals from pit lake water. In this study. the effect of storing sewage on its carbon quality for bioremediation of acidic pit lake water was studied. In addition. the effectiveness of labile organic carbon (lactic acid and ethanol) on SRB activity was tested. Bioremediation experiments were performed in controlled and replicated microcosms with acidic (pH 2.2) water from a pit lake by addition of stored (3 years at 4 °C) sewage for stimulation of sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) activity. This sewage had been previously used successfully in remediating to pH 7 water from this pit …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:25zTQ8aaf3EC,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857411000863,11298595000606973681,/scholar?cites=11298595000606973681,,,0,0,0
92722,Bioeconomic appraisal of flowering annuals for seed production under poplar (Populus deltoides) based agroforestry system,2011,S Rani and SK Chauhan and R Kumar and KK Dhatt,,,,,Postgraduate Institute of Agriculture. University of Peradeniya: Peradeniya,To make the poplar (Populus deltoids) based agroforestry systems economically more profitable. twelve winter flower annuals under three environmental conditions (open. under 3 and 4 year old poplar canopy) with four replications in split-split plot design were evaluated. Results of the study revealed that yield and other parameters of flowering annuals were low in crops that were in association with poplar than in open environmental condition. Among the crops studied. Coreopsis tinctoria. Coreopsis lanceolata. Phlox drumondii and Gaillardia pulchelia showed better performance than the other crops in both conditions. The poplar growth parameters such as tree height. diameter at breast height. crown spread. crown height and tree volume/fresh weight showed better performance under agroforestry plantation than without inter-cultivation. Benefit-cost ratio of growing flowers for seed production ranged from 1.15 to 5.31 under three year old poplar canopy and 1.68 to 5.51 in open environment. The corresponding values were 1.12 to 5.17 and 1.40 to 5.37 for four year old poplar canopy and open environment. In comparison to traditionally grown wheat crop. flower annuals were found profitable under poplar canopy as well as in open environment.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:hL4nnw0dEwcC,20,http://thesis.pgia.ac.lk:8080/bitstream/1/2216/2/PGIATAR-22%282%29-125.pdf,12966675195430367003,/scholar?cites=12966675195430367003,,http://thesis.pgia.ac.lk:8080/bitstream/1/2216/2/PGIATAR-22%282%29-125.pdf,0,0,0

The method is based on the reaction of AFZ with gold (III) chloride in the pH range 1.0–5.0 forming red color complex solution. showing absorption maxima at 510 nm. The linear plot indicates that Beer’s law is obeyed in the range of 10–110 µg/ml of alfuzosin hydrochloride. The molar absorptivity and Sandell’s sensitivity are 5.62 x 103 l mol-1 cm-1 and 0.0758 µg/cm2 respectively. The standard deviation of the method for ten determinations of 20 µg/ml of alfuzosin hydrochloride is 0.0123. The correlation coefficient (γ) of the experimental data of the calibration plot is 0.9991. The effective range of concentration for accurate determination of alfuzosin hydrochloride as ascertained from Ringbom’s plot and it is 20–100 µg/ml.

In the present investigation. the fluence for proton irradiation was varied up to 2×1015 protons cm−2. while that for copper beam was kept in the range of 1×101 to 1×1013 ions cm−2 to study the swift heavy ion-induced modifications in LDPE. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis). FTIR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were utilized to study the induced changes. The analysis of UV–vis absorption studies reveals that there is decrease of optical energy gap up to 43% on proton irradiation (at 2×1015 ions cm−2). whereas the copper beam (at 1×1013 ions cm−2) leads to a decrease of 51%.

The stresses and the pore pressure are taken as the basic state variables. Displacements are obtained by integrating the coupled constitutive relations. The problem of surface loads is discussed in detail. Explicit analytical solutions are derived for normal line loading. shear line loading and normal strip loading. The permeability anisotropy is found to have a significant effect on the quasi-static deformation of the half-space. However. in the drained and undrained limits. the anisotropy has no effect. The stresses in the drained and undrained states are independent of the poroelastic parameters.

92784,Realized volatility and India VIX,2011,Ashok Banerjee and Ritesh Kumar and VK Unni,,,,,IIMC,While the market return of a stock is difficult to predict. there are well established models to predict return volatility. It has been observed in early sixties of the last century (Mandelbrot 1963) that stock market volatility exhibits clustering. where periods of large returns are followed by periods of small returns. Later popular models of volatility clustering were developed by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986). The autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARCH) models (Engle. 1982) and generalized ARCH (GARCH) models (Bollerslev. 1986) have been extensively used in capturing volatility clustering in financial time series (Bollerslev et al. 1992). Using data on developed market. several empirical studies (Akgiray. 1989; West et al. 1993) have confirmed the superiority of GARCH-type models in volatility predictions over models such as the naïve historical average. moving average and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). GARCH models can replicate the fat tails observed in many high frequency financial asset return series. where large changes occur more often than a normal distribution would imply. Financial markets also demonstrate that volatility is higher in a falling market than it is in a rising market. This asymmetry or leverage effect was first documented by Black (1976) and Christie (1982). Empirical results also show that augmenting GARCH models with information like market volume or number of trades may lead to modest improvement in forecasting volatility (Brooks. 1998; Jones et al. 1994).It is an empirical question to establish whether conditional volatility models better capture the underlying volatility of the asset return …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:i9B0nK2ie9AC,16,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.1032&rep=rep1&type=pdf,9706189930332031007,/scholar?cites=9706189930332031007,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.457.1032&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The MASTER [1] study remains. methodologically. the most robust study of epidural analgesia. albeit with all the limitations which have been mentioned. It gives an idea of the exceptionally poor level of evidence that has preceded it and that to a large extent has shaped modern epidural practice. We are quite comfortable with the concepts of powering a study. It is a statement of fact that the epidural group had a higher mortality rate than the control group. We did not say it was statistically significant. We acknowledge that this study was underpowered. but this raises a further issue. Being underpowered to demonstrate an effect of 10% only serves to confirm that epidural analgesia. if it can confer benefit. is realistically at the 2–3% level at best.

In this review. we describe various mechanisms by which metal ion leachates can interact with therapeutic proteins and antibodies. Site-specific modifications due to metal catalyzed oxidation (MCO) of the therapeutic proteins cause them to become destabilized and potentially increasingly aggregation prone.

So. direct utilization of solar energy into useful energy is important. There are so many solar thermal equipments in which concentrating type collector heated the fluid up to 100 to 4000C. It is employed for a variety of applications such as power generation. industrial steam generation and hot water production. Parabolic trough collector is preferred for steam generation because high temperatures can achieve. Cylindrical parabolic trough type collector consists of selective concentrator and a receiver tube. The selective cover system prevents the heat loss (convective and radiative) from the receiver tube and improves the performance of solar parabolic trough. Also evacuated chamber is created to reduce the loss of heat and reduce the corrosion of concentrator surface. Tracking system is embedded in the solar parabolic trough for tracking the sun energy movement.This report presents the evaluation of solar insolation in terms of monthly average hourly global radiation in Patna on 10th April. 2013. On the basis of this solar energy flux. comparative study of the instantaneous efficiency of solar parabolic trough is done.

Real time industrial processes are subjected to variation in parameters and parameter perturbations. which when significant makes the system unstable. Determination or tuning of the PID parameters continues to be important as these parameters have a great influence on the stability and performance of the control system. most of the processes are complex and nonlinear in nature resulting into their poor performance when controlled by traditional tuned PID controllers. The need for improved performance of the process has led to the development of optimal controllers. So the control engineers are on look for automatic tuning procedures.

The model has been used to study the deacylation of penicillin G to 6‐aminopenicillanic acid using two commercially available immobilised Penicillin acylases. The values of De/R2 for the enzyme pellets have been estimated using data on uptake of 6‐aminopenicillanic acid and phenylacetic acid by the enzyme pellets. The kinetic parameters of the model were individually estimated from a suitably designed set of experiments. The values of the Thiele modulus from the kinetic parameters so calculated have been found to be in the range 1·67 to 9·8 for the two enzymes studied. implying that diffusional effects cannot be ignored. The effect of such diffusional limitations on the overall rates and hence on the utilisation of the intrinsic kinetic ability of the enzyme has been demonstrated.

The key targets for these neutralizing antibodies are the viral envelope antigens gp120 and gp41. Although broadly reactive neutralizing epitopes on gp120 and gp41 have been mapped and studied extensively. these epitopes are poorly immunogenic. Indeed. various vaccine candidates tested in preclinical and clinical trials do not generate antibodies against these epitopes.

92882,System and method for performing non-linear constrained optimization with a genetic algorithm,2010,,,,,,,An augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm that may be used to generate solutions for optimization problems subject to linear. bound. and non-linear constraints is discussed. The augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm uses an adaptive mutation operator to separately handle the linear. and bound constraints. and uses an augmented Lagrangian framework to handle non-linear constraints. The non-linear constraints are handled by creating a sub-problem without the linear and bound constraints and solving the sub-problem using Lagrange parameter estimates and a penalty factor. The exclusion of the linear constraints and boundary constraints from the sub-problem allows the sub-problem to be resolved in a more effective manner than is possible using conventional techniques.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC,12,https://patents.google.com/patent/US7672910B1/en,10170183672935462413,/scholar?cites=10170183672935462413,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/2f/1d/f7/624d0812753cf0/US7672910.pdf,0,0,0

Smart polymeric materials respond with a considerable change in their properties to small changes in their environment. Environmental stimuli include salt. UV-irradiation. temperature. pH or concentration. chemicals. light. magnetic or electric field. ionic factors. biological molecules. solvent exchange etc. This behaviour can be utilised for the preparation of so-called ‘smart’drug delivery systems. which mimic biological response behaviour to a certain extent. These smart polymeric systems have several advantages over conventional methods. such as ease of manufacturing. ease of administration. biodegradability and the ability to alter release profiles of the incorporated agents. The possible environmental conditions to use for this purpose are limited due to the biomedical setting of drug delivery as application. Different organs. tissues and cellular compartments may have large differences in pH. which makes the pH a suitable stimulus.""

The system includes a device for producing a proton beam which travels along a pre selected path and strikes the target material in a target chamber. This target chamber is positioned in the path of the proton beam such that subjection of the target material to the beam produces nitrogen-13 atoms and alpha particles.

With its growing powers. the state has increasingly claimed prior proprietary rights over natural resources. It is generally proposed that traditional societies were able to resolve the issue of claims over natural resources and state intervention was minimal. Early writings have sought to establish a 'golden age' approach to Indian environmental history. The interventionist attitude of the state has been attributed to the British. The state tried to control and manage the natural resources not for conservation but to enhance revenue collection. However. it might be incorrect to attribute interventionism only to colonial and post-colonial administrations. Medieval states were also very eager to ensure continuous and regular appropriation of revenue and were thus actively involved with the management and appropriation of natural resources.

92915,Quantitative analysis of generations for inheritance of fruit yield in watermelon,2013,Rakesh Kumar and Todd C Wehner,48,HortScience,7,844-847,American Society for Horticultural Science,There is a large genetic diversity for fruit size and yield in watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai var. lanatus]. Current cultivars have high fruit quality but may not be the highest yielders. This study was designed to estimate variance components and heritability of fruit yield (Mg·ha−1). fruit count (th·ha−1). and fruit size (kg/fruit) in a cross involving high-yielding ‘Mountain Hoosier’ with low-yielding ‘Minilee’. Six generations (PaS1. PbS1. F1. F2. BC1Pa. and BC1Pb) were developed and tested in Summer 2008 at two locations in North Carolina. Discrete classes were not observed within the F2 segregating population. The actual distribution of the F2 population for fruit yield. fruit count. and fruit size deviated from the normal distribution. ‘Mountain Hoosier’ had higher parental and backcross variance than ‘Minilee’. High F2 variance for fruit yield indicated large phenotypic variance. There was a larger environmental variance than genetic variance associated with the yield traits. Estimates of broad- and narrow-sense heritability were low to medium. A large number of effective factors indicated polygenic inheritance for fruit yield and fruit size. Gain from selection for yield is amendable by selection. As a result of this complex inheritance. selection based on individual plant selection in pedigree method may not be useful for yield improvement in this population. Hence. a selection scheme based on progeny testing using replicated plots. perhaps at multiple locations. is recommended.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:pZ2CosqRuhkC,11,https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/48/7/article-p844.xml,11430719154092881176,/scholar?cites=11430719154092881176,,https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/48/7/article-p844.xml,0,0,0

The network is a shared medium so that the weakness security attacks such as eavesdropping. replay attack. and modification attack. Thus. we have to establish a common key for encrypting/decrypting our communications over an insecure network. In this scheme. a                  threshold proxy signature scheme based on RSA. any                  or more proxy signers can cooperatively generate a proxy signature while                  or fewer of them cannot do it. The threshold proxy signature scheme uses the RSA cryptosystem to generate the private and the public key of the signers (Rivest et al.. 1978). Comparison is done on the basis of time complexity. space complexity. and communication overhead. We compare the performance of four schemes (Hwang et al. (2003). Kuo and Chen (2005). Yong-Jun et al.

Four PGPR strains (Azospirillum. Phosphorous solubilising bacteria. Pseudomonas flourescens and Bacillus subtilis). one commercial organic product (Aishwarya) and non inoculated control were used. The study revealed that seeds inoculated with Azospirillum (basal@ 5 kg ha-1+ 40 days after sowing (DAS)@ 5 kg ha-1) recorded early germination (6.48 days). The maximum vine length (4.42 m) was recorded in basal@ 2 l/plant application of both Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas flourescens@ 2.5 kg ha-1. Number of primary branches was maximum (4.80) in plants applied with phosphorous solubilising bacteria (PSB) as basal@ 5 kg/ha and 40 DAS@ 5 kg/ha. Tap root length (23.57 cm) and secondary root length (39.88 cm) were highest in the plants supplied with Azospirillum (basal@ 5 kg ha-1+ 40 DAS@ 5 kg ha-1) where as. dry root weight (4.64 g) was more in case of double application of Bacillus subtilis basal@ 2 l plant-1+ 40 DAS@ 2 l plant-1.

The former can be traumatic or iatrogenic during. eg pyelolithotomy. pyeloplasty. ureterolithotomy. vaginal orabdominal hysterectomy. rectal dissection. or percutaneous urological interventional procedures [1]. Spontaneous extravasation occurs if there is a distal obstruction. eg a ureteric calculus [2]. peri–ureteric masses or papilloma of the renal pelvis [3. 4]. and is generally caused by forniceal rupture. When the amount of urine exceeds the capacity of lymphatic clearance. perirenal fluid collects [5. 6].Whereas imaging modalities like CT and ultrasonography are often limited in ascertaining the origin and nature of fluid collections in the abdomen and pelvis. 99m Tc–DTPA scintigraphy can be used to confirm the fluid collection to be a urinoma.

Creactive protein was measured pre‑operatively. RESULTS: CRP was reactive in 89% of cases and 3 of 30 controls (P= 0). Among the thirteen complicated cases. two had a CRP reactivity of 1.2 mg/dl. eight had 2.4 mg/dl and three had 3.6 mg/dl. In the uncomplicated cases. forty nine were reactive at 1.2 mg/dl. twenty six at 2.4 mg/dl and one at 3.6 mg/dl (P= 0.0009). In histopathologically inflamed appendix. reactivity was 94.4% and in normal appendix reactivity was 40%(P= 0.00007). CRP positivity had a sensitivity of 94.4%(CI 89.9‑98.9) and a positive predictive value of 95.5%(CI 91.4‑99.6). CRP reactivity and leucocytosis if combined. the sensitivity. specificity. PPV and NPV were 85%. 100%. 100% and 81% respectively. Threshold for CRP reactivity if raised to 2.4 mg/dl. the sensitivity. specificity. PPV and NPV are 42%. 100%. 100% and 16% respectively.

Effect of different vent shapes for same duct geometry is studied for thermal comfort of passenger. Also. effect of vent shapes on velocity at vent outlet. pressure drop across ducts and overall flow distribution from ducts also part of study of this thesis. Changes in vent shape can affect major results in velocities over manikin and hence the temperature distribution inside cabin. Use of CFD tools to simulate car environment and assessment of thermal comfort is needed for improvement in HVAC design and performance analysis.Vehicle cabin environment is continuously changing phenomenon and there is a need for transient analysis in order to study passenger thermal comfort. In order to save computational effort. convective heat transfer is decoupled from the other two modes and solved in FLUENT. These results are then fed as inputs to RADTHERM to solve conduction and radiation equations.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,Fingerprint matching is the process used to determine whether two sets of fingerprint ridge detail come from the same finger. There exist multiple algorithms that do fingerprint matching in many different ways. Some methods involve matching minutiae points between the two images. while others look for similarities in the bigger structure of the fingerprint. A major approach for fingerprint recognition today is to extract minutiae from fingerprint images and to perform fingerprint matching based on the number of corresponding minutiae pairings. One of the most difficult problems in fingerprint recognition has been that the recognition performance is significantly influenced by fingertip surface condition. which may vary depending on environmental or personal causes. In this paper we propose a method for offline fingerprint matching based on minutiae matching. However. unlike conventional minutiae matching algorithms. our algorithm also takes into account region and line structures that exist between minutiae pairs. This allows filling the small breaks in the curves created because of uneven surface and uneven pressure.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:9Df4XUWggEMC,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajendra_Kumar24/publication/260132307_An_efficient_ANN_Based_approach_for_Latent_Fingerprint_Matching/links/00b4952fb1017191df000000.pdf,2118152610974338393,/scholar?cites=2118152610974338393,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajendra_Kumar24/publication/260132307_An_efficient_ANN_Based_approach_for_Latent_Fingerprint_Matching/links/00b4952fb1017191df000000.pdf,0,0,0

In chicken two main AMPs that play significant roles in bolstering the innate immunity are gallinacins and fowlicidins. which are the functional analogues of the mammalian beta-defensins and cathelicidins. Gallinacin identifies the Gram negative bacteria while fowlicidin exerts broad spectral activity. The basic mechanism of action is by far similar in both groups of AMPs. The ‘docking sites’ of these antimicrobial peptides includes the “lipid A” moiety of lipo polysaccharides. lipo-teichoic acids. anionic membrane phospholipids on bacterial surfaces. These AMPs block the DNA replication and protein synthesis in bacteria causing death of the microbe.

On the occurrence of a minor fault in any subsystem the system goes to partial failure whereas on occurrence of a major fault in the non-redundant subsystem it completely fails. On partial failure of the system. the repairman available first inspects whether the fault is in redundant subsystem or in non-redundant subsystem and accordingly carries out the repair of the subsystem involved. Various measures of system effectiveness are obtained by using Markov processes and regenerative point technique.

The pleotropic function of this protein by virtue of its intracellular/extracellular localization and its behavior as an adhesin and virulence factor is quite enigmatic. Despite its importance in mycobacterium persistence. we do not know much about its biophysical and biochemical properties. Earlier reports suggest that the enzyme exists only as a monomer in prokaryotes; however. we observed the existence of both active monomer and dimer forms of the enzyme under physiological conditions. The dimeric form of the enzymes is more stable as compared to the monomeric form as evident from various biophysical parameters. In addition. the dimeric enzyme also shows enhanced stability against proteolysis than the monomers.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,In the field of image processing. identifying object is based on appropriately chosen descriptors. The proper choice of descriptors in pattern recognition is the most sensitive criteria as small misjudgments may lead to wrong identification. There have been several algorithms proposed and worked in this field. Here. the idea is to identify the objects in an uncomplicated method while being computationally efficient. This paper is based on identifying the patterns of objects/polygons based on the recording area of the objects per line scan. The descriptors here are invariant to translation and become invariant to scaling after normalization. Here the objects considered are regular polygons in various background conditions. In order to reduce the noise. after segmentation by thresholding along with labeling and area filtering is done. Along with polygon identification. descriptors for all the numbers are also shown. In order to identify the objects. the average magnitude difference function (AMDF) is applied to each characteristic curve. This paper also shows that though AMDF is a dissimilarity measure. it works better here than auto correlation function (ACF). which is a similarity measure.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:ymY9cBF3mdcC,9,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.206.2941&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5001822837068520988,/scholar?cites=5001822837068520988,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.206.2941&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

93020,A Modern Parallel Register Sharing Architecture for Code Compilation,2010,Rajendra Kumar and PK Singh,1,International Journal of Computer Applications,16,108-113,International Journal of Computer Applications. 244 5 th Avenue.# 1526. New York. NY 10001. USA India,The design of many-core-on-a-chip has allowed renewed an intense interest in parallel computing. On implementation part. it has been seen that most of applications are not able to use enough parallelism in parallel register sharing architecture. The exploitation of potential performance of superscalar processors has shown that processor is fed with sufficient instruction bandwidth. The fetcher and the Instruction Stream Buffer (ISB) are the key elements to achieve this target. Beyond the basic blocks. the instruction stream is not supported by currents ISBs. The split line instruction problem depreciates this situation for x86 processors. With the implementation of Line Weighted Branch Target Buffer (LWBTB). the advance branch information and reassembling of cache lines can be predicted by the ISB. The ISB can fetch some more valid instructions in a cycle through reassembling of original line containing instructions for next basic block. If the cache line size is more than 64 bytes. then there exist good chances to have two basic blocks in the recognized instruction line. The code generation for parallel register share architecture involves some issues that are not present in sequential code compilation and is inherently complex. To resolve such issues. a consistency contract between the code and the machine can be defined and a compiler is required to preserve the contract during the transformation of code. In this paper. we present a correctness framework to ensure the protection of the contract and then we use code optimization for verification under parallel code.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:QUKcMBy53xEC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajendra_Kumar24/publication/43771961_A_Modern_Parallel_Register_Sharing_Architecture_for_Code_Compilation/links/0a85e52fb90086bb4e000000/A-Modern-Parallel-Register-Sharing-Architecture-for-Code-Compilation.pdf,18183220453501789971,/scholar?cites=18183220453501789971,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajendra_Kumar24/publication/43771961_A_Modern_Parallel_Register_Sharing_Architecture_for_Code_Compilation/links/0a85e52fb90086bb4e000000/A-Modern-Parallel-Register-Sharing-Architecture-for-Code-Compilation.pdf,0,0,0

93023,Performance evaluation of general insurance companies: a study of post-reform period,2010,Rohit Kumar,,,,,Patiala,It can be said that the insurance industry as a whole has recorded profound growth after liberalization and privatization of the sector. though the reforms have adversely affected the underwriting results of all the public sector general insurance companies. thanks to their increase in expense ratio and claim ratio in the post-reform period. In the post-reform period. the comparative profitability analysis of the public and private sectors reveals that the public sector general insurance companies have exhibited higher underwriting losses than the private sector companies but the higher investment income of the public sector has compensated their higher underwriting losses which resulted into their higher profitability than the private sector general insurance companies. The liberalization process and the competitive environment acted as a catalyst in the general insurance sector and inculcated efficiency in most of the public insurers and made them more efficient as compared to their private competitors. though private players are reducing the gap very fast by providing better service quality to their customers. The latest market share figures indicate that in such a short span of time. private players have captured market share to the extent of forty-one per cent. which is an eye opener.

Matsum. & Nakai],2009,Rakesh Kumar,,,,,,Watermelon is a diverse crop in terms of qualitative genetic traits. with many different fruit types among the cultivars. We were interested in determining the optimum method for improving yield. and measuring the heritability and rate of natural outcrossing within elite populations. The rate of natural outcrossing is dependent upon the distance between plants. as well as other factors such as location and cultivar. The objective of this study was to 1) estimate narrow-sense heritability for yield using parent-offspring regression in two watermelon populations (NCHYWI and NCHYW2); 2) determine the inheritance of fruit yield. rind pattern. and fruit shape in six generations (PaS1. PaS2. F1. F2. BC1Pa and BC1Pb) of three families; and 3) determine the rate of natural outcrossing effected by in-row spacing and cultivars. Field trials were conducted at two locations in North Carolina (Clinton and Kinston) to determine the narrow-sense heritability for yield in NCHYW1 and NCHYW2 watermelon populations using parent-offspring regression. Low estimates of narrow-sense heritability were recorded for total fruit weight (0.04-0.12). marketable fruit weight (0.06-0.15). total fruit number (0.04-0.16). fruit size (0.18-0.19). and percent culls (0.02-0.09) for NCHYW1 and NCHYW2 populations. respectively.

In these groups of patients. we have tried to make the standard captopril renogram more objective by simultaneously estimating the individual kidney glomerular filtration rate (IKGFR). Twenty-five patients (10 bilateral. 15 unilateral) with angiographically proven renal artery stenosis (RAS) were studied. Ten renal units in five hypertensive patients with normal renal arteries were used as controls. A fall of more than 10% in IKGFR post-captorpril was considered a positive result. The sensitivities of renogram and IKGFR in patients with bilateral RAS were 52.9% and 88.2% respectively.

The most common heme proteins include hemoglobin. myoglobin. cytochromes. and redox enzymes such as catalase and peroxidase.Setaria digitatais a cattle filarial parasite. which is devoid of typical cytochrome systems. However. studies showed activities of δAminolevulinate synthase (ALAS). δAminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD). and heme oxygenase in appreciable amounts. suggesting the presence of necessary equipment for the biosynthesis of heme. This is further confirmed by the end product inhibition of ALAS by heme and the observation of the death of the parasite by succinyl acetone. an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of heme. Though typical cytochrome systems are absent. microsomal cytochrome P 450 and elevated levels of heme containing enzymes such as catalase and peroxidase are present in the parasite.

The time-varying parameters of the model are modelled as stochastic processes. A time-varying ARMA model is considered to represent the non-stationary process. Furthermore. in this work. a unified method for the optimal estimation of both the time-varying parameters and their corresponding stochastic model parameters is presented.

A weak northward gradient in temperature north of 17°N and an eastward gradient south of it is noticed. The thermocline is found at shallower depths in the northern regions. A steady increase in the salinity is observed northward. the maximum being off Bombay. North of 17°N the flow is mainly eastwards which deflects towards south with increase in depth. At SO m a continuous weak southward drift is noticed. More or less uniform distribution is foimd in the dissolved oxygen content at surface and 20 m depth. but at 50 m depth eastward gradients are noticed. Sharp decrease in dissolved oxygen values occur from the top of the thermocline and the oxygen minimum layer is conspicuous in all the sections. The nature of the isotherms and the isolines of oxygen indicate the presence of upwelling in the region off Bombay. The total phosphorus content is much less in the region between 15°N and 18°N with higher values further south and north of these latitudes. The patterns of distribution of dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus contents show an inverse relationship. A westward gradient in the phosphorus values is seen at 50 m depth.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C,3,http://eprints.cmfri.org.in/1584/,13450118277871809286,/scholar?cites=13450118277871809286,,http://eprints.cmfri.org.in/1584/1/Article_03.pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents the effect of varying stiffness in terms of cross section and moment of area of beam and column. and on shear lag phenomenon. Variation of axial force in the column is affected by the variation of stiffness of beam as well as column. It has been observed that the beam stiffness has more significant impact on the variation of the axial force and base bending moment of the tubular buildings. This impact of the beam stiffness may be understood in the terms of additional bending moment which is generated in the flange panel of the tubular buildings. Effect of increasing column stiffness has increased base bending moment in both flange and web columns due to increased rigidity of the building.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:sRzLl6AghiAC,2,https://search.proquest.com/openview/c713383b6391b67f4441ec6d34c364d2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2030611,17855386844541530103,/scholar?cites=17855386844541530103,,,0,0,0

Both solid and pore network are assumed to be continuous so as to form two interpenetrating continua. The theory of poroelasticity investigates the time-dependent coupling between the deformation of the elastic solid skeleton and fluid flow within the skeleton. The solid-to-fluid and fluid-to-solid couplings are assumed to occur instantaneously in the quasi-static approximation in which elastic wave propagation is ignored. Consolidation of a poroelastic body takes place when it is acted upon by surface loads. The study of consolidation of a poroelastic half-space or stratum has received much attention due to its geophysical and engineering applications.

Paragangliomas of the head and neck are extremely rare tumors (approximately 1 in 30.000 head and neck tumors).[1] Since these tumors are difficult to access and very vascular. diagnostic biopsy is not feasible due to the risk of significant bleeding and neurovascular damage. Diagnosis of Glomus jugulare or Glomus vagale is therefore difficult. Patients usually present late and with otologic/neurologic symptoms. CT and MRI provide highly suggestive information. including hypervascularity or bony erosions. However. in some instances. these modalities may not differentiate paragangliomas from meningioma. schwannoma or metastasis. Arteriography has a limited role and also carries the risk of neurologic complications. Also. head and neck paragangliomas may be biochemically silent. which is another reason why a non-invasive diagnostic method becomes important.A fifty two year old lady. presented with chief complaints of impairment of hearing and tinnitus in the left ear since one year with left temporal headache. She also had IX. X. XI cranial nerve palsy on the left side. There was no history of hypertension.

On the basis of a review of scholarly literature and three case studies of public action (based on ethnographic fieldwork) in an Indian village. this study observes that public action is far more complex than celebrated problems of collective action. In public action we want collective action to happen and deliver optimum outputs for target publics. But this should at the same time offer gains. rewards. and outcomes of different kinds to different stakeholders. This discussion aims to outline the scope and possible types of public action.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,Mobile Ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are formed by the association of the mobile devices. usually capable of multihop communication among themselves even if there is no networking infrastructure and central administration to control its operation. Need for the ubiquitous computing lead to connect the MANETs to the fixed IP Network ie internet. To connect the MANET to the internet first it might discover internet gateway through which it can communicate. The discovered gateway may be the mobile node within the MANET or it may be any fixed external node outside the MANET. The gateway works as the default router for all the nodes of the MANET through which all the incoming/outgoing packets are routed between the MANET and the internet. Discovery of the efficient internet gateway is very challenging task. Although So many solutions are proposed and implemented by the different authors/researchers but still no unique and robust solution is discovered so far. therefore a deep investigation and evaluation of the existing proposal is required to investigate the robust & flexible solution. This paper discusses the fundamentals of MANET-INTERNET integration and address systematic evaluation of the current proposals with issues & challenges remains unresolved.

The most coherent modes in this case are the fundamental and the fourth harmonic. The analysis is based on the coherency of the self-excited detonation modes due to turbulence. Analysis reveals coherency is significantly affected with a turbulent Mach number greater than 0.3 and also the regions downstream of the shock are more affected by turbulence than the region just behind the shock. The effect of forcing is also analyzed in terms of the four fundamental energy modes: acoustic. kinetic. entropic and chemical.

93645,MidSFN Local Scheduling Algorithm for Heterogeneous Grid Environment,2012,G Sumathi and R Santhosh Kumar and S Sathyanarayanan,9,International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI),3,253,International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI),A grid is a heterogeneous computing and communication system that allows a group of nodes to compass a task. The process of assigning the jobs or subtasks to the nodes present in the heterogeneous grid is known as scheduling. The type of scheduling in which the subtasks are assigned to the nodes is known as Local Scheduling. A significant research problem is how to assign resources to the subtasks and order the execution of the subtasks that are matched to maximize performance criterion of a local grid system. This procedure of scheduling is called mapping or resource allocation. MidSFN adverts to Medium Subtask Fastest Node algorithm which classifies the subtasks into three tier categories. High. Middle and Low based on their priority. In MidSFN algorithm priority is assigned based on the new parameters Computational Complexity and Processing Power. The value for processing power is assigned based on the Performance Factor. The value of the Performance Factor is the product of the number of operations per cycle per processor and the number of instructions processed per second. In MidSFN algorithm the subtask of medium computational complexity and resources exhibiting medium processing power are assigned with a high priority. The subtasks are then mapped to respective processors based on the assigned priority for execution. Compared to other local scheduling algorithms. MidSFN algorithm shows efficient load balancing and better computation with effective usage of resources. The effectiveness of this algorithm is evaluated through simulation results.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC,2,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.402.1986&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12415236566015010205,/scholar?cites=12415236566015010205,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.402.1986&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
93646,Requirement for pollenizer in new monoecious hybrid cucumber ‘NC-Sunshine’,2012,Todd C Wehner and Rakesh Kumar,22,HortTechnology,2,191-195,American Society for Horticultural Science,Monoecious cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants generally produce enough pollen for fruit set. The amount of pollen required for fruit set depends on the number of pistillate flowers produced by the cultivar. ‘NC-Sunshine’ is a new monoecious slicing hybrid cucumber with a high percentage of pistillate nodes. Because of the high percentage of pistillate nodes. a pollenizer might be required to maximize pollination to get high total and early yield. Hence. an experiment was conducted at three locations to evaluate the effect of the pollenizer ‘Poinsett 76’ on yield of ‘NC-Sunshine’ compared with no pollenizer ‘Gray Zucchini’ squash (Cucurbita pepo). Differences (P ≥ 0.05) due to pollenizer. location. and the interaction of pollenizer and location on ‘NC-Sunshine’ yield traits were detected. Pollenizer influenced cucumber yield at two of three locations. Results indicated that the pollenizer ‘Poinsett 76’ significantly increased total. marketable. and early yield of ‘NC-Sunshine’. The percentage of early and marketable yield was also higher with the pollenizer ‘Poinsett 76’. In addition. the use of a pollenizer decreased cull yield. Therefore. a pollenizer is needed for monoecious hybrids having a high percentage of pistillate nodes.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:1pC5hbHeJ6IC,2,https://journals.ashs.org/horttech/view/journals/horttech/22/2/article-p191.xml,3908968214932230733,/scholar?cites=3908968214932230733,,https://journals.ashs.org/horttech/view/journals/horttech/22/2/article-p191.xml,0,0,0

All patients undergoing genitourinary surgery had received antibiotics. Injectable antibiotic was administered within 1 hr before surgery in 95% cases and 1-2 hrs before surgery in 5% cases. Preoperatively single antibiotic was used in 92%. two in 7% and three in 1% cases whereas postoperatively single antibiotic was used in 91%. two in 7% and three in 2% cases. Most commonly administered antibiotic group preoperatively as well as postoperatively was a second generation cephalosporin. cefuroxime along with a beta lactamase inhibitor. sulbactam (90% cases) followed by the combination of cefuroxime and an aminoglycoside. amikacin (4% preoperatively and 5% cases postoperatively). The number and group of antibiotic used preoperatively and postoperatively were quite identical. The average duration of antibiotic use was 3-10 days. The prophylactic use of antimicrobials in genitourinary surgeries in this hospital was rational with respect to time of administration and choice of antibiotic group. However. the duration of antimicrobial use was highly irrational which must be controlled to prevent the emergence of resistance strains and decrease the adverse effects and cost of health care to the …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC,2,https://www.ijphs.org/article/2012/1/4-1,13535153742728752006,/scholar?cites=13535153742728752006,,https://www.ijphs.org/sites/default/files/IntJPharmacolClinSci_1_3_106.pdf,0,0,0

93673,A Novel Heuristic for Selection of Hyperblock in If-Conversion,2011,Rajendra Kumar and A Saxena and PK Singh,6,,,232-235,IEEE,In this paper we present a novel heuristic for selection of hyperblock in If-conversion. The if-conversion has been applied to be promising method for exploitation of ILP in the presence of control flow. The if-conversion in the prediction is responsible for control dependency between the branches and remaining instructions creating data dependency between the predicate definition and predicated structures of the program. As a result. the transformation of control flow becomes optimized traditional data flow and branch scheduling becomes reordering of serial instructions. The degree of ILP can be increased by overlapping multiple program path executions. The main idea behind this concept is to use a step beyond the prediction of common branch and permitting the architecture to have the information about the CFG (Control Flow Graph) components of the program to have better branch decision for ILP. The navigation bandwidth of prediction mechanism depends upon the degree of ILP. It can be increased by increasing control flow prediction in procedural languages at compile time. By this the size of initiation is increased that allows the overlapped execution of multiple independent flow of control. The multiple branch instruction can also be allowed as intermediate steps in order to increase the size of dynamic window to achieve a high degree of ILP exploitation.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:zDAX0LUT-dsC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/35332624/A_Novel_Heuristic_for_Selection_of_Hyperblock_in_If-Conversion.pdf,2680044819533778655,/scholar?cites=2680044819533778655,,https://www.academia.edu/download/35332624/A_Novel_Heuristic_for_Selection_of_Hyperblock_in_If-Conversion.pdf,0,0,0

93686,Speed Control of a Real Time DC Shunt Motor Using SA Based Tuning of a PID Controller,2010,SM Girirajkumar and Atal A Kumar and N Anantharaman,975,International Journal of Computer Applications,,8887,International Journal of Computer Applications. 244 5 th Avenue.# 1526. New York. NY 10001. USA India,The proposed work deals with optimal tuning of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for speed control of a DC shunt motor. PID controllers are widely used in industrial plants because of their simplicity and robustness. Industrial processes are subjected to variation in parameters and parameter perturbations. which when significant makes the system unstable. So the control engineers are on look for automatic tuning procedures. The performance of Ziegler-Nichols method. one of the widely accepted conventional methods has been compared and analyzed with the intelligent tuning technique called the Simulated Annealing method (SA). The results establishes that tuning the PID controller using SA technique which comes under evolutionary programming has proved its excellence in giving better results by improving the steady state characteristics and performance indices.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:E9jS3u5z5twC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/33409770/pxc3871331.pdf,12008729086826434920,/scholar?cites=12008729086826434920,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33409770/pxc3871331.pdf,0,0,0
93687,A note on demand draft charges levied by banks in India,2010,Ashish Das and Rajeev Kumar and Prasanna Kumar,,,,,,In this paper we study the service charges levied by banks on demand drafts in India. Though RBI advocated reasonability of service charges for demand drafts as early as February 2007. it did not prescribe any explicit thresholds or measures of reasonability. We try to propose a rationalization of such charges by looking into the demand draft charges of 37 select banks comprising 89% of the network of bank branches in India. It is observed that among the select banks the highest service charge for issue of demand draft (having value upto Rs. 10.000) is Rs. 550 while the same is Rs. 1000 for cancellation. Similarly. for issue of demand drafts. having value more than Rs. 10.000. such charges range from 0% to 0.45% of the draft amount. After more than 36 months of RBI’s advice to banks on reasonability of service charges for demand draft issue. we find that more than 10% of the banks have not prescribed a ceiling for demand draft charges. Also. among those who have set a cap. the maximum demand draft charge has been set as high as Rs. 30.000. The analysis carried out here has an underlying premise that competitive market pricing is required to safeguard consumer interest. and if market fails to have a pricing structure which is competitive. it becomes imperative to take recourse to public policy to protect consumer interest. Focusing at the reasonability of service charges levied by banks for issuing demand drafts. the study provides benchmarks and concludes that there is a need to rationalize and bring in uniformity in the amount of service charges for demand drafts.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:wNiDLpJVIZAC,2,http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/10054/1728,3016493506693134527,/scholar?cites=3016493506693134527,,http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/1728/demand_draft_2010.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

93690,Change in surface free energy and surface resistivity of polycarbonate and polypropylene sheets after plasma exposure,2010,RS Bisht and R Kumar and N Thakur,,,,,,Sheets of polypropylene (PP) and polycarbonate (PC) of thickness 2 mm have been exposed to direct current (DC) plasma. Glow discharge plasma was generated at a pressure 200 Pa to modify the surface of polymer sheets at room temperature. Low pressure allows a relatively long free path for accelerated electrons and ions inside the chamber. The measurements of surface energy and surface resistivity were carried out for the thin sheets which were exposed at different discharge powers and exposure time in oxygen plasma. It has been observed that for lowest discharge power (1 watt). the variations in surface energy (along with its components) for PC are small then that for PP sheet. while at 5 watt of discharge power no significant difference has been observed. The resistivity has been found to decrease with the exposure time as well as with the discharge power for both the samples. The surface free energy of PP has been found to increase to 50 mJ/m2 and in case of PC 52 mJ/m2 For maximum power (i.e. 5 watt used in this study) the surface resistivity of PP has been found to decrease to 1.26x109 Ω/cm2 and for PC it decreased to 1.83x1011Ω/cm2.

In insects. RNA interference acts as a natural anitiviral response to RNA virus infection. Especially in Drosophila. it is proved that dicer mediated RNA interference directs innate immunity against RNA viruses. This information prompted us to identify similar RNAse III (dicer) gene in mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori. The Drosophila dicer gene was BLAST-searched with B. mori genome and single contig (GenBank accession n AADK01001038) showed maximum homology with dicer gene. through which the RNAse III gene sequence was identified in the genome of silkworm B. mori. The RNAse III domain was present in the three regions with the length of 278 bp. 277 bp and 185 bp in the contig. possibly these three regions form exons. The primers were designed for three B. mori RNAse III regions and amplified through PCR. The region I was amplified only in pure Mysore silkworm strain whereas all three regions were amplified in Daizo strain. The PCR product sequences were translated and showed RNAse III domain with in the amplified product. The predicted B. mori RNAse III domain had phylogenetic relationship with other insect dicer genes. We presume that this RNAse III (dicer) would protect B. mori larvae from invading RNA viruses. which exists in the other insects.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:hKmHnHMtuq0C,2,https://www.isj.unimore.it/index.php/ISJ/article/download/137/53,15092629845387245194,/scholar?cites=15092629845387245194,,https://www.isj.unimore.it/index.php/ISJ/article/download/137/53,0,0,0

93743,Leptin: pathogenesis and treatment of morbid obesity,2000,Arvind Kumar and Nicholas A Inverso and Christopher D Still,2,,4,337-344,Current Medicine Group,Leptin is a hormone produced primarily by the adipocytes. It works through different receptors and seems to provide information to the hypothalamus about the energy status of the body. Although leptin appears to exert its anti-obesity effect through its central action. the full spectrum of its action is yet to be determined. Most obese subjects in studies have high serum levels of leptin. suggesting that the major problem is leptin resistance rather than leptin deficiency. Consequently. these patients may not respond to exogenous leptin. Recent trials have indicated. however. that leptin may have therapeutic potential in leptin-deficient as well as leptin-resistant states.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:aDl3D7KC1E4C,2,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11894-000-0029-5.pdf,8960579722444295301,/scholar?cites=8960579722444295301,,,0,0,0

The key idea of the sensor-based robotics security system technique is to exploit the information obtained about the environment topology through the Sensors and information and communication technology functions to bias the distribution of random nodes in e-governance technology—like approach toward critical regions. that is. narrow passages and hard-to-navigate regions. This results in a better coverage of the free space especially in environments where narrow passages exist. Inspired by the promising results obtained using this technique for model-based cases. we propose a sensor-based robotics Security planning framework [1]. In our proposed sensor-based technique. information obtained about the C-space topology through the FD paradigm is utilized to find the next best view configuration where each scan should be carried out. They are actually measuring the force that produces the acceleration of a known mass. Different types of acceleration transducers are known: stress-strain gage. piezoelectric. capacitive. and inductive. Micromechanical accelerometers have been developed. In this case. the force is measured by measuring the strain in elastic cantilever beams formed from silicon dioxide by an integrated circuit fabrication technology. Sensors are used to detect the positive contact between two mating parts and/or to measure the interaction forces and torques that appear. while the robot manipulator conducts part-mating operations [2].

A very important issue in wind turbine design is the validity of the models that are used in the design process. the models used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) or the aerodynamic simulations. The aerodynamic part of the design basis has been restricted to non-shear turbulent inflow conditions. Therefore. measured detailed flow characteristics on a rotor in natural. turbulent flow environment are needed to be compared with 2D/3D CFD. wind tunnel data and other aerodynamic models. This will improve the prediction of the wind turbine response. but also represent a unique validation basis for 3D CFD computations and aerodynamic engineering models.

93819,Non Destructive Evaluation of Degradation in Bond Line of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite Adhesive Lap Joints.,2013,RL Kumar and MR Bhat and CRL Murthy,5,International Journal of Aerospace Innovations,,,,A critical issue in using adhesives for structural joints is the assessment of integrity and reliability of these joints in service. One of the factors limiting the wide spread use of adhesives for structural bonding in industries is the lack of reliable non destructive testing methods to evaluate the bonded joints. Joining of fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite materials by adhesive bonding has to take into account factors such as the adopted bonding process. the interface properties and the control of the adhesive bond line thickness. In this paper. results of experimental investigations on the non destructive evaluation (NDE) of single lap bonded joints made of glass fiber reinforced epoxy matrix composite laminates are presented. Unidirectional glass fiber reinforced plastic substrates were joined using a two part epoxy adhesive system. Specimens with varied bond quality were prepared adding different proportions of poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) to the epoxy hardener mixture. The bonded area of the specimen was subjected to ultrasonic inspection and x-ray radiography. The joints were subsequently loaded till failure to determine their bond strength. Results obtained show a correlation between the amplitude of reflected ultrasonic waves from different interfaces and the bond strength.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:aUOtug7Ojf8C,1,https://triggered.edina.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http://multi-science.atypon.com%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1260%2F1757-2258.5.3-4.61,9752199160026032467,/scholar?cites=9752199160026032467,,https://triggered.edina.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http://multi-science.atypon.com%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1260%2F1757-2258.5.3-4.61,0,0,0

There are few studies to date which examine the predictors of clinical outcomes and mortality of patients with this fatal disease. Methods: In a cohort of ATTR patients (n591 age 7269.8 years. 85% male) referred to Columbia University Medical Center between 2001-2013. we examined the clinical predictors for outcomes such as death. hospitalizations. and arrhythmia. We performed survival analysis using Cox-Proportional Hazard modeling to identify baseline predictors of death. Results: Patients within our ATTR cohort on average had mild systolic dysfunction (avg LVEF 41%+/-17%). elevated troponin (avg 0.18+/-0.41 ng/mL). and elevated BNP levels (807+/-617 pg/ml). Initial analyses show that univariate predictors of death include serum biomarkers (BNP O 600 pg/ml. HR 2.77 p 5 0.025; Troponin O 0.1 ng/mL. HR 2.76. p 5 0.026). decreased renal function (eGFR! 30 ml/min/m2. HR 3.99. p! 0.001). and modified BMI (BMI x albumin! 100 (kg* g)/(m2* dL). HR 2.4. p 5 0.04). Multivariate analysis suggest that mBMI and eGFR are independent predictors of mortality (HR 5.3 (95% CI 1.7-16.5) and 9.5 (95% CI 1.9-46.5) respectively. global LRT p-value! 0.01).

India,An expression for the volume dependence of thermal pressure is formulated using basic thermodynamic identities. It is applied to aluminium metal for which sufficiently reliable data are available for comparison. The calculations are performed using the two models viz. the Thomas-Fermi model and the Stacey-Davis model. It is found that the values of thermal pressure for m=6 in both models are almost the same. Thermal pressure increases with the increase in pressure. The anhormonic effects are found to be dominant below about (P=60 GPa). While above this. harmonic effects become dominant. The anharmonic effects are very important at low pressures and become less significant as the pressure is increased. Values of thermal pressure have been calculated by taking into account the effect of the change in volume on melting. The results obtained for aluminium indicate that the present model is capable of predicting the volume dependence of thermal pressure. which is found to be in good agreement with the available data for a wide range of pressures and temperatures,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:7EeV9ZTah7MC,1,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/19422,3687377816141542410,/scholar?cites=3687377816141542410,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/19422/1/IJPAP%2051%287%29%20494-498.pdf,0,0,0

New York. NY 10001. USA India,The proposed last research entitled “An Effective Data Comparison of Graph Clustering Algorithms via Random Graphs” compared two mostly used algorithms for graph clustering ie restricted neighborhood search and markov clustering algorithms via random graph generators ie Erdos-Renyi and power law graphs. This paper is an extension to our last research work. In this we have examined an efficient behavioral analysis of both algorithms via random graphs. This paper mainly shows the behavior of both the algorithms under certain parameters which we have used. Previously in case of Erdos-renyii we used graphs with 1000 nodes with variable edge densities. while in this paper we have modified the number of nodes from 1000 to 15000 with variable edge densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 while in case of Power-law we have variable number of nodes ranging from 1000 to 15000. This paper also depicts as to which algorithm works more efficient. whether in case of Erdos-Renyi or Power-Law graphs. Our last research showed that in case of Erdos-Renyi graph run time of RNSC algorithm is better as compared to MCL for graph having nodes less than 2000 but as nodes keep on increasing the run time of RNSC increases drastically while run time of MCL doesn’t increase. so MCL is better in case of Erdos-Renyi graph having more than 2000 nodes and having high connectivity between the nodes [12] while in this paper it is clearly visible that both RNSC and MCL works better in case of Power-Law graph as compared to Erdos-Renyi graph which clearly states that both algorithm shows some similar characteristics in graphs where edge …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:HOg0WoviCygC,1,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.8455&rep=rep1&type=pdf,15569643771487334958,/scholar?cites=15569643771487334958,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.8455&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Medical images containing lot of information which are often affected by noise and artifacts. which leads to the inefficient diagnosis. LPG-PCA which is a statistical decorrelation technique is found to be one of the efficient methods which could be used in improving the performance of medical images. For better preservation of fine structures in an image. a pixel and its nearest neighbors are modeled as a vector variable whose training samples are selected using a moving window in the image. Such a local vector variable preservation leads to the selection of the similar intensity characteristics. This property of LPG-PCA technique is applied in image deblurring process using adaptive sparse domain regularization technique. This method involves clustering of data and finding the Sub dictionary of each cluster using LPG-PCA. Then the dictionary for input patch is selected using SVD technique and deblurring is done using regularization.

Floquet analysis of the unforced conditions reveals that the least stable perturbations are almost subharmonic with ratio between global mode and fundamental frequency λi/ωf= 0.47. This suggests the emergence of period doubling modes as the route to chaos observed in larger systems. The response to forcing is analyzed in terms of the coherency of the four fundamental energy modes: acoustic. entropic. kinetic and chemical.

93881,Advanced traveler information system with communication constraints,2011,Rohit Kumar and David A Castanón,,,,1916-1921,IEEE,The Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). which provide real-time information about public transit to the commuters have gained tremendous popularity in last few years. The accuracy of such a system depends on the location information of the bus at the base station. Consequently bus uses a fixed transmission policy of communicating periodically to base station. This periodic communication is generally expensive. and it is in fact one of the main factors that prevents aggressive deployment of such systems. In this paper we first propose new architecture and develop new framework to study the ATIS in a communication constrained environment and then propose three different techniques for implementation of the system that tries to minimize loss in accuracy in this constrained environment. Simulation examples are provided in the end to support the proposed theory.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:KKhxhHPhcTsC,1,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5991547/,1759102902336063470,/scholar?cites=1759102902336063470,,http://folk.ntnu.no/skoge/prost/proceedings/acc11/data/papers/1350.pdf,0,0,0
93882,Ontology-Based Semantic Matchmaking of Grid Services Using Parameter Matching Algorithm,2011,Saurabh Saxena and Rajeev Kumar and MK Sharma,2,International Journal of Computer Science and Telecommunications,3,,,The fundamental problem the Grid research and development community is seeking to solve is how to coordinate distributed resources amongst a dynamic set of individuals and organizations in order to solve a common collaborative goal. The problem of service discovery in a Grid environment arises through the heterogeneity. distribution and sharing of the resources in different virtual organizations. This paper proposes a service discovery framework which is based on semantics. It gives an example of the Grid Job Submission Service written in DAMLS in order to show how service ontologies are implemented.

93890,Protein folding: understanding nature’s intelligent ergonomics,2011,Ranjeet Kumar,35,IRSAPS Bulletin,,,,Proteins are the most abundant molecule in biology other than water. 1 Our body is made up of more than 1. 00.000 different protein that virtually govern all the crucial life processes. 2 The biopolymer proteins are made up of 20 different building blocks known as amino acid which assembles in many permutations and combinations giving rise to the wide diversity. The backbone of all amino acids is made up of a carboxyl and amide group the very nature of the side chains determines whether an amino acid will be hydrophilic or hydrophobic. acidic or basic. The linear sequence of the amino acids in a protein defines its primary structure. DNA undergoes transcription to yield RNA the process mediated by RNA polymerases which is further translated to yield the building blocks of proteins. The blue print for each amino acid is laid down by sets of three letters known as codons. The linear sequence is transformed in to functional protein by virtue of its indigenously motivated assembly in to a folded entity by the process of protein folding which finally gives it a three dimensional shape. A newly synthesized polypeptide must fold in to its native (biologically active) conformation. Secondary structure refers to repeating local configuration of residues. eg α-helices and β-sheets. generated mainly by the need for hydrogen bonds to form between peptide bond units. They assemble denovo to form larger and more complex molecular structures known as motifs (such as helix-turn-helix motifs). which may have particular roles interacting with other cellular components.

Breathing induced tumor motion necessitates larger margins during radiation therapy planning which may be harmful for healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Large sampling time in data acquisition and latencies involved in real time imaging systems and tracking system pose a significant challenge to target localization. A framework based on pulmonary mechanics is developed to predict and precisely track the breathing induced motion of lung tumor to direct the tracking system to an estimated position instead of an observed one. A hybrid approach based on the correlation of real-time imagery data of internal markers and easy to measure external respiratory signals like flow readings etc. is proposed to support dynamic radiation therapy procedures.

Air pollution caused by cars is one of the more challenging forces that air pollution environmentalists are dealing with. The air pollution caused by cars that irritate respiratory symptoms. cause cancers. and creates eye irritation. Nitrous oxides contribute to more air pollution from cars.. This is one serious cause of acid rain and other air pollution problems. Second another thing is the shortage of natural fuels because the number of cars is increasing. In many urban areas. the carbon monoxide air pollution from cars can reach over 90%. So we have developed an electrical system by the integration of solar. wind and electrical power.

The mainstay of diagnosis of kalaazar is bone marrow (BM) examination. Standard texts1 2 mention the presence of the Leishmania donovani bodies (LD bodies) inside macrophages or neutrophils to emphasise their essential nature. We have. however. observed casually that extracellular LD bodies are more common. and hence picked up more quickly. than the intracellular forms. We hypothesised that LD bodies may come to lie extracellularly because cells bearing them become disrupted during the making of a BM aspirate. If this is true. then a less cell-disruptive method of making BM imprints should produce fewer extracellular and more intracellular forms. We therefore retrospectively compared BM aspirates with BM imprints with respect to the presence of …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:zEYdoEEwLqEC,1,https://jcp.bmj.com/content/62/6/574.short,554622165149965773,/scholar?cites=554622165149965773,,https://jcp.bmj.com/content/jclinpath/62/6/574.full.pdf,0,0,0

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic micro algae produce a wide array of compounds which include antibiotics. algicides. toxins. pharmaceutically active compounds and plant growth regulators. Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic prokaryotes which comprise of a large number of species of widespread occurrence with diverse morphological. physiological and biochemical properties. While secondary metabolism has a rather restricted distribution. primary metabolism is universal among microbes. The end products of primary metabolism are energy and intermediates for synthesis of essential macromolecules such as lipids. proteins and nucleic acids. In well-regulated. metabolically efficient. wild type microbes such as Escherichia coli. intermediates and end products of primary pathways do not accumulate and they do not possess the genetic apparatus to make secondary metabolites. On the other hand. certain organisms like cyanobacteria possess genes for producing secondary metabolites in addition to genes necessary for growth. In such organisms. certain steps of primary metabolism lack regulation. This results in the over synthesis of intermediates and end products of primary pathways. Under metabolic stress. the pools of accumulated intermediates may induce subsidiary pathways to form secondary metabolites.

Tc-99m (V) DMSA and Re-188 (V) DMSA encapsulated PLGA microspheres were prepared by solvent evaporation technique. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used for coating microspheres to avoid opsonization. MTT Assay and flow cytometry were conducted after incubating Re-188 (V) DMSA microspheres (0 mGy-200 mGy) with U87 MG glioma cells for 24. 48 and 120hrs. In-vivo studies were conducted by injecting coated and uncoated Tc-99m (V) DMSA microspheres in normal rats. The results revealed a glioma cell survival rate of 68-95% at 24 hrs. The same was found to be 100-162% at 48 hrs. The observed response at 48 h was due to repairable damage in some cells and excitation of some cells from G0 phase to G followed by uncontrolled tumor growth. At 120 1 hrs the survival at different doses was found to be 58-75%. Biodistribution studies showed longer circulation time of PEG-coated microspheres; however. uncoated microspheres were localized in liver and spleen. The bigger microspheres were localized in lungs.

INTRODUCTION There are several cogent and pressing reasons for evaluating. promoting and monitoring the level of women's empowerment in India. not the least of which is that household health and nutrition is generally in the hands of women and their empowerment is necessary for ensuring not just their own welfare. but the well-being of the entire household. Empowerment of women is also critical for the very development of India. since it will enhance both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development. Further. the success of development efforts depends on the fruits of development reaching men and women. boys and girls. The extent. to which this happens. however. depends critically on gender relations within the society that set the worth of one sex relative to the other. A final. but one of the most fundamental reasons for promoting the empowerment of women is that failing to empower women as well as men to reach their full potential is a violation of their basic hạman rights.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17077700040810086473&hl=en&oi=scholarr,17077700040810086473,/scholar?cites=17077700040810086473,,,0,0,0

Isoproterenol resulted in significant increase in muscle weight to whole body weight ratio with no increase in hypertrophy index in soleus muscle. A significant increase in noncontractile protein collagen is also observed in both muscles but more prominent in soleus muscle. Collagen proliferation is also analyzed on sodium dodecyle sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of pepsin soluble and Cyanogen Bromide (CNBr) treated pepsin insoluble collagen. Isoproterenol remolded the myofibrillar proteins in both muscles but significant increase in myofibrillar ATPase activity occurred only in soleus muscle.

To begin with we quote some definitions and observations from Pratt [4]. There are lots of connectives in the closed unit interval [0. 1] . we present some of them. We replace the set of natrual numbers ℕ by a semi ring K = [0. 1] in the definition of a petrinet and discuss the firing rule of this petrinet. We also define a dual net and see that a transition t fires at a marking μ to produce precisely the dual of what it produces when it dual fires at μ . The last section of this paper is devoted exclusively to a “petrinet corresponding to a lineale” (which is a model for linear logic) we will discuss two special cases of a lineale and with the help of these cases. we offer a definition of a ‘complementary net’. a kind of dual. based on the complementation.

It is commonly known as “Garden Nasturtium” and is grown as an ornamental in the gardens. Different vegetative parts like root stem. leaves. and shoot apices were excised from both the in vivo and in vitro raised plants and thereafter planted on Murashige and Skoog’s medium supplemented with various growth adjuvants for callus induction. organogenesis and multiple shoot formation. Multiple shoot proliferation was effected from shoot apices on MS medium supplemented with various growth adjuvants in different combinations. Multiple shoot formation occurred on MS supplemented with BAP (0.5 – 4 ppm) either alone or in combination with NAA (0.5 ppm). Best results. however. were obtained on MS + BAP (4 ppm) where 25 – 35 shoots regenerated from a single shoot apex. It was also observed that initial treatment with BAP (2 – 4 ppm) for 2 - 3 weeks followed by transfer to lower concentration of BAP (0.01 - 0.1 ppm) or simple MS medium proved most effective in terms of new shoot production and shoot growth rate. The shoots thus formed were excised and transferred to different root inducing media. Roots. stem and leaves were planted on variously supplemented MS medium for organ regeneration and callus induction. Nasturtium exhibited a high propensity of rooting from all the vegetative parts of the plant. Prolific root regeneration directly from these explants was observed on MS supplemented with NAA (1 - 4 ppm) with or without Kinetin.

The In-sacco degradability of oat straw: green berseem combinations (80: 20. 70: 30. 60: 40 and 50:50 ratio on DM basis) revealed that the effective degradabiilty of DM increased (P<0.05) linearly and the undegradable fraction declined (P<0.05) with the increase in level of berseem. A combination of oat straw and berseem in 50: 50 ratio gave the best results.

Then we discuss the pros and cons of completely generic restructuring (without requiring to modify the algorithm itself) to mobile-aware solutions where the algorithm has to explicitly handle the efects of mobility. We then stress on the importance of design abstraction of resources in a mobile environment so that a greater amount of concurrency can be handled in the resource. To that effect we propose a method to evaluate a’concurrency load’for any abstraction and use it to tell which of the abstractions would be better in the mobile situation and in this relation we enumerate two principles which must be followed.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:f13iAvnbnnYC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ratan_Ghosh2/publication/220792509_On_Restructuring_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Mobile_Computing/links/0deec52ea04443ab2b000000/On-Restructuring-Distributed-Algorithms-for-Mobile-Computing.pdf,12647749793013602960,/scholar?cites=12647749793013602960,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ratan_Ghosh2/publication/220792509_On_Restructuring_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Mobile_Computing/links/0deec52ea04443ab2b000000/On-Restructuring-Distributed-Algorithms-for-Mobile-Computing.pdf,0,0,0

Part of the reaction of cleavage is the abstraction of hydrogens from the deoxyribose moiety of DNA by the biradical formed via a Bergman rearrangement. The mechanism of the reaction of abstraction of two hydrogen atoms from two deoxyribophosphate molecules by the calicheamicinone biradical is studied with ab initio calculations at Hartree-Fock and post-Hartree-Fock level. The Titan program is used to perform the calculations. It is found that the reactions are exothermic and thus thermodynamically reasonable.

94000,Window Air Conditioners: Performance Evaluation and Energy Conservation,2001,M Sidhartha Bhatt and R Sudir Kumar,,,,,NISCAIR-CSIR. India,The paper presents the results of performance evaluation of window air conditioners (mainly units of capacity 1.5 TR) which use R22 as the refrigerant and electrical power (230 V. 50 Hz) as the actuating energy source. The results pertain to two types of studies-field studies. wherein over 100 units are routinely tested for their cooling load and power input (as a part of the energy audit in a number of locations all over India); and laboratory studies wherein the cooling load and daily energy consumption are monitored under stabilized conditions. The power input to window A/Cs is 10-30 per cent more than state-of-the-art systems. The daily specific energy consumption (kWh/m3/d) is higher by six to seven times than those in the developed countries and can be reduced by logic based controls and by minimizing heat in leaks in the conditioned space. The laboratory tests indicate that the daily energy consumption of conventional window A/Cs are in the range 17-23 kWh/d/NTR. Logic based energy savers can reduce the energy consumption by 11-20 per cent. Use of state-of-the-art developments in compressors. motors and heat exchangers can minimize the electrical power input by as much as 30 per cent. In the long run. R22 needs to be replaced by more eco-friendly refrigerants.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:JpYjwmnXVqYC,1,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/26529,14437590247924179049,/scholar?cites=14437590247924179049,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/26529/1/JSIR%2060%288%29%20655-661.pdf,0,0,0

The ab initio development of the theory includes a very general and newly formulated Hamiltonian which involves the contributions due to harmonic-. anharmonic-. localized phonons and electron-phonon and electrons. This almost approximation-free technique is capable of automatically predicting the formation and decay of Cooper pairs in the superconducting crystals. Expressions for the life times and density of states of electrons are obtained in the new framework which are responsible to describe a large number of dynamical properties of high temperature superconductors.(author),True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC,1,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:33001392,16004435852170068142,/scholar?cites=16004435852170068142,,,0,0,0

Water and air-mist sprays are used to cool the moving strand and are grouped into a number of zones which are controlled zonewise.

This method. though simple and easy to implement. does not consider the thermodynamic history of the moving and solidifying strand and is satisfactory only during steady state operation. In practice. a sudden speed reduction. and thereby a steep fall in the water flow. induces strand reheating resulting in internal cracks. scale formation and in extreme cases. even bulging of the strand.

94013,Restructuring in Crompton Greaves Ltd.-a model for restructuring of public sector undertakings,1999,Anil Kumar Sharma and Rajiv Kumar,15,Indian Journal of Public Enterprises,27,91-100,,1. INTRODUCTION Corporate governance refers to the system of governing publicly traded companies. Governance of those companies assumes special importance because of the separation of ownership and management that results in the classic agency problem. Corporate governance models are systems and practices that minimise the agency problem. The Companies Act 1956 and similar statutes in other countries provide for corporate structure that protects shareholders right to elect their agent. the board of directors. for managing the enterprise. Shareholders exercise their rights by casting their votes in general meetings. However exercising that right is costly. both in terms of time and money. Moreover in absence of cumulative voting'minority shareholders can seldom get a representation in the board. Further. there is no guarantee that elected representatives would act in the best interest of shareholders because of the inherent conflict between the interest of owners and executives. Therefore the corporate structure provided in statutes has not worked effectively to ensure good governance. This ineffectiveness of a theoretically good management structure has given rise to various concerns about the quality of corporate governance. The current literature on corporate governance focuses on corporate governance models that address the question of corporate accountability to shareholders. Model codes of good corporate practices that would ensurre adequate monitoring and supervision of executive management have been developed by regulatory authorities and capital markets. Enterprises are expected to adhere to those codes …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:vCSeWdjOjw8C,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13165309563921608151&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13165309563921608151,/scholar?cites=13165309563921608151,,,0,0,0

A series solution for the state variables has been assumed in terms of the incremental conversion of caprolactam in that domain. The coefficients are obtained using the balance equations. This technique of solution takes care of the nonlinearity of the problem in a natural way and involves the sequential evaluation of constant coefficients of the series.

Polish Academy of Science,The optical absorption spectra of Nit+ ion in various environments have been studied extensively by several authors [1-6]. Since Nit+ ion among the transition metal ions has strong absorption bands in the 200-1500 nm region. which are well assigned. Nit+ ion was used as an impurity and optical probe to study the electronic absorption spectra in different host lattices with different symmetry ligands [7-11]. however. there seem to be no reports available in the literature on optical studies of Nit+ ions in the lithium sodium potassium sulphate (LSPS) lattice. Hence the studies of Nit+ ion in LSPS were undertaken at 300 and 77 K to obtain the crystal field parameters and to estimate the site symmetry of the ion in the host lattice.The triple salt. lithium sodium potassium sulphate (Li 2 NaK (SO4) 2) has been the subject of many investigations for the past few years [12-18].

Siemens(1878) and H. Moissan(1897) about a century back(1). Major attraction of using plasma in metallurgical smelting oper-ations. especially in the last two to three  decades. have emerged from its ability to deliver high grade heat to any environment independently  of  oxygen  potential.  Further more. compact unit of high  throughput. due  to high power flux and higher  reaction  rates  attained. and ability to handle cheaper fine feed without causing pollution problems have been the other important  attractions.  Although. the development of plasma technology in the area of nonferrous extractivepetallurgy is still confined to the  laboratory and pilot plant research  stage.  applications  in ferrous metallurgy have entered  the  stage of  commercialization. Table 1' lists  some of  the high  capacity iron and steel installations. Ferroalloys production. using  carbothermic smelting reduction of oxide ores and by remelting of ferro-alloys fines. has been a major driving  force in fostering the development  of  plasma  technology.  As  indicated in Table 1. both ferro  manganese  and  ferro  chromiuin  are being produced at present on industrial scale. Research and development in the production of  other  ferroalloys. e.g. ferro silicon. ferro vanadium. ferro  molybdenum. is in an advanced stage.

These use nominally abrupt emitter-base junctions to take advantage of the conduction band discontinuity or 'spike' to launch ballistic electrons across the base. Whilst many of the reported HBTs in this materials system were single heterostructure devices there are advantages to be gained by having both emitter and collector made from the high bandgap material. such as for example symmetric operation and low offset voltage. It is important therefore to study the detailed electrical characteristics of both junctions in the HBT which will provide detail on the interfacial band structure.

94089,Aluminium Alloy Conductors,1985,Rajendra Kumar,8,,,127-138,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,Electric power has to be transported over long distances connecting the generating centres with the consuming ones and for this purpose erection of AC/DC high and extra high voltage transmission lines has become vital. Although ACSR or AAC has been commonly used. aluminium alloy conductors as AAAC (all aluminium alloy conductor) and ACAR (alloy reinforced aluminium conductor) are finding increasing application on their technological merits. After discussing the metallurgical aspects associated with conductivity as influenced by temperature. alloying and lattice defects. the paper discusses the structural issues connected with the mechanical properties. Finally. the paper describes the development of an aluminium alloy conductor based on the Al-Mg-Si system but possessing high resistance to corrosion in tropical conditions.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:zLla2nKXDtwC,1,https://www.scientific.net/KEM.8.127.pdf,4591694123559496797,/scholar?cites=4591694123559496797,,,0,0,0

During the earlier period. periodicals faced many difficulties. The periodicals. which could not withstand the pressure of the time. disappeared. One of the major factors that led to the disappearance of periodicals at that time was that the number of educated people was very small.

Whilst many workers (1) attribute condensed gas like structures others rightly differ and consider a liquid as a close neighbour to the solid state (2)~(5). A matrimonly between the two approaches appears logical and one of the recent models. surmises a liquid as consisting of a colloidal dispersion of groups of atoms (clusters) having near solid associations in a matrix of random monatomic atoms. The liquid. thus. consists of (i) clusters of either AB or AA types (ii) true liquid atoms which are free and have random motions and (iii) excess number of vacancies in equilibrium at any temperature. The density of atomic packing in the clusters is greater than that of the monatomic and randomized atoms but the clusters are progressively destroyed as the temperature is raised in the liquid state.Using the technique of centrifuging Kumar and coworkers showed the existence of unlike atom clusters in the liquid state in systems characterised by the formation of intermetallic compound and phases in the solid state (Cd-Sb (6).

High school certificate (HSC) scores were correlated with grade point average (GPA) and study duration. Statistical analysis using Pearson’s correlation and regression test was carried out using a fixed effect model.Results: HSC significantly increased over time. A positive correlation was observed between HSC scores and cumulative GPA (p< 0.001). There was also a positive correlation between HSC and study duration (p< 0.001). However. HSC scores could predict GPA only up to 24% and study duration up to 9%. Conclusions: HSC grades are able to select good-quality medical students.

A standard treatment approach is the key for appropriate management. While guidelines exist for the standard management of germ cell tumors. consensus for other urologic malignancies is evolving. Recently. availability of targeted therapy and small molecules has led to paradigm shift in the management of metastatic renal cell cancer. A clinician needs to be aware about adverse reactions and also dose modifications needed to reduce toxicity of these molecules in certain subsets of patients. Unavailability of handy information. prompted us to compile this information in this manual which we hope will be useful to busy residents and physicians involved in the care of such patients. A number of colleagues have helped in this effort; Lipika Goel. a fellow from Harvard Medical School inspired us to work on this. later Ranjit Sahoo. Venkatraman Radhakrishnan and Gaurav Prakash helped to put this information together. We have made an effort to give information on our current practice at AIIMS and also at other centres. Some data particularly on targeted therapy in renal cell cancer has been taken from other sources.

94117,Leptospirosis: Recent Observations,,RSajith Kumar,17,Medicine update,,617-623,,Leptospirosis. even though known to humanity for long. has been presenting with various modifications in clinical picture. As a disease affecting the working population of developing countries. it is producing damages in personal lives as well as economic prosperity. Ours being an agriculture based nation. the damage that Leptospirosis causes as an occupational hazard of farmers needs to be stressed. The classical clinical manifestations of Weil’s disease are also accompanied by instances where predominant meningeal. cardiovascular or pulmonary manifestations are significant. They cause serious morbidity and mortality. The observation that early detection and management are the keys to reducing mortality has to be taken note of in organizing CMEs and health awareness programs for professionals and public alike. The available management systems have to be improvised with facilities for cardiac monitoring. ventilatory support etc. Newer insights into why the disease behaves differently in different persons. communities and epidemics also need to be discussed. The availability and acceptance of preventive strategies in the form of vaccines and chemoprophylaxis are to be ensured. Environmental sanitation. vector and reservoir annihilation are important priorities. The diagnostic modalities and investigational therapies need regular upgradation as per the needs assessment.

With the help of compound vapour compression refrigeration system. temperature up to – 50 °C is achievable.  The cascade refrigeration system is widely used where low temperatures are needed. The natural refrigerant CO2 makes it possible to achieve temperatures as low as -54°C in the low temperature stage. In this case propene is the refrigerant for the upper cascade stage.Using other refrigerants (e.g. ethane) in low temperature circuit temperatures as low as -88oC can be realized. So the required evaporating temperature below -80 °C can be achieved by cascade refrigeration system. Present work deals with thermodynamic analysis of cascade refrigeration system using ozone friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants Iso-butane (R-600a). Propane(R-290) & Ethane (R-170). Iso-butane (R-600a). Propane (R-290) & Ethane (R-170) are the natural refrigerants. These are hydrocarbons. These refrigerants are used as replacement to CFC refrigerant in low temperature applications.

Subsequently. India built experimental and a series of operational earth remote sensing (RS) satellites for monitoring natural resources and to help in disaster monitoring and relief. With the experience and expertise gained in building big satellites. it initiated the design and development of its first small satellite bus called Indian Mini Satellite (IMS‐1) in 2005–2006. IMS‐1 was flown on 28 April 2008. It was originally called Third World Satellite (TWSAT). It carried two optical payloads namely Miniature Multi‐spectral camera (IMS1‐MX) and Hyperspectral camera (IMS1‐HySI). The main goal of this project was to design. build and operate a 3‐axis stabilized RS satellite that would provide easy data access to students and scientists of developing countries. In this chapter. IMS1 and TWSAT are used interchangeably.The IMS1‐MX payload was a 4 band multispectral imager with spatial resolution of about 37 m and swath of about 151 km. for generating imageries in Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) spectrum. The bands were primarily selected to generate data for natural resources monitoring/management such as agriculture. forest coverage and deforestation. urban infrastructure development. land use and waste land mapping. coastal features mapping. coral reef mapping and land slide studies.

Six male sterile (A) lines [81A and HMS 8A (A1). Pb3l3A (A2). Pb402A (A3). 81A4 and 81A5] representing five different cytoplasm systems and their corresponding maintainer (B) lines were crossed with 12 restorer (R) lines in a line x tester design. The 24 parents (A+ B and R) and 144 crosses were grown separately in contiguous block in randomized block design with two replications in six environments. three each (El. E2 and E3) and (E4. E5 and E6) during two years. The data were reported for dry fodder yield (g/plant) and major dry fodder yield contributing characters–plant height (cm). total tillers at maturity and number of leaves per main tiller. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among genotypes. parents. lines (A. B). testers and hybrids (A x R. B x R). The differences due to A vs. B were non-significant except for dry fodder yield (g/plant) and number of leaves per main tiller; and A x R vs. B x R crosses were significant except for number of leaves per main tiller. Cytoplasmic effects were estimated by comparing A x R and B x R hybrids combination. The results indicated that a few number of cytoplasmic effects was significant. Both positive and negative cytoplasmic effects were observed for three characters viz.. dry fodder yield (g/plant). plant height (cm) and total tillers at maturity.

94147,Effect of prenatal sound stimulation on the morphology of visual thalamic relay nuclei of domestic chick,2014,Ranjeet Kumar and Shashi Wadhwa,3,International Journal of Medical Science and Public Health,6,660-666,Dipika Charan,Background: The embryonic development is a complex process and the behavioural traits of an organism are influenced by the experiential factors during early development.. The fact that sensory systems of birds and mammals do not become functional at the same time in development raises an interesting question as to how sensory systems and their respective stimulative histories might influence one another. especially during prenatal period. Studies show that in normal embryonic development. sensory stimulation can play an active role in the construction of species specific perceptual preferences evident after birth or hatching. Aims & Objective: Evaluate volume. neuronal number and neuronal nuclear area of visual thalamic nuclei in the control and auditory stimulated groups by providing prenatal sound enrichment. Materials and Methods: The auditory stimulus of frequency ranging between 100-6300 Hz at 65 dB was given to the chick embryos from E10 to E20. One group was given species-specific sounds of maternal calls (100-1600 Hz) from E10-E15 followed by chick hatchling calls (1600-6300 Hz) from E15-E20. The other experimental group received sitar music sounds given as slow music (100-1600 Hz) from E10-E15 followed by fast music (100-4000 HZ) from E15-E20. Volume. neuronal number and neuronal nuclear area in the control and auditory stimulated groups was evaluated on serial Nissl stained sections by stereological methods. Results: volume and the mean neuron number and of nucleus rotandus is increased in both species-specific and music stimulated groups and increase is nearly similar in both groups.

Based on elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein. computed tomography findings and cytology. a diagnosis of primary mediastinal germ cell tumor was made. He underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical removal of the anterior mediastinal mass. Post operative histopathology revealed the mass to be a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. At 6 month follow up the serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were elevated (71.04 ng/ml; normal range: 1–8). Contrast enhanced CT of chest and abdomen were normal. Because of persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels the patient underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) to localize the site of recurrence. PET–CT (Fig. 1) revealed multiple focal areas of intense 18F-FDG uptake at multiple skeletal sites with no corresponding CT abnormalities (A–F). including facial bones (B. C. arrow). As contrary to diffuse bone marrow 18F-FDG uptake seen post chemotherapy. the 18F-FDG uptake seen in this case was patchy (E. F. arrow). Therefore a diagnosis of extensive bone marrow metastasis was made on 18F-FDG PET–CT. As bone or bone marrow metastasis is extremely rare in germ cell tumors. the patient underwent bone marrow biopsy of sacrum based on PET–CT findings which confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic deposits from germ cell tumor. The patient is being planned for second line chemotherapy.Primary mediastinal germ cell tumor is a rare subgroup of germ cell tumors accounting for less than 5% of all germ cell malignancies. 1 It is more common …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:SrsqWtBqNIQC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/42902037/Mediastinal_germ_cell_tumor_presenting_w20160221-18762-rhry4.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42902037/Mediastinal_germ_cell_tumor_presenting_w20160221-18762-rhry4.pdf,0,0,0

Pune (India),With the recent Supreme Court ruling on Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. there has been a lot of furore in India demanding that the LGBT community’s needs be recognised and that the legal system of India legalise gay marriage. In its ruling the apex court reversed an earlier ruling of the Delhi High Court had struck down Section 377. that criminalises homosexual relationships. Watching so many people. both belonging to the LGBT community and otherwise protesting for the reversal of the judgement of the apex court made me wonder if the mindset of people in our country is indeed changing. Maybe. our society has become more open minded and accepting towards diversity after all. It even made me proud to think that members from different wakes of society are protesting for the rights of a community that forms a minority in terms of numbers but it got me wondering if mere protesting does after all indicate a change in the attitude of the society.How many times have each of us not stumbled upon derogatory jokes on the LGBT community on social networking sites. the majority of whose members are often well educated people? What is worse is that such jokes have found a way to enter social gatherings or even casual conversations at bus stops and super markets. The gay community in our society is excessively stereotyped. often by the same people whom you would find at queer pride marches.

94165,Ground bounce minimization in low power MTCMOS circuits,2013,Siddharth Shekhar and Ravi Guide Kumar,,,,,,Recently. there has been rapid progress in personal communication services (PCS) based on battery drives. including digital cellular phone. personal digital assistants. notebook and computers. In order to promote this development. low power design is essential to achieve the miniaturization and long battery life. Multiple Threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) power gating is one of the most effective techniques in reducing leakage power. which increases exponentially with device scaling. However. this technique suffers a major problem called ground bounce noise during active to sleep mode transition. During mode transition. a sudden current surge flows through parasitic inductance connected to power and ground pins due to packaging which causes voltage fluctuation or ground bounce on the supply line which affect the nearby circuits operating normally. This dissertation is a comprehensive record of the work done toward minimization of ground bounce noise in the Digital VLSI Circuits. We analyzed this ground-bounce noise and reduced it with novel power-gating structures that utilize holistic integrated device circuit- architecture approaches. The efficiency of the technique has been tested on 16 bit ripple Carry Adder in 180nm CMOS technology. Furthermore performance of Ground bouncing reduction techniques have been compared with the available techniques for reducing ground bounce. not only for the ground bounce but also with respect to other parameter like leakage power.

In many cases their description involves a knowledge of the properties of many nuclei that have to be theoretically modeled since experimental information is not available. It is essential that sufficient experimental data are available to test. constrain and guide the theoretical models. This paper concerns the determination of the absolute value of the Gamow-Teller transition strength B(GT) in fp-shell nuclei. These nuclei are important e.g. in neutrino induced reactions at the violent core-collapse stage of type II supernovae. Experimental B(GT) values can be obtained from charge-exchange (CE) reactions on stable nuclei or from beta decay since they involve the same operator. These two studies are to a large extent complementary. each having their own advantages and disadvantages. Assuming isospin symmetry one can combine the results from both types of study on mirror nuclei to determine absolute B(GT) values. This method. the so-called 'merged analysis' is very powerful since it allows B(GT) determinations for GT transitions starting from very unstable nuclei if the beta-decay T1/2 and the Q-beta value are precisely known and if the relative B(GT) values are studied in CE reactions for the mirror nucleus.

In 3D streaming. the model is buffered and rendered instead of complete download. The central idea of this paper is to visualize the typical 3D human brain model at different resolutions based on the client’s requirement at a rapid rate with necessary interactions. This is achieved by initially streaming the simplified version of 3D human brain and then the refinements are streamed based on the client’s requirement. The experiment results and analysis affirms the fact that this type of multi resolution streaming reduces the initial time to present the rendered 3D model to the requested clients. Experiments are further conducted to compare the quality of the multi resolution models that are being rendered with respect to the original model.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:3q5vy9RXY8EC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-81-322-0997-3_40,,,,,0,0,0

Zool,1,365-371,,The genetics of complex adaptation. particularly the degree to which populations follow either parallel or divergent evolutionary trajectories under common selective pressures is an area of active interest in evolutionary biology (. 2009;. 2009). Desiccation resistance in Drosophila is an interesting choice for its complex trait in which the study of repeated patterns of evolution among species and populations can throw fresh insight on the correlation between ecology and physiology. Many Drosophila encounter periods of low humidity during their life-history and must balance water content against integument water loss owing to a high surface area/volume ratio. In doing so. numerous Drosophila species have successfully colonized arid habitats including deserts and high altitudes as well as tropical and temperate zones. providing an excellent model to study adaptation to desiccation at the intra-and inter-population level (Gibbs. 2002; Parkash et al.. 2005). By contrast several rainforest restricted species show little ability to evolve resistance little ability to evolve resistance to desiccation (Hoffmann et al.. 2003; Kellermann et al.. 2009). although they show ample genetic variation for many other traits. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying natural genetic variation for desiccation survival in Drosophila at the population scale. and it is desiccation stress.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:ThYxFsVAhEkC,0,http://mujournal.mewaruniversity.in/JIR2/10.pdf,,,,http://mujournal.mewaruniversity.in/JIR2/10.pdf,0,0,0

Romana Gaspirc and,2013,Ritesh Kumar,,The Role of Ecosystems in Disaster Risk Reduction,,221,United Nations University Press,The nature and scope of disaster risk reduction planning depend on the interpretation of concepts of risk and resilience. Often a narrow focus is adopted. where only short-term local socioeconomic vulnerabilities are addressed. Where this is the case. the occurrence of extreme events is considered a given; the socioeconomic and environmental root causes that inﬂict or exacerbate the hazards. and which become visible only at broader temporal and spatial scales. are not addressed. Some risk reduction professionals do incorporate such a broader “landscape approach”. However. they often rely heavily on human-engineered solutions. such as the construction of dykes. dams and reservoirs. These infrastructurebased approaches generally aim to conﬁne the variability of natural processes to manageable levels and thereby mitigate the impacts of extreme events.These sectoral approaches have contributed to the common perception of ﬂoods as being hazardous events that need to be reduced at all costs.

94213,Simulation of Branch Prediction Optimization in ParallelRegister Sharing Architecture,2012,Rajendra Kumar and PK Singh,2,International Journal of Modeling and Optimization,5,575,IACSIT Press,In this paper we present simulation of optimization of branch prediction in parallel register sharing architecture to show high degree of ILP. The main idea behind this concept is to use a step beyond the prediction of common branch and permitting the architecture to have the information about the CFG (Control Flow Graph) components of the program to have better branch decision for ILP. The navigation bandwidth of prediction mechanism depends upon the degree of ILP. It can be increased by increasing control flow prediction in procedural languages at compile time. By this the size of initiation is increased that allows the overlapped execution of multiple independent flow of control. The multiple branch instruction can also be allowed. These are intermediate steps to be taken in order to increase the size of dynamic window to achieve a high degree of ILP exploitation.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:IEHkmGLyHGEC,0,http://ijmo.org/papers/186-S047.pdf,,,,http://ijmo.org/papers/186-S047.pdf,0,0,0

These galaxies are large. dark matter dominated. spirals that have low star formation rates and large HI gas disks that show very little star formation. Although a significant fraction of their nuclei show signatures of AGN in optical emission lines. not much is known about their nuclear activity. In this paper we present GMRT radio maps of AGN in five LSB galaxies. All five galaxies have compact radio cores that have spectral indices that are close to flat in nature. Two galaxies also show extended emission associated with their AGN; the core-jet structure is similar to that observed in bright Seyfert galaxies. Thus. although the disks of LSB galaxies are optically dim and appear poorly evolved. their nuclei show properties similar to bright spiral galaxies in our nearby universe.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:Lbh3VFZM3akC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012cosp...39.1243M/abstract,,,,,0,0,0

In this paper a strategic design model for two-echelon distribution system is being formulated & analyzed. where the first echelon is the customer order fulfillment stage. In this stage customer order is placed to the distribution center and distribution center immediately replenish the order to the customer. Here the customer order distribution is considered as normal distribution. Also the second echelon is the procurement of goods to distribution center (DC). In this stage. to fulfill the customer requirement the goods are stored in the distribution center which is replenished from plant. Here a standard level is maintained to fulfill the retailer requirement. The key decision considered here is to decide how any ordered lot is being supplied to a particular new demand area. A heuristic mathematical model is developed to minimize the cost of supply a goods into a new demand area. For the purpose of finding the optimal cost of transferring goods. an excel calculation sheet have been formulated. Solution is in two phase. at first phase optimal stock level have been calculated to satisfy the demand by excel Add-ins called “SOLVER”.

94245,Private Equity: Unlocking the Sustainability Potential,2012,Ritu Kumar,,Sustainable Investing: The Art of Long-Term Performance,,129,Routledge,Private equity has become one of the fastest growing and dynamic asset classes. the hallmark of which is the injection of high-quality management in portfolio companies. This affords private equity investors significant opportunities to address the challenge of sustainable investing while achieving market rates of return on their investments.The practice of taking equity holdings in privately held companies originated in the US during the 1970s. spreading later to the UK and Europe. It is now finding roots in emerging markets at a rapid pace. The industry has grown considerably over the past few years. with a loose agglomeration of 77.000 entrepreneurs worldwide and US $2 trillion assets under management globally by mid 2007 (Preqin. 2008). Although this is only 3 per cent of the US $60 trillion in capitalized stock markets. the potential for growth is enormous. Private Equity Intelligence Ltd. also known as Preqin. a provider of financial information for the private equity sector. predicts a US $5 trillion industry over the next five to seven years. The high rates of growth are driven by investment performance. value creation and the resulting investor appetite for greater allocations.

Over the remote oceans organo-iodine compounds contribute to the atmospheric iodine budget; however. these compounds do not fully account for the IO concentrations observed. where an additional source appears to be required. The deposition of O3 to the sea surface and subsequent reaction with iodide in the interfacial layer has been proposed as the missing source of reactive iodine to the marine boundary layer. Experiments were conducted to quantify the flux of reactive iodine produced from this process. which releases both I2 and HOI into the gas phase.

94274,Thermally induced breakup of levitated droplet,2012,Abhishek Saha and Saptarshi Basu and Ranganathan Kumar,,,,,ICLASS,We report two kinds of instabilities in the form of secondary atomization and catastrophic breakup in levitated fuel droplets. The short wavelength (Kelvin-Helmholtz) instability for diesel and bio-diesel triggers secondary atomization near the droplet equator. Temperature dependent fuel properties and external heating rate are responsible for the inception and relative strength of these instabilities. If breakup occurs. it is always preceded by secondary atomization when droplet Weber number exceeds a critical value. The second type of instability results from change in surface tension and viscosity with increase in droplet temperature which causes wide fluctuations in droplet aspect ratio. If the viscous damping of aspect ratio oscillation is not strong enough. the droplet goes through unbounded stretching. A stability criterion has been established based on the inhomogeneity of Bernoulli (acoustic) pressure and surface tension of the droplet in terms of a local Weber number and Ohnesorge number. This instability is thermally induced in a droplet which does not experience instabilities without external heating.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:6IwoDg2IE1oC,0,https://ilasseurope.org/ICLASS/iclass2012_Heidelberg/Contributions/Paper-pdfs/Contribution1380_b.pdf,,,,https://ilasseurope.org/ICLASS/iclass2012_Heidelberg/Contributions/Paper-pdfs/Contribution1380_b.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,Background: PSA in the range of 4–10 ng/ml has a poor positive predictive value for prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a non-invasive investigation that determines the likelihood of malignancy based on tissue metabolite ratios. We have previously demonstrated its ability in identifying malignant areas of the prostate. We now evaluate the ability of MRSI to improve cancer detection rate by comparing biopsy outcomes in men with and without a pre-biopsy MRSI.Materials & Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 278 men with PSA levels between 4–10 ng/ml and normal rectal examination who underwent TRUS guided prostate biopsy at our institution between 2002–2011. Outcomes were compared between men who had a standard biopsy versus those who also underwent a pre-biopsy MRSI.

A real time mechanical industrial process is considered in the paper for which a controller is designed using non-traditional optimization technique. The stability and performance of this mechanical system is greatly governed by the controller settings. It is seen that the traditionally tuned PID controllers fails to meet industrial requirements in terms of accuracy and precision when it comes to system with varied complexities. Many techniques have been developed to obtain the optimum PID parameters for a particular system. In this report Simulated Annealing (SA) is proposed as a method for PID parameter optimization and its effectiveness is compared with those of traditional PID tuning methods.

The advantages of using space-time codes over the wireless chanqel are twofold: with intelligent signal design. better reliability and higher rates can be achieved. although there is a tradeoff between the two. Two formulations which quantify the best possible reliability and rate that a spacetime code can simultaneously achieve have been recently proposed in the literature: the ratodiversity tradeoff and the diversity-multiplexing gain (D-MG) tradeoff. The ratediversity tradeoff applies in the context of a system with a fixed constellation (ie.. one that does not increase with signal to noise ratio (SNR)) and is based on pairwise error probnbiIity.

94318,Investigation of Erosion Wear of Ductile Materials With and Without Coating,2011,Rakesh Kumar and Satish Guide Kumar,,,,,,Wear is one of the most common problems encountered in industries like thermal power plants. hydropower plants. mining industries. food-processing industries etc. in which solid liquid mixture is transported through pumps and pipes. Wear is the loss of material from a component due to a mechanical interaction with another object. Many types of solids. liquids. and even highvelocity gases can remove material and change the physical dimensions and functionality of a part. Corrosion and erosion are the main causes of wear. Corrosion is caused by chemical reaction of material with its environment. Erosion wear is due to exposure to moving liquids and gases. which may or may not contain hard particulate.Effect of erosion wear in slurry pumps and pipes is predominantly more as compared to corrosion. The service life of equipment of slurry transport system is reduced by erosion caused by solid-liquid mixture following through the slurry transport system. Present work is to study the erosion behaviour of ductile materials. 13Cr4Ni steel taken for the study of erosion wear of pump and piping system with fly ash slurry.

The fetcher and the Instruction Stream Buffer (ISB) are the key elements to achieve this target. Beyond the basic blocks. the instruction stream is not supported by current ISBs. The split line instruction problem depreciates this situation for x86 processors. With the implementation of Line Weighted Branch Target Buffer (LWBTB). the advance branch information and reassembling of cache lines can be predicted by the ISB. The code generation for parallel register share architecture involves some issues that are not present in sequential code compilation and is inherently complex. To resolve such issues. a consistency contract between the code and the machine can be defined and a compiler is required to preserve the contract during the transformation of code. We want to achieve high level parallelism at faster clock speed it require distribution of processor resource and avoiding primitive that require single cycle global communication.

It becomes necessary to write the drugs and other parameters in a candid. concrete and clear manner on the prescription slip. It has been observed that prescriptions are generally vague which lead to misinterpretations and thereby resulting in failure of drug therapy. drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reactions. WHO has set prescribed indicators to evaluate the use of drugs to be used in the hospitals/dispensaries. Materials and Methods: Prescription slips were randomly collected from the OPDs of the Guru Gobind Singh Hospital attached to Medical College. Faridkot. for analysis and evaluation. Results: A total of 606 prescriptions were collected. and divided into two categories-47.53% legible and 52.47% illegible. Average number of drugs prescribed is 3.45. The most common drugs prescribed were antibiotics. CNS related. vitamins/minerals and CVS and their percentage was 23.89%. 16.86%. 14.9% and 12.37% respectively. All the drugs were prescribed by non-generic (Trade) names. which included 35.33% drugs from the essential drugs list. Oral forms prescribed were 82.92% and Injectable were 1.9%. Conclusion: Thus. the important parameters of prescription writing are missing and inadequate in most of the cases. There is high tendency and frequency to prescribe more than two drugs but less used from the essential drugs list. There is an urgent need to develop the prescription writing skills and to start an awareness campaign for budding doctors regarding the use of essential drugs list.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/32001555/Drug_Prescribing_Pattern_2011_Pharmacy.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32001555/Drug_Prescribing_Pattern_2011_Pharmacy.pdf,0,0,0

Johannes C. Walter. In eukaryotes. double hexamers of the replicative DNA helicase MCM2-7 are loaded onto double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at each origin of replication in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In S phase. numerous accessory factors activate the helicase activity of MCM2-7. leading to unwinding of the DNA template. Despite decades of study. it remains unclear how MCM2-7 unwinds DNA. One model is that upon activation. MCM2-7 goes through a conformational change to encircle single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) whereupon it translocates along one strand while excluding the other (steric exclusion). An alternative model envisions that MCM2-7 translocates along dsDNA. As DNA emerges the rear exit channel of MCM2-7. it is split by a rigid pin that bisects the channel.

One of the passive design features of this reactor is the heat removal through natural circulation of primary coolant at all power level with no primary coolant pumps. Nuclear plants are mainly base load units. but the proposed plant with various advance features has to operate in load following mode i.e. Reactor follows Turbine (in a limited range). In this mode. any alteration in turbine load results in the steam pressure change. The steam pressure error is fed to the Reactor Regulating System (RRS). which changes the reactor power to control the system pressure.

94360,Effect of process parameters on friction stir welding of AA5083,2011,Rajneesh Kumar and Kanwer Singh and Sunil Pandey,56,Australasian Welding Journal,3,39-48,,[en] Friction stir welding (FSW) is a novel solid-state joining process that is being used to join high-strength aerospace aluminum alloys and other metallic alloys that are difficult to weld by conventional fusion welding. During FSW many of the welding parameters. eg tool design. rotation speed and translation speed. can be precisely controlled. thereby providing control over the energy input. However. the effect of different welding parameters on the process forces remains an area of uncertainty. Using a systematic experimental design approach. the effects of process parameter changes on the process forces and energy input have been evaluated for friction welding of AA5083.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:Oj-SLI0tZTcC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:47080254,,,,,0,0,0

While most methods in use today are invisible to an observer’s senses. mathematical analysis may reveal statistical anomalies in the stego medium. These discrepancies expose the fact that hidden communication is happening. The goal of steganography is to avoid drawing suspicion to the transmission of a hidden message. If suspicion is raised. then this goal is defeated. Discovering and rendering useless such covert messages is a new art form known as steganalysis.

Piping systems play a vital role in the operation of any reactor. Fast breeder reactor piping system carries sodium at high temperatures. These systems are operated for long durations. Under normal operating conditions. these piping systems are under tensile stress due to internal pressure and self weight. In case of any seismic excitations. these piping systems are subjected to cyclic torsion along with the constant tensile stress. The combination of static axial tension and large magnitude of cyclic torsion leads to accumulation of plastic strains in axial direction. This accumulation of plastic strain in the axial direction due to cyclic torsion is called ratcheting.

94372,Guest Editorial Special Issue on Reliable Aspects of Embedded Hardware,2010,Rakesh Kumar,2,IEEE Embedded Systems Letters,4,101-102,IEEE,MUCH of the astonishing success of the semiconductor industry can been attributed to Moore’s Law that has allowed us to literally print circuits and systems growing at exponential capacities for the last three decades. The resulting exponentially reducing cost per function has resulted in an unprecedented penetration of technology in homes and beyond. leading to profound impacts on the society and quality of life. Moore’s Law has started being threatened. however. due the resulting exponentially deteriorating effects of material properties on chip reliability. As transistors become smaller—the oxide in 22 nm process is only five atomic layers thick. and gate length is only 42 atoms across. it is becoming increasingly expensive for the current design and manufacturing technology to keep the transistors functioning reliably. even under normal operating conditions.

94373,SIMULATION OF MODIFIED ROUTING PROTOCOL FOR DETECTION AND REMOVAL OF COOPERATIVE BLACK HOLE ATTACK IN MOBILE AD HOC NETWORK,2010,RAJESH KUMAR,,,,,,An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes dynamically forming a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. In mobile ad hoc network. each mobile node acts as a host as well as a router. These nodes communicate to each other by hop-to-hop communication. A number of routing protocols like Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV). Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector (DSDV) and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) have been implemented. AODV is a prominent on-demand reactive routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. But in existing AODV. there is no security provision against a well-known “Black Hole” attack.

Two experiments were performed to determine the reduced transition probabilities of 112Sn and 114Sn relative to 116Sn in order to minimize the systematic errors. The experiments were performed to improve these crucial data points and to firmly establish the location of the unexpected sudden change of B (E2)-values along the Sn isotopic chain. At GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung. Darmstadt. Germany. we performed two consecutive measurements using 114Sn and 116Sn beams on a 58Ni target. In the experiment carried out at Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC). New Delhi. India. targets of 112Sn and 116Sn were bombarded with a 58Ni beam. The obtained B (E2; 0+→ 2+) values of 0.242 (8) e2b2 and 0.232 (8) e2b2 for 112Sn and 114Sn respectively. are not consistent with the recent large scale shell model (LSSM) calculations. The results confirm the tendency of large B (E2) values for lighter tin isotopes below the mid-shell 116Sn nucleus. that has been observed recently in various radioactive ion beam experiments. In neutron deficient Sn isotopes for which Coulomb excitation experiments are presently not possible due to lack of sufficient beam intensities. decay studies can be performed to obtain the level scheme in these exotic nuclei. In a fragmentation reaction. angular momenta are transferred to the nuclei of interest. which can be measured after the separation in the fragment separator (FRS) using an effecient gamma array.

94385,Performance Analysis of Space Time Block Codes with Channel Coding,2010,Roshan Kumar and Amit Kumar Guide Kohli,,,,,,Wireless systems are rapidly developing to provide high speed multimedia data transfer services that were traditionally offered by wired networks. To support these services. channels with large capacities are required. Theoretical investigations in the past few years have shown that very high capacities can be obtained by employing multiple antenna elements at both the transmitter and the receiver end of a wireless system. In multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) system of wireless communication. Space time block coding (STBC) is one of the attractive technique for high bit-rate and high capacity transmission. The advantage of space-time codes lies in the fact that diversity advantage is obtained by shifting the complexity of adding additional antennas to the transmitter while allowing the complexity of receiver to be reasonably low. Methods for providing transmit diversity in communication over fading channels also been concerned. The advantage of space-time codes lies in the fact that diversity advantage is obtained by shifting the complexity of adding additional antennas to the transmitter while allowing the complexity of receiver to be reasonably low.

Spiropentane (SP) possesses D 2d symmetry at its equilibrium configuration. The two low-lying electronic states of SP+ belong to X∼ 2 B 2 and A∼ 2 E symmetry. respectively. SP+ in the degenerate A∼ state is susceptible to JT distortions along the vibrational modes of b symmetry. The A∼ state of SP+ is vertically∼ 0.51 eV spaced from its X∼ state. Symmetry rule allows a coupling of the X∼ and A∼ states via the degenerate e vibrational modes. This is termed as the (B+ E⊗ b)⊗ e JT and PJT effects revealing the symmetry of the electronic states and the coupling vibrational modes. The theoretical findings establish significant impact of the JT and PJT coupling in the observed complex structure of the X∼–A∼ bands of SP+.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:rzmi0EmCOGEC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010410002326,,,,,0,0,0

94389,Understanding Proteins: The Wonder Molecule,2010,Ranjeet Kumar,,www. bbmanthan. info,,20,,Biological systems are quite intriguing and the enigma called life has puzzled the human rationale since antiquity. The self sustaining biological process called life has been greatly debated and understanding the fine fabric that lies as a common theme to all living forms is still a holy grail yet to be comprehended in great details. In biophysical terminology according to physicists such as John Bernal. Erwin Schrödinger. Eugene Wigner. and John Avery. life is a member of the class of phenomena which are open or continuous systems able to decrease their internal entropy at the expense of substances or free energy taken in from the environment and subsequently rejected in a degraded form [1. 2]. The basic organizational unit of all living organisms is cell that finally forms the interwoven communicating assembly providing the platform for genesis of life. The functional pleotropy of the cells arise from the formation of specific consortium formed by the proteins. sugars. lipids and nucleic acids. The cells in addition contain myriad sea of chemical constituents with water forming the base of life’s cocktail and constituents such as small inorganic and organic molecules: K+. Na+. Ca++. Mg++. Cl-. P04--. organic bases. all vital amines (vitamins) and cofactors floating freely regulating and maintaining the integrity and dynamics of life. If life be considered gods intelligently designed complex engine then these small molecules can be analogical to tiny tools. nuts. bolts and spare parts which facilitates efficient running.

The model for such a real time process is identified and validated. Real time industrial processes are subjected to variation in parameters and parameter perturbations. which when significant makes the system unstable. Determination or tuning of the PID parameters continues to be important as these parameters have a great influence on the stability and performance of the control system. most of the processes are complex and nonlinear in nature resulting into their poor performance when controlled by traditional tuned PID controllers. The need for improved performance of the process has led to the development of optimal controllers. So the control engineers are on look for automatic tuning procedures. This paper discusses in detail about the Particle swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. an Evolutionary Computation (EC) technique. and its implementation in PID tuning for an industrial process. Compared to other conventional PID tuning methods. the result shows that better performance can be achieved with the proposed method in terms of time domain specification and performance indices.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:CUz-cjXBMXMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9017242110865819031&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Drought reduces the photosynthetic rate and total photosynthetic surface area due to senescence (4). These factors are responsible for reduction in dry matter accumulation and grain yield. The productivity of the rice not only depends on the accumulation of total amount of dry matter but its effective partitioning to economic part is a key to stabitize the yield particularly under drought stress conditions. Under such conditions partitioning to economic parts mainly from stem and leaves plays an important role in yield stabiUty (3).

The direction of rotation of the two pumps is identical and the suction bays for the right and left sides of the twin pump naturally induce prerotation/preswirl to the flow approaching the impeller. It is observed from tests that the prerotation in the left side increases head and power while that on the right side decreases impeller head and power. During regular operation it is observed that the two sides no longer give the same performance for which they were designed. This fact is also verified during performance tests.In this study an attempt is made to eliminate prerotation on either sides of the twin suction bay and equalize impeller power and head. Firstly the baseline design (vertical inline pump) is numerically studied using full pump simulation and the results are compared to that of experimental data. Evaluation of the traditional suction design is done using component simulation. Parametric design changes are carried out on the traditional suction bay to eliminate prerotation. Two selected redesigned versions are further analysed using full pump simulations and the results are compared with that of the baseline and the traditional designs.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:EsO17nB32j8C,0,http://www.sastechjournal.com/pdf/Journals/May2010/9.pdf,,,,http://www.sastechjournal.com/pdf/Journals/May2010/9.pdf,0,0,0

With low power consumption. high data rates up to 480 Mbps. large spatial capacity and low interference with other wireless services due to low power spectral density. MIMO-OFDM based UWB systems are the most sought after for wireless communications. The application targeted by this design was the band 1 of ‘Band group 1’based UWB system with a center frequency of 3.432 GHz and a bandwidth of 528 MHz.This paper focuses on FPGA implementation of Reconfigurable Digital Frontend module of MIMO-OFDM. The modeling of the MIMO-OFDM system was carried out in MATLAB followed by Verilog HDL implementation. Unlike the conventional OFDM based systems. Numerically Controlled Oscillators (NCO) are used for mapping modulated data onto the subcarriers. The use of NCO in the MIMO-OFDM system reduces the resource utilization of the design on FPGA along with reduced power consumption. The major modules that were designed. which constitute the digital frontend module. are Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulator/demodulator. 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) modulator/demodulator and NCOs. Each of the modules was tested for its functionality by developing corresponding testbenches.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:P2d6BWbXU0IC,0,http://www.sastechjournal.com/pdf/Journals/May2010/13.pdf,,,,http://www.sastechjournal.com/pdf/Journals/May2010/13.pdf,0,0,0

94424,P05-03. The use of immune complexes to enhance antibody responses against neutralizing epitopes on HIV envelope,2009,CE Hioe and M Visciano and R Kumar and J Liu and M Tuen,6,Retrovirology,3,1-1,BioMed Central,BackgroundThe capacity of immune complexes to augment antibody (Ab) responses is well established. The enhancing effects of immune complexes have been attributed mainly to Fc-mediated adjuvant activity. On the other hand. antigenic alterations of specific epitopes as a result of immune complex formation have been less well studied.MethodsWe probed for alterations in the antigenicity of HIV gp120/Ab complexes using ELISA with monoclonal Abs specific for different gp120 regions. The immunogenicity of the gp120/Ab complexes was evaluated in mice immunized with the complexes.ResultsThe data show that gp120/Ab complexes display higher reactivity with mAbs to the neutralizing epitopes on the V3 loop. Enhanced Ab responses to the V3 loop were detected in mice immunized with thegp120/Ab complexes. Importantly. potent neutralizing activity was observed in the sera immunized with the complexes. but not in the sera of mice immunized with uncomplexed gp120. However. the neutralization was highly restricted to the homologous HIV-1LAI strain. When the immune complexes were prepared using gp120 from a more representative subtype B HIV-1 strain (JRFL). high titers of Ab responses with distinct fine specificity were induced in the sera of immunized mice. but the breadth of serum neutralizing activity was still limited.ConclusionThe binding of Abs to gp120 alters the antigenicity and immunogenicity of gp120. leading to enhanced potency of Ab responses against the neutralizing V3 epitopes. However. further studies are necessary to improve the breadth of the neutralizing Ab responses.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:ckcx6fjc-GEC,0,https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4690-6-S3-P79,,,,,0,0,0

94428,Collision Avoidance for Airborne System UsingGPS Data and RADAR Data,2009,NK Srinath and Ramakanth Kumar,1,International Journal of Computer and Electrical Engineering,3,317,IACSIT Press,The Airborne collision avoidance is required as the air traffic system continuous to grow. The various factors relating to the position of the aircraft at any instant of time is considered to avoid collision. This paper discusses collision avoidance in spite of parallel flights in space. It ultimately provide for certifying. safety-critical software developed for Collision avoidance System. The GPS information along with the RADAR data is accessed by the flight precisely surveillance. Time is an important factor for GPS system to calculate the position-longitude. latitude. and altitude. direction of motion and angle of motion. Precise time-oriented techniques of collision avoidance system provide both range and range-measurements of all air crafts as well as ground stations. It is desirable for an aircraft pilot to know the navigation parameters of not only his aircraft but also about the multiple flying aircrafts either relative/absolute to his aircraft during sortie. To facilitate all these information. this paper shows the incorporation of a perfect and efficient multiple tracking systems like GPS. RADAR and display system on board.

A sensor node collects and delivers necessary data in response to the user’s request. Wireless sensor networks have various applications such as military. environment. home. security etc. A major issue in wireless sensor networks is limited battery power of sensor nodes. Therefore it is required to use the battery power in an efficient manner. to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. If the sensors transmit its data directly to the base station. then it will deplete its energy quickly. There are various routing algorithm to overcome these constraints. If the goal is to minimize the energy then Power Efficient-GAthering in Sensor Information System (PEGASIS) reduces the amount of energy spend per round. but it is also important to consider the delay occurs in data gathering.

So their spatial and temporal redundancy must be exploited to obtain reduced data to store and transmit. The motion between two consecutive images can be estimated using Full Search Block Matching Algorithm (FSBMA). This algorithm determines motion by pixel-by-pixel basis. Systolic array architecture can be used to implement the Full Search Block Matching Algorithm due to their advantageous properties like regularity. modularity and local communication.The FSBMA has been designed using two dimensional systolic array architecture. The blocks of this architecture are processing element. shift register arrays. address generators for search area value. reference block value. enable signal generator. candidate region monitor and best match selection unit. All these blocks and the top module have been designed. In this work the two dimensional systolic array architecture with serial input is used to perform Full Search Block Matching Algorithm. The FSBMA using Systolic Array has been modeled in Verilog Hardware Description Language and simulated against its functional specifications. This is then synthesized using Xilinx synthesis tool with constraints and has been implemented on FPGA. The implemented design has been verified. The system has a single clock and reset.

94485,Easing of Fuzzy Multiplexing in Complex Robot Arbitration by FBSP Grouping,2008,SK Harisha and Ramakanth P Kumar and M Krishna and SC Sharma,8,IJCSNS,12,309,,In Behavior-Based System (BBS). the control strategy is distributed among a set of specialized behaviors. Each behavior with particular intention runs completely independently to send commands to control the mobile robot. However. behavior with different intentions may generate conflicting command. Therefore. behavior coordination is an important issue. An intelligent behavior fusion is implemented to solve this problem. Each behavior has a certain degree of possible effects. with degree zero is the least desired action and degree one is the most desired action. The behaviors send certain degree as a possibility for each action set to achieve the objectives of the behaviors. The main controller then performs command fusion and selects the most favored action for the exploration. This will solve the action selection problem and improve the probability to succeed but when numbers of behavior crosses certain extent. fuzzy multiplexing or fuzzy fusion process leads to complex task. This existing technique of fuzzy multiplexing has been implemented by adapting FBSP (Fuzzy Based Sensor Perception) grouping. In this technique the number of behavior. which comes under same group. shares the common sensor by varying fuzzy range values. Experimental results are conducted for easy localization with low cost sensors and successful navigation using IR range sensors.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:IvSMUa3B7yYC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/47933631/20081244.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47933631/20081244.pdf,0,0,0

So transmission delay is the main problem to send a large amount of data. To overcome this problem data should be routed to the minimum possible route for this there are various routing protocols which can be used to route the data in optical networks. In this thesis we are using two routing protocol to send the data and analyzing the performance parameters such as end to end transmission delay and throughput of the network. The transmission delay is the main problem in today’s networks because everyone wants to transmit a large amount of data and this lead to high delay in the network. So data compression may be one alternative to this problem. In this thesis we are also seeing the usefulness of data compression in fast speed and slow speed SONET. By modeling and simulating fast speed and slow speed network in OPNET IT Guru. we observe the overall result that although the throughput between the switch and the client using compression is less than the throughput between the switch and the client that is not using the compression. the response time for the client using compression is higher. In other words. the client loses more time for the compression and decompression processes than it gains from the transmission of the smaller frames. So we can say that there is no need to transmit the compressed data in the high speed network because it transmits uncompressed data to higher speed than the compressed …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:MUocvVTjX6cC,0,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/handle/10266/734,,,,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/bitstream/10266/734/3/T734.pdf,0,0,0

Control software can contain errors (faults). and fault-tolerance methods must be developed to enhance system safety and reliability. We present an approach for fault detection and isolation that is key to achieving fault-tolerance. Detection approach is hierarchical involving monitoring both the control software. and the controlled-system. The latter is necessary to safeguard against any incompleteness of software level properties. A model of the system being monitored is not required. and further the approach is modular and hence scalable. When fault is detected at the system level. an isolation of a software fault is achieved by using residue methods to rule out any hardware (plant) fault.

Raman spectroscopy and specific heat measurement techniques. XRD data shows that BiMn2-xTixO5 is orthorhombic (sg Pbam) up to x= 0.3. further SEM study indicates the decrease in porosity and grain size with Ti substitution. The change in phonon modes due to Ti substitution has been investigated from unpolarized Raman spectra. A low frequency Ag mode is found to be less asymmetrical with Ti substitution and is discussed elaborately. The specific heat anomaly associated with antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed with increasing Ti content and is consistent with the literature. Low temperature specific heat (LTSH) fitting shows the increasing magnetic contribution to the specific heat with Ti substitution.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bharti_Gaur3/publication/248398873_Effect_of_Diluents_on_the_Thermal_Behaviour_of_Vinyl_Ester_resins/links/02e7e51dfa5a66bada000000/Effect-of-Diluents-on-the-Thermal-Behaviour-of-Vinyl-Ester-resins.pdf#page=14,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bharti_Gaur3/publication/248398873_Effect_of_Diluents_on_the_Thermal_Behaviour_of_Vinyl_Ester_resins/links/02e7e51dfa5a66bada000000/Effect-of-Diluents-on-the-Thermal-Behaviour-of-Vinyl-Ester-resins.pdf#page=14,0,0,0

Scientific research into human ESC has been proliferating steadily in the last few years. This has led to premature and unjustified expectations that embryonic stem cells will cure a host of diseases affecting the heart. brain. endocrines. spinal cord. However. there are ethical issues involved in the use of ESC and research on embryonic cells has been banned in many countries.Use of postnatal or adult stem cells. such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). does not pose any ethical issue. Moreover. HSCs have been in use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for more than 30 years in a variety of malignant and nonmalignant disorders. More recently. there have been reports based on laboratory and animal studies. suggesting that adult stem cells can also exhibit “plasticity” or the ability of “transdifferentiation”. thereby allowing cells of one lineage to form cells belonging to another lineage.

Chances of deflagration with P5 permitted explosives are more because of these explosives are weakest of all the permitted explosives. Deflagrations of permitted explosives pose a grave hazard in underground coal mines where there is danger of methane or coal dust explosion. Therefore. only non-deflagrating type of P5 permitted explosives are allowed for use in underground coal mines. Deflagration characteristics of permitted P5 explosives of all three types (NG-based. slurry & emulsion) were studied in the laboratory in two different experimental set-ups namely. Audibert Delmas Apparatus (ADA) and Modified Long Cannon (MLC). under varying conditions. Results of studies were analyzed to compare the severity of the methods as well as proneness towards deflagration of different types of explosives and finally selection of standard laboratory method for assessment of deflagration propensity of P5 explosives.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:7AXAwFc_feUC,0,http://cimfr.csircentral.net/351/,,,,,0,0,0
94552,Hardware/System Support for Four Economic Models for Many Core Computing,2007,Joseph Sloan and Rakesh Kumar,,"Coordinated Science Laboratory Report no. UILU-ENG-07-2214, CRHC-07-07",,,Coordinated Science Laboratory. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,This paper argues for a new set of economic models for many-core computing. Current economic models for processors require a customer to estimate her average-case or worst-case computational requirements beforehand and then buy a processor/system that meets those needs. Physically changing the chip is the only way to transition between different peak computational capabilities. but it has associated cost and management overheads. Therefore. users tend to continue using the chip till a new system is bought. This causes computational resources on chips to often not match computational requirements of customers and/or applications. thereby resulting in processors that are often underutilized or over-utilized. Similarly. the one-to-one mapping between a chip and its available peak computational capability that the current economic models assume results in a mismatch between computational requirements of a user and the. computational capabilities of a chip. This mismatch will only increase with increasing number of cores on the processor die.This paper presents four alternative economic models for many-core computing. The proposed models recognize that when a many-core chip is bought. the customer may often wish to pay for less number of cores than what is present on a chip. The models provide flexibility to the customer to change the available peak computational capability of the chip (or effective number of cores) during the lifetime of the chip. Two of the proposed models also allow the user to treat processing as a sendee by allowing the user to rent computational capability on the chip as well as pay only for the capability …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:MkYP4vM-iK8C,0,https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/74600/B59-CRHC_07_07.pdf?sequence=2,,,,https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/74600/B59-CRHC_07_07.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

94636,Design of lead-rubber bearings for use in seismic isolation of highway bridges,2005,L PARAMESWARAN and R KUMAR and MV RAO,66,Journal of the Indian Roads Congress,2,,,Application of seismic isolation elastomeric bearings in highway bridges is a novel approach. which helps in reducing the earthquake forces considerably. These bearings are effective in improving the performance of bridges under the action of seismic forces by shifting the fundamental period of vibration and by imparting large energy dissipation capacity. In this paper. a brief study on the behaviour of bridges during earthquakes is presented to emphasize the need for seismic resistant design. The basic concept of seismic. isolation and advantages of using isolation bearings in bridges are discussed. A study on developments in the design of seismic isolation elastomeric bearings as well as their application in some of the existing highway bridges is presented. A comprehensive methodology for the design of lead-rubber isolation bearing has been proposed and discussed in detail. To illustrate this. a design of lead-rubber bearing at abutments and piers of a three span bridge has been included. The performance checks and testing requirements of this type of bearings are also highlighted.(A),True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:9Pw2l-cN0AIC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/782288,,,,,0,0,0

94640,A theoretical study of the performance of sub-micron MOSFET devices in the presence of edge potential,2005,VP Kiran and RG Kumar and AK Singh* and S Gurunarayanan,92,International journal of electronics,5,295-302,Taylor & Francis Group,In the present communication we have presented a detailed theoretical analysis of the performance of the sub-micron device in the presence of the discontinuity at the Si–SiO2 interface. It is assumed that due to interface discontinuity a potential develops at the edges (Source/Drain) in addition to the built-in-potential. This potential. called Edge Potential. measures directly the extent of the interface roughness. The effect of this potential is more critical in the case of short channel device where drain and source are in close proximity. Our analysis shows that the discontinuity is dominant at the edges but not in the channel. Drive current as well as saturation transconductance decreases in the presence of edge potential. These results suggest that the performance of the device degrades due to the interface roughness. Effect of interface roughness near the edges can be reduced at high gate voltage but it will result more …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC,0,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207210500114083,,,,,0,0,0

In India. its cultivation has been found very successful in Western Himalayan region (Rathore. 1984) but its commercial exploitation is still underway in Sikkim. The fruits are very delicious and mature during winter season. which is a lean period for other temperate fruit crops. However. the evaluation of fruit quality of a newly introduced fruit crop is a prerequisite before any decision could be taken on in release for commercial cultivation. The research work conducted during last decade (Khan et al.. 3; Rathore. 5) have shown that the composition of fruit vary with the climate and type of cultivar grown.

Co.,Biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems demands new and innovative approaches that are relatively easy and economical to deploy and that provide timely and accessible information to environmental managers and policy makers. due to the shear magnitude and scope of the challenge (Wells. 1999). Several aquatic and terrestrial groups have been frequently used in quantifying the effects of pollutants on aquatic systems (Rand and Petrocelli. 1985). Rotifers form an important group of freshwater community and are recognized as bioindicators of water quality and the trophic status of the aquatic system (Naik. 1991). The use of freshwater rotifer. Brachionus calyciflorus as a test organism for ecotoxicological studies has been evaluated by Janssen et al.(1993). Changes in the demographic characteristics of Brachionus patulus. B. rubens (Halbach et al.. 1984) and B. calyciflorus (Ferrando et al.. 1993) have been shown to be sensitive indicators of toxic stress for a wide variety of chemical compounds. The physiological effects of different toxicants like diazinon. DDT on B. patulus. endosulfan on B. calyciflorus (Ferrando and Moliner. 1991). methyl parathion. diazinon on B. calyciflorus (Fernandez et al.. 1993). and methyl parathion on B. patulus (Sarma et al.. 2001) have been studied.

A triple modular redundancy approach is followed for the design of this system. This system is functionally partitioned into two sub-systems-Reactor Regulating System (RRS) and Reactor Trip Logic System (RTLS). RRS controls the reactor power as per demand and RTLS generates the reactor trip on abnormal process conditions. This paper describes the details of RRS and RTLS system architecture and fault tolerant and fail-safe features used in the system design.(author),True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:4Q5OFK1iulkC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:36070077,,,,,0,0,0

The average life cycle of the bar was found to reduce from 50 cycles to 20 cycles during a specified time span. While reduction. it was observed that both stiffener and the bar were continuously exposed to flue gas. Failure in the vicinity just above the MS stiffener takes place due to gradual reduction in cross-sectional area of the Cu-bar as a result of oxidation. pitting and crack formation. Microstructural analysis also reveals that the presence of pits/voids are also responsible for such failure. In fact. the failure is attributed mostly due to the intergranular mode. In order to prevent such failure. a few remedial measures are suggested. Among them. stringent quality control of the copper metal before and after the fabrication of bar as well as also increasing the height of the stiffener could well be explored.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:qyhmnyLat1gC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15710684497509909819&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

94674,Methodology for fire hazard indexing and ranking of materials with particular reference to needs of architects and construction engineers,2005,MP Singh and BB Lal and AA Ansari and NL Gowsami and R Kumar,30,Fire Engineer,2,19-24,Institution of Fire Engineers (India),Fire safety considerations for a building dictate use of those materials/products that have low fire hazard. In addition to functional suitability. fire hazard potential of a material/product too needs to be considered by architects and construction engineers. In this context. assessment of fire behaviour of building material/products is becoming increasingly important. To assess fire behaviour (or fire hazard potential). various fire tests are conducted. On the basis of fire test results/data. materials/products of lower fire hazard are identified. However. test results of different fire tests are expressed differently. This implies that there is ‘lack of uniformity’ in expression of test results/data. This non-uniformity in itself presents difficulty in understanding and application of test results. When two or more fire properties are to be simultaneously considered in hazard assessment. selection of relatively safer materials becomes quite difficult …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:Nw_I7GeUguwC,0,https://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:fe&volume=30&issue=2&article=005,,,,,0,0,0

The beneficial effects of surgical debridement are thought to be in part due to the transformation of a chronic wound to an acute wound. thereby allowing the inflammatory phase of acute wound healing to be reactivated. We tested the hypothesis that subcutaneous injection of the inducible isoform of the 70 kDa mammalian heat shock protein (iHSP70) will cause acute inflammatory swelling in an in vivo murine model. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Student’s t‐test and significance was accepted when p < 0.05.

94690,Study of prolactin gene polymorphism using PCR-RFLP and SSCP in different buffalo breeds of Gujarat,2004,Rakesh Kumar,,,,,,Prolactin (PRL) is one of the most versatile hormones of the pituitary gland in terms of its biological activities. More than 100 different and district effects of the hormone have been documented. Prolactin plays an important role in initiation and maintenance of lactation. It is also responsible for the synthesis of milk proteins. lactose and lipid components of milk in bovines and other mammalian species. The present study was undertaken with the objective to genotype three different buffalo breeds of Gujarat viz.. Surti. Mehsani and Jaffrabadi for PRL locus (exon 3) using Polymerase Chiain Reaction–Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) techniques. Bovine PRL gene specific primers. forward: 5’-CGA GTC CTT ATG AGC TTG ATT CTT–3’. reverse: 5’GCC TTC CAG AAG TCG TTT GTT TTC–3’. were used to amplify 156bp of the buffalo PRL gene homologues to the exon 3 of the bovine PRL covering 50 Surti. 30 Mehsani and 30 Jaffrabadi buffaloes by phenol: chloroform method. PCR volume of 25μl was subjected to 32 cycles each. comprising of 950C for 1 minute. 580C for 1 minute and 720C for 1 minute followed by 10 minutes of final extension at 720C. The amplified products (20μl) was digested with 10 units of RSA I restriction enzyme for 3 hrs at 370C and electrophoresed on 2% agarosegel for 1 hour. All the samples studied from the three breeds comprised of single fragment of 156 bp indicating the monomorphic nature. showing AA genotype of the locus.

Scanty work has been done on the effect of chemical fertilizer on avian hematology. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) is extensively used in agricultural and horticultural operations. The excessive use of this fertilizer causes environmental pollution. The DAP contaminated food in Indian myna Acridotheres tristis was found to cause gradual decrease in the number of erythrocytes and hemoglobin content. whereas the number of leucocytes increased upto 1000 ppm. Beyond this concentration of DAP a recovery trend was found in counting of blood corpuscles. The decrease in the number of RBC and decrease in the number of WBC was due to disturbance in neurotransmission.

IBO virus replicates leading to death of immature B-cells and eventually resulting into depletion of lymphoid follicles in BF. This is mainly responsible for immuno-suppression which isthe hall mark of IBO and makes the development of immuno-prophylaxis against IBO more challenging and the overall vaccination program in poultry ineffective.Generally the disease is controlled by passive transfer of antibodies to chicks from hens by vaccinating with killed vaccine followed by live vaccine starting around 2-3 weeks of age when maternal antibodies decline substantially.

MFI and FER) and mesoporous (MCM-41 and MCM-48) materials employing Keggin anions as novel promoters has been reported. The catalytic use of these promoters not only reduces the syntheses time by 3 to 4 folds but also produces uniform and very small (nanosized) crystallites of the materials. Various Keggin anions such as phosphomolybdate (PM). phosphotungstate (PW). molybdate (M) and tungstate (W) were used as promoting anions. The order of efficiency of different promoters in accelerating the nucleation/crystallization processes followed the order: PW≥PM>W≥M>>none. i.e.. no promoter. All the samples were characterized by powder XRD. porosity measurements. SEM. TEM and 29Si MAS NMR.

Some of the unique properties like high mechanical strength. low thermal conductivity. reduced shrinkage. chemical inertness makes this material highly potent as filler material for use in construction. This paper aims to evolute some of these properties and the potential use of the cenospheres. An attempt has been made to obtain cenosphere enriched floats from flyash. Physico-chemical and morphological characterizations have been carried out for each of the floats. The float obtained from the finest fraction (under pass of sieves of m.s 350) is recommended for use in the specialty construction materials as these floats have higher enrichment of cenospheres. low carbon content and high Al2O3/SiO2 content.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:J3KpcKIlIpsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6283421667039068562&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Among the DNA-binding drugs. polyamides. which are derived1 from natural product antibiotics such as netropsin and distamycin. represent a class of small molecules that can practically bind any predetermined DNA sequence. DNA recognition by these ligands depends on their sideby-side hydrogen bond pairings in the DNA minor groove. Extensive studies have revealed that these molecules show extremely high affinity for sequence-directed. minor groove interaction. Polyamides containing aromatic α-amino-acids. jV-methylpyrrole. and N-methylimidazole moieties have an affinity and specificity for DNA comparable with naturally occurring DNA-binding …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:dhpJJ7xvgBgC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8726095516303135886&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

In the olden days. the injured and sick were treated in the home set-up. Then. the natural calamities and wars made it expedient to bunch several of those. who were taken ill at the same time. This would have led to birth of hospital concept—a concept implying efficiency. appropriateness of the management. discipline and team work. Gradually. hospitals have got organised. backed by advancement in technology and specialised clinical diagnosis and surgery. Now they have become symbols of expertcare. especially for the high risk patients and the emergencies. It is possible to have a round. the clock close supervision of each patient. as also constant monitoring.There are social reasons also. which encourage hospitalization of the sick. ie. lack of space in modern flats. inadequate toilet facilities. all the family members going to work. lack of confidence to administer drugs and provide nursing care among the attendants at home etc. By tradition. we feel that a patient is safer. when admitted in a hospital then when he is taking treatment at home. even under medical supervision. But. the hospital treatment is impersonal. expensive and less cost effective. The hospitals eat away over 80 per cent of our health* Forn erly on the faculty of Post-Graduate Institute of Medical.

He has explained the little understood concepts of government failure. malaise of government monopoly and oppressive control of bureaucratic procedures and suggested innovative solutions like audit of economic laws (in. fact all laws need to be audited). creation of countervailing power-centres. etc.The basic problem is implementation of these ideas. It is naive to expect from the government of any day to bring about all these changes. The'huzur mai-baap'government of none of the states will bring about these changes as it involves dilution of the power of the government in general and lessening of the privileges of the vested interests who control. the,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:B71Od6CY_ssC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16788786887386056531&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The fibrotic reaction is the end result of the acute inflammatory response caused by significant tissue trauma at the time of biosensor placement in vivo and is probably associated with increased expression of cellular stress proteins acutely. We tested the hypothesis that subcutaneous injection of stress proteins will cause acute inflammatory swelling in a murine model in vivo. Comparisons between groups were preformed using the Student's t-test and significance accepted when p<0.05. Subcutaneous injection of stress proteins.

94778,Diagnosis of repeated failures in discrete event systems.,2002,HE Garcia and S Jiang and R Kumar,,,ANL/NT/CP-108625,,Argonne National Lab.(ANL). Argonne. IL (United States),We introduce the notion of repeated failure diagnosability for diagnosing the occurrence of a repeated number of failures in discrete event systems. This generalizes the earlier notion of diagnosability that was used to diagnose the occurrence of a failure. but from which the information regarding the multiplicity of the occurrence of the failure could not be obtained. It is possible that in some systems the same type of failure repeats a multiple number of times. It is desirable to have a diagnoser which not only diagnoses that such a failure has occurred but also determines the number of times the failure has occurred. To aide such analysis we introduce the notions of K-diagnosability (K failures diagnosability).[1. K]-diagnosability (1 through K failures diagnosability). and [1./spl infin/]-diagnosability (1 through/spl infin/failures diagnosability). Here the first notion is the weakest of all three. and the earlier notion of diagnosability is the same as that of K-diagnosability or that of [1. K]-diagnosability with K= 1. We give polynomial algorithms for checking these various notions of repeated failure diagnosability. and also present a procedure of polynomial complexity for the online diagnosis of repeated failures.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:TewouNez5YAC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/925041,,,,,0,0,0

94788,TRANSMISSION RULES & PRICING FOR A STATE-LEVEL TRANSMISSION NETWORK,2001,Rekha Jain,,,,,,BACKGROUNDThe electricity market has traditionally seen the development of its vital infrastructure under a natural monopoly. The idea. probably valid in its time. was that electrification was a strategic asset for an economy and the nature of electricity production made it economic to have one entity build the power plants and develop the network of wires. We did not want multiple sets of wires from different companies running down our streets. And the large investments in power plants would enjoy great economies if we could integrate their development with the expansion of the transmission network. In countries like the United States. vertically integrated monopolies were fostered under government regulation. In other countries. like England. the government took on direct responsibility for managing the electricity industry.The flip side however has been that the many years of protection and government regulation has resulted in large. sometimes bloated. slow-moving institutions that were hostile to innovation. As a result. in a country like England (where the government owned many of the companies). the new mantra became privatization and marketization under the Thatcher regime.

The consumption of water has been doubling every 21 years and seventy percent of all water used is utilized for irrigation though half of it only. reaches the crops. Coupled with increased demand from industry and urbanization. there is severe pressure on water now. As signs of ''water stress"" is becoming more pronounced. and issues relating to water are assuming political overtones. water has to be treated as an economic commodity and ways and means have to be found for increasing the performance of the irrigation systems. Among the various reasons for the non-performance or under-utilization of the created irrigation potential. non-participation of the beneficiaries and poor upkeep of the system by the administrative and development machinery of the government at the various levels. deserve special mention and attention. ""Participatory Irrigation Management"" (PIM). where the beneficiaries share responsibility in partnership with the governmental agencies bas now become indispensable for efficient running of a system.

Hence it is extremely important to study these latencies and processing overheads. In this document. we propose experimental approaches to measure join latencies on the IP Multicast Backbone. MBone. Using one approach. we measured join latencies at a receiver on the Mbone. We found that pruning was not taking place properly in the current MBone. We also found that existing IGMPv2 protocol fails to take into account all the interoperability scenarios with IGMPv1 protocol which might result in higher leave latencies. A solution to correct this problem is proposed which requires modifications to IGMPv2 protocol at the multicast router only.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:suENJ97mPqEC,0,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/897557,,,,,0,0,0

This device offers a well defined flow field and also permits visual observation of the dispersed drop movement. The dispersed drops coalesce with the disk for the systems where the dispersed phase wets the disk surface. The dispersed phase accumulate at the downstream end of the disk and they detach from there as blobs. Through an accurate measurement of accumulated dispersed phase volume. the coalescence rate was determined. The coalescence efficiency in the Hele Shaw cell is determined by dividing the coalescence rate by the undisturbed flow rate of the dispersed phase through an area equal to the projected area of the disk on a plane normal to the flow direction. The coalescence efficiency first increases and then decreases with the flow rate of dispersion. The coalescence rate/disk dimensions increases with the decrease in the disk dimensions. The rate of coalescence increases with the increase in the dispersed drop diameter and it decreases with the increase in the continuum phase viscosity. The presence of surfactants reduces the coalescence rate. All these results are quantitatively explained through a model. which takes into account several important features like various mechanism of drainage. the roles of dispersion and continuous phase viscosities. and the drop deformation.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:XWcFhoZvYIAC,0,https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130000020774/,,,,,0,0,0

Four policy scenarios. combining command and control measures-ie discharge standards-with market based instruments. such as pollution charges and intra-plant trades. are evaluated and ranked according to five criteria. Scenario rankings show that the performance of policy measures changes when qualitative assessments of administrative feasibility and public transparency are added to the more precise criteria of environmental efficiency. cost effectiveness and incentive provision. Assessments on the basis of the latter three give high grades to certain types of MBIs. whereas evaluations on political acceptability are not as favourable.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:bGIpCNGh66kC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=r_dTX6X67U4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:Go3fJQBPKmgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=xzOkTD8GZF&sig=svTud1DTiZSjk7F6qcyZGUbiQbk,,,,http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/other/WEBx0072xPA/manual_cdrom/CPlinks/pdfs/creed11e.pdf,0,0,0

The utility of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and classification of acute leukaemias is well established. This diagnostic utility relates primarily to two points : firstly the distinction between acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and secondly to subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Leukaemic cells were immunophenotyped using the alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase techniques. The monoclonal antibodies were very useful in distinguishing cases of acute myeloid leukaemia from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with CD10 positivity showed a better prognosis. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was uncommon and was associated with unfavourable prognosis.

The techniques considered have their own merits. However. these techniques are not a substitute for conventional methods of characterization. e.g.. wet chemical analysis. XRF. optical microscopy. etc. The techniques described are only complementary tools.

D.DegreeYear: 1992Institute: University of FloridaThe estimation of drag force exerted by fluid flow over a sphere is a fundamental problem and has received attention both for bounded and unbounded flow. An offshoot of this study on a sedimenting sphere in a cylindrical tube has provided an effective means to ascertain viscosity of fluids. However. low-drag measurement difficulties and other practical impediments had restricted the sedimentation study to the determination of liquid viscosity only. The current work incorporates an accurate microbalance to obtain the drag force exerted by gas flow over a suspended sphere. The drag measurements are carried out by an ultra precise thermal microbalance having a sensitivity of 0.1 microgram. The results obtained have been extended for viscosity measurements.

Canadian Black). Measurements of leaf water potential made by length change method Significantly correlated (r= 0.98) with those of pressure chamber method. It indicates that the length change method can be effectively employed to determine water potential with great precision where the pressure chamber apparatus is not avaUable. This method can also be used to determine relative water content at zero turgor and the bulk modulus of tissue waD elasticity. stress and correlates well with different plant functions and productivity in field crops (Yadav anti Singh. 1984). In some laboratories it is difficult to determine waterpotentiaJ in field crops owing to non-availability of instrument such as pressure chamber. A length change or strip method which do not involve the use of expensive instruments may be a good proposition for measuring leafwater potential. Bras sicajuncea (cv. Canadian Black) plants were used to study the utility of length change method and to compare it with pressure chamber method.The length change or strip method involves the use of solutions ofa solute which does not penetrate the protoplasm ofthe tissue used (Slatyer. 1958). Stripsofknown length cut from the tissue are floated on a range ofsolutions ofdilIerent solute potential values.

It has been estimated that 80 percent of cattle population are at risk from ticks and diseases transmitted by them (Snelson. 1975) and cause world economic loss of 7 billion US dollars annually in terms of decrease in milk and meat production. death of affected animal. damaged hides and the cost of tickicides (McCosker. 1979)For control of ticks. the most widely used approach is application of acaricides. But. large scale and indiscriminate use of chemicals has led to the emergence of resistance to conventional acaricides in various tick strains (Solomon. 1983; Nolan et al.. 1989). There are certain other limitations also of this approach like environmental pollution. toxicity and pesticide residual problem in animal products.

Since this area is surrounded by many tribal inhabitants and villagers. a good number of useful tree taxa have been indiscriminately exploited to improve their economy and livelihood. At many places the ecosystem is discontinuous and receeded to few pockets among the low lying hill masses. The following species have been enumerated in this area: Walsura trifoliata. Delbergia sissoo. Sapindus emarginatus. Tamarindus indica. Holoptelia integrifolia. Wrightia tinctoria. Dolichandrone falcatum. Elaeodendron glaucum. Hardwickia binata. Gyrocarpus americanus. Acacia arabica and Vitex leucoxylon. Most of the above species have been raised in the nurseries by seed Sowing.

The feasibility of faba bean sole cropping and intercropping system with chickpea in comparison with traditional rabi (winter season) legumes was compared under rainfed conditions. The soil was sandy loam in texture. low in available N (130 kg/ha). medium in available P (16.2 kg/ha). and high in K (304.5 kg/ha) with a pH value of 8.4. A basal dose of 100 kg diammonium phosphate (18: 46: 0) was placed below the seed at the time of sowing. Eleven treatments consisting of chickpea. peas. lentil. and linseed as sole as well as intercrop were replicated three times in a randomized block design. The results revealed that growing of faba bean as both sole crop and as intercrop in chickpea (2: 2) is a viable approach for sustainable productivity in terms of total grain yield and chickpea equivalent/ha. Although intercropping of faba bean with chickpea (2: 2) reduced the yield of chickpea by 51.4. the chickpea equivalent yield was higher in this combination than the yield of chickpea as a pure crop,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC,0,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QV9200204,,,,,0,0,0

It is well known that for sufficiently large values of n (notation: n» 0) 1. 2 (Qlqn+ 1). the length of the Q-module Q/q n+ 1 is a uniquely determined polynomial of degree d. called the Hilbert polynomial and is given by n+(n+ d—lQ (Qlqn+ 1)= e0 (d— e l (\—1)+(-1) ded where the integers e „. e l. ed depend on q and are known as normalized Hilbert coefficients. ei is sometimes written as ei (q) to emphasize its dependence on q. It is easily seen that e. is positive. In case Q is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. Northcott [2] showed that e l is non-negative and Narita [1] showed that in this case e2 is non-negative as well. Narita gave an example of a Cohen-Macaulay ring and an m-primary ideal q such that e3 (q) is negative.

The effects of various deployment schemes as well as out-of-plane librations on tethered payload raising are systematically studied. Equations of motion have been obtained for a general two-body dumb-bell tethered system in an elliptic orbit executing the three-dimensional librational motion. This analysis accounts for the tether mass as well. Contrary to the observations made by Kyroudis and Conway. an increase in deployment rate does not lead to a monotonic increase in apogee altitude of the payload at release. Typical plots of the altitude gain vs deployment rate are presented showing widely differing and separated'peaks' and'valleys'. These could be used to select the optimum deployment scheme for raising payloads to higher altitudes.

95012,Early Detection of ras Oncogenes Activated by Chemical Carcinogentreatment,1989,R Kumar and S Sukumar and M Barbacid,,,,19-22,Springer. Boston. MA,Molecular analysis of H-ras oncogenes induced by a single dose of nitrosomethylurea (NMU) in pubescent rats revealed their consistent activation by G→A transitions. the type of mutation preferentially induced by NMU. These results suggested that NMU is directly responsible for the malignant activation of ras oncogenes during initiation of carcinogenesis. We have now modified this experimental system to examine’ the precise mechanisms by which ras oncogenes contribute to carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that although ras oncogenes may become activated during the carcinogenic insult. they require specific cooperation with normal developmental programs to exert their carcinogenic properties. Definitive demonstration of this hypothesis requires identification of activated ras oncogenes in the putative target cells prior to the manifestation of the neoplastic phenotype.

Maternal hypothyroidism resulted impaired reproduction and intrauterine growth retardation of offsprings as revealed by their reduced body weight. heart weight. body length and tail length. Offsprings born to hypothyroid mothers showed very high rate of mortality and none of them survived beyond eight days.. Maternal hyperthyrodism did not cause any abnormality on reproduction. Hyperthyroid mothers showed increased rate in body weight gain during pregnancy which was associated with increased weight of body and heart of fetuses born to hyperthyroid mothers. Plasma thyroxine was not measurable in fetus from hypothyroid mothers till 21st day of gestation.

95015,ZEOLITE BETA: A SUITABLE CATALYST FOR ISOMERIZATION AND HYDROCRACKING OF LONG CHAIN n-ALKANES,1989,S ERNST and R KUMAR and J WEITKAMP,,"Catalysis, Concepts and Applications: Proceedings of the Ninth National Symposium on Catalysis, December 15-17, 1988",,75,TATA McGraw-Hill Publishing Company,Zeolite Beta was synthesized. brought into a bifunctional form and tested as a catalyst in isomerization and hydrocracking of selected long chain n-alkanes. The product distributions (as exemplified with n-undecane as feed) exhibit some similarities with those obtained earlier on bifunctional Y-type zeolites. However. considerably higher yields of feed isomers could be obtained with 0. 27 wt.-% Pd/HBeta. Therefore. this catalyst seems to be well suited for improving the low temperature properties of distillates by isomerization of the waxy components. Results of supplementary catalytic experiments involving the comparative conversion of four Cg-alkanes with different degrees of branching strongly suggest that hydrocracking in zeolite Beta proceeds ma inly via the energetically most favorable type A B-scissions. Since they start from bulky intermediates. it can be concluded that the suppression of hydrocracking reactions in zeolite Beta is not due to shape selectivity effects.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=855305528497868882&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

95041,A New Method For Designing The Parallel Square Hole Gamma Camera Collimator,1986,Rajendra Kumar and GS Pant,11,Journal of Medical Physics,3,285,Medknow Publications,It has been observed by one of us that the detection of a cold lesion of a given size is easier if it is located in larger organ (with radioactive distribution) than in a smaller organ provided the contrast is high enough. This type of dependence of detect ability of cold lesion has not been incorporated in the design of gamma camera collimator. In this paper we have attempted to develop the theory for designing the parallel square whole gamma camera collimator. The method takes into account the size of the cold area and of the surrounding hot area in the organ. The associated problems in the design have been discussed and usefulness of an image processing device; so-called collywobbler has been investigated.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:pqgf-8x9CmQC,0,https://www.jmp.org.in/article.asp?issn=0971-6203;year=1986;volume=11;issue=3;spage=285;epage=285;aulast=Kumar;type=0,,,,,0,0,0

95043,Design and construction of gates for small scale hydropower.,1986,G Chauhan and A Kumar and PK Jain,,,,,,Design and construction of gates for small scale hydro power projects (SHP) warrant a departure from conventional approach used for large hydro power projects. While fail-safe operation of the gates is vital for successful functioning of both. the large as well as small hydro power projects. there is a wide difference in terms of cost of gates when expressed as a percentage of total project cost. The cost of gates constitute a low percentage of total project cost in large hydro power projects and the emphasis has been on safe and proper functioning of the gates with little attention to their cost. In SHP. however. the gates constitute a relatively higher percentage of total project cost and hence their design and construction has to be low in cost commensurate with safety and functional requirements.

The results have been analysed using the most commonly used parametric methods. This revealed that the expected life calculated on the basis of the lower cut off point. representing a confidence level of 97.5%. does not agree well with the extent of service exposure of the respective tubes. However. their predicted 100 000 h rupture strength does show a definite trend with the length of service. though the expected lives were in the range of 50 000-100 000 h. Microstructural examinatoin did not show any significant accumulation of creep damage. As 100 000 h rupture strength was significantly higher than the design requirement of 45 MPa. it was concluded that these were fit for further use. 5 ref.--AA,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:dBzKUGQurMsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2817855590473650497&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

95080,EVALUATION OF VARIOUS LABORATORY TECHNIQUES USED FOR RABIES DIAGNOSIS,1983,Ram Kumar and ML Mehrotra,7,Indian Journal of Veterinary Pathology,,82-84,Indian Association of Veterinary Pathologists.,The diagnosis of rabies is of paramount importance. Various methods viz. Seller's rapid staining. histopathology. fluorescent antibody (FA) technique and biological test in laboratory animals are advocated for its diagnosis (2). Most of the laboratories commonly practise first two procedures due to limited laboratory facilities and non-availability of suitable materials (3. 4). In the present communication. all the four methods were attempted and assessed for precise and quick diagnosis of rabies. These techniques were taken up according to the avaijable materials from field. Most of the time complete materials for all the 4 tests were not available.Thirty six specimens of different species of animals from different parts of the country formed the materials of this study. Heads of 23 cases suspected for rabies were received. while 2 specimens in 10 per cent formalin and 5 in 50 per cent buffered glycerine were obtained for histopathological examina-tion and biological test. respectively. When the heads of suspected cases were received. two to three impression smears were prepared from hippocampus. cerebellum and medulla. Impression smears were stained with Seller's stain (5).

Idaho Falls (USA),It is a concern in the current safety analysis of nuclear reactors to understand the different release mechanisms of fission products to accurately determine the radiological source term for a wide variety of accidents. The mechanism which is least understood and which produces an uncertainty in determining the radiological source term during a reactor accident is the early release of fission gas present in the fuel-cladding gap through a cladding breach. In a loss-of-coolant type accident the fuel rods would be surrounded mainly by steam. therefore. the release of the gap gas can simply be treated as a discharge problem through an orifice. However. during reactor normal operation or in those accidents where the failed fuel rods are surrounded by liquid coolant. the release process of the gap gas would be strongly influenced by the coolant conditions (pressure. temperature and flow rate). The purpose of this work is to describe analytically the prompt escape of volatiles and gaseous fission products. present in the fuel-cladding gap through a cladding breach. where the fuel rod is surrounded by liquid coolant.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:urP0JZOBBUsC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5235986,,,,,0,0,0

Presently. we are considering E r interaction studies. because the identification of levels in the spectra of Kramer's ions is relatively easier and the analysis becomes simpler. if JJ mixing is small which is if the spin-orbit coupling constant is large. As such Er3+ enjoys an important position as the rare-earth probe for detailed crystalline studies.

Forty healthy individuals and 70 psychiatric patients aged 25 to 45 years without previous history of TAB inoculation or enteric fever during last one year and serum negative for S. typhi and S. paratyphi (A & B) antibodies (titre< 40) were selected. Group of 40 healthy individuals served as control. The psychiatric patients were started on chlorpromazine 2.5 mg three times a day orally. On 7th day 1 ml of formalised TAB vaccine (Glaxo) was injected subcutaneously. Blood was with-drawn on 15th and 30th days of inoculation and serum was tested for antibody titre by agglutination. The antibody titre was significantly lower in the chlorpromazine treated group against TO and TH on 15th day and against PA (H) and PB (H) also on 30th day. The parallel shift of the curves in the treated group as compared to the control suggests that only one mechanism is likely to be responsible for the reduction in antibody titre.

The Al--1.25% Mn alloy produced by D.C. casting technique has a tendency to develop coarse grain size during recrystallization annealing of the cold rolled sheet. The roles of matrix supersaturation and dispersed precipitates on the recrystallization grain size are briefly discussed. The coarse precipitate particles by their effect on deformation substructure accelerate recrystallization. Precipitation from the supersaturated solid solution results in a fine dispersion of particles which hinder recrystallization. The effect of processing variables like composition. homogenization and rate of heating to recrystallization temperature on the recrystallized grain size are briefly described. 30 ref.--AA.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:QuPaituDtm8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7357635060173160076&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Mo. W. V. Nb etc. individually or in suitable combination. have been used. The choice of blading materials is to a large extent a function of design considerations. The grades used in different stages of steam turbine of a given capacity vary between different manufacturers. as is true with the three BHEL Units in India. Rationalization of blading materials both for HP and LP stages can lead to considerable saving on their development and testing cost. With this object in mind. a detailed and comparative study has been carried out of available grades of blading materials. The inter-relationships between chemical compositions. heat treatment. microstructure and their influence on long-term creep-rupture behaviour have been discussed in the light of the desired properties from design view points and service conditions.

95166,WooL ProdUCed IN INdIA,,DB Shakyawar and VV Kadam and Kumar Ajay,,,,40,,Wool. Nature’s gift to sheep. enjoys the status of being luxury fibre! The luxuriousness is owing to higher cost. ecofriedliness and inherent smart nature of the fibre. The cost of the fiber is largely influenced by its grade. The fibre grade is a numerical designation of wool fineness based on the average fiber diameter and variation of fiber diameter. It does not include characteristics such as length. crimp. strength. elasticity. luster. hand. and color--all of which affect on what is known as quality of either fibre. yarn or fabric (USDA. 1968). Wool produced all over the world is mainly grouped into three grades according to the end use viz. Apparel. carpet and coarse grade wool. The wools of below 25 microns diameter are known as apparel wool. wools of 25-35 micron are classified as medium or carpet grade wool and wools of more than 35 micron diameter are categorized as coarse wool (Karim SA. 2009).Indian wool quality varies with different agro-ecological regions. The north temperate region produces fine wool with lower medullation and higher staple length. The northwestern semi-arid and arid region produces carpet grade wool. Most of the wools in this region are of coarse grade with fibre diameter more than 35 microns. However. Bharat merino is the finest quality of wool produced in the Kodaikannal hills of the south peninsular region and the Kolar region of Karnataka. The wool quality is also largely depends upon climatic conditions and sheep breed. India has vast genetic resources in sheep.

High fat content along with highly active lipases causes hydrolysis of fat into fatty acids. It contains 74% unsaturated fatty acids like oleic (C18: 1). linoleic (C18: 2). and linolenic (C18: 3). The lipase (triacylglycerol acyl hydrolase. EC 3.1. 1.3) enzyme is accumulated in the pericarp. aleurone layer and germ. This enzyme is responsible for stepwise hydrolysis of the triacyl glycerol into diacyl glycerol. monoacylglycerol. glycerol and short chain free fatty acids. Unsaturated fatty acids undergoes to oxidation in the presence of oxygen and moisture. resulting in development of undesired off odour. Pearl millet is also reported to contain oxidative enzyme such as peroxidase (Reddy et al.. 1986) and enzymatic browning. catalysed by enzyme such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO). both of which play important role in pearl millet flour quality deterioration. Hence. there are two type of rancidity mechanisms contribute to the development of off odour in pearl millet flour. First is enzymatic rancidity caused by lipase enzyme which results the release of free fatty acids. which further converted into phenolic aglycones. causes the generation of mousy odour. Poly phenol oxidase causes enzymatic browning. which results the generation of bitter compounds. Second mechanism is oxidative rancidity. caused by the lipoxygenase activity on free fatty acids and converted into hydro-peroxides and further through peroxidase activity. into aldehyde. ketones. polymers of peroxides etc. which is responsible for off odour development …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:_hb0F9yZ3cgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ranjeet_Kumar38/publication/328464715_Biochemistry_of_Food_Crops_From_Omics_Studies_to_Nutrient_Analysis/links/5bcf54034585152b144fa3da/Biochemistry-of-Food-Crops-From-Omics-Studies-to-Nutrient-Analysis.pdf#page=68,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ranjeet_Kumar38/publication/328464715_Biochemistry_of_Food_Crops_From_Omics_Studies_to_Nutrient_Analysis/links/5bcf54034585152b144fa3da/Biochemistry-of-Food-Crops-From-Omics-Studies-to-Nutrient-Analysis.pdf#page=68,0,0,0
95169,ANFIS based Automated System for the Detection of Gadolinium Lesions in Brain MRI,,Rajesh Kumar and A Sivasankar,,,,,,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects different parts of the central nervous system at different points of time. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. MS is an auto-immune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by the presence of Gadolinium lesions. In this paper. an intelligent technique is proposed for the automatic segmentation of Gadolinium lesions from the brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of MS patients. Since. manual interpretation of the lesions based on visual examination by radiologist/physician may lead to erroneous diagnosis when a large number of MRIs are analyzed; we propose an automated intelligent classification system. The proposed technique uses a trained classifier. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) to discriminate between the regions of MS lesions and non-MS lesion regions mainly based on the textural features. The proposed method consists of three stages. namely. preprocessing. feature extraction and classification. The classifier’s goal is to classify subjects as normal and abnormal brain MRI. The main contribution of the proposed technique described in this paper is the use of textural features like Gray level cooccurrence features. Local binary pattern features. Gray level based features. Histogram and Wavelet features to detect Gadolinium lesions in a fully automated approach that does not rely on manually delineating the lesions. The obtained results exhibit a sensitivity of 72% and maximum accuracy of 99% which assures that the proposed method would be viable for use in clinical practice for the detection of Gadolinium lesions …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:sFh2DmJudxsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17922786203219055795&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

95176,Time based Synchronous Global State Determination Algorithm for MDSs,,Raman Kumar and Parveen Kumar,,,,,,Two checkpointing approaches ie. coordinated checkpointing and times based checkpointing are widely used in the literature of MDSs. Coordinated checkpointing protocols uses the less checkpoints and domino free but have large coordinated message overheads as processes synchronize by exchanging coordinated message. However. time based protocol requires every process to take checkpoint during checkpointing. Some of the time based protocols defines the timeout period tp. When this timeouts occur. processes take their checkpoint. If the checkpointing interval is too small then multiple checkpoints are transferred from MHs to MSS through wireless link and also checkpointing takes some time to save the application state. This approach increases the checkpointing overheads. On the other hand. if checkpointing interval is too large this may leads to large amount of computational loss during rollback and recovery. As a result time based approach has minimum coordinated messages overheads cost but has high checkpointing cost as it requires large number checkpoints than minimum but coordinated checkpointing approach have minimum checkpointing cost than time based approach but higher coordinated message overheads cost. In this paper. we design an efficient coordinated checkpointing protocol which uses time to indirectly coordinate to minimize the number of coordinated message transmitted through the wireless link and reduces the number of checkpoints nearest to the minimum. The algorithm is non-blocking and minimum process.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:mVcUxdmZzz4C,0,http://csjournals.com/IJITKM/PDF%209-1/3.%20Raman.pdf,,,,http://csjournals.com/IJITKM/PDF%209-1/3.%20Raman.pdf,0,0,0

In experimental psychology and physiology. the word haptic refers to the sense of touch. So apart of senses like vision and audio one can feel the “sense of touch” of things that are created in the virtual world. Haptic may imply haptic communication. haptic perception and haptic technology. Haptic communication is the way of response given by humans and other animals via touching. Haptic perception is the process of recognizing objects through touch. Haptic technology refers to tactile feedback. which means it provides feedback in the form of touch so one can feel the physical properties and movements of virtual objects created by computer.

There is also a significant upward shift in the trend in agricultural land-prices during the"" green revolution” period. The main shift in the trend has occurred during the mature phase of green revolution. that is. during 1977-78 to 1992-93. The land market activity. as reflected in number of land transactions and the total area transferred via land market. is also found to be expanding. Number of transactions and area purchased show an upward trend during the four decade period of 1953-54 to 1992-93. The impact of green revolution has been to increase the demand for land holdings by the peasants. irrespective of a boom in the land prices. However. the negative growth in average size of transaction during the entire study period alludes to a tendency of “controlled-expansion” in the land market activity. Finally. the implications of upward trend in agricultural land purchases are suggested.

They are stimulated by external impulses such as television advertisements. radio. friends and many others. Apart from this first stage. customers go through two other stages known as the Black box stage and the purchasing stage. The second stage is usually difficult for managers to monitor but it is the crucial stage for the customer as he gathers information concerning the product or the service. Some customers widen the scope of information search because they want to eliminate greater percentage of risk associated with the purchase. After this stage. the customer is then expected to move to the last stage. ie to purchase the product. In between the information searching stage and the last stage. customers can change their minds and even purchase the same product from another company who did not create the stimulus. The research indicated that about 62% of 300 customers observed were not likely to return to purchase. It also revealed that 69% of that sample did not give any assurance of returning for further transactions and 66% made it clear that they were still searching for more information before they could purchase. Since the entrepreneurs had already invested in stimulating them. some strategies have been proposed to assist them in directing the focus of their customers.

Aldrich) powder at 750 C for 9 hrs hours in programmable temperature controlled furnace. The gross structure and phase purity of the powder sample ground from sintered pellets were examined by powder X-ray diffraction technique. The phase identification/gross structural characteristics of synthesized SnO2 materials explored through powder X-ray diffracto meter reveals that the sample crystallize in tetragonal structure with lattice parameters a= b= 4.7346 Å. c= 3.1787 Å. The surface morphology investigated through scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy (SEM & AFM) results that pure SnO2 possesses uniform grains and is almost homogeneously distributed. which indicates the high packing density of the materials and nano spheres like structures on the surface of SnO2sample.

The key to assist managements to plan effectively lies in better and greater use of computerised corporate planning models. System Dynamics is one of the latest modelling innovations that provides a flexible framework in which to view the interdependent operations of a system in coherent and orderly manner. With this in view a modular approach using System Dynamics principles has been adopted to model an integrated steel plant. The model so developed has been applied to conduct simulation experiments in the area of corporate planning.

Many new techniques and technologies are developed to protect things and to stop the crimes. Forensics Science has gained much attention of users and researchers in last few years. Forensics deals with after crime data and the application of scientific principles to analyze data collected by law enforcement agencies. Biometrics in general means the statistical study of biological phenomena. This is usually associates with the use of unique physiological characteristics of a person to identify an individual. Face recognition refers to an automated or semiautomated process of matching facial images with collected face data. In many cases when other forensics evidence are not available. constructing a face sketch is the last resort to solve a crime. The major challenge of sketch based photo retrieval is matching images of different modalities which referred as “modality gap”. The face recognition system based on face descriptors first partitions sketch and face images in to N slices. It then computes image descriptor.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:IjbvboqL_eAC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/33616507/ncst162.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33616507/ncst162.pdf,0,0,0

The five synchronous separate geopolitical grids. which developed independently. have been integrated gradually. In August 2006. the 25 GW Northern grid was synchronised to the “North East-East-West” grid to form the North East--East-West grid now designated as the “NEW grid” having installed capacity of around 90 GW (peak 60 GW). The 25 GW South India grid (installed capacity of over 36 GW). is presently connected asynchronously to the NEW-grid through 4 GW of HVDC links Fig-1.The power system in India is operated on a regional basis through its regional control centres that are equipped with conventional SCADA/EMS system. With the above developments. there has been a paradigm shift in power system operation in India. Knowledge of the “neighbouring system” became as important as the knowledge of the host region for real-time security assessment and monitoring of the integrated system. However as the National control centre is yet to be commissioned. the real-time data exchange between the regional control centres is extremely limited.

The quality of the fingerprint images greatly affects the performance of the minutiae extraction. The fingerprints obtained from the crime scenes are of very bad quality because these are left unintentionally. Such fingerprints are called latent fingerprints. This paper investigates the major challenges in latent fingerprint recognition obtained from a crime scene. Poor quality fingerprint images lead to missing and spurious minutiae that degrade the performance of fingerprint matching system. The importance of image processing concepts cannot be ruled out to make a biometric method robust. However. the performance of a minutiae extraction algorithm relies heavily on the quality of the input fingerprint images. Some special treatment is done to reveal such fingerprints.

Live video streaming without delay is a reality now. However. the available bandwidth has to be allocated optimally when video streaming takes place over a multicast network. This is because users have different requirement with respect to bandwidth. Moreover. the users may need streaming to their mobile devices. PCs or high–definition TV. In order to allocate bandwidth based on user requirement. the users can be grouped into various categories. This will facilitate to manage bandwidth allocation easily. This is achieved using MDC (Multiple Description Coding) in which video source is associated with various descriptions and the receivers are associated with one of the descriptions. This will automate the process of allocating different bandwidth to different users while the same video is being streamed. However allocating optimal bandwidth is a challenging task that needs research. In this Paper we consider this as an optimization problem. The aim is to maximize user bandwidth experience and satisfaction by improving coding efficiency pertaining to MDC. We developed an algorithm to achieve this. The simulation results of our algorithm reveal that it improves user satisfaction significantly.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:oyQIn_cjXD4C,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.4940&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.4940&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Specifically. we show that if the unmodeled dynamics are small in some sense. then all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. Forther. we show that robust performance is achieved in the sense that the mean-square tracking error converges to zero linearly with the un-modeled dynamics. In the absence of nnmodeled dynamics. we show that the tracking error asymptotically goes to zero. The adaptation law considered is the usual gradient update law with projection. This shows that modifications such as normalization or relative dead-zones are not necessary to achieve stability in the presence of unmodeled dynamics.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:HWVPSj4JXeEC,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4174346/,,,,,0,0,0
95218,PERCEPTIVE APPROACH FOR ROUTE OPTIMIZATION IN MOBILE IP,,Sumit Kumar and Anil Kumar and Vinay Kumar Nigam and Rakesh Kumar,,,,,,The recent advances in wireless communication technology and the unprecedented growth of the Internet have paved the way for wireless networking and IP mobility. Mobile Internet protocol [1. 2] has been designed within the IETF to support the mobility [2] of users who wish to connect to the internet and maintain communications as they move from place to place. Mobile IPV6 allows a mobile node to talk directly to its peers while retaining the ability to move around and change the currently used IP addresses. This mode of operation is called Route Optimization [7. 10]. In this approach. the correspondent node learns a binding between the Mobile nodes permanent home address and its current temporary care-of-address. This introduces several security vulnerabilities to Mobile IP. among them the most important one is the authentication and authorization of binding updates. This paper describes the Route optimization by the introduction of mobility. In this paper. we proposed a new efficient technique for route optimization in mobile IP for smoothly communication while MN moving from one network domain to other without losing the connection. Our technique will also be improve the path in intra-network communication [9].,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:qS3OQCqhxh0C,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e50a/b287bb578f468d1402041fccf7392b0c4dc0.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e50a/b287bb578f468d1402041fccf7392b0c4dc0.pdf,0,0,0

Further the presence of wad in the wound adds to the confusion that the firing would have occurred within a distance of 5.0 meters. Conclusion: This case report reiterates the importance of examination of the crime weapon. test firing the similar cartridges with the same weapon and proper analysis of the wound ballistics is a must for a forensic expert to arrive at a proper opinion in fire arm injury cases.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:Kr09a2QcR50C,0,https://journals.sbmu.ac.ir/ijmtfm/article/view/2965,,,,https://journals.sbmu.ac.ir/ijmtfm/article/download/2965/2916,0,0,0
95222,Adaptive Block Pinning for Multi-core Architectures,,Rakesh Kumar and Nitin Chaturvedi and TSB Sudarshan,,,,,,Difference between speed of processor and memory is increasing with advent of every new technology. Chip Multi Processors (CMP) have further increased the load on the memory hierarchy. So it has become important to manage on-chip memory judiciously to reduce average memory access time. The previous research has shown that it is better to have a shared cache at the last level of on-chip memory hierarchy. Sharing last level of cache gives rise to a new category of cache misses; those were not present in uniprocessor. called “inter-processor misses”. This paper proposes a technique to eliminate inter-processor misses by giving replacement ownership of a block to a processor who brought it into the cache. This reduction in interprocessor misses. which constitutes 40% of over all misses. will result in performance improvement. Also two different ways of relinquishing the ownership of a block are being proposed. so that if some other processor. other than owner. can make use of the block in a more efficient way. ownership will be transferred to the new processor.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:FIkAGs9z2eEC,0,http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/24527495/1569155061.pdf,,,,http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/24527495/1569155061.pdf,0,0,0

The approach was in line with that described in A Modern Regional Policy for the United Kingdom (HM Treasury. 2003) 1. Since there is a disparity in progress among different regions. there are a number of different ways in which regional development problems can be conceptualized but in its National Strategic Framework the UK Government argued that the less-well off regions were growing too slowly relative to the more prosperous regions. The causes of their relatively poor growth were identified as a lack of relative competitiveness. That means that many regions lack productivity in terms economy and they are not self sustained but depend heavily on public funding.To enhance their competitiveness requires measures to enhance the growth of their productivity and to increase their ability to use their labour more effectively (as measured by their employment rate). It is generally recognized that the ability of regions to grow is influenced by their economic structure and the quality of their resource base. Across the United Kingdom. some regions have found it hard to shake-off the legacy of the past and secure higher value added sectors to replace their declining industrial sectors. An inability to secure new investment from the private sector has often meant that the less prosperous regions have become relatively heavily dependent on the public sector for income and jobs. a factor to which we return below.

To find out the reasons of failure. a systematic comparative study was conducted using as supplied and failed samples. PoDFA analysis and chemistry of the supplied material showed no significant reason for failure. On the other hand. macro and microstructural analysis of the samples revealed interesting observations like rosette formation. grain boundary melting. eutectic and script like structures in the preheated billet samples.

RNA is quite similar to DNA but differs on the parameters of being single stranded. harboring a ribose sugar and thymine being replaced by uracil. DNA undergoes transcription to yield RNA the process mediated by RNA polymerases which is further translated to yield the building blocks of life-proteins. A fine orchestra of RNA and protein assembly is involved to produce life’s key molecular machine. ribosomes the site for protein synthesis. which is nature’s marvelous ergonomic design. Diversity exists in forms. structure and function of RNA and their crucial role in fine tuning and regulating intricate gene expression and being the genome material of viruses has evoked great interest globally to unveil these molecules. Thus RNA biology takes centre stage of today’s therapeutic scenario.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:bKwnt0rjkrwC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/RANJEET_KUMAR/publication/202475194_RNA_Therapeutics_Silencing_the_Culprit/links/0a9b2ae9c364e055abcfd66d.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/RANJEET_KUMAR/publication/202475194_RNA_Therapeutics_Silencing_the_Culprit/links/0a9b2ae9c364e055abcfd66d.pdf,0,0,0

According to the survey. few years ago there were 10 million online databases but from the recent survey. now a days there are 30 million online database and the number is increasing day by day due to the revolution of technology in all the fields. Obviously. extracting the exact data is very hard. Already there are number of approaches which has been implemented but they generally filter the blocks after then they cluster. align and then extract the data but during this process. it is not guaranteed that we will get exact data.This Apotheosis Extraction Approach which is a fully experimented over number of online databases. automatically detect the schema of html. dhtml. jsp and all the webpages including scripting webpage. in this approach. when any query is submitted to web page then first of all. it form a tree in which all the part of html. dhtml. jsp is identified internally and it differentiate by positional. layout. appearance and content features after then clustering and regrouping of data. alignment of data is done. Sometimes we are able to get records but not items of data.

The cornerstone of management of meningitis in children depends on the rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment. The differential diagnosis of meningitis in children has been reported to be difficult due to various non-specific clinical features. Several techniques are currently in use. but none of them is foolproof. The analysis of CSF is often crucial for the diagnosis of neurological disorders as the chemical components of CSF reflect the state of the CNS in healthy and diseased state1. The potential advantages of NMR and the persistent problems regarding the timely diagnosis of childhood meningitis have prompted us to explore 1H NMR spectroscopy as a diagnostic utility based on the analysis of CSF from 191 cases to bring out an additional diagnostic tool involving the quantitative NMR information and the routine clinical symptoms features of patients in the form of an expert system MENEXSYS.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:Uo5fLKClJkAC,0,https://cds.ismrm.org/ismrm-2005/Files/02771.pdf,,,,https://cds.ismrm.org/ismrm-2005/Files/02771.pdf,0,0,0

95248,Efficient Tracking of Public Transport in Urban Environment,,Rohit Kumar,,,,,,Good public transport is an important requirement for smooth working of an economy. It not only reduces the traffic on the road leading to free flow of goods and services. it also reduces the oil dependence of the country and improves the environment conditions. The government of various countries is encouraging people to use public transport by infusing more capital for its development and making it more user friendly. Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) is one such effort wherein a rider is provided with accurate real-time information which reduces their wait times [1].[2]. In this PhD we aim to abstract the transportation problem with new models and develop a framework for reducing communication cost. Reducing cost is really important for implementation of ATIS in case of countries (especially developing economies like India where there is major rise in the middle-class population and is adding a lot of cars on road every day) which have a business model that is different from the one used in US and the user (transit authority) is charged every time it tries to connect to the server. ATIS provide real-time transit information concerning location of vehicles and estimated arrival times (ETA)[3]. Such information is based on the state estimate of the vehicles from on-board sensors. and models of vehicle motion through traffic. In the first part of this PhD. we propose new models and algorithms to track public transit in urban environment. The new models incorporate side information such as average speed on a segment of road. quality of GPS estimation. desired path and road inter-connectivity.

Total 80 beneficiary and 80 non-beneficiary farmers were selected from two panchayat samities of identified district. Data were collected by personal interview technique from selected respondents. The study revealed that the 77.50 per cent beneficiary farmers and only 15.00 per cent non-beneficiary farmers had high economic benefits level ie more than Rs. 55362/year and 6.25 per cent beneficiary farmers and 36.25 per cent non-beneficiary farmers obtained economic benefits from wheat crop upto Rs. 22525/year. Whereas. 16.25 per cent farmers and 48.75 per cent non-beneficiary farmers were getting income from Rs. 22525 to 55362/year due to wheat cultivation. Further. there was significant difference in level of economic benefits between beneficiary and non-beneficiary farmers from wheat cultivation. This significant difference was due to the fact that beneficiary farmers adopted the wheat interventions introduced under National Food Security Mission.

Successful solutions should exploit grid and information system domain contexts so that security postures of the grid can adapt to the situational awareness based on near real time security state and events of power and information systems. Security analysis and control systems should also leverage the interplay of security. reliability and stability in the smart grid through unified vulnerability models and threat analyses for the OT and IT domains.We present essential characteristics and properties for Interoperating Smart Grid Cyber Security Systems that are functionally pervasive. topologically distributive yet flexible in supporting traditional and emerging smart grid characteristics (eg. distributed renewables integration. pervasive monitoring and control for automated decision intelligence). Such systems need to balance the challenges of different security postures that the OT system warrants where availability and data integrity is paramount vis-à-vis the IT system where confidentiality takes priority.

Copper and low-κ dielectric materials are used to improve electrical performance of interconnects for integrated circuits. At radio and microwave frequencies. the signal propagation behaviour of on-chip interconnects are complex to analyze and predict especially for lossy lowresistivity silicon substrates. Interconnects behave as transmission lines. and signal delay. transients. crosstalk and power dissipation become critical. In addition. integration of mesoporous dielectrics and scaling of feature size has made the patterning and processing of damascene interconnects far more challenging than initially anticipated.

Enalapril maleate loaded microspheres were prepared by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method using ethanol/liquid paraffin system. The resultant microspheres were evaluated for average particle size. drug loading. in vitro drug release and release kinetics. FTIR spectrometry. scanning electron microscopy. differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray powder diffraction studies were used to investigate the physical state of the drug in the microspheres. The mean particle size of the microspheres was influenced by varying drug: polymer ratio and emulsifier concentration while drug loading was dependent on drug: polymer ratio. The results of FTIR spectrometry. differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffraction studies indicated stable character of Enalapril maleate in drug-loaded microspheres and also revealed absence of drugpolymer interaction. The drug release profiles of the microspheres at pH 1.2 showed poor drug release characteristics while at pH 6.8. drug release was extended over a period of 8 h; release was influenced by polymer concentration and particle size. Drug release followed the Higuchi model.

Clustering and Generalized Measures of Fuzzy Informationquot. is to study fuzzy regression. fuzzy clustering with application. to characterize new measures of fuzzy information and to study their various generalizations. Fuzzy set theory has capability to describe the uncertain situations which contain ambiguity and vagueness. Fuzziness is sometimes found in some decisions. in our thoughts and in the way of processing the information.  newlineAs probabilistic  entropyquot measures uncertain degree of the randomness in a probability distribution. Fuzzy entropy measures fuzziness of a set which arises from the intrinsic ambiguity or vagueness carried by the fuzzy set. The entropy of a fuzzy event is different from the classical Shannon entropy. as no probabilistic concept is needed in order to define it. We should note that fuzzy entropy deals with vague and ambiguous uncertainties. while Shannon entropy deals with probabilistic uncertainties. There are number of measures of fuzzy entropy corresponding to the various probabilistic entropy measures have been proposed and studied in literature. newline             newline,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:M7C5BM2v8n8C,0,https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/11094,,,,,0,0,0

Recent efforts have been directed towards understanding why such therapies demonstrate very little anti-tumor activity for certain cancers. A class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER) is unexpectedly inefficient in some cancers. A mathematical model for use in the study and treatment of cancers is described for the HER signaling pathway that agrees with the existing data over large time intervals.

These results suggested that NMU is. directly responsible for the malignant activation of ras oncogenes during initiation of carcinogenesis. We have now modified this experimental system to examine'the precise mechanisms by which ras oncogenes contribute to carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that although ras oncogenes may become activated during the carcinogenic insult. they require specific cooperation with normal developmental programs to exert their carcinogenic properties. Definitive demonstration of this hypothesis requires identification of activated ras oncogenes in the putative target cells prior to the manifestation of the neoplastic phenotype.

Nevertheless it is clear that in many countries coverage rates remain inadequate and there continue to be inequities based on poverty and income levels. gender. geographical location and culture. Against this background the Strategic Group of Experts [SAGE] has requested an examination of impacts of New Vaccines on immunization and health systems. A group of recognised experts reviewed the available published literature so as to take stock of the current state of knowledge and identify the critical knowledge gaps. A important conclusion from this review is that while the introduction of new vaccines have had many positive impacts on both the immunization and health systems the impacts have not been automatically positive or negative. The impacts may vary depending on strengths and weaknesses in the existing health systems as well as on the type and relevance of the service delivery modality in a given set of socio-economic. institutional and cultural circumstances.

95300,A TIGLYCATIO ADA TIOXIDA T ACTIVITY OF POLYSACCHARIDES ISOLATED FROM FRUIT EXTRACT OF POMEGRA ATE (PU ICA GRA ATUM),,R Kokila and Chethan Kumar and S Gangadhara and R Harsha and R Dinesha and Thammanna Gowda SS,,,,,,Pomegranate (Punica granatum) has been used for centuries to confer health benefits in a number of inflammatory diseases. In present study. antioxidant. metal chelating and ferric ion reducing and antiglycation property was checked for the polysaccharide isolated from pomegranate fruit juice. At 20 µg/mL sugar concentration. it gave 87% and 85% inhibition in hydroxyl radical scavenging assay and Antiglycation assay respectively. It also had metal ion chelating and ferric ion reducing activity. It also inhibited fructosamine formation by 72% after 3 days of incubation. The above studies suggested that the inhibition of glycation exhibited by extract was not only due to its free radical scavenging property but also due to the modification in the amino or carbonyl groups in the Millard reaction. which resulted in the inhibition of fructosamine formation. On the SDS-PAGE profile. a band of glycated Bovine serum albumin (BSA) with a relative molecular weight larger than that of original BSA was observed. These results suggest that cross-linking between proteins or binding of carbohydrate to protein occurred during advanced glycation end products formation. So the sugars present in the extract may be donating the hydrogen atom to the free radical. and exhibiting the antioxidant activity. So polysaccharide isolated from pomegranate fruit juice can be used in preventing many diseases where free radical plays a vital role. As it has antiglycating activity. it can be used in delaying or preventing complications of diabetes and aging.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:QsKbpXNoaWkC,0,https://pharmacologyonline.silae.it/files/archives/2010/vol1/80.Kumar.pdf,,,,https://pharmacologyonline.silae.it/files/archives/2010/vol1/80.Kumar.pdf,0,0,0

95306,Multiparametric Approach To Perform QoS Analysis Of Mobile Ad-Hoc Network,,Rahul Kumar and Ritu Pahawa,,,,,,Wireless ad-hoc networking has become an irreplaceable technology in modern communication system where communication infrastructure is insufficient or unavailable. Ad-hoc network is a collection of self-organizing nodes that are rapidly deployable and adaptable to frequent topology changes. The evolution of the Multimedia Technology & the Commercial Interest of Companies to reach civilian applications has made QoS in MANETs an unavoidable task. Resource limitations and variations add to the need for QoS provisioning. Use of MANETs in critical and delay sensitive applications demands service differentiation. Maintaining appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) for MANETs is a complex task due to the dynamic behavior of the network topology. The goal of QoS provisioning is to achieve network behaviors that are deterministic. so that information carried by the network can be better delivered and network resources can be better utilized. In this paper. we are going to analyze the multiparametric approach to perform QoS analysis of mobile ad-hoc network.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/52291359/IJETR011407.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52291359/IJETR011407.pdf,0,0,0

95315,EFFICACY OF AIR DISINFECTION DEVICES IN CONTROLLING ATMOSPHERIC MICROFLORA IN ENCLOSED HEALTH CARE SETTINGS.,,Ravi Kumar and EK Jyothi and Nanda Kumar and Madhava Murthy MR and R Ravi Kumar and Bangalore NIMHANS,,,,,,INTRODUCTION: There is increasing concern with the prevalence of hospital infection. This is causing a significant economic and logistical burden on the health services. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of hydroxyl radical based air disinfection devices in reducing the atmospheric pathogen count in enclosed health care settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequential trial with repeated readings was designed before and after installation of the Air Disinfection devices. Study was conducted at 52 points in different locations which included sections from out Patient Department. Intensive Care Units. Operation Theatre. Surgical Ward. Radiology Department and cubicles in routine microbiology. The samples collected with air sampler were processed in Neuromicrobiology Laboratory. RESULT: It was observed that the mean (±SE) colony forming units (CFU/m3) count after 24 and 48 hours before and after use of air disinfectant devices at the above locations were 159.75 (±35.42). 210.31 (±65.15) and 44.04 (±14.15). 55.31 (±15.06) respectively. The differences in the mean CFU concentrations were found to be statistically significant (p= 0.006). Additionally. a high degree of variance in the CFU counts was noted before using the devices as compared to that after using the same. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that there is considerable reduction in the number of colony forming units subsequent to the introduction of the Air Disinfection devices. These devices supplement and compliment the general hygienic practices. However owing to a lot of compounding factors affecting the colony forming units in a given location. sufficient care must …,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/32644098/Publication_on_AD_in_JEMDS.pdf.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32644098/Publication_on_AD_in_JEMDS.pdf.pdf,0,0,0
95316,FPGA based Real Time 3D-RISS/GPS Integrated System for Position Tracking,,S Sandeep Kumar and R Ravi Kumar,,,,,,Position tracking systems supported with RISS and gyroscopes are found to be better solutions in the places where GPS is unemployable or in the places where GPS cannot work. Generally systems that are based on GPS for position tracking. face a lot of problems in the areas where line of sight is hard to achieve ie GPS denied environment. like dense terrestrial areas. subways. tunnels and hidden places. This system provides continuous and highly reliable position tracking by synchronizing real time stimulus obtained from the sensors and the actual GPS values. The core processor of the system is built on an FPGA which is used in the system kernel. The key factor for using FPGA in the system is its customizable core and its flexibility to interface with the sensors. The core employees the Hybrid Kalman filter for estimating the displacement and position. In this system we integrate the 3D-RISS with GPS to achieve a Reliable and uninterrupted Position Tracking. In these systems the processor estimates the position of the object based on the four inputs taken from the RISS and the Odometer. they are Velocity. acceleration. orientation and position. Here the system integrates the offline Inertial data (ie while the GPS is unavailable) with that of actual GPS data. The system starts to compute the position and velocity using the initial data provided by the GPS at the instant it was lost. This kind of position tracking systems used in various kinds of moving objects like Aircrafts. Guided missiles.

95319,Secure And User Interactive Information Extraction in Linux Distributions,,Sunit Jaiswal and Anshul Agrawal and Ravi Prabh and Rakesh Kumar,,,,,,Linux distributions have long been used as server operating systems. and have risen to prominence in that area. Netcraft [1] reported in October 2009 that seven of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran Linux distributions on their web servers. Linux distributions are the cornerstone of the LAMP server-software combination (Linux. Apache. MySQL. Perl/PHP/Python) which has achieved popularity among developers. and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting.Linux distributions are also commonly used as operating systems for supercomputers as of June 2009. out of the top 500 systems. 443 (88.6%) run a Linux distribution. In the Linux distributions there are several commands already available for maintaining servers. We generally use commands like useradd. groupadd in Linux distributions for adding a user. These commands can be used with options to include the information about the user. But the drawback is that if you are the network administrator and you are maintaining the server. you are required to add the information personally. It becomes a tedious and time taking task for administrator because he/she has lot of other important tasks to perform. That is why we are introducing a new command INTODUCE to minimize the work load on administrator.,True,3EsdMWYAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,0,http://bvicam.in/INDIACom/news/INDIACom%202010%20Proceedings/papers/Group1/351.pdf,,,,http://bvicam.in/INDIACom/news/INDIACom%202010%20Proceedings/papers/Group1/351.pdf,0,0,0

The substrates contain the fluorogenic leaving group 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC). Substrates incorporating the ACC leaving group show kinetic profiles comparable to those with the traditionally used 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) leaving group. The bifunctional nature of ACC allows for the efficient production of single substrates and substrate libraries by using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid-phase synthesis techniques.

Within the fold of each divergent enzyme is embedded the catalytic machinery essential to providing rate enhancement for an identical reaction. and the particular amino acids directly involved in this function are expected to be highly conserved and invariant in their spatial positions. Among the remaining residues will be those required for the overall three-dimensional structure. Such residues are found largely within the hydrophobic core of the enzyme and. within a family. may show covariance according to the thermodynamic determinants specifying stability and the informational determinants specifying uniqueness of the fold. The remaining amino acids of the enzymes then constitute much of the raw material for evolutionary adaptation to novel selectivity. Many of these can be expected to be found interacting with distal. variable. specificitydetermining portions of the substrates in modes that are unique to each enzyme of the family. The core structural residues may also contribute to generating new specificity. by virtue of second or third shell interactions with the amino acids directly contacting substrate.Here we describe structure-function relationships in one of the largest and most comprehensively studied of all enzyme families. the serine proteases with a chymotrypsin fold.

This effect can be mimicked by incubating wild-type 15-lipoxygenase with a synthetically altered substrate which has its doubly allylic methylene carbons shifted by one carbon relative to arachidonic acid.

Here. we show the first application of plasmon rulers to in vivo studies to observe very long trajectories of single biomolecules in live cells. We present a unique type of plasmon ruler comprised of peptide-linked gold nanoparticle satellites around a core particle. which was used as a probe to optically follow cell-signaling pathways in vivo at the single-molecule level.

The cruzain S2 specificity pocket is able to productively bind both arginine and phenylalanine residues. The structures of cruzain bound to benzoyl‐Tyr‐Ala‐fluoromethyl ketone and benzoyl‐Tyr‐Ala‐fluoromethyl ketone at 2.2 and 2.1 Å. respectively. show a pH‐dependent specificity switch. Glu 205 adjusts to restructure the S2 specificity pocket. conferring tight binding to both hydrophobic and basic residues. Kinetic analysis of activated peptide substrates shows that substrates placing hydrophobic residues in the specificity pocket are cleaved at a broader pH range than hydrophilic substrates.

Formation of NETs is considered to be a defense mechanism utilized by neutrophils to ensnare and kill invading pathogens. and has been recently termed NETosis. Neutrophils can be stimulated to undergo NETosis ex vivo. and are predicted to contain high levels of serine proteases. such as neutrophil elastase (NE). cathepsin G (CG) and proteinase 3 (PR3). Serine proteases are important effectors of neutrophil-mediated immunity. which function directly by degrading pathogenic virulent factors and indirectly via proteolytic activation or deactivation of cytokines. chemokines and receptors. In this study. we utilized a diverse and unbiased peptide library to detect and profile protease activity associated with NETs induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). We obtained a “proteolytic signature” from NETs derived from healthy donor neutrophils and used proteomics to assist in the identification of the source of this proteolytic activity. In addition. we profiled each neutrophil serine protease and included the newly identified enzyme. neutrophil serine protease 4 (NSP4). Each enzyme had overlapping yet distinct endopeptidase activities and often cleaved at unique sites within the same peptide substrate. The dominant proteolytic activity in NETs was attributed to NE; however. cleavage sites corresponding to CG and PR3 activity were evident.

The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent of the disease. Although public health procedures have been effective in combating the spread of SARS. concern remains about the possibility of a recurrence. Various approaches are being pursued for the development of efficacious therapeutics. One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160 000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides.

The rat enzyme is synthesized as a precursor species containing a large amino-terminal fragment (108 amino acids) that contributes a putative signal sequence and an activation peptide. The mature form of rat CPB is homologous to bovine CPB (77% identity); the amino acids in bovine CPB which have been previously implicated in catalysis or ligand binding are invariant in the rat orthologue. The rat CPB cDNA was used as a probe for the isolation of the rat CPB gene.

Incubation of the HIV1 or HIV2 protease with a 4-fold molar excess of an inactive mutant of HIV1 leads to 80 and 95% inhibition of enzyme activity. respectively. Incubating HIV1 and HIV2 proteases at a 1: 5 ratio results in a 50% reduction of activity of the mixed enzymes. The H1V1/HIV2 heterodimer was identified by ion-exchange HPLC. The heterodimer may display a disordered dimer interface. thereby affecting the catalytic potential of the enzyme. This mechanism of inactivation is an example of a dominant negative mutation that can obliterate the activity of a naturally occurring multisubunit enzyme …,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,72,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi00215a016,6561811995712995339,/scholar?cites=6561811995712995339,,,0,0,0

By comparing conserved differences among sequences of 12- and 15-lipoxygenases. a small region responsible for functional differences between 12- and 15-lipoxygenases has been identified. Furthermore. the replacement of only two amino acids in 15-lipoxygenase (at 417 and 418 in the primary sequence) by those found in certain 12-lipoxygenases results in an enzyme that has activity similar to 12-lipoxygenase.

Hemoglobin hydrolysis has been described as an ordered process initiated by aspartic proteases. but cysteine protease inhibitors completely block the process. suggesting that cysteine proteases can also initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis. To characterize the specific roles of falcipains. we used three approaches. First. using random P1 – P4 amino acid substrate libraries. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 demonstrated strong preference for cleavage sites with Leu at the P2 position. Second. with overlapping peptides spanning α and β globin and proteolysis-dependent 18O labeling. hydrolysis was seen at many cleavage sites. Third. with intact hemoglobin. numerous cleavage products were identified. Our results suggest that hemoglobin hydrolysis by malaria parasites is not a highly ordered process. but rather proceeds with rapid cleavage by falcipains at multiple sites. However. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 show strong specificity for P2 Leu in small peptide substrates. in agreement with the specificity in optimized small molecule inhibitors that was identified previously. These results are consistent with a principal role of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by P. falciparum and with the possibility of developing small molecule inhibitors with optimized specificity as antimalarial agents.,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,68,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005156,5529918722623518523,/scholar?cites=5529918722623518523,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005156,0,0,0

Unlike other serine proteases. tetrapeptide substrate preferences do not correlate well with natural substrate cleavage sequences. This suggests that the context of the cleavage sequence within a macromolecular substrate imposes another level of selection not observed with the peptide substrates.

This is a robust and efficient mechanism of inhibition but. due to the highly conserved architecture of protease active sites. these inhibitors often exhibit promiscuity. Inhibitors that show strict specificity for one protease usually achieve this selectivity by combining substrate-like binding in the active site with exosite binding on the protease surface. The development of new. specific inhibitors can be aided greatly by binding to non-conserved regions of proteases if potency can be maintained.

Digestion of nutrients from the host bloodstream is essential for parasite development and reproduction. A network of proteolytic enzymes (proteases) facilitates hydrolysis of host hemoglobin and serum proteins.  Methodology/Principal Findings We identified a new cathepsin L termed SmCL3 using PCR strategies based on S. mansoni EST sequence data. An ortholog is present in Schistosoma japonicum. SmCL3 was heterologously expressed as an active enzyme in the yeast. Pichia pastoris. Recombinant SmCL3 has a broad pH activity range against peptidyl substrates and is inhibited by Clan CA protease inhibitors. Consistent with a function in degrading host proteins. SmCL3 hydrolyzes serum albumin and hemoglobin. is localized to the adult gastrodermis. and is expressed mainly in those life stages infecting the mammalian host. The predominant form of SmCL3 in the parasite exists as a zymogen. which is unusual for proteases. This zymogen includes an unusually long prodomain with alpha helical secondary structure motifs. The striking specificity of SmCL3 for amino acids with large aromatic side chains (Trp and Tyr) at the P2 substrate position. as determined with positional scanning-synthetic combinatorial library. is consistent with a molecular model that shows a large and deep S2 pocket. A sequence similarity network (SSN) view clusters SmCL3 and other cathepsins L in accordance with previous large-scale phylogenetic analyses that identify six super kingdoms.

The overall structure remains similar to that at room temperature. The attainable resolution appears to be improved due to the decrease in the fall off of intensities with resolution [reduction of the temperature factor]. This decreases the uncertainty in the atomic positions and allows the localization of more protein atoms and solvent molecules in the low temperature map. The largest differences between the two models occur at residues with higher than average temperature factors. Several features can be localized in the solvent …,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,46,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.340100303,14458593867012516063,/scholar?cites=14458593867012516063,,,0,0,0

95508,Cullin E3 ligases and their rewiring by viral factors,2014,Cathal Mahon and Nevan J Krogan and Charles S Craik and Elah Pick,4,,4,897-930,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The ability of viruses to subvert host pathways is central in disease pathogenesis. Over the past decade. a critical role for the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) in counteracting host immune factors during viral infection has emerged. This counteraction is commonly achieved by the expression of viral proteins capable of sequestering host ubiquitin E3 ligases and their regulators. In particular. many viruses hijack members of the Cullin-RING E3 Ligase (CRL) family. Viruses interact in many ways with CRLs in order to impact their ligase activity; one key recurring interaction involves re-directing CRL complexes to degrade host targets that are otherwise not degraded within host cells. Removal of host immune factors by this mechanism creates a more amenable cellular environment for viral propagation. To date. a small number of target host factors have been identified. many of which are degraded via a CRL-proteasome pathway. Substantial effort within the field is ongoing to uncover the identities of further host proteins targeted in this fashion and the underlying mechanisms driving their turnover by the UPS. Elucidation of these targets and mechanisms will provide appealing anti-viral therapeutic opportunities. This review is focused on the many methods used by viruses to perturb host CRLs. focusing on substrate sequestration and viral regulation of E3 activity.

Studies in Ctsg-null mice suggest that cathepsin G supports antimicrobial defenses but can injure host tissues. The human enzyme has an unusual “Janus-faced” ability to cleave peptides at basic (tryptic) as well as aromatic (chymotryptic) sites. Tryptic activity has been attributed to acidic Glu226 in the primary specificity pocket and underlies proposed important functions. such as activation of prourokinase. However. most mammals. including mice. substitute Ala226 for Glu226. suggesting that human tryptic activity may be anomalous. To test this hypothesis. human cathepsin G was compared with mouse wild-type and humanized active site mutants. revealing that mouse primary specificity is markedly narrower than that of human cathepsin G. with much greater Tyr activity and selectivity and near absence of tryptic activity.

This pan-specificity of inhibition is believed to derive from formation of a heterotetrameric complex with target proteases involving three types of interface: the dimerization interface. a primary substrate-like interaction. and a smaller secondary interaction between the partner ecotin subunit and the protease. A monomeric ecotin variant (mEcotin) and a single-chain ecotin dimer (scEcotin) were constructed to study the effect of a network of protein interactions on binding affinity and the role of dimerization in broad inhibitor specificity. mEcotin was produced by inserting a β-turn into the C-terminal arm. which normally exchanges with the other subunit.

Because these host-pathogen interactions are extensive and interactions between human proteins are found within many different databases. it is difficult to generate integrated HIV-human interaction networks. We have developed a web-based platform. termed GPS-Prot                      http://www.gpsprot.org                                        . that allows for facile integration of different HIV interaction data types as well as inclusion of interactions between human proteins derived from publicly-available databases. including MINT. BioGRID and HPRD. The software has the ability to group proteins into functional modules or protein complexes. generating more intuitive network representations and also allows for the uploading of user-generated data. GPS-Prot is a software tool that allows users to easily create comprehensive and integrated HIV-host networks. A major advantage of this platform compared to other visualization tools is its web-based format. which requires no software installation or data downloads. GPS-Prot allows novice users to quickly generate networks that combine both genetic and protein-protein interactions between HIV and its human host into a single representation.

95541,Conversion of trypsin to a functional threonine protease,2006,Teaster T Baird Jr and William D Wright and Charles S Craik,15,Protein science,6,1229-1238,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,The hydroxyl group of a serine residue at position 195 acts as a nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism of the serine proteases. However. the chemically similar residue. threonine. is rarely used in similar functional context. Our structural modeling suggests that the Ser 195 → Thr trypsin variant is inactive due to negative steric interaction between the methyl group on the β‐carbon of Thr 195 and the disulfide bridge formed by cysteines 42 and 58. By simultaneously truncating residues 42 and 58 and substituting Ser 195 with threonine. we have successfully converted the classic serine protease trypsin to a functional threonine protease. Substitution of residue 42 with alanine and residue 58 with alanine or valine in the presence of threonine 195 results in trypsin variants that are 102–104‐fold less active than wild type in kcat/KM but >106‐fold more active than the Ser 195 → Thr single variant.

However. its mechanism of action remains elusive. Whereas human cathepsin V exhibits a potent elastolytic activity. the structurally homologous cathepsin L. which shares a 78% amino acid sequence. has only a minimal proteolytic activity toward insoluble elastin. This suggests that there are distinct structural domains that play an important role in elastinolysis. In this study. a total of 11 chimeras of cathepsins V and L were generated to identify elastin-binding domains in cathepsin V. Evaluation of these chimeras revealed two exosites contributing to the elastolytic activity of cathepsin V that are distant from the active cleft of the protease and are located in surface loop regions.

Genome sequence analysis reveals a greatly expanded family of cercarial elastase gene isoforms in Schistosoma mansoni. This expansion appears to be unique to S. mansoni. and it is unknown whether gene duplication has led to divergent protease function.   Methods Profiling of transcript and protein expression patterns reveals that cercarial elastase isoforms are similarly expressed throughout the S. mansoni life cycle. Computational modeling predicts key differences in the substrate-binding pockets of various cercarial elastase isoforms. suggesting a diversification of substrate preferences compared with the ancestral gene of the family. In addition. active site labeling of SmCE reveals that it is activated prior to exit of the parasite from its intermediate snail host.   Conclusions The expansion of the cercarial gene family in S. mansoni is likely to be an example of gene dosage. In addition to its critical role in human skin penetration. data presented here suggests a novel role for the protease in egress from the intermediate snail host. This study demonstrates how enzyme activity-based analysis complements genomic and proteomic studies. and is key in elucidating proteolytic function.,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001589,4503210679027047178,/scholar?cites=4503210679027047178,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001589,0,0,0

A small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protease (KSHV Pr) traps the enzyme in an inactive monomeric state where the C-terminal helices are unfolded and the hydrophobic dimer interface is exposed.

However. divergence in function between the iP and the constitutive proteasome (cP) has been unclear. A global peptide library-based screening strategy revealed that the proteasomes have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities. Differing iP specificity alters the quantity of production of certain MHC I epitopes but does not appear to be preferentially suited for antigen presentation. Furthermore. iP specificity was found to have likely arisen through genetic drift from the ancestral cP. Specificity differences were exploited to develop isoform-selective substrates. Cellular profiling using these substrates revealed that divergence in regulation of the iP balances its relative contribution to proteasome capacity in immune cells. resulting in selective recovery from inhibition.

Membrane-anchored serine proteases (MASPs) play critical roles in the development and homeostasis of epithelial barrier tissues; how MASPs are activated in mature epithelia is unknown.

While the blood feeding adult secretes predominantly FheCL1. an enzyme with a strong preference for Leu at the S2 pocket of the active site. the infective stage produces FheCL3. a unique enzyme with collagenolytic activity that favours Pro at P2.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using a novel unbiased multiplex substrate profiling and mass spectrometry methodology (MSP-MS). we compared the preferences of FheCL1 and FheCL3 along the complete active site cleft and confirm that while the S2 imposes the greatest influence on substrate selectivity. preferences can be indicated on other active site subsites. Notably. we discovered that the activity of FheCL1 and FheCL3 enzymes is very different. sharing only 50% of the cleavage sites. supporting the idea of functional specialization. We generated variants of FheCL1 and FheCL3 with S2 and S3 residues by mutagenesis and evaluated their substrate specificity using positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PS-SCL).

In Plasmodium falciparum these proteases appear to mediate the processing of hemoglobin and aspartic proteases (plasmepsins) in the acidic food vacuole and the hydrolysis of erythrocyte structural proteins at neutral pH. Two cysteine proteases. vivapain (VX)-2 and VX-3 have been characterized in P. vivax. but comprehensive studies of P. vivax cysteine proteases remain elusive.  Findings We characterized a novel cysteine protease of P. vivax. VX-4. of which orthologs appears to have evolved differentially in primate plasmodia with strong cladistic affinity toward those of rodent Plasmodium. Recombinant VX-4 demonstrated dual substrate specificity depending on the surrounding micro-environmental pH. Its hydrolyzing activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Z-Leu-Arg-MCA) and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA was highest at acidic pH (5.5). whereas that against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA was maximal at neutral pH (6.5–7.5). VX-4 preferred positively charged amino acids and Gln at the P1 position. with less strict specificity at P3 and P4. P2 preferences depended on pH (Leu at pH 5.5 and Arg at pH 7.5). Three amino acids that delineate the S2 pocket were substituted in VX-4 compared to VX-2 and VX-3 (Ala90. Gly157 and Glu180).

A Wiley Company,Proteins can be regarded as the principal dynamic molecules in living cells owing to their unparalleled ability to perform an immense assortment of biological functions. These include indispensable roles in catalysis. transport and storage. coordinated motility. maintenance of structural integrity. immune protection. and metabolic regulation. The remarkable adaptability of proteins is further demonstrated by their capacity to mediate critical biological processes tailored to a variety of conditions such as extremes of pH or temperature. The functional diversity exhibited by proteins is based on an equally extraordinary structural diversity. The linear sequence of amino acids unique to each protein determines its characteristic threedimensional form. Higher order structural diversity can be achieved by self-assembly of monomeric units into molecular macrostructures.

Within this phylum are several parasitic worms that are often poorly characterized due to their complex life-cycles and lack of responsiveness to genetic manipulation. The flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. or planaria. is an ideal model organism to study the complex role of protein digestion due to its simple life cycle and amenability to techniques like RNA interference (RNAi). In this study. we were interested in deconvoluting the digestive protease system that exists in the planarian gut. To do this. we developed an alcohol-induced regurgitation technique to enrich for the gut enzymes in S. mediterranea. Using a panel of fluorescent substrates. we show that this treatment produces a sharp increase in proteolytic activity. These enzymes have broad yet diverse substrate specificity profiles. Proteomic analysis of the gut contents revealed the presence of cysteine and metallo-proteases. However. treatment with class-specific inhibitors showed that aspartyl and cysteine proteases are responsible for the majority of protein digestion. Specific RNAi knockdown of the cathepsin B-like cysteine protease (SmedCB) reduced protein degradation in vivo. Immunohistochemistry and whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) confirmed that the full-length and active forms of SmedCB are found in secretory cells surrounding the planaria intestinal lumen.

We employed a mass spectrometry-based substrate profiling method to identify an optimal peptide substrate of PmC11. a C11 protease secreted by the commensal bacterium Parabacteroides merdae.

These proteases are evolutionarily divided into clades that are proposed to reflect their substrate specificity. most noticeably through the S2 subsite. Single amino acid substitutions to residues lining this site. including amino acid residue 69 (aa69; mature cathepsin L5 numbering) can have profound influences on subsite architecture and influence enzyme specificity.

The humoral immune response involves uptake of antigens by antigen presenting cells (APCs). APC processing and presentation of peptides on MHC class II (pMHCII). and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of pMHCII complexes. Most in silico methods predict only peptide-MHCII binding. resulting in significant over-prediction of CD4 T-cell epitopes. We present a method. ITCell. for prediction of T-cell epitopes within an input protein antigen sequence for given MHCII and TCR sequences. The method integrates information about three stages of the immune response pathway: antigen cleavage. MHCII presentation. and TCR recognition. First. antigen cleavage sites are predicted based on the cleavage profiles of cathepsins S. B. and H. Second. for each 12-mer peptide in the antigen sequence we predict whether it will bind to a given MHCII. based on the scores of modeled peptide-MHCII complexes. Third. we predict whether or not any of the top scoring peptide-MHCII complexes can bind to a given TCR. based on the scores of modeled ternary peptide-MHCII-TCR complexes and the distribution of predicted cleavage sites.

Many human fungal pathogens secrete peptidases that influence virulence. but in most cases the substrate specificity and regulation of these enzymes remains poorly understood. The paucity of such information is a roadblock to our understanding of the biological functions of peptidases and whether or not these enzymes are viable therapeutic targets. We report here an unbiased analysis of secreted peptidase activity and specificity in C. neoformans using a mass spectrometry-based substrate profiling strategy and subsequent functional investigations. Our initial studies revealed that global peptidase activity and specificity are dramatically altered by environmental conditions. To uncover the substrate preferences of individual enzymes and interrogate their biological functions. we constructed and profiled a ten-member gene deletion collection of candidate secreted peptidases. Through this deletion approach. we characterized the substrate specificity of three peptidases within the context of the C. neoformans secretome. including an enzyme known to be important for fungal entry into the brain. We selected a previously uncharacterized peptidase. which we term Major aspartyl peptidase 1 (May1). for detailed study due to its substantial contribution to extracellular proteolytic activity.

Vif targets A3 restriction factors for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by recruiting them to a multi-protein ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. Here. we describe a degradation-independent mechanism of Vif-mediated antagonism that was revealed through detailed structure-function studies of antibody antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) to the Vif complex. Two Fabs were found to inhibit Vif-mediated A3 neutralization through distinct mechanisms: shielding A3 from ubiquitin transfer and blocking Vif E3 assembly. Combined biochemical. cell biological and structural studies reveal that disruption of Vif E3 assembly inhibited A3 ubiquitination but was not sufficient to restore its packaging into viral particles and antiviral activity. These observations establish that Vif can neutralize A3 family members in a degradation-independent manner.

95641,Analysis of the substrate specificity of Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) and design of specific and sensitive peptide substrates,2017,Emrah Kara and Dipankar Manna and Geir Åge Løset and Eric L Schneider and Charles S Craik and Sandip Kanse,,Thrombosis and haemostasis,,,,Factor VII (FVII) activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating serine protease that is likely to be involved in a number of disease conditions such as stroke. atherosclerosis. liver fibrosis. thrombosis and cancer. To date. no systematic information is available about the substrate specificity of FSAP. Applying phage display and positional scanning substrate combinatorial library (PS-SCL) approaches we have characterised the specificity of FSAP towards small peptides. Results were evaluated in the context of known protein substrates as well as molecular modelling of the peptides in the active site of FSAP. The representative FSAP-cleaved sequence obtained from the phage display method was Val-Leu-Lys-Arg-Ser (P4-P1’). The sequence X-Lys/Arg-Nle-Lys/Arg (P4-P1) was derived from the PS-SCL method. These results show a predilection for cleavage at a cluster of basic amino acids on the nonprime side. Quenched fluorescent substrate (Ala-Lys-Nle-Arg-AMC) (amino methyl coumarin) and (Ala-Leu-Lys-Arg-AMC) had a higher selectivity for FSAP compared to other proteases from the hemostasis system. These substrates could be used to measure FSAP activity in a complex biological system such as plasma. In histonetreated plasma there was a specific activation of pro-FSAP as validated by the use of an FSAP inhibitory antibody. corn trypsin inhibitor to inhibit Factor XIIa and hirudin to inhibit thrombin. which may account for some of the haemostasis-related effects of histones. These results will aid the development of further selective FSAP activity probes as well as specific inhibitors that will help to increase the understanding of the functions of …,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC,11,https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/61832,10769481946422948576,/scholar?cites=10769481946422948576,,https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/61832/Kara%2Bet%2Bal%2BT%2526H.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

Tryptic digestion of the alkylated protein and mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides identify an active site aspartic acid (Asp-25) as the single residue that is alkylated. Computer modeling of 1 bound in the crystal structure of the SIV protease using DOCK 3.5 indicates that 1 has appropriate access to the active site. It is able to align in an orientation that allows a proton to be transferred to the epoxide from one of the catalytic aspartic acid groups in conjunction with nucleophilic attack on the epoxide of the carboxylate moiety of the second catalytic aspartic acid residue. Hydrophobic interactions are not optimal for this process due. in part. to the rigidity of the inhibitor ring system and the planar conformation of the amide.

This molecule may be engineered to increase and/or change its affinity and specificity providing significant biotechnological potential. Since ecotin binds tightly to serine proteases of the trypsin fold. it may help to identify the role of these enzymes in different biological processes. In this work. we tested ecotin variants as an affinity purification reagent for identifying enzymes in samples of tumor progression and mammary gland involution. Initially. we used a commercial source of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) that remained fully active after elution from an affinity column of the ecotin variant (M84R. M85R). We then successfully identified u-PA from more complex mixtures including lysates from a prostate cancer cell line and involuting mouse mammary glands.

They are suitable scaffolds for drug development due to their small cores. whose disulfide bonds impart extraordinary chemical and biological stability. A challenge in developing a DRP therapeutic is to engineer binding to a specific target. This challenge can be overcome by (i) sampling the large sequence space of a given scaffold through a phage display library and by (ii) panning multiple libraries encoding structurally distinct scaffolds. Here. we implement a protocol for defining these diverse scaffolds. based on clustering structurally defined DRPs according to their conformational similarity. We developed and applied a hierarchical clustering protocol based on DRP structural similarity. followed by two post-processing steps. to classify 806 unique DRP structures into 81 clusters. The 20 most populated clusters comprised 85% of all DRPs. Representative scaffolds were selected from each of these clusters; the representatives were structurally distinct from one another. but similar to other DRPs in their respective clusters. To demonstrate the utility of the clusters. phage libraries were constructed for three of the representative scaffolds and panned against interleukin-23. One library produced a peptide that bound to this target with an IC50 of 3.3 μM. Most DRP clusters contained members that were diverse in sequence. host organism. and interacting proteins. indicating that cluster members were functionally diverse despite having similar structure.

Candida albicans Bar1 was purified and shown to exhibit preferential cleavage of native α pheromone over pheromones from related fungal species. This result establishes that protease substrate specificity coevolved along with changes in its pheromone target. Pheromone cleavage by Bar1 occurred between residues Thr-5 and Asn-6 in the middle of the tridecapeptide sequence.

Paralogous Fasciola hepatica cathepsin L proteases are essential to parasite invasion. tissue migration and reproduction. In spite of similarities in their overall sequence and structure. these enzymes often exhibit different substrate specificity. These preferences are principally determined by the amino acid composition of the active site’s S2 subsite (pocket) of the enzyme that interacts with the substrate P2 residue. Although secreted FhCL1 accommodates aliphatic residues in the S2 pocket. FhCL2 is also efficient in cleaving proline in that position. To understand these differences. we engineered the FhCL1 S2 subsite at three amino acid positions to render it identical to that present in FhCL2. The substitutions did not produce the expected increment in proline accommodation in P2. Rather. they decreased the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency towards synthetic peptides. Nonetheless. a change in the P3 specificity was associated with the mutation of Leu67 to Tyr. a hinge residue between the S2 and S3 subsites that contributes to the accommodation of Gly in S3. Molecular dynamic simulations highlighted changes in the spatial distribution and secondary structure of the S2 and S3 pockets of the mutant FhCL1 enzymes. The reduced affinity and catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzymes may be due to a narrowing of the active site cleft that hinders the accommodation of substrates.

The sequential process includes discovery of the initial lead compound. lead optimization through molecular modification. in vitro and in vivo assays. toxicology trials. and human safety and efficacy trials. Any methods which can accelerate and improve the efficiency of this process are desirable. The development of new drugs has always depended on the identification of lead compounds with some biological activity (2). Methods that have successfully been used to find leads are listed in Table 17.1. Some of the herbal remedies used in ethnopharmacology. or folk medicine. have made the transition to approved drugs. The availability of enzyme crystal structures has allowed the direct design of inhibitors that are useful drugs. Biochemical information has been exploited to design compounds like malathion. which are metabolized to harmful products in insects but are relatively nontoxic to mammals. This targeting of crucial enzymes and nucleic acids of parasites and pathogens as a means of treating diseases was clearly enunciated by Seymour Cohen (3).

Mucinous cysts are precursor lesions to pancreatic cancer. however. the majority are indolent. Current diagnostics cannot identify mucinous cysts that harbor cancer or reliably differentiate these lesions from nonmucinous cysts. which present minimal risk of malignant progression. We previously determined that activity of two aspartyl proteases was increased in mucinous cysts. Using a global protease activity profiling technology. termed multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry (MSP-MS). we now show that aminopeptidase activity is also elevated in mucinous cysts.

While many of these drugs were discovered by traditional drug-screening programmes. a number of technological advances in the last decade have opened up the possibility of more focused and cost-effective approaches to drug design. These new approaches of'structure-based drug design'derive in large part from the avalanche of new information on enzyme gene sequences that has resulted from advances in molecular biology. Acquisition of information about the primary structure of an enzyme. which in the recent past could take years. now can take weeks. Concurrent with rapid advances in gene isolation and sequencing. there have been major advances in the ability to express active recombinant enzymes in a variety of host cells. and equally important advances in computer modelling of enzyme active sites based upon primary structure information. This chapter will review a potential strategy for drug design that utilizes each of these technologies in a new interactive fashion. The design of inhibitors for proteolytic enzymes will be presented as an example of the application of this strategy. but its more general applicability to other enzyme-inhibitor or receptor-inhibitor interactions should be apparent.,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:cBPnxVikjH8C,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7741720603710485731&hl=en&oi=scholarr,7741720603710485731,/scholar?cites=7741720603710485731,,,0,0,0

The processing of the envelope protein precursor to form the surface protein and the transmembrane protein appears to be mediated by a cellular proteinase (McCune et al. 1988). However. the limited proteolysis of the gag. pol. and gagpol precursors to form the matrix. capsid. and nucleocapsid proteins. and the viral enzymes has been attributed to a virally encoded proteinase (Kräusslich and Wimmer 1988). Evidence that the virally encoded proteinase is responsible for the processing event comes from an experiment involving a sitedirected mutation in the putative active site of the proteinasecoding region. When the mutant retroviral genome was introduced into recipient cells. noninfectious virions resulted that contained unprocessed gag polyprotein (Kohl et al. 1988).

Demonstration of active catalytic function is further proof of the authenticity of the isolated clone. The predicted amino acid structure shares significant sequence similarity with other lipoxygenases in certain regions. This extends our earlier observation that the lipoxygenases form a family of enzymes. Furthermore. the conservation of amino acid residues in select regions suggests a role in enzymatic activity.

The comparison of substrate preferences of TrCB1.1 and TrCB1.4 showed that TrCB1.4 had a very narrow substrate specificity and after processing it was less effective towards protein substrates when compared to TrCB1.1. Self-processing of both isoforms could be facilitated by sulfated polysaccharides due to a specific binding motif in the pro-sequence. Trans-activation by heterologous enzymes was also succesfully employed. Expression profiling revealed a high level of transcription of genes encoding the enzymatically inactive paralogs TrCB1.5 and TrCB1.6. The transcription level of TrCB1.6 was comparable with that of TrCB1.1 and TrCB1.2. the most abundant active isoforms. Recombinant TrCB1.6wt. a wild type paralog with a Cys29-to-Gly substitution in the active site that renders the enzyme inactive. was processed by the active TrCB1 forms and by an asparaginyl endopeptidase. Although TrCB1.6wt lacked hydrolytic activity. endopeptidase. but not dipeptidase. activity could be restored by mutating Gly29 to Cys29. The lack of exopeptidase activity may be due to other mutations. such as His110-to-Asn in the occluding loop and Asp224-to-Gly in the main body of the mature TrCB1.6. which do not occur in the active isoforms TrCB1.1 and TrCB1.4 with exopeptidase activity.

Antibodies that bind specific uPAR epitopes may disrupt these interactions. thereby inhibiting these processes. Using a highly diverse and naïve human fragment of antigen binding (Fab) phage display library. we identified 12 unique human Fabs that bind uPAR. Two of these antibodies compete against urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) for uPAR binding. while a third competes with β1 integrins for uPAR binding. These competitive antibodies inhibit uPAR-dependent cell signaling and invasion in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line. H1299. Additionally. the integrin-blocking antibody abrogates uPAR/β1 integrin-mediated H1299 cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN). This antibody and one of the uPAR/uPA antagonist antibodies shows a combined effect in inhibiting cell invasion through Matrigel/Collagen I or Collagen I matrices. Our results indicate that these antagonistic antibodies have potential for the detection and treatment of human uPAR-expressing tumors.The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR/CD87) is a glycosylated protein of 45–55 kDa consisting of three homologous cysteine-rich domains. The protein is localized to the extracellular leaf of the plasma membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. uPAR mediates a wide variety of cellular processes including inflammation (1). metastasis and invasion (2. 3). tissue remodeling (4). angiogenesis (5). and cell adhesion (6).,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Craik/publication/228907519_Antagonstic_anti-upar_antibodies_significantly_inhibit_uPAR-mediated_cellular_signaling_and_migration/links/02e7e51507a4fc32b1000000/Antagonstic-anti-upar-antibodies-significantly-inhibit-uPAR-mediated-cellular-signaling-and-migration.pdf,8138762634780068980,/scholar?cites=8138762634780068980,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Craik/publication/228907519_Antagonstic_anti-upar_antibodies_significantly_inhibit_uPAR-mediated_cellular_signaling_and_migration/links/02e7e51507a4fc32b1000000/Antagonstic-anti-upar-antibodies-significantly-inhibit-uPAR-mediated-cellular-signaling-and-migration.pdf,0,0,0

In this context. proteolysis is a unique PTM because it is irreversible; the hydrolysis of the peptide backbone generates separate fragments bearing a new N and C terminus. Proteolysis can “re-wire” protein–protein interactions (PPIs) via the recruitment of end-binding proteins to new termini. In this review. we focus on the role of proteolysis in specifically creating complexes by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases to new N and C termini. These complexes potentiate proteolytic signaling by “erasing” proteolytic modifications. This activity tunes the duration and magnitude of protease signaling events. Recent work has shown that the stepwise process of proteolysis. end-binding by E3 ubiquitin ligases. and fragment turnover is associated with both the nascent N terminus (i.e..

Arginine scanning of the six CDR loops of U33 was done to identify initial binding determinants since uPA prefers arginine in its primary substrate binding pocket. Two CDR loops were selected to create an engineered affinity maturation library of U33 that was diversified around ArgL91 (CDR L3) and ArgH52 (CDR H2). Biopanning of the randomized U33 library under stringent conditions resulted in eight Fabs with improved binding properties. One of the most potent inhibitors. AB2. exhibited a 13-fold decrease in IC50 when compared to U33 largely due to a decrease in its off rate.

Because cleavable linkers for prodrugs had not been developed for bacterial proteases. we used substrate phage to discover substrates for proteases found in the bacterial periplasm. Rather than focusing on a single protease. we used a periplasmic extract of E. coli to find sequences with the greatest susceptibility to the endogenous mixture of periplasmic proteases. Using a fluorescence assay. candidate sequences were evaluated to identify substrates that release native amine-containing payloads. We next designed conjugates consisting of (1) an N-terminal siderophore to facilitate uptake. (2) a protease-cleavable linker. and (3) an amine-containing antibiotic. Using this strategy. we converted daptomycin—which by itself is active only against Gram-positive bacteria—into an …,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:Azgs6IHzeyYC,0,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c06987,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7790458/,0,0,0

However. many diseases and conditions involve biological processes that are difficult to detect with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to enable a correct diagnosis. Proteolytic events are an example of such a biological process and are directly or indirectly associated with a wide variety of diseases and conditions.[0003] For example. despite gains in prevention and therapy. coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality. The event that causes death is most often a blood clot in the coronary artery initiated by rupture of an athero sclerotic plaque. Such clots can directly occlude this major vessel or break off and migrate to smaller arteries causing myocardial ischemia and cellular damage.

Patients diagnosed with TNBC lack the estrogen and progesterone receptors. the human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor and do not respond well to current therapies. One hallmark of TNBC is increased uPAR expression. As uPAR was observed in BC and its metastasis but not in normal tissue. anti-uPAR Abs can serve as a targeted therapy for TNBC. The Craik lab used recombinant phage display technology to identify anti-human-uPAR Abs. Two of those human antibodies. 2G10 and 3C6. were tested in in vitro and in vivo TNBC models and demonstrated therapeutic potential.

In this work. the effect of ecotin-WT and a variant of this protein harboring two mutations (Met84Arg and Met85Arg. ecotin-RR) were analyzed to determine their ability to prevent thrombus formation using in vivo models. Ecotins were analyzed in vitro using the coagulation tests. An in vivo venous thrombosis rat model and a pulmonary thromboembolism mouse model were used to investigate the antithrombotic activity. The bleeding time in rats using a tail-transection model was evaluated as a possible side effect caused by the administration of these proteins.

These proteases are evolutionarily divided into clades that are proposed to reflect their substrate specificity. most noticeably through the S₂ subsite. Single amino acid substitutions to residues lining this site. including amino acid residue 69 (aa69; mature cathepsin L5 numbering) can have profound influences on subsite architecture and influence enzyme specificity. Variations at aa69 among known Fasciola cathepsin L proteases include leucine. tyrosine. tryptophan. phenylalanine and glycine. Other amino acids (cysteine. serine) might have been expected at this site due to codon usage as cathepsin L isoenzymes evolved. but C69 and S69 have not been observed. The introduction of L69C and L69S substitutions into FhCatL5 resulted in low overall activity indicating their expression provides no functional advantage. thus explaining the absence of such variants in Fasciola. An FhCatL5 L69F variant showed an increase in the ability to cleave substrates with P₂ proline. indicating F69 variants expressed by the fluke would likely have this ability. An FhCatL2 Y69L variant showed a decreased acceptance of P₂ proline. further highlighting the importance of Y69 for FhCatL2 P₂ proline acceptance. Finally. the P₁–P₄ specificity of Fasciola cathepsin L5 was determined and. unexpectedly. aspartic acid was shown to be well accepted at P₂. which is unique amongst Fasciola cathepsins examined to date.,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/902117,,,,,0,0,0

While substrates for both types of proteases have been determined experimentally. there are many more yet to be discovered in humans and other metazoans. Here. we present a bioinformatics method based on support vector machine (SVM) learning that identifies sequence and structural features important for protease recognition of substrate peptides and then uses these features to predict novel substrates. Our approach can act as a convenient hypothesis generator. guiding future experiments by high confidence identification of peptide protein partners. Results: The method is benchmarked on the known substrates of both protease types. including our literature-curated GrB substrate set (GrBah). On these benchmark sets. the method outperforms a number of other methods that consider sequence only. predicting at a 0.87 true positive rate and a 0.13 false positive rate for caspase substrates. and a 0.79 true positive rate and a 0.21 false positive rate for GrB substrates. The method is then applied to~ 25.000 proteins in the human proteome to generate a ranked list of predicted substrates of each protease type. Two of these predictions.

95779,How Immune Peptidases Change,2010,Manisha Ray Makarova and Charles S Craik and H George,185,J. Immunol,,5360-5368,,Cathepsin G is a major secreted serine peptidase of neutrophils and mast cells. Studies in Ctsg-null mice suggest that cathepsin G supports antimicrobial defenses but can injure host tissues. The human enzyme has an unusual “Janus-faced” ability to cleave peptides at basic (tryptic) as well as aromatic (chymotryptic) sites. Tryptic activity has been attributed to acidic Glu226 in the primary specificity pocket and underlies proposed important functions. such as activation of prourokinase. However. most mammals. including mice. substitute Ala226 for Glu226. suggesting that human tryptic activity may be anomalous. To test this hypothesis. human cathepsin G was compared with mouse wild-type and humanized active site mutants. revealing that mouse primary specificity is markedly narrower than that of human cathepsin G. with much greater Tyr activity and selectivity and near absence of tryptic activity. It also differs from human in resisting tryptic peptidase inhibitors (eg. aprotinin). while favoring angiotensin destruction at Tyr4 over activation at Phe8. Ala226Glu mutants of mouse cathepsin G acquire tryptic activity and human ability to activate prourokinase. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the Ala226Glu missense mutation appearing in primates 31–43 million years ago represented an apparently unprecedented way to create tryptic activity in a serine peptidase. We propose that tryptic activity is not an attribute of ancestral mammalian cathepsin G. which was primarily chymotryptic. and that primateselective broadening of specificity opposed the general trend of increased specialization by immune peptidases and allowed acquisition of new …,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.7859&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.7859&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This will provide a better functional insight into the propagation of cancer. and ultimately could allow us to diagnose cancer at earlier stages. Here. we propose a new platform to capture and measure activity of specific proteases in patient samples. with single-molecule sensitivity.,True,S84xrEgAAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC,0,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/NEMB/proceedings-abstract/NEMB2010/77/346310,,,,,0,0,0

This work aims to develop a PET agent to investigate imaging of tumors that express this protease using a 18 F-labeled scFv. E2. which has picomolar binding affinity for the catalytic domain of MT-SP1.Methods: E2 was chosen for its selectivity for matriptase from a phage display library of over 2 x 10 9 members. E2 was nonspecifically labeled by conjugation of N-succinimidyl 4-[18 F] fluorobenzoate (FSB) to free amine groups of the molecule. FSB was synthesized as according to the literature (Appl. Rad. Isot. 63. 329-332. 2005) and purified via solid phase extraction.

A potential Achilles’ heel of herpes virus replication is a protease. which is an attractive target for viral suppression. In the herpes virus family of proteases. dimerization is ubiquitously used as a regulatory mechanism for protease activation. Direct evidence for a link between protease activity and dimerization came from our previous report showing a tight communication between the KSHV protease active sites and the dimer interface using a transition state hexapeptide diphenylphosphonate inhibitor (Marnett et al. 2004.

Despite the fact that an estimated 2% of the human genome codes for proteases. only a small fraction of these enzymes have well-characterized functions. Much of the difficulty in understanding protease biology is a direct result of the complexity of regulation. localization and activation exhibited by this class of enzymes. To derive signaling relationships between molecules involved in proteolytic pathways we have used various high-throughput transcriptional. translational and substrate specificity profiling methods. These approaches have been applied to members of a class of membrane-associated serine proteases (MTSP/TTSP) that are dysregulated in various cancers and to members of the granzymes that are involved in the induction of targeted cell death.

Granzyme B prefers substrates containing P4 to P1 amino acids Ile/Val. Glu/Met/Gln. Pro/Xaa. and aspartic acid N-terminal to the proteolytic cleavage. By investigating the narrow extended specificity of the granzyme B-like proteases the mediators of their unique specificity are being defined.

Compared with other chymotryptic enzymes. such as cathepsin G and chymotrypsin. it is much more slowly inhibited by serum serpins. Although chymase hydrolyzes several peptides and proteins in vitro. its target repertoire is limited compared with chymotrypsin because of selective interactions in an extended substrate-binding site. The best-known natural substrate. angiotensin I. is cleaved to generate vasoactive angiotensin II. Selectivity of angiotensin cleavage depends in major part on interactions involving substrate residues on the carboxyl-terminal (P1'-P2') side of the cleaved bond.

Beluga liver microsomes oxidized 3.3′.4.4′-TCB at rates averaging 21 and 5 pmol/min per mg for males and females. respectively. while pilot whale samples oxidized this congener at 0.3 pmol/min per mg or less. However. rates of 3.3′.4.4′-TCB metabolism correlated with immunodetected CYP1A1 protein content in liver microsomes of both species. The CYPIA inhibitor α-naphthoflavone inhibited 3.3′.4.4′-TCB metabolism by 40% in beluga. supporting a role for a cetacean CYP1A as a catalyst of this activity. Major metabolites of 3.3′.4.4′-TCB generated by beluga liver microsomes were 4-OH-3.3′.4′.5-TCB and 5-OH-3.3′.4.4′-TCB (98% of total). similar to …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,60,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841300001237,312265503269728359,/scholar?cites=312265503269728359,,,0,0,0

Inc.,Livers were collected from six male and six female white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) at both a bleached‐kraft pulp mill effluent (BKME)‐exposed site and a reference site during the 1992 spring spawning migration. A semistandardized methodology for 7‐ethoxyresorufin‐O‐deethylase (EROD) analysis was proposed that featured similar physical and chemical conditions yet allowed for different instrumentation and techniques. Postmitochondrial supernatants (PMSs) were analyzed for EROD activity by 14 laboratories. and repeat EROD analyses were performed within one laboratory to estimate within‐laboratory variability.

The ability of SDF-1α to induce IANK cell chemotaxis is inhibited upon incorporating antibodies to the α subunit of Goand Gqbut not Gi. Gs. or Gz. whereas (Ca++)imobilization is inhibited with anti-Gi. anti-Gqand anti-Gs. but not with any other anti-G proteins examined. Further analysis showed that antibody to phospholipase C (PLC)β but not PLCγ inhibited SDF-1α-induced (Ca++)imobilization. suggesting that this signal is mediated by G protein coupled receptor and not by tyrosine kinase receptors. Our results are the first to show that SDF-1α is chemoattractant for NK cells. and that this effect is coupled to G proteins.,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X97969370,605465014860235900,/scholar?cites=605465014860235900,,,0,0,0

Fish acclimated at 5 °C possessed greater levels of G6PD. H6PD. and 6PGD activity than those fish maintained at 10 or 15 °C. This phenomenon was probably associated with increased lipogenesis during cold acclimation.During starvation hepatic G6PD and 6PGD activities decreased. whereas H6PD activity increased slightly. Upon refeeding. the G6PD level gradually increased. but the “overshoot” in enzyme activity reported in mammalian studies was not observed.When both cold acclimation and starvation were studied simultaneously. regulation by temperature was initially the dominant control factor.

The identity of these products was established by mass spectrometry of metabolites formed by scup (S. chrysops) liver microsomes compared with the spectra obtained for authentic trans-dihydrodiols. Whereas the benzo-ring dihydrodiols equaled 40-60% of the total ethyl acetate-soluble metabolites formed by liver microsomes of the various species. the K-region metabolite BP-4. 5-dihydrodiol was formed in small or undetectable amounts. Microsomal preparations of kidney and gill from S. chrysops formed BP-7. 8-dihydrodiol and BP-9. 10-dihydrodiol in proportions like those seen with liver of the same species. Embryonic tissues of F. heteroclitus metabolized BP with a regiospecificity similar to that exhibited by adult liver microsomes. Isomeric forms of BP-7. 8-dihydrodiol are potent proximate carcinogens. and activation of BP to mutagenic and carcinogenic derivatives is associated with metabolism on the benzo ring of BP.

In the absence of other recent sources and due to its short half-life. only those parts of the Pacific Ocean would have detectable 134Cs values that were impacted by Fukushima releases. Between March and May 2011. 134Cs was not detected around the Hawaiian Islands and Guam. Here. most 137Cs activities (1.2–1.5 Bq m–3) were in the range of expected preexisting levels. Some samples north of the Hawaiian Islands (1.6–1.8 Bq m–3) were elevated above the 23-month baseline established in surface seawater in Hawaii indicating that those might carry atmospheric fallout. The 23-month time-series analysis of surface seawater from Hawaii did not reveal any seasonal variability or trends. with an average activity of 1.46 ± 0.06 Bq m–3 (Station Aloha. 18 values).

To determine if 8-to 26-month old oil remaining in some spawning areas produced physiological responses in developing pink salmon eggs and alevins. we conducted an initial assessment of cytochrome P-4501A induction and histopathologic lesion occurrence in preemergent pink salmon collected from oiled spawning substrates. Egg and alevin samples were collected from four oiled and five reference sites in Prince William Sound. Alaska. between December 1989 and May 1991. Immunohistochemical staining for cytochrome P-4501A was increased in alevins from 13 of 16 samples from oiled sites. but was not increased in any of the 7 samples from the reference sites. Cytochrome P-4501A induction was not detected in egg samples from either oiled or control sites. Persistent P-4501A staining through the end of the study was evidence for chronic exposure of two year-classes of pink salmon to hydrocarbon contamination. Histopathologic lesions were more frequent in alevins from oiled sites. but differences were not statistically significant. and lesion occurrence seemed dependent on developmental stage. These results provide evidence that pink salmon alevins developing in heavily oiled sites were exposed to hydrocarbons more than 2 years after the initial spill and that the hydrocarbons induced detectable physiological changes.

This finding suggests an unusually long half-life for teleost CYP1A. We examined directly the half-live of hepatic microsomal CYP1A protein and heme moieties in F. heteroclitus. by measuring the incorporation and disposition of [3H]-leucine and [14C]-5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in fish that had been treated with the CYP1A inducer beta-naphthoflavone prior to administration of label. Incorporation of [3H]-leucine into trichlororacetic acid-precipitable (total) microsomal protein and into immunoprecipitated CYP1A protein peaked between 1.5 to 4 hours. Incorporation of [14C]-ALA into total microsomal (heme) protein peaked at 24 hours. and into the heme of CYP1A at 8 hours. Loss of label from total microsomal protein was biphasic. giving half-lives of 8 and 138 hours for bulk protein. and 66 and 141 hours for heme. CYP1A apoprotein had a half-life of 32 to 39 hours based on isotopic loss and 43 hours calculated from the kinetics of enzyme induction. The apparent half-life of CYP1A heme was approximately 100 hours. which was substantially greater than the protein half-life. in contrast to mammalian P450s. in which half-lives for protein and heme are similar.

However. causative linkages between the role of these chemicals and observed endocrine-related abnormalities are virtually nonexistent. Three exceptions exist in humans: a) associations between high polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polychlorinated dibenzodioxin and dibenzofuran (PCDD/PCDF) exposure in utero and possibly via breast-feeding. and neurobehavioral deficits; b) increasing support for an association between breast cancer risk and exposure to PCB and/or DDTs; and c) one study demonstrating an association between dieldrin exposure and breast cancer risk and mortality. In wildlife species. however. strong evidence in laboratory. field studies. and semifield studies with harbor seals from the Dutch Wadden Sea have shown correlations between contaminant exposure and endocrine-related effects such as developmental-. reproductive-. and immune-associated toxicities.

CYP1s other than the CYP1As are poorly studied in birds. Here we characterize avian CYP1B and CYP1C genes and the expression of the identified CYP1 genes and AHR1. comparing basal and induced levels in chicken and quail embryos.   Methodology/Principal Findings We cloned cDNAs of chicken CYP1C1 and quail CYP1B1 and AHR1. CYP1Cs occur in several bird genomes. but we found no CYP1C gene in quail. The CYP1C genomic region is highly conserved among vertebrates. This region also shares some synteny with the CYP1B region. consistent with CYP1B and CYP1C genes deriving from duplication of a common ancestor gene. Real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed similar tissue distribution patterns for CYP1A4. CYP1A5. CYP1B1. and AHR1 mRNA in chicken and quail embryos. with the highest basal expression of the CYP1As in liver. and of CYP1B1 in eye. brain. and heart. Chicken CYP1C1 mRNA levels were appreciable in eye and heart but relatively low in other organs. Basal transcript levels of the CYP1As were higher in quail than in chicken. while CYP1B1 levels were similar in the two species. 3.3′.4.5.5′-Pentachlorobiphenyl induced all CYP1s in chicken; in quail a 1000-fold higher dose induced the CYP1As. but not CYP1B1.   Conclusions/Significance The apparent absence of CYP1C1 in quail. and weak expression and induction of CYP1C1 in chicken suggest that CYP1Cs have diminishing roles in tetrapods; similar tissue expression suggests that …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC,11,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028257,775260447290098459,/scholar?cites=775260447290098459,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028257,0,0,0

96218,Catalytic properties of scup cytochrome P4501A expressed in Chinese hamster V79 cells,1998,JJ Stegeman and V Soballa and HG Morrison and J Jacob and J Doehmer,1,Marine Environmental Research,46,395,,CYP functions may determine an organism's susceptibility to toxic chemicals.  Most fish CYP1As have been classified as CYP1A1 (Nelson et al. (1996) Pharmacogenetics 6. 1-42) but may be like ancestral genes that diverged to CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in mammals.  This might be evident in catalytic function of fish CYP1As.  To test this hypothesis. an expression plasmid bearing a scup CYP1A cDNA was transfected into Chinese hamster V79 cells. which then expressed authentic and active scup CYP1A.  These V79 cells were exposed to phenanthrene (Ph). chrysene (Ch). benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph) or benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and metabolites analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS.  Sites of attack by the expressed scup CYP1A were 1.2- and 3.4-Ph. 1.2- and 3.4-Ch. and 3.4- and 5.6-BcP.  Comparing these patterns to those formed by human and rat CYP1A1 or 1A2 expressed in V79 cells showed that Ph and B(c)Ph metabolism by scup CYP1A1 resembled that of human 1A2. Ch metabolism resembled that of human 1A1 and rat 1A1. As with induced scup liver microsomes. purified and reconstituted scup CYP1A and antibody inhibition studies. expressed scup CYP1A oxidized BaP at the 7.8- and the 9.10-positions more efficiently than mammalian 1A1 or 1A2. Activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and PAH dihydrodiols to cytotoxic derivatives by expressed scup CYP1A also showed similarities to CYP1A1 or CYP1A2.  Thus. scup CYP1A1 has catalytic properties resembling both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 from mammals. consistent with the possibility that teleost CYP1As represent a type ancestral to both mammalian 1A forms.

96224,Effects of Triphenyltin on the Hepatic Mono-oxygenase System in Marine Fish.,1996,Karl Fent and Bruce Woodin and John J Stegeman,1,Marine Environmental Research,42,51-52,,The interaction of triphenyltin chloride (TPT) with fish microsomal mono-oxygenase system has been studied in vitro and in vivo in marine scup (Stenotomus chrysops). TPT is employed as a fungicide in agriculture. but finds also application in antifouling paints. leading to direct contamination of aquatic systems. Incubation in vitro of scup microsomes led to a strong concentration related inhibition of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activity. About 40% of the native total spectral P450 is converted to P420. This suggests either some specificity for the EROD catalyst CYP1A1 form. or loss of reductant NADPH cytochrome c reductase as the cause. Further in vitro incubations showed that NADPH. but not NADH. cytochrome c reductase was strongly inhibited at 10 [mu    ]M TPT and higher. To further investigate this effect. fish were injected with single doses of 5. 25. and 50 [mu ]M TPT (1.9. 9.6. 19.3 mg/kg TPT). and 24 and 48 h later. hepatic microsomes were analyzed for EROD activity. total P450 content and three CYP forms by immunoblotting. and NAD(P)H cytochrome c reductase.

Evaluation of the risk to these animals requires an understanding of their capacity to respond to contaminant exposure. including the activity and regulation of enzymes involved in pollutant metabolism. such as the cytochromes P450. These studies focused on the presence and metabolic capabilities of P450 subfamilies 1A and 2B in livers of fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the Pribiloff Islands Alaska. A CYP1A1-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb 1-12-3) recognized a single band on immunoblots of hepatic microsomal protein from adult seals and pups. This apparent seal CYP1A form showed variable expression. suggesting induction by environmental chemicals in some animals. Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD activity. specific for CYP1A forms in other vertebrates. was correlated with P4501A protein levels. Levels of the CYP2B-associated activity pentoxyresorufin O-deethylase (PROD) were very low and were highly correlated with EROD activity. suggesting that there is a single catalyst (CYP1A). Other investigators have speculated that CYP2B function is reduced in pinnipeds. based on patterns of PCB congeners in blubber.

The oceans are the ultimate sink for many chemicals of anthropogenic origin but also are a source of naturally occurring toxins (and pharmacological agents). Certain classes of marine pollutants—especially persistent organic chemicals such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons—are globally distributed. occurring even in the most remote areas such as polar regions. the open ocean. and the deep sea (Ballschmiter and others 1997; Muir and others 1988; Stegeman and others 1986). In many coastal areas. the concentrations of chemicals in the environment are extremely high (eg. Weaver 1984).Marine pollutants have been classified primarily on the basis of their chemical structure (eg. polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) or original source or use (eg. petroleum hydrocarbons or pesticides). Increasingly. however. chemicals are being grouped by functional characteristics. ie. properties related to shared effects or mechanisms of action (eg.“endocrine disruptors”[Limbird and Taylor 1998; McLachlan 1993; NRC 1999]).

The CYP1A form is widely used as a biomarker of exposure to organic pollutants. CYP1A induction involves the activation of a specific receptor. the aryl hydrocarbon. Metabolism of petroleum hydrocarbons by CYP1A results in the biotransformation of the parental compound into more toxic forms. These intermediary metabolites are highly reactive and are known to be carcinogenic because they bind to DNA. modifying its structure and function. Analysis of CYP1A induction may therefore indicate the susceptibility of organisms to the toxic effects of petroleum hydrocarbons.In the Amazon basin. petroleum extraction began in 1988 at Coari (Brazil).

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year. enormous economic losses. erosion of human capital. and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important. but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers. government leaders. international organizations. civil society. and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health. identify gaps in knowledge. project future trends. and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread. worsening. and in most countries poorly controlled.

The approach involves cloning and sequencing of selected genes to determine new and fundamental aspects of the biochemistry and molecular biology of P450 genes in fish. as related to the influence of xenobiotics on the expression of fish P450 genes. Multiple P450 gene families occur in fish. yet only a single P450. cytochrome P4501A. has been studied in detail at the level of structure. function. and regulation in more than one fish species.

Sterol 14α-demethylation is an essential step in this pathway and is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51). In M. capsulatus. the enzyme consists of the P450 domain naturally fused to a ferredoxin domain at the C-terminus (CYP51fx). The structure of M. capsulatus CYP51fx was solved to 2.7 Å resolution and is the first structure of a bacterial sterol biosynthetic enzyme. The structure contained one P450 molecule per asymmetric unit with no electron density seen for ferredoxin.

PWS sites were divided in three oiling categories based upon 1989 shoreline assessments: non-spill path (NSP). spill path oiled (SPO) and spill path notoiled (SPNO). Rockfish (N= 177). rock sole (N= 30) and kelp greenling (N= 49) were collected at nearshore locations (~ 50–500 m from shore); Pacific halibut (N= 131) and Pacific cod (N= 81) were collected further off-shore (~ 500–7000 m). Fish were assayed for bile fluorescent aromatic contaminants (FAC) and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) levels measured as liver ethoxyresorufin 0-deethylase (EROD) activity and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of various tissues. For all species studied at all sites. bile FACconcentrations and CYP1A levels were low and in the same range for fish caught at PWS SPO and SPNO sites relative to non-spill path sites in PWS and theGOA. Consequently. the hypothesis is rejected for the species studied. The bile FACresults further indicate a pervasive exposure of fish at all sites. including those in the GOA far-removed from the effects of the spill. to low levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Analysis of the benthic sediments indicates that the probable sources of this exposure are petrogenic hydrocarbons derived from natural oil seeps and eroding sedimentary rocks in the eastern GOA.(Published in: Marine Environmental …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/41259717/Biomarkers_in_Fish_from_Prince_William_S20160115-2938-5k4y8l.pdf,17521385595247103802,/scholar?cites=17521385595247103802,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41259717/Biomarkers_in_Fish_from_Prince_William_S20160115-2938-5k4y8l.pdf,0,0,0

Skin and heart samples were placed in buffered formalin until immunohistochemical (IMHC) analysis for cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A). Scaup treated with BNF at 20 or 100 mg/kg body weight showed approximately 20-to 65-fold increases in four MOs. Responses of two of the four MOs were as high at 20 mg/kg as at 100mg/kg.

Degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. specific to highly conserved regions of mammalian CYP3A genes. were used to amplify a 400-bp fragment from Fundulus heteroclitus liver cDNA.  This fragment was isolated from two separate PCR-reactions and cloned into a pT7Blue(R) vector.  The 124-amino acid sequence deduced from two separate clones was aligned with corresponding sequences from representative members from each of the CYP1. CYP2. CYP3 and CYP4 gene families.  Phylogenetic analyses showed that F. heteroclitus was more than 60% identical to the corresponding region of 21 different mammalian CYP3A genes.  Thus. the fish sequence and all mammalian CYP3A sequences cluster together when compared to sequences of other members of other CYP gene families 1. 2 and 4.  These data indicate that the obtained sequence from F. heteroclitus is a part of a CYP3A gene from this vertebrate phylum.

Previously. a P450 (P450B) was purified from scup liver and found to be structurally related to mammalian CYP2B.  We investigated the role of this scup CYP2B-like protein in metabolism of tetrachlorobiphenyls (TCBs). comparing the metabolism of 3.3'.4.4'-TCB and 2.2'.5.5'-TCB.  Hepatic microsomes from feral scup metabolized 3.3'.4.4'-TCB and 2.2'.5.5'-TCB at rates of 0.13 and 2.1 pmol/min/mg protein. respectively.  Rates of 2.2'.5.5'-TCB metabolism were strongly correlated with microsomal 'CYP2B' content. both of which were significantly greater in feral than in depurated fish.  The 3.3'.4.4'-TCB. a strong competitive inhibitor of CYP1A. inhibited both EROD and MROD activity while 2.2'.5.5'-TCB did not.  Neither TCB congener inhibited metabolism of the other.  Polyclonal antibodies against scup P450B strongly inhibited 2.2'.5.5'-TCB metabolism but polyclonal antibodies to scup CYP1A did not.  Thus. correlation analysis and inhibition studies indicate that distinct enzymes are the major catalysts of 3.3'.4.4'-TCB and 2.2'.5.5'-TCB metabolism and that 'CYP2B' (P450B) from scup catalyzes 2.2'.5.5'-TCB metabolism.  Metabolism of 2.2'.5.5'-TCB and other ortho-substituted congeners with adjacent. unsubstituted meta-para positions is catalysed by CYP2B enzymes in mammals.  Assignment of a known CYP2B catalytic function to the scup CYP2B-like protein supports the evidence that this is a CYP2B homologue.  Phenobarbital-type induction has not been documented in fish.

In addition. there is evidence to suggest that the nature of the activating mutation may be a consequence of specific chemical carcinogen-DNA interaction. Therefore. the authors sought to determine whether a relationship exists between PAH-DNA chemistry and chemically-induced genetic changes in end-stage liver tumors. Recently. they have demonstrated that a flounder c-Ki-{und ras} oncogene was present in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts transfected with DNA derived from a flounder liver tumor. Therefore. a more systematic study to detect oncogenes in affected flounder liver samples was undertaken. To characterize the oncogenes. DNA from the Nu-Nu tumors was isolated and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization of tumor DNA with a viral Ki-{und ras} DNA probe. This analysis revealed the presence of c-Ki-{und ras} oncogenes of fish origin in 6/7 (86%) of the Nu-Nu tumor DNAs analyzed. They hypothesize that common mechanisms of oncogene activation may be associated with tumor initiation.

One key response is the induction of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) transcription. PXR is a promiscuous receptor activated by a wide range of ligands that can differ across species. making functional studies on its role in the chemical defensome. most relevant when approached in a species-specific manner. Genetic knockout studies in mammals have shown a requirement for PXR in ligand-dependent activation of CYP3A expression or reporter gene activity. Transient knockdown in zebrafish revealed a similar requirement. however it is not known what the effect of a genetic knockout would be in the zebrafish model. Here. we report on generation of two zebrafish lines each carrying a genetic deletion in the pxr coding region. predicted to result in loss of a functional gene product. To our surprise zebrafish larvae. homozygous for either of the pxr mutant alleles. retain their ability to induce cyp3a65 mRNA expression following exposure to the established zebrafish Pxr ligand. pregnenolone (PN). Thus. zebrafish carrying pxr alleles with sizable deletions in either the DNA binding or the ligand binding domains do not yield a loss-of-function phenotype. suggesting that a compensatory mechanism is responsible for cyp3a65 induction. Two alternative possibilities are that Pxr is not required for the effect or that truncated yet functional mutant Pxr is sufficient for the effect.,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:m4fbC6XIj1kC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/652743v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/05/30/652743.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth. Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis. we conclude that the lungfish. and not the coelacanth. is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods. unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity. nitrogen excretion and the development of fins. tail. ear. eye. brain and olfaction.

96312,Pregnane X receptor and aryl hydrocarbon receptor both participate in regulation of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2s and CYP3s) in developing zebrafish,2013,Akira KUBOTA and Benjamin LEMAIRE and Matthew TAKATA and Bruce WOODIN and Jared GOLDSTONE and John STEGEMAN,,,,1003039,The Japanese Society of Toxicology,We addressed roles of the pregnane X receptor (PXR. also steroid X receptor SXR) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in regulation of cytochrome P450 CYP2 and CYP3 genes in developing zebrafish exposed to potential agonists for the PXR and AHR. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one (pregnenolone) or carrier (DMSO) for 24 h. starting at 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). and then harvested at day 3. We also exposed one-day-old embryos to 3. 3’. 4. 4’. 5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB126) or DMSO for 24 h and then held in clean water until day 4. Pregnenolone caused a concentration-dependent increase in mRNA expression of PXR. some of the CYP2AAs. as well as CYP3A65 and CYP3C1. all of which peaked at 3 μM and then declined. PCB126 also upregulated the transcript levels of those genes in most cases in a concentration-dependent manner. We next examined the role of the PXR and AHR in the modified expression of those potential target genes by using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) to block initiation of the translation. Treatment of embryos with PXR-MO. but not control-MO. partially inhibited pregnenolone-induced expression of PXR. CYP2 and CYP3 genes. Similarly. AHR2-MO treatment blocked PCB126-induced transcript expression of PXR and some CYP2 and CYP3 genes. The present study shows that PXR not only is self-upregulated. but also upregulated via activation of AHR2 in zebrafish embryos. Selected zebrafish CYP2 and CYP3 genes appear to be under the regulation of PXR and AHR2. They include some CYP2AAs that were first identified in zebrafish.,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/toxpt/40.1/0/40.1_1003039/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0,0,0
96313,The cytochrome P450 genesis locus: the origin and evolution,2013,David R Nelson and Jared V Goldstone and John J Stegeman,,,,,,The neighbourhoods of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes in deuterostome genomes. as well as those of the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Acropora digitifera and the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens were examined to find clues concerning the evolution of CYP genes in animals. CYP genes created by the 2R whole genome duplications in chordates have been identified. Both microsynteny and macrosynteny were used to identify genes that coexisted near CYP genes in the animal ancestor. We show that all 11 CYP clans began in a common gene environment. The evidence implies the existence of a single locus. which we term the ‘cytochrome P450 genesis locus’. where one progenitor CYP gene duplicated to create a tandem set of genes that were precursors of the 11 animal CYP clans: CYP Clans 2. 3. 4. 7. 19. 20. 26. 46. 51. 74 and mitochondrial. These early CYP genes existed side by side before the origin of cnidarians. possibly with a few additional genes interspersed. The Hox gene cluster. WNT genes. an NK gene cluster and at least one ARF gene were close neighbours to this original CYP locus. According to this evolutionary scenario. the CYP74 clan originated from animals and not from land plants nor from a common ancestor of plants and animals. The CYP7 and CYP19 families that are chordate-specific belong to CYP clans that seem to have originated in the CYP genesis locus as well. even though this requires many gene losses to explain their current distribution. The approach to uncovering the CYP genesis locus overcomes confounding effects because of gene conversion. sequence divergence. gene birth and death …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Nelson3/publication/234087122_The_cytochrome_P450_genesis_locus_The_origin_and_evolution_of_animal_cytochrome_P450s/links/53ef80bf0cf23733e812d568.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Nelson3/publication/234087122_The_cytochrome_P450_genesis_locus_The_origin_and_evolution_of_animal_cytochrome_P450s/links/53ef80bf0cf23733e812d568.pdf,0,0,0

Oxidation rates of some substrates (eg. 3. 3’. 4. 4’-tetrachlorobiphenyl-TCB) differ by orders of magnitude between fish and mammal CYP1As. In contrast. benzo [a] pyrene (B [a] P) is metabolized at similar rates. but with slightly differing regiospecificity. TCB and B [a] P were docked to ensembles of homology models. to explore the structural basis of these catalytic differences. Multiple models. based on multiple templates and a consensus of these. were constructed for rat. human. scup and/or killifish CYP1A (1) s. Multiple dockings to each model gave distributions of docked poses for each enzyme. TCB docked closer to the heme more frequently in rat or human CYP1A1 than in fish CYP1A. Analysis of residues interacting with the substrate suggested that docking differences were due primarily to Leu387 and Val230 in killifish CYP1A. TCB was docked to models of killifish CYP1A mutated in silico to the corresponding residues in human CYP1A1. initially L387V and V230G. and then to models with additional residues mutated. Docking profiles in the mutated enzyme were nearly identical to those of human CYP1A1. The results support the hypothesis that structural constraints impede oxidation of chlorinated AHR agonists in fish CYP1As. Multiple dockings of B [a] P to consensus models of mammalian and fish CYP1As yielded frequencies of substrate orientations corresponding to known regiospecificities for B [a] P metabolism by these enzymes.

96318,Organic Pollutants,2008,CHRISTOPHER M REDDY and JOHN J STEGEMAN and MARK E HAHN,,Oceans and human health: risks and remedies from the seas,,121,Academic Press,During the course of the 20th century. the planet became and is now chemically different from any previous time. The difference we speak of is that resulting from the introduction of synthetic chemicals that had not existed before. or from chemicals formed by natural processes that previously had existed only in trace amounts but now occur in greatly increased abundance because of human activity. The abundance. persistence. and distribution pathways mean that many such chemicals often end up in the oceans. Depending on chemical use and disposal practices. this often means the coastal ocean. This chapter focuses on those organic chemicals. which because of abundance. persistence. and biological activity (intended or unintended) may pose risks to the health and well-being both of organisms in the sea as well as humans potentially exposed to these chemicals via contaminated marine resources. Concerns about possible effects of these chemicals thus can be viewed under the rubric of “oceans and human health” or. conversely. of “humans and ocean health.” Many thousands of different chemicals have been made since the chemical industries became established (Muir and Howard. 2006). One may distinguish these chronologically. according to when they were made. The period of the 1930s through the 1960s saw new structures. including many pesticides (insecticides. fungicides. and herbicides). Common insecticides include 1. 1. 1-trichloro-2. 2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT) and toxaphene. and herbicides include 2. 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2. 4-D) and 2. 4. 5-trichlorophenoxyacetic …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=LMZPqW-PmFYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA121&dq=info:YoJg3-V1T1kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=4Ec9tYCGQz&sig=IxC-G6BbOoMy2DPS74Csu4-70ss,,,,,0,0,0

The classes of compounds that typically cause environmental induction of CYP1A are therefore coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). tetrachlorodibenzodioxins (TCDDs). and tetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDFs). Noncoplanar PCBs induce the CYP2B family. The CYPs are thus biomarkers for environmental exposure to these classes of compounds. Because all animals appear to be capable of the CYP1A induction response. the possible applications of this technique are widespread. It has been used in both the aquatic and the terrestrial areas. and it can be used in regard to questions about contamination in a species or in a habitat. There are many approaches to evaluating the CYP status of organisms. They vary both in the techniques used to assess CYPs and in the sampling required to perform the assessment. At the most basic level the sampling methods can be divided into lethal and nonlethal. This includes both the development and validation procedures and the utilization of the proven methodology in the field. In some cases the species to be studied are abundant. such as carp (Cyprinus carpio). sucker (Catostomus commersoni). European starling (Sternus vulgaris). tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor). mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos). and mouse (Peromyscus sp.) so the sacrifice of individual organisms for the development and validation procedures and the utilization of the proven methodology does not have a serious effect on the resource.(Even for …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.8206&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.8206&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Integument biopsies were collected from freeranging bottlenose and common dolphin in offshore waters of the western Atlantic Ocean. between Georges Bank and Cape Hatteras NC. CYPlAl expression was determined inmiunohistochemically. to identify if regional variation in the expression of CYPlAl within a species could be identified within a small segment of an ocean basin. CYPlAl expression was similar between most cell types that expressed the protein. and between both species. CYPlAl expression. in both species. varied within the dermis of a given biopsy and endothelial cells in the lower dermis expressed higher CYPlAl. as had been seen in other bottlenose dolphin samples (Chapter 4). CYPlAl expression in endothelial cells of the lower dermis appeared to be correlated with the relative amount of adipocytes in bottlenose dolphin. A similar analysis was not performed with common dolphin. Geographical variation in CYPlAl expression was addressed by comparing CYPlAl expression and latitude and longitude. No simple relationship between these variables existed and no variation was seen in the common dolphin samples. More complex geographical variation in CYPlAl expression from bottlenose dolphin seemed evident from comparisons of CYPlAl expression along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients or by grouping samples into broad regions.

Hallmarks of embryonic exposure include cardiac malformation. impaired circulation. loss of erythrocytes. pericardial and yolk sac edema. and early life stage mortality. However. the mechanism of TCDD cardiovascular embryotoxicity is poorly understood. The primary goal of this thesis was to identify TCDD-responsive genes likely to be involved in processes of toxicity. We constructed microarays using cDNA librares derived from zebrafish embryonic and adult hear tissue. Embryonic hear arays were used for protocol development. The resulting workfow was employed in the production of adult hear micro arays containing-2800 unique cardiovascular genes. These arays were used to establish gene expression profiles of zebrafish embryos exposed to 1.84: t. 42 or 1O. 74: t. 1.38 ng TCDD/g embryo. Alterations in cardiovascular gene expression were limited; 44 genes or ESTs were significantly differentially expressed 2: 1.8-fold (p-values: S5x10-4). and only CYPIA and CYPIBI were induced::-fold. Transcriptional responses to TCDD were highly dose-dependent. and adaptive responses were a prevalent feature of TCDD-modulated gene expression. Microaray analyses indicated induction of genes in three major funptional classesxenobiotic detoxification. sarcomere structure. and energy transfer.

This protein is induced by exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) such as non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 2. Immunohistochemistry revealed that cytochrome P450 lAl (CYPlAl) protein was highly expressed in several internal organs of beluga whale from two locations in the Arctic and from the St. Lawrence estuary. The pattern and extent of CYPlAl expression in these whales are similar to those seen in animal models that are strongly induced. The strong induction of beluga CYPlAl even at the lower doses of environmental contaminants in the Arctic suggests that this species is highly sensitive to CYPlAl inducers. The high level of CYPlAl expression coupled with high levels of contaminants that include CYPlAl substrates in St. Lawrence beluga indicate that CYPlAl could be involved in the development of neoplastic lesions seen in the St. Lawrence beluga whale population 3.

Such measurements alone are insufficient to indicate the likelihood of biological effects from contaminant exposure. especially for contaminants that do not bioaccumulate. Cytochrome P450 1 Al (CYPl Al) in mammals is induced by and involved in the metabolism of planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). chemicals of concern in aquatic systems. CYPl A induction is a molecular effect of exposure to these inducers in many vertebrates. Here we summarize studies of CYPlAl expression detected immunohistochemically in integument (epidermis and blubber) collected by biopsy or at necropsy from 17 species of cetaceans. CYPl Al expression was detected in all species. but varied both within and between species. CYPlAl levels in mysticetes were generally similar to those in odontocetes. Assessing how differences between individuals. populations or species affect CYPlAl expression in cetacean integument is essential to the interpretation of this induction as a biomarker of exposure to and effects of contaminants.

FL: Academic Press. c1998-,New Bedford Harbor (NBH). MA. is a federal Superfund site that is heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs). including some potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists. A population of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) continues to inhabit this site. despite accumulating extraordinarily high concentrations of PCBs (272 mug/g dry weight). To determine if NBH killifish have developed resistance to HAHs that act through the AhR. we examined the inducibility of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1). UDP glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in fish from NBH and a reference site. Scorton Creek (SC. Cape Cod. MA; PCB concentrations 0.177 mug/g dry weight). 2.3.7.8-Tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) induced CYP1A1 mRNA. protein. and activity in SC fish in all tissues examined (liver. heart. gut. gill. kidney …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2935704509006701978&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Polyclonal antibodies to P-450E. the major BNF-inducible scup P-450 isozyme. stimulated 2-hydroxylation in microsomes from BNF-treated scup by 80% but did not affect the activity in control microsomes. This first description of 2-OH E 2 formation by teleosts shows that it is a major microsomal activity in fish. The sex differences in E 2 2-hydroxylation indicate the catalysts is regulated by sex hormones. Stimulation of this activity by anti-P-450E suggests that BNF-induced P-450 isozymes with intrinsically low E 2 2-hydroxylase activity may also bind factors necessary for E 2 metabolism by other isozymes.

National Cancer Institute,Microsomal preparations of liver from adults of several (teleost) fish species. including scup (Stenotomus chrysops). winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). and killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). metabolized the model polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo [apyrene (BP) with a marked regiospecificity. forming high percentages of benzo-ring deriva-tives. but particularly BP-7. 8-dihydrodiol and BP-9. 10-dihy-drodiol. The identity of these products was established by mass spectrometry of metabolites formed by scup (S. chrysops) liver microsomes compared with the spectra obtained for authentic trans-dihydrodiols. Whereas the benzo-ring dihydrodiols equaled40-60% of the total ethyl acetate-soluble metabolites formed by liver microsomes of the various species. the K-region metabolite BP-4. 5-dihydrodiol was formed in small or undetectable amounts. Microsomal preparations of kidney and gill from S. chrysops formed BP-7. 8-dihydrodiol and BP-9. 10-dihydrodiol in propor-tions like those seen with liver of the same species. Embryonic tissues of F. heteroclitus metabolized BP with a regiospecificity similar to that exhibited by adult liver microsomes. Isomeric forms of BP-7. 8-dihydrodiol are potent proximate carcinogens. and activation of BP to mutagenic and carcinogenic derivatives is associated with metabolism on the benzo ring of BP. The widespread appearance of regiospecificity for this portion of the BP molecule may be reflected in structural requirements for metabolism of other hydrocarbons and indicate that fish are useful in the study of various factors that affect tumorigenesis by polycyclic hydrocarbons.–Natl Cancer Inst …,True,vJvCpvkAAAAJ:TesyEGJKHF4C,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vL5rAAAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA371&dq=info:tA-bzfU8CUcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ZBmUjqQQLA&sig=bnB2zlNutL18PKoaKzHLXGN1M2Q,,,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vL5rAAAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA371&dq=info:tA-bzfU8CUcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ZBmUjqQQLA&sig=bnB2zlNutL18PKoaKzHLXGN1M2Q,0,0,0

96457,1Q2 Environmental contaminants activate human and polar bear 2 (Ursus maritimus) pregnane X receptors (PXR. NR1I2) differently,,John J Stegeman and Bruce Blumberg and Anders Goksøyr,,,,,,22 Background: Many persistent organic pollutants (POPs) accumulate readily in polar bears because of their 23 position as apex predators in Arctic food webs. The pregnane X receptor (PXR. formally NR1I2. here proposed 24 to be named promiscuous xenobiotic receptor) is a xenobiotic sensor that is directly involved in metabolizing 25 pathways of a wide range of environmental contaminants. 26 Objectives: In the present study. we comparably assess the ability of 51 selected pharmaceuticals. pesticides and 27 emerging contaminants to activate PXRs from polar bears and humans using an in vitro luciferase reporter gene 28 assay.29 Results: We found that polar bear PXR is activated by a wide range of our test compounds (68%) but has a slightly 30 more narrow ligand specificity than human PXR that was activated by 86% of the 51 test compounds. The major-31 ity of the agonists identified (70%) produces a stronger induction of the reporter gene via human PXR than via 32 polar bear PXR. however with some notable and environmentally relevant exceptions. 33 Conclusions: Due to the observed differences in activation of polar bear and human PXRs. exposure of each species 34 to environmental agents is likely to induce biotransformation differently in the two species. Bioinformatics 35 analyses and structural modeling studies suggest that amino acids that are not part of the ligand-binding domain 36 and do not interact with the ligand can modulate receptor activation. 37© 2015 The Authors.
