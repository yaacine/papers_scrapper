1103348,Water stability and adsorption in metal–organic frameworks,2014,Nicholas C Burtch and Himanshu Jasuja and Krista S Walton,114,,20,10575-10612,American Chemical Society,1. INTRODUCTION The ability to synthesize porous metal− organic frameworks (MOFs) with prescribed structural features (Figure 1) has led to intense interest in the materials for selective adsorption processes. The hybrid nature of MOFs provides an almost infinite set of building blocks that can be manipulated to target specific adsorption behavior by introducing open metal sites and functional groups into the structure. or by further modulating the properties by postsynthetic modification. 1− 6 To date. much of the experimental and theoretical research on MOF applications has centered on adsorption simulations and measurements. and MOFs have shown high loadings and selectivities for various target gases. Investigations of gas storage (hydrogen/methane) and carbon dioxide capture from flue gas have been a particular focus. 7− 10MOF behavior in the presence of water is a topic of significant importance when …,True,cDm-deAAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,1320,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr5002589,9512115736005543470,/scholar?cites=9512115736005543470,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.719.5926&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1103349,Applicability of the BET method for determining surface areas of microporous metal− organic frameworks,2007,Krista S Walton and Randall Q Snurr,129,Journal of the American Chemical Society,27,8552-8556,American Chemical Society,The surface area is one of the most important quantities for characterizing novel porous materials. The BET analysis is the standard method for determining surface areas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms and was originally derived for multilayer gas adsorption onto flat surfaces. Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of crystalline. porous materials that have been shown to exhibit very large BET surface areas. These materials are microporous and possess surfaces that are far from flat. In some MOFs. adsorption occurs through a pore-filling mechanism rather than by layer formation. Thus. it is unclear whether BET surface area numbers reported for these materials are truly meaningful. Given the standard practice of reporting BET surface areas for novel porous materials. a critical test of the BET method is much needed. In this work. grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to predict …,True,cDm-deAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,872,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja071174k,16572688815114966556,/scholar?cites=16572688815114966556,,,0,0,0

1103351,Calculating geometric surface areas as a characterization tool for metal− organic frameworks,2007,Tina Düren and Franck Millange and Gérard Férey and Krista S Walton and Randall Q Snurr,111,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,42,15350-15356,American Chemical Society,Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) synthesized in a building-block approach from organic linkers and metal corner units offer the opportunity to design materials with high surface areas for adsorption applications by assembling the appropriate building blocks. In this paper. we show that the surface area calculated in a geometric fashion from the crystal structure is a useful tool for characterizing MOFs. We argue that the accessible surface area rather than the widely used Connolly surface area is the appropriate surface area to characterize crystalline solids for adsorption applications. The accessible surface area calculated with a probe diameter corresponding to the adsorbate of interest provides a simple way to screen and compare adsorbents.

K+. Rb+. and Cs+ and studied by adsorption of CO2. This is the first study to examine adsorption equilibrium isotherms and capacities of CO2 on the alkali metal series for both Y and X zeolites under mild conditions. CO2 capacity increased as Cs < Rb ≈ K < Li ≈ Na for Y zeolites. For X zeolites. the capacity for CO2 increased in the order Cs < Rb < K < Na < Li (the order of decreasing ionic radii). For both zeolites the larger cation forms (Cs. Rb. K) exhibited strongly nonlinear concave downward isotherms. which is indicative of strong interactions between CO2 and the zeolite. This is consistent with an increased basicity of the framework compared to the smaller cation forms. given that CO2 is a weakly acidic gas. This is also reflected by the Henry’s law slopes obtained from the Toth isotherm equation.

However. we show that there are significant changes in chemical and thermal stability of Zr6O4(OH)4 MOFs with the incorporation of different organic linkers. As the number of aromatic rings is increased from one to two in 1.4-benzene dicarboxylate (UiO-66. ZrMOF–BDC) and 4.4′-biphenyl dicarboxylate (UiO-67. ZrMOF–BPDC). the Zr6O4(OH)4 SBU becomes more susceptible to chemical degradation by water and hydrochloric acid. Furthermore. as the linker is replaced with 2.2′-bipyridine-5.5′-dicarboxylate (ZrMOF–BIPY) the chemical stability decreases further as the MOF is susceptible to chemical breakdown by protic chemicals such as methanol and …,True,cDm-deAAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,450,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/ta/c3ta10662d,15803358495167266070,/scholar?cites=15803358495167266070,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA614004.pdf,0,0,0

Structural degradation of the materials after regeneration is analyzed via powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and nitrogen adsorption measurements. MOFs with open metal sites are quite hydrophilic but appear to maintain their structure according to PXRD. However. significant surface area loss indicates that decomposition is occurring and is likely an attribute of oxygen presence during the regeneration procedure.

In this work. UiO-66 has been synthesized with amino-. nitro-. methoxy-. and naphthyl-substituted ligands to impart polar. basic. and hydrophobic characteristics. Pure-component CO2. CH4. N2. and water vapor adsorption isotherms were measured in the materials to study the effect of the functional group on the adsorption behavior. Heats of adsorption were calculated for each pure gas on each material. The results indicate that the amino-functionalized material possesses the best adsorption properties for each pure gas due to a combination of polarity and small functional group size.

The most famous example of a substance that contracts when heated is ice: it transforms into water. which has a higher density than ice. Negative thermal expansion (NTE) in solids is relatively rare. although examples have been found in zeolites.[2] The underlying physics of NTE remains poorly understood. Herein. we show. on the basis of molecular simulations. that the recently synthesized isoreticular metal–organic frameworks (IRMOFs) consistently have negative thermal-expansion coefficients and are by far the most contracting materials known.

Here we show that the efficacy of MOFs for carbon capture depends dramatically on the process and that some MOFs can provide significant carbon capture under typical pressure and vacuum swing processes. In particular. MOFs that possess coordinatively unsaturated metal centers offer as much as 9 mmol g−1 swing capacity under certain conditions.

Deformation enhances the atomic mobility. as quantified by the van Hove function. The enhanced mobility is shown to arise from two mechanisms: First. active deformation continually reduces barriers for hopping events. and the importance of this mechanism is modulated by the rate of thermally activated transitions between adjacent energy minima. Second. deformation moves the system to higher-energy regions of the energy landscape. characterized by lower barriers. Both mechanisms enhance the dynamics during deformation. and the second mechanism is also relevant after deformation has ceased.

We use molecular dynamics simulation to address this problem by carrying out shear and temperature increase simulation on atactic glassy polystyrene. Our results show explicitly that the structure (as quantified by the torsion population) changes associated with shear and temperature increase are quantitatively – and in some cases qualitatively – different. This is due to the competition between rejuvenation and physical aging. and we show this by carrying out a relaxation simulation.

To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon. we carry out two types of simulations: molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. which determine the atomic trajectories at finite temperature. and quasi‐static simulations. which determine the atomic trajectories in the limit of zero temperature (and in the limit of zero shear rate). The quasi‐static simulations show discontinuous changes in properties. such as system energy and atomic mobility.

The 1: 1 stoichiometry for complexes of methyl orange and the quaternized polyCV-vinylimidazole) homopolymers suggests that bindingcapacity is dictated primarily by charge.2. The binding strength between methyl orange andthe quaternized polymers is influenced by (a) Coulombic interaction between the anionic dye and polycations.(b) nonionic interaction between the quaternizing side chain and the dye. and (c) nonionic bound dye-dye interaction. 3. The binding behavior in the saturation range 0< r< 0.7 can be described by the McGhee-von Hippel ex-pression. The bound dye-dye interaction is associated with the aggregation tendency of the dye. which contributes an additional force to the overall polymer-dye interaction. The cooperative binding cannot persist. however. at a higher saturation level. possibly because of the steric hindrance of the two neighboring dye molecules.,True,leOswz4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,386,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00148a028,6209506114615093336,/scholar?cites=6209506114615093336,,,0,0,0

The move consists of a concerted rotation around up to seven adjacent skeletal bonds that leaves the rest of the chain unaffected. No assumption is made concerning the backbone geometry other than that bond lengths and bond angles are held constant during the elementary move. Special sampling techniques are needed because the new move involves a correlated change in seven degrees of freedom along the chain backbone. We use the new move in conjunction with reptation in an isothermal-isobaric Monte Carlo simulation of a bulk tetracosane melt system and find that it improves computational efficiency relative to a purely reptation-based Monte Carlo scheme.

For example. for very rapid chemical reactions. the rate of reaction within the zeolite may be severely limited by the rate of intrazeolite sórbate diffusion. The intracrystalline diffusivity depends on the size and shape of the sórbate molecule relative to that of the zeolite pore. the energetic interactions between the zeolite and the sórbate molecule. and the connectivity and dimensionality of the zeolite pore structure. Since the experimental determinationof sórbate diffusivities is time-consuming. it would be highly desirable to be able to predict the transport rates of sórbate molecules a priori. from fundamental knowledge of the structure and energetics of a zeolite-sorbate system.

Therefore. NP cytotoxicity assessment requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which these engineered nanostructures interact with the cell membrane. In this study. extensive Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the partitioning of an anionic. ligand-decorated NP in model membranes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipids and different concentrations of cholesterol. Spontaneous fusion and translocation of the anionic NP is not observed in any of the 10-µs unbiased MD simulations. indicating that longer timescales may be required for such phenomena to occur. This picture is supported by the free energy analysis. revealing a considerable free energy barrier for NP translocation across the lipid bilayer. 5-µs unbiased MD simulations with the NP inserted in the bilayer core reveal that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligands of the NP surface rearrange to form optimal contacts with the lipid bilayer. leading to the so-called snorkeling effect.

The attractive feature of MOFs is that. by changing the ligand and/or metal. they can be chemically tuned to perform optimally for a given application. In most. if not all. of these applications one also needs a material that has a sufficient mechanical stability. but our understanding of how changes in the chemical structure influence mechanical stability is limited. In this work. we rationalize how the mechanical properties of MOFs are related to framework bonding topology and ligand structure. We illustrate that the functional groups on the organic ligands can either enhance the mechanical stability through formation of a secondary network of nonbonded interactions or soften the material by destabilizing the bonded network of a MOF. In addition. we show that …,True,hrSdliYAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,36,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00157,3970389241544802345,/scholar?cites=3970389241544802345,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00157,0,0,0

One of the proposed mechanisms. in which the deposits affect the processes in the engine. is the adsorption and desorption of fuel components in the pores within the deposit. In this article we investigate this mechanism in more detail by considering single component adsorption of normal and branched alkanes in selected model slit pores representing the structure of the deposits. We further extend these studies to the binary mixture of normal heptane and isooctane. corresponding to a primary reference fuel blend.

The scenario family is characterized by rapid and fossil-fueled development with high socio-economic challenges to mitigation and low socio-economic challenges to adaptation (SSP5). A special focus is placed on the SSP5 marker scenario developed by the REMIND-MAgPIE integrated assessment modeling framework. The SSP5 baseline scenarios exhibit very high levels of fossil fuel use. up to a doubling of global food demand. and up to a tripling of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the century. marking the upper end of the scenario literature in several dimensions.

To advance our understanding of the sources of the differences. 10 global economic models that produce long‐term scenarios were asked to compare a reference scenario with alternate socioeconomic. climate change. and bioenergy scenarios using a common set of key drivers. Several key conclusions emerge from this exercise: First. for a comparison of scenario results to be meaningful. a careful analysis of the interpretation of the relevant model variables is essential. For instance. the use of “real world commodity prices” differs widely across models. and comparing the prices without accounting for their different meanings can lead to misleading results.

A natural question in this context is what will be the ‘transformation pathway’towards stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there? The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways. including the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies?

The IPCC provides. on request. scientific and technical advice to the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its bodies. In response to a 1994 evaluation of the earlier IPCC IS92 emissions scenarios. the 1996 Plenary of the IPCC requested this Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES)(see Appendix I for the Terms of Reference). This report was accepted by the Working Group III (WGIII) plenary session in March 2000. The long-term nature and uncertainty of climate change and its driving forces require scenarios that extend to the end of the 21st century. This Report describes the new scenarios and how they were developed.The SRES scenarios cover a wide range of the main driving forces of future emissions. from demographic to technological and economic developments. As required by the Terms of Reference. none of the scenarios in the set includes any future policies that explicitly address climate change. although all scenarios necessarily encompass various policies of other types. The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive assessment of the literature. six alternative modeling approaches. and an “open process” that solicited wide participation and feedback from many groups and individuals.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound. for each region and sector. is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate. ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone. carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However. stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however. the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured.

Chapter 10 presents results for regional models which operate on smaller spatial scales. Climate change simulations are assessed for the period 1990 to 2100 and are based on a range of scenarios for projected changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosol loadings (direct effect). A few Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) simulations include the effects of ozone and/or indirect effects of aerosols (see Table 9.1 for details). Most integrations1 do not include the less dominant or less well understood forcings such as land-use changes. mineral dust. black carbon. etc.(see Chapter 6). No AOGCM simulations include estimates of future changes in solar forcing or in volcanic aerosol concentrations.There are many more AOGCM projections of future climate available than was the case for the IPCC Second Assessment Report (IPCC. 1996)(hereafter SAR). We concentrate on the IS92a and draft SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. Some indication of uncertainty in the projections can be obtained by comparing the responses among models. The range and ensemble standard deviation are used as a measure of uncertainty in modelled response. The simulations are a combination of a forced climate change component together with internally generated natural variability.

There are two major objectives of the present update. The first is an extension of the discussion on the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). including a reevaluation in view of the updates in the lifetimes of the radiatively active species. The second important objective is to underscore major developments in the radiative forcing of climate due to the observed stratospheric ozone losses occurring between 1979 and 1990.

1103548,Multi-gas forcing stabilization with Minicam,2006,Steven J Smith and TML Wigley,,The Energy Journal,Special Issue# 3,,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper examines the role of climate forcing agents other than carbon dioxide using the MiniCAM integrated assessment model for both no-climatepolicy and policy emissions scenarios. Non-CO2 greenhouse-gas forcing is dominated by methane and tropospheric ozone. Assumptions about the prevalence of methane recovery and local air pollution controls in the no-policy cases are a critical determinant of methane and ozone-precursor emissions. When these factors are considered. emissions are substantially reduced relative to earlier estimates. This reduces their potential as climate mitigation agents through specific climate policies. Nevertheless. the addition of non-CO2 greenhouse gas and ozone precursor abatement options significantly reduces mitigation costs in the first half of the 21st century (by up to 40%) compared to the case where only CO2 abatement options are pursued. While the influences of aerosols are small by the end of the century. there is a significant interaction in the early 21st century between policies to reduce CO2 emissions and SO2 emissions. even in the presence of SO2-related pollution control policies. The attendant reduced aerosol cooling can more than offset the reduction in warming that accrues from reduced CO2. When non-CO2 gases are included in the policy. the net effect is that global-mean climate change to 2050 is practically unaffected by mitigation policy.,True,p7kx5PMAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,347,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=2201,13634541970348778386,/scholar?cites=13634541970348778386,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2201,0,0,0

Emissions were estimated in 11 world regions using country-level emissions inventories and regional fossil fuel sulfur content information. Estimated global emissions in 1990 are 72 TgS with an estimated uncertainty of ±8% due to random errors with additional systematic errors that suggest that true emissions may be higher than this central value. We estimate that 56% of 1990 world emissions are from coal. 24% from oil. 15% from industrial processes and 3% from biomass burning.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound. for each region and sector. is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate. ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone. carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However. stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however. the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured.

Therefore. many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 C. Here we analyse integrated energy–economy–environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios. energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 C-consistent scenarios. but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors. leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 C-to a 1.5 C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO 2. This implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide. to be achieved between 2045 and 2060.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound. for each region and sector. is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate. ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions.

The Netherlands. 19-21 September 2007. This report is the culmination of the combined efforts of the New Scenarios Steering Committee. an author team composed primarily of members of the research community. and numerous other meeting participants and external reviewers who provided extensive comments during the expert review process. The expert meeting included presentations focused on needs for scenarios as seen from a policymaking perspective. a review of past IPCC scenarios. overviews of evolving plans in the research community. needs and opportunities for scenarios on two different time scales ('near term' to 2035. and 'long term' to 2100. extended to 2300 for some applications). and a review of options for the benchmark scenarios. referred to in the report as 'Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCPs). Additional presentations addressed institutional issues and options for increasing participation by developing and transition-economy countries. The remainder of the meeting was organized around a series of breakout groups and plenary sessions that provided an opportunity for the research communities to further coordinate their plans. to refine the proposal for the RCPs. and to consider additional cross-cutting issues.

This paper focuses primarily on the requirements to limit radiative forcing from Kyoto gases to 2.6 W/m2. Given that we estimate year 2005 radiative forcing to be 2.4 W/m2. the 2.6 W/m2 limit creates a non-trivial constraint. Allowing radiative forcing to exceed the long-term target level provides greater latitude in achieving the goal. but implies major changes to both global energy and land-use systems in the near term as well as the long term. In addition. delay on the part of major emitting parties creates potential “leakage” in both energy and land use.

Here. the interaction is viewed as a local competition between juveniles of different species for environmentally variable sites vacated by the random deaths of adults. Because plants are sedentary and have finite fecundity. often only a subset of species will compete for an available site. When a dominant species is recruitment limited. inferior competitors will win some sites by forfeit. It is shown that recruitment limitation allows “winning-by-forfeit” which lessens the effect of competitive asymmetries and slows population and community dynamics. Moreover. since recruitment limitation is likely to be most pronounced in highly diverse communities because of the rarity of many species. it is suggested that there is no conflict between the hypothesis that species-rich plant communities are more influenced by chance and history than regulated …,True,wr0aDMEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,530,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519385701701,326792376817978402,/scholar?cites=326792376817978402,,,0,0,0

The predictions that follow from future scenarios of a complete deforestation in the region point to a restrained water cycle. while the simulated effects of small. disturbed areas show a contrasting tendency. Differences between coarsely spatially averaged observations and finely sampled data sets have also been encountered. These contrasts are only partially explained by the different spatial resolutions among models and observations. since they seem to be further associated with the weakening of precipitation recycling under scenarios of extensive deforestation and with the potential intensification of convection over areas of land‐surface heterogeneity.

It describes an insightful model for determining the economic costs of limiting carbon dioxide emissions produced by burning fossil fuels and provides a solid analytical base for rethinking public policy on the farreaching issue of global warming. In recent years a growing concern that the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases will lead to undesirable changes in global climate has resulted in a number of proposals. both in the United States and internationally. to set physical targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But what will these proposals cost? Based on the authors' earlier ground-breaking work. Buying Greenhouse Insurance outlines a way to think about greenhouse-effect decisions under uncertainty.

Article 2 of the UNFCCC states that:“... the ultimate objective of this Convention… is to achieve… stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved with a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”(UNEP/WMO. 1992).The ultimate goal for stabilizing GHG concentrations is to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The question of what is dangerous is one that the authors of this chapter cannot answer. Danger is a function of the degree to which effects are negative and the degree to which those effects are unacceptable. The latter is a value judgment. The TAR’s task is to define what is known about the effects of climate change—to identify their character and their implications and whether they are negative or positive. It is not about determining whether these effects are acceptable.,True,26an0CsAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,401,http://gyohe.faculty.wesleyan.edu/files/2018/05/53.pdf,8105026265415328774,/scholar?cites=8105026265415328774,,http://gyohe.faculty.wesleyan.edu/files/2018/05/53.pdf,0,0,0

Limiting the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration to 450 or 550 ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100 would require a decarbonization of the global energy system in the 21st century.

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

We find that the short-term US abatement costs of implementing this Protocol are likely to be substantial. These costs can be reduced through international trade in emission rights. The magnitude of the costs will be determined by the number of countries participating in the trading market. the shape of each country's marginal abatement cost curve. and the extent to which buyers can satisfy their obligation through the purchase of emission rights.

This approach requires a definition of trade-offs among the radiatively active gases.

1103675,Buying greenhouse insurance,1992,Alan S Manne and Richard G Richels,,,,,,[en] A growing concern that the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases will lead to undesirable changes in global climate has resulted in proposals. both in the United States and internationally. to set physical targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But what will these proposals cost? This book outlines a way to think about greenhouse-effect decisions under uncertainty. It describes an insightful model for determining the economic costs of limiting CO 2 emissions produced by burning fossil fuels and provides a solid analytical base for rethinking public policy on the far-reaching issue of global warming. It presents region-by-region estimates of the costs that would underlie an international agreement. Using a computer model known as Global 2100. they analyze the economic impacts of limiting CO 2 emissions under alternative supply and conservation scenarios. The results clearly indicate that a reduction in emissions is not the sole policy response to potential climate change. Following a summary of the greenhouse effect. its likely causes. and possible consequences. this book takes up issues that concern the public at large. They provide an overview of Global 2100. look at how the US energy sector is likely to evolve under business-as-usual conditions and under carbon constraints. and describe the concept of greenhouse insurance.

Over the past decade. there has been considerable debate over the characteristics of a least-cost pathway. Some have suggested that a gradual departure from the emissions baseline will be the most cost-effective because it reduces the pressure for premature retirement of the existing capital stock. and it provides valuable time to develop low-cost. low-carbon-emitting substitutes. Others counter that a major flaw in analyses that support this line of reasoning is that they ignore learning-by-doing (LBD).In this paper. we examine the impact of LBD on the timing and costs of emissions abatement. With regard to timing. we find that including learning-by-doing does not significantly alter the conclusions of previous studies that treated technology cost as exogenous.

The size of the reductions is currently the subject of international negotiations. This paper is intended to contribute to the analysis and assessment phase leading up to the adoption of new targets and timetables.

We explore the implications of fully integrating terrestrial systems and the energy system into a comprehensive mitigation regime that limits atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that this comprehensive approach lowers the cost of meeting environmental goals but also carries with it profound implications for agriculture: Unmanaged ecosystems and forests expand. and food crop and livestock prices rise.

RA) and soil organisms (heterotrophic respiration. RH). Many studies have attempted to partition RS into these two components. with highly variable results. This study analyzes published data encompassing 54 forest sites and shows that RA and RH are each strongly (R2>0.8) correlated to annual RS across a wide range of forest ecosystems.

Here we introduce the SRDB database. a near-universal compendium of published RS data. and make it available to the scientific community both as a traditional static archive and as a dynamic community database that may be updated over time by interested users. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual RS. mean seasonal RS. a seasonal or annual partitioning of RS into its sources fluxes. RS temperature response (Q10). or RS at 10 °C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes. not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. To date. data from 818 studies have been entered into the database. constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961–2007 and are dominated by temperate. well-drained forests. We briefly examine some aspects of the SRDB data – its climate space coverage. mean annual RS fluxes and their correlation with other carbon fluxes. RS variability. temperature sensitivities. and the partitioning of RS source flux – and suggest some potential lines of research that could be explored using these data. The SRDB database is available online in a permanent archive as well as via a project-hosting repository; the latter source leverages open-source software technologies to encourage wider participation in the database's future development.

The impact of these short-term phenomena on larger scale ecosystem fluxes is increasingly recognized. and a growing number of studies show that these events affect fluxes of soil gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). methane (CH4). nitrous oxide (N2O). ammonia (NH3) and nitric oxide (NO). Global climate models predict that future climatic change is likely to alter the frequency and intensity of drying-rewetting events and thawing of frozen soils. These future scenarios highlight the importance of understanding how rewetting and thawing will influence dynamics of these soil gases. This study summarizes findings using a new database containing 338 studies conducted from 1956 to 2011. and highlights open research questions. The database revealed conflicting results following rewetting and thawing in various terrestrial ecosystems and among soil gases. ranging from large increases in fluxes to non-significant changes. Studies reporting lower gas fluxes before rewetting tended to find higher post-rewetting fluxes for CO2. N2O and NO; in addition. increases in N2O flux following thawing were greater in warmer climate regions. We discuss possible mechanisms and controls that regulate flux responses. and recommend that a high temporal resolution of flux measurements is critical to capture rapid changes in gas fluxes after these soil perturbations. Finally. we propose that future studies should investigate the interactions between biological (i.e.. microbial community and gas production …,True,9ODDdTAAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,338,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/2459/2012/,15662485337637240643,/scholar?cites=15662485337637240643,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/2459/2012/bg-9-2459-2012.pdf,0,0,0

This paper focuses primarily on the requirements to limit radiative forcing from Kyoto gases to 2.6 W/m2. Given that we estimate year 2005 radiative forcing to be 2.4 W/m2. the 2.6 W/m2 limit creates a non-trivial constraint. Allowing radiative forcing to exceed the long-term target level provides greater latitude in achieving the goal. but implies major changes to both global energy and land-use systems in the near term as well as the long term.

1103717,Relating land use and global land-cover change,1993,Billie Turner and Richard H Moss and DL Skole,,[No source information available],,,Scanning Microscopy International,Gaining a better understanding of the ways that land cover and land-use practices are evolving is a priority concern of the global change research community. Being able to project future states of land cover is a requirement for making numerical predictions about other global changes. The plant outlined in this report by working groups calls for the development of a system to classify land-cover changes according to their socio-economic driving forces. The remainder of this report defines the research problem and lays out a plan that addresses the human causes of global land-cover change. This plan includes the development of a global land-cover and land-use model that can link to other global models central to the study of global environmental change. The report reviews the importance of modification and conversion of land cover to the functioning of the Earth system.

A more consistent use of socio-economic scenarios that would allow an integrated perspective on mitigation. adaptation and residual climate impacts remains a major challenge. We assert that the identification of a set of global narratives and socio-economic pathways offering scalability to different regional contexts. a reasonable coverage of key socio-economic dimensions and relevant futures. and a sophisticated approach to separating climate policy from counter-factual “no policy” scenarios would be an important step toward meeting this challenge.

The impacts are expected to be particularly severe in the developing world and among marginalized communities because of limited adaptive capacity. Adaptation is an important pillar for the response to climate change. and the IPCC Assessment Reports highlight the complementary roles of mitigation and adaptation in climate policy. Particularly. IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)(IPCC. 2007) provided an evaluation of adaptation that is the departure point for the present report. The AR4 emphasized that adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from climate change that is already unavoidable due to past emissions. A wide array of adaptation options were noted. but also that the level of adaptation was inadequate for a reduction in vulnerability to future climate change. Moreover. the report showed there are barriers. limits. and costs that are not fully understood. Since the publication of IPCC AR4. significant progress has been made on the adaptation activities both quantitatively and qualitatively. In particular. there is substantial progress in development of national adaptation strategies and plans. These include climate change adaptation (CCA) legislation and formal national strategies. As of 2012. 26 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries have developed or are currently developing strategic frameworks for national adaptation (Mullan et al.. 2013).

Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

Then we formulate our own integrated assessment model. the Model of INvestment and Technological Development (MIND). which allows analysis of the relationship between specific mitigation options and the costs of ambitious climate protection objectives.

We use an integrated energy–economy–climate modeling system to examine how a further delay of cooperative action and technology availability affect climate mitigation challenges. With comprehensive emissions reductions starting after 2015 and full technology availability we estimate that maximum 21st century warming may still be limited below 2 C with a likely probability and at moderate economic impacts. Achievable temperature targets rise by up to~ 0.4 C if the implementation of comprehensive climate policies is delayed by another 15 years. chiefly because of transitional economic impacts.

Here we explore the possible consequences of these impacts for the electricity supply sector at the global scale. Regional hydropower projections are developed by forcing a coupled global hydrological and dam model with downscaled. bias-corrected climate realizations. Consequent impacts on power sector composition and associated emissions and investment costs are explored using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We find that climate-driven changes in hydropower generation may shift power demands onto and away from carbon intensive technologies. This causes significantly altered power sector CO2 emissions in several hydro-dependent regions. although the net global impact is modest.

The hydrologic model is coupled with an optimization routine to achieve an agreement between observed and simulated streamflow. Future predictions are made for three scenarios: future climate change. land use change. and jointly varying climate and land use. Future climate is modelled using precipitation and temperature predictions for the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) and Hadley climate models.

As a first step towards that goal. a global integrated assessment model. which includes a water-demand model driven by socioeconomics at regional and global scales. is coupled in a one-way fashion with a land surface hydrology–routing–water resources management model. To reconcile the scale differences between the models. a spatial and temporal disaggregation approach is developed to downscale the annual regional water demand simulations into a daily time step and subbasin representation. The model demonstrates reasonable ability to represent the historical flow regulation and water supply over the US Midwest (Missouri. Upper Mississippi. and Ohio river basins). Implications for future flow regulation. water supply. and supply deficit are investigated using climate change projections with the B1 and A2 emission scenarios. which affect both natural flow and water demand. Although natural flow is projected to increase under climate change in both the B1 and A2 scenarios. there is larger uncertainty in the changes of the regulated flow. Over the Ohio and Upper Mississippi river basins. changes in flow regulation are driven by the change in natural flow due to the limited storage capacity. However. both changes in flow and demand have effects on the Missouri River Basin summer regulated flow.

In addition. the dependence of the isotopic composition of the entire snow cover on altitude was analysed. Snow in four Swiss catchments was sampled at the end of the accumulation period in April 2010 and a second time during snowmelt in May 2010 and analysed for stable isotope composition of 2H and 18O. The sampling was conducted at both south-facing and north-facing slopes at elevation differences of 100 m. for a total altitude difference of approximately 1000 m. The observed variability of isotopic composition of the snow cover was analysed with stepwise multiple linear regression models. The analysis indicated that there is only a limited altitude effect on the isotopic composition when considering all samples. This is due to the high variability of the isotopic composition of the precipitation during the winter months and. in particular in the case of south-facing slopes. an enrichment of heavy isotopes due to intermittent melting processes. This enrichment effect could clearly be observed in the samples which were taken later in the year. A small altitudinal gradient of the isotopic composition could only be observed at some north-facing slopes. However. the dependence of snow depth and the day of the year were significant predictor variables in all models. This study indicates the necessity to further study the variability of water isotopes in the snow cover to increase prediction for isotopic composition of snowmelt and hence increase model performance of residence time models for …,True,puXDdRwAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,42,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2657/2013/,8047623560878799016,/scholar?cites=8047623560878799016,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2657/2013/hess-17-2657-2013.pdf,0,0,0

1103794,Strategies of female mate choice: a theoretical analysis,1980,Anthony C Janetos,7,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2,107-112,Springer-Verlag,Females of many species face a difficult sampling problem while searching for a mate. How do they find the best male possible when the constraints of time. memory. and mobility prevent them from visiting all the males in the population?Five possible solutions are examined: random mating a fixed-threshold criterion. a fixed-threshold with last-chance option. an optimal one-step decision strategy. and the best-of-n-males strategy. Random mating is the worst strategy whenever the female gets more than one chance to mate. The two fixed-threshold strategies approach equal effectiveness as n increases but are always below the optimal one-step decision strategy. However. the best-of-n-males strategy always yields the highest expectation of fitness in a mate. The difference is especially great when n≳5.Plotting the average fitness of males chosen vs n. the number of males examined. yields a …,True,UQO2IEUAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,585,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299515,17541079579209423825,/scholar?cites=17541079579209423825,,,0,0,0

In the more immediate context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. implementation of the Kyoto Protocol calls for estimates of carbon stocks for a baseline year as well as for subsequent years. Data sources from country level statistics and other ground‐based information are based on varying definitions of ‘forest’ and are consequently problematic for obtaining spatially and temporally consistent carbon stock estimates.

The MA definition of a driver is any natural or human-induced factor that directly or indirectly causes a change in an ecosystem. A direct driver unequivocally influences ecosystem processes. An indirect driver operates more diffusely by altering one or more direct drivers. Global driving forces are categorized as demographic. economic. sociopolitical. cultural and religious. scientific and technological. and physical and biological. Drivers in all categories other than physical and biological are considered indirect. Important direct drivers include changes in climate. plant nutrient use. land conversion. and diseases and invasive species.

In each case we derive rules for an optimal solution to the problem. We also derive models based on very simple. plausible rules of behavior that we suspect animals may actually use. Although the expected payoffs from optimality models always exceed the expected payoffs from our simpler behavioral models. under certain conditions the difference is not large. When good foraging sites last but a short time and when females' mobility in their habitat is limited. the results of simple models and optimal models are very close indeed.Because of the difficulty of distinguishing between the results of each type of model and because natural selection will presumably provide a best mix of solutions to a range of problems rather than a …,True,UQO2IEUAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,194,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00302939,14514955877544961964,/scholar?cites=14514955877544961964,,http://nsmn1.uh.edu/bcole/papers/Janetos%20Cole%201981.pdf,0,0,0

Orbweavers move among web-sites frequently. but sheetweb weavers do not. A simple model that examines the adaptive advantages of active foraging and sit-and-wait strategies leads to three predictions: 1) Orbweavers should have a simple decision rule for leaving web-sites. 2) Orbweavers' web-sites should have more variable payoffs than do the web-sites of sheetweb weavers. and 3) Orbweavers should have a lower cost of moving than do sheetweb weavers. Field and experimental data bear out each prediction. In addition. analysis of the residence times of spiders at web-sites that are used more than once reveals that members of the two guilds do not compete with each other for web-sites.The distinction between active foragers and sit-and-wait predators stems from the relative frequency of the …,True,UQO2IEUAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,130,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00296392,2633804008715468977,/scholar?cites=2633804008715468977,,,0,0,0

This paper discusses two analytical approaches to this challenge used to inform funding decisions related to the US Department of Energy (DOE) applied energy R&D portfolio. The two approaches are distinguished by the constraints under which they were conducted: the need to provide an end-to-end portfolio analysis as input to internal DOE budgeting processes. but with limited time and subject to institutional constraints regarding important issues such as expert judgment.

Five climate variables are included: temperature. diurnal temperature range. precipitation. vapour pressure. and cloud cover. The set comprises the observed climate record (1901–2000). a control scenario (1901–2100) and 16 scenarios of projected future climate (2001–2100). The 16 climate change scenarios represent all combinations of four emissions scenarios and four global climate models (GCMs). covering 93% of the range of uncertainty in global warming in the 21st century published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus these scenarios permit users to assess the implications for climate impacts of some of the major sources of uncertainty in future climate. The scenarios were constructed by combining time-series of global warming and patterns of change from GCMs with the baseline climate and sub-centennial variability from the observed record. Thus these grids provide homogenous 200-year transient scenarios (1901–2100) for users projecting the future impacts of climate change using environmental models.

The matrix architecture facilitates addressing key questions related to current climate research and policy-making: identifying the effectiveness of different adaptation and mitigation strategies (in terms of their costs. risks and other consequences) and the possible trade-offs and synergies. The two main axes of the matrix are: 1) the level of radiative forcing of the climate system (as characterised by the representative concentration pathways) and 2) a set of alternative plausible trajectories of future global development (described as shared socio-economic pathways). The matrix can be used to guide scenario development at different scales. It can also be used as a heuristic tool for classifying new and existing scenarios for assessment.

Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

In order to assess the optimal response of the carbon market to forest sequestration. we couple two global models. An energy–economy–climate model for the study of climate policies is linked with a detailed forestry model through an iterative procedure to provide the optimal abatement strategy. Results show that forestry is a determinant abatement option and could lead to significantly lower policy costs if included. Linking forestry management to the carbon market has the potential to alleviate the policy burden of 50 ppmv or equivalently of 1 4∘ C. and to significantly decrease the price of carbon.

1103913,The 2008 WITCH model: new model features and baseline,2009,Enrica De Cian and Valentina Bosetti and Alessandra Sgobbi and Massimo Tavoni,,,85.2009,,FEEM Working Paper,WITCH is an energy-economy-climate model developed by the climate change group at FEEM. The model has been extensively used in the past 3 years for the economic analysis of climate change policies. WITCH is a hybrid top-down economic model with a representation of the energy sector of medium complexity. Two distinguishing features of the WITCH model are the representation of endogenous technological change and the game–theoretic set-up. Technological change is driven by innovation and diffusion processes. both of which feature international spillovers. World countries are grouped in 12 regions which interact with each other in a setting of strategic interdependence. This paper describes the updating of the base year data to 2005 and some new features: the inclusion of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and abatement options. the new specification of low carbon technologies and the inclusion of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation.,True,jtRH0iwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,130,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1512475,6977439368118150899,/scholar?cites=6977439368118150899,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/55284/files/85-09.pdf,0,0,0

Evidence from Europe,2017,Marcella Nicolini and Massimo Tavoni,74,,,412-423,Pergamon,We test if policy support for renewable electricity have been effective in promoting renewables in the five largest European countries in the period 2000–2010. We collect data on the exact amount of monetary incentives and the average tariffs granted. The econometric analysis reveals a positive correlation between subsidies and the production of incentivized energy. as well as the installed capacity. We find that a 1% (1c€) increase in the incentive (tariff) leads to an increase in renewable generation of 0.4–1% (18–26%). Feed-in tariffs appear to outperform tradable green certificates.

Current and future expected carbon prices appear to have powerful effects on R&D spending and clean technology diffusion. Their impact on stabilisation costs depends on the nature of R&D: R&D targeted at incremental energy efficiency improvements has only limited effects. but R&D focused on the emergence of major new low-carbon technologies could lower costs drastically if successful-especially in the non-electricity sector. where such low-carbon options are scarce today. With emissions coming from multiple sources. keeping a wide range of options available matters for stabilisation costs more than improving specific technologies. Due to international knowledge spillovers. stabilisation costs could be further reduced through a complementary. global R&D policy.

A natural question in this context is what will be the ‘transformation pathway’towards stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there? The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways. including the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key characteristics of different transformation pathways. including the rates of emissions reductions and deployment of low-carbon energy. the magnitude and timing of aggregate economic costs. and the implications for other policy objectives such as those generally associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?

Previous studies have analyzed natural gas infrastructure development largely independent of the interactions of the natural gas sector with the broader economy. However. natural gas infrastructure development is strongly influenced by broader domestic and international socioeconomic conditions. We couple a global Human-Earth system model with state-level detail in the United States (GCAM-USA) that provides the broader socioeconomic context for natural gas supply and demand with a natural gas infrastructure investment model (NANGAM) to examine inter-state natural gas pipeline infrastructure development in the U.S. under a range of socioeconomic scenarios.

The small modular reactor (SMR) is viewed as a possible solution to the problems of energy security as well as climate change. In this paper. we use an integrated assessment model (IAM) to investigate the evolution of a global energy portfolio with SMRs under a stringent climate policy. Technology selection in the model is based on costs; we use results from previous expert elicitation studies of SMR costs. We find that the costs of achieving a 2 °C target are lower with SMRs than without. The costs are higher when large reactors do not compete for market share compared to a world in which they can compete freely. When both SMRs and large reactors compete for market share. reduction in mitigation cost is achieved only under advanced assumptions about SMR technology costs and …,True,A7TVt0MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014098831400156X,4247313093317569305,/scholar?cites=4247313093317569305,,https://fetter.it-prod-webhosting.aws.umd.edu/sites/default/files/fetter/files/2014-enecon.pdf,0,0,0

We use an integrated assessment model to quantify the implications of the Paris Agreement for stranded assets in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). a developing region with the least carbon-intensive power sector in the world. We find that meeting the Paris goals results in stranding of $37–90 billion and investment of $1.9–2.6 trillion worth of power sector capital (2021–2050) across a range of future scenarios. Strengthening the NDCs could reduce stranding costs by 27%–40%.

We assume that the ensuing regime involves strong mitigation efforts but does not require late joiners to compensate for their initially higher emissions. Thus. climate targets are relaxed. and although staged accession can achieve significant reductions of global warming. the resulting climate outcome is unlikely to be consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees.

This study investigates the variation in the pre-enrollment load patterns of Korean commercial and industrial electricity customers and their impact on event-day loads during a critical peak pricing experiment in the winter of 2013. Contrary to conventional approaches to profiling electricity loads. this study proposes a new clustering technique based on variability indices that collectively represent the potential demand–response resource that these customers would supply.

Most lava flows have flow tops that are porous and permeable and have enormous capacity for storage of CO2. Interbedded sediment layers and dense low‐permeability basalt rock overlying sequential flows may act as effective seals allowing time for mineralization reactions to occur. Laboratory experiments confirm relatively rapid chemical reaction of CO2‐saturated pore water with basalts to form stable carbonate minerals. Calculations suggest a sufficiently short time frame for onset of carbonate precipitation after CO2 injection that verification of in situ mineralization rates appears feasible in field pilot studies.

1103992,US Federal Investments in Energy R&D: 1961-2008,2008,James J Dooley,,,,,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,This paper documents nearly a half century of US federal government support for energy research and development (R&D). Data on energy R&D expenditures disaggregated by major program area are presented here for the first time for the period 1961-2008. This paper also documents US federal government spending on key large scale energy R&D programs that were initiated in response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. Since 1961. the US government has invested nearly $172 billion (in inflation adjusted 2005 US dollars) for the development of advanced energy technologies and for the necessary underlying basic science. Over this period. nearly 24% of the total federal investment in energy R&D occurred during the short seven-year span of 1974-1980. From 1977-1981. energy R&D investments briefly rose above 10% of all federal R&D; however. since the mid-1990s energy R&D has accounted for only about 1% of all federal R&D investments.,True,SE1u1qsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,36,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/949139,880219762483390027,/scholar?cites=880219762483390027,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/949139,0,0,0

Given this lack of knowledge with respect to the concept of CCS—let alone first-hand experiential knowledge derived from seeing these technologies deployed in local communities—it is imperative to re-examine how research on CCS stakeholder involvement is conducted and how the results of these studies are reported.

Therefore. many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 C. Here we analyse integrated energy–economy–environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios. energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 C-consistent scenarios. but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors. leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 C-to a 1.5 C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO 2.

In spite of this restriction. global emissions of CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion and cement production have continued to grow by 2.5% per year on average over the past decade. Two thirds of the CO 2 emission quota consistent with a 2 C temperature limit has already been used. and the total quota will likely be exhausted in a further 30 years at the 2014 emissions rates.

However. there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources). To demonstrate the new concept we quantify System LCOE from a simple power system model and literature values.

We use an integrated energy–economy–climate modeling system to examine how a further delay of cooperative action and technology availability affect climate mitigation challenges.

A large share will come from the variable renewable energy (VRE) sources wind and solar photovoltaics (PV); however. integrating wind and solar causes challenges for existing power systems. In this paper we analyze three major integration challenges related to the structural matching of demand with the supply of wind and solar power: low capacity credit. reduced utilization of dispatchable plants. and over-produced generation. Based on residual load duration curves we define corresponding challenge variables and estimate their dependence on region (US Indiana and Germany). penetration and mix of wind and solar generation.

Currently RE supplies almost 20 % of global electricity demand. Almost all EMF27 mitigation scenarios show a strong increase in renewable power production. with a substantial ramp-up of wind and solar power deployment. In many scenarios. renewables are the most important long-term mitigation option for power supply. Wind energy is competitive even without climate policy. whereas the prospects of solar photovoltaics (PV) are highly contingent on the ambitiousness of climate policy.

Under favorable atmospheric conditions. large fires can result in pyro-convection that transports the emissions into the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Here. we present three-dimensional model simulations of the injection of fire emissions into the lower stratosphere by pyro-convection. These model simulations are constrained and evaluated with observations obtained from the Chisholm fire in Alberta. Canada. in 2001. The active tracer high resolution atmospheric model (ATHAM) is initialized with observations obtained by radiosonde. Information on the fire forcing is obtained from ground-based observations of the mass and moisture of the burned fuel. Based on radar observations. the pyro-convection reached an altitude of about 13 km. well above the tropopause. which was located at about 11.2 km. The model simulation yields a similarly strong convection with an overshoot of the convection above the tropopause. The main outflow from the pyro-convection occurs at about 10.6 km. but a significant fraction (about 8%) of the emitted mass of the smoke aerosol is transported above the tropopause. In contrast to regular convection. the region with maximum updraft velocity in the pyro-convection is located close to the surface above the fire. This results in high updraft velocities >10 m s−1 at cloud base. The temperature anomaly in the plume decreases rapidly with height from values above 50 K at the fire to about 5 K at about 3000 m above the fire.

1104029,A quantitative analysis of pricing behavior in California's wholesale electricity market during summer 2000,2002,Paul L Joskow and Edward Kohn,23,The Energy Journal,4,,International Association for Energy Economics,During the Summer of 2000. wholesale electricity prices in California were nearly 500% higher than they were during the same months in 1998 or 1999. This price explosion was unexpected and has called into question whether electricity restructuring will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that explain this increase in wholesale electricity prices. We simulate competitive benchmark prices for Summer of 2000 taking account of all relevant supply and demand factors-gas prices. demand. imports from other states. and emission permit prices. We then compare the simulated competitive benchmark prices with the actual prices observed.

A large part of the problem can be associated with the failure of wholesale spot market prices for energy and operating reserves to rise to high enough levels during periods when generating capacity is fully utilized. Reforms to wholesale energy markets. the introduction of well-design forward capacity markets. and symmetrical treatment of demand response and generating capacity resources to respond to market and institutional imperfections are discussed. This policy reform program is compatible with improving the efficiency of spot wholesale electricity markets. the continued evolution of competitive retail markets. and restores incentives for efficient investment in generating capacity consistent with operating reliability criteria applied by system operators.

1104045,Regulation in theory and practice: An overview,1981,Paul L Joskow and Roger G Noll,,,,1-78,The MIT Press,During the past twenty-five years the amount of research on the economics of government regulation has increased enormously. The study of publicpolicy approaches to problems in industrial organization was once limited almost exclusively to antitrust policy and the regulation of a few industries with natural monopoly characteristics. This area of inquiry has been transformed as new administrative agencies with powers to set prices. restrict entry. and control what products are produced. and how. have come to affect the efficiency of industrial markets and the distribution of production and income throughout the economy. The increased attention to the economics of administrative regulation is due to a number of factors. First. research has benefited considerably since the late 1950s from the application of modern statistical analysis and the mathematics of constrained optimization. Although technically unsophisticated by contemporary standards. the classic works by Averch and Johnson (1962). Caves (1962). Meyer et al.(1959). and Stigler and Friedland (1962) represent a watershed in the study of economic regulation by administrative agencies. What economists now know about the effects of government regulation on economic activity that they did not know twenty years ago is. for the most part. attributable to the kinds of analytical techniques that were first used in a handful of classic papers such as these.A second reason for the expansion of scholarly interest in this area is the increasing importance of administrative regulation in the US economy.

Its primary goal was to develop the infrastructure and to provide the experience that would enable the successful use of a cap-and-trade system to limit European GHG emissions during a second trading period. 2008-12. corresponding to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

We examine the political economy of this allocation. Though no Senate or House votes were ever taken. hypothetical votes suggest that the actual allocation would have beaten plausible alternatives. While rent‐seeking behavior is apparent. statistical analysis of differences between actual and benchmark allocations indicates that the legislative process was more complex than simple models suggest. The coalition of states that produced and burned high‐sulfur coal both failed to block acid rain legislation in 1990 and received fewer allowances than in plausible benchmark allocations.

The critical questions is how to define the optimal level of energy efficiency. This paper seeks to disentangle some confusing strands of argument that are frequently brought to bear on this question. by identifying the major conceptual issues that determine the set of feasible answers.

These combined market failures provide a strong rationale for a portfolio of public policies that foster emissions reduction as well as the development and adoption of environmentally beneficial technology. Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that the rate and direction of technological advance is influenced by market and regulatory incentives. and can be cost-effectively harnessed through the use of economic-incentive based policy. In the presence of weak or nonexistent environmental policies. investments in the development and diffusion of new environmentally beneficial technologies are very likely to be less than would be socially desirable.

1104056,Valuing climate change: the economics of the greenhouse,2013,Samuel Fankhauser,,,,,Routledge,Within only a few years. global warming has emerged from scientific speculation into an environmental threat of worldwide concern. Yet the scientific community remains uncertain as to the long-term trends and effects of climate change. and this uncertainty has been seized on as justification for inaction by an international community reluctant to bear the costs of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Valuing Climate Change presents concrete. economic evidence of the need for action. Fankhauser assesses the costs of a doubling of GHG emissions to be a significant percentage of gross world product; a figure which he then compares to the costs of reducing emissions. In his comparison. he looks at regional as well as global estimates of damage. and takes account of the non-climate change benefits of GHG reductions. such as a switch in the energy sector to cleaner technologies or renewable fuels. and the impacts on transport. with reduced congestion and improved air quality. It is clear that the stakes are high. and Fankhauser believes that tougher targets may be needed than those set out in the Framework Convention on Climate Change. He assesses the optimum policy responses to GHG reduction. the likely instruments for achieving it and the potential for international cooperation in dealing with the problems.

The analysis emphasizes the emerging theoretical and empirical evidence that using prices to manage water demand is more cost effective than implementing nonprice conservation programs. similar to results for pollution control in earlier decades. Price‐based approaches may also compare favorably to prescriptive approaches in terms of monitoring and enforcement. Neither policy instrument has an inherent advantage over the other in …,True,TcoarRAAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,390,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008WR007227,4201302202139022700,/scholar?cites=4201302202139022700,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008WR007227,0,0,0

The theoretical basis for the study is a spatial city model with stochastic returns to future land development. The empirical model of agricultural land prices is estimated with a cross-section on approximately three thousand counties in the contiguous US. The results provide evidence that option values associated with irreversible and uncertain land development are capitalized into current farmland values. For each county. we decompose the current agricultural land value into components measuring rents from agricultural production and rents from future land development.,True,TcoarRAAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,384,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009411900200503X,16753246213251282211,/scholar?cites=16753246213251282211,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/39006/PDF,0,0,0

Both state space and frequency domain criteria are developed using the wealth of literature on absolute stability theory and the concepts of supply rates and storage functions. The state space conditions are expressed in terms of Riccati equations and parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions.

The Active Twist Rotor (ATR) is a four‐bladed. Mach‐scaled. fully articulated rotor. with active blades. The active blades have embedded piezoelectric active fiber composite actuators that allow direct control of blade twist. The experiments were conducted at the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. During the tests. the rotor system response characteristics were identified. using linear time‐periodic (LTP) system identification techniques. Results indicated that the effects of periodicity on the system response are small. and hence time‐invariant control techniques can be used.

The second generation design of the X-Frame actuator is described focusing on the design changes made from the actuator prototype. The function of the components that restrain the actuator to the rotor blade and connect it to the servo-flap are described. The major challenge in placing a discrete actuator into a rotor blade is in allowing the required functionality in the aggressive acceleration environment of the blade.

Measurements on cluster films coated with chromophoric polymer or with thiol-bound chromophores give spatially-averaged enhancements of 1000 and 20 000. respectively. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy studies show that the enhancements are spatially inhomogeneous. with peak-enhancement factors of ≥ 10 000 (polymer/cluster) and ≥ 160 000 (thiol chromophore/cluster). and excitation frequency dependent.

1104161,Redox sensing by prokaryotic transcription factors,2000,Ming Zheng and Gisela Storz,59,,1,1-6,Elsevier,Prokaryotic cells employ redox-sensing transcription factors to detect elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and regulate expression of antioxidant genes. In Escherichia coli. two such transcription factors. OxyR and SoxR. have been well characterized. The OxyR protein contains a thiol–disulfide redox switch to sense hydrogen peroxide. The SoxR protein uses a 2Fe–2S cluster to sense superoxide generated by redox-cycling agents. as well as to sense nitric oxide. Both proteins are turned on and off with very fast kinetics (∼ minutes). allowing rapid cellular responses to oxidative stress.

Three such columns in series with pore sizes of 2000. 1000. and 300 Å were found to separate DNA-CNT into fractions of very narrow length distribution. as measured directly by atomic force microscopy. The average length decreases monotonically from >500 nm in the early fractions to <100 nm in the late fractions. with length variation ≤10% in each of the measured fractions.

In LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2. an increase of magnetization is found below 100 K with ac magnetic susceptibility revealing broad peaks at 96. 40. 13. and 7 K. The low-temperature neutron diffraction and heat capacity studies do not reveal long-range magnetic ordering; the magnetic component of heat capacity shows a broad peak at 10 K. This behavior is explained by assuming a nonrandom distribution of transition metals. The 96 K transition is attributed to the ordering of clusters of Ni2+ spins in the transition metal and lithium layers. which are coupled by a 180° superexchange mechanism.

Through careful control of the cooling rate after high temperature calcination. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinels with different disordered phase and/or Mn3+ contents have been synthesized. It is revealed that during the slow cooling process (<3 °C min−1). oxygen deficiency is reduced by the oxygen intake. thus the residual Mn3+ amount is also decreased in the spinel due to charge neutrality. In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) demonstrates that the existence of a disordered phase fundamentally changes the spinel phase transition pathways during the electrochemical charge–discharge process.

An initial screening of different species of fungi has been conducted. Fungal growth medium was overlaid onto cured concrete plate. Mycelial discs were aseptically deposited at the plate center. The results showed that. due to the dissolving of Ca(OH)2 from concrete. the pH of the growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the drastic pH increase. Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into hyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete.

The scaffold provided short pathways for both lithium ions and electrons in the active phase. enabling fast kinetics and thus a high power density. The scaffold also resulted in a reduced voltage hysteresis. The electrode showed a reversible capacity of ∼1000 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 (∼0.2 C) for about 20 cycles. and at a current density of 20 A g–1 (∼20 C). the deliverable capacity was about 450 mAh g–1. The room-temperature voltage hysteresis at 0.1 A g–1 (∼0.1 C) was 0.62 V. which is significantly smaller than that normally reported in the literature. The hysteresis further reduced to 0.42 V at 45 °C.

Here. we report that the thermal conductivity of molybdenum disulfide can be modified by electrochemical intercalation. We observe distinct behaviour for thin films with vertically aligned basal planes and natural bulk crystals with basal planes aligned parallel to the surface. The thermal conductivity is measured as a function of the degree of lithiation. using time-domain thermoreflectance. The change of thermal conductivity correlates with the lithiation-induced structural and compositional disorder. We further show that the ratio of the in-plane to through-plane thermal conductivity of bulk crystal is enhanced by the disorder.

In the current work. we perform a comprehensive analysis about the magnesiation behavior of α-MnO2 by comparing the reactions following the intercalation and conversion routes. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the conversion reaction that generates amorphous magnesium and manganese oxide is thermodynamically more preferable than the intercalation reaction.

To utilize this unique property to regulate oxygen-involved reactions. it is crucial to match the oxygen release–intake equilibrium with targeted reaction conditions.

However. the lack of appropriate cathode with high-energy density and good sustainability hinders the realization of competitive magnesium cells. Recently. a new concept of hybrid battery coupling metal magnesium anode with a cathode undergoing the electrochemical cycling of a secondary ion has received increased attention. Mg-Na hybrid battery. for example. utilizes the dendritic-free deposition of magnesium at the anode and fast Na+-intercalation at the cathode to reversibly store and harvest energy. In the current work. the principles that take the full advantage of metal Mg anode and Na-battery cathode to construct high-performance Mg-Na hybrid battery are described. By rationally applying such design principle. we constructed a Mg-NaCrO2 hybrid battery using metal Mg anode. NaCrO2 cathode and a mixture of all-phenyl complex (PhMgCl-AlCl3. Mg-APC) and sodium carba-closo-dodecaborate (NaCB11H12) as dual-salt electrolyte. The Mg-NaCrO2 cell delivered an energy density of 183 Wh kg-1 at the voltage of 2.3 V averaged in 50 cycles. We found that the amount of electrolyte can be reduced by using solid MgCl2 as additional magnesium reservoir while maintaining comparable electrochemical performance. A hypothetical MgCl2-NaCrO2 hybrid battery is therefore proposed with energy density estimated to be 215 Wh kg-1 and the output voltage over 2 V.,True,SAEY9f0AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC,5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2018.00611/full,6870282492557698526,/scholar?cites=6870282492557698526,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2018.00611/full,0,0,0

Such substitution reduces the miscibility gap at room temperature and also significantly lowers the solid solution formation temperature in the two-phase region.

Due to the ensemble-averaging nature of EXAFS. the values of the coordination numbers in nanoparticles cannot be simply interpreted in terms of the degree of alloying or segregation if the compositional distribution is broad. We demonstrate that a Cowley short range order parameter is an objective measure of either the segregation tendency (e.g.. a core-shell type) or the degree of randomness (in homogeneous nanoalloys). This criterion can be used even in the case when the clusters are random but have broad compositional distributions.

The direct recycling method transforms end‐of‐life (EOL) cathode materials into battery grade materials with minimal energy consumption and least environmental disruption. In direct recycling. the relithiation step to restore the lithium stoichiometry of the cathode materials is critical. In this work. a novel electrochemical relithiation approach in an aqueous electrolyte followed by a heat treatment for recycling cathode materials in EOL lithium‐ion batteries is demonstrated and analyzed.

As soon as a metal salt is dissolved in water or a nonaqueous solvent. a soluble metal complex is formed. Knowing how this complex organizes with the organic groups in the medium of the solvent is crucial to understanding the transformation of these molecules into the final solid through hydrolysis and condensation. Condensation is strongly believed to occur when point zero charge molecules (pzc) are formed at the isoelectric point.

Herein. we investigated the gas-phase HCl oxidation (4HCl + O2 → 2Cl2 + 2H2O) over ceria. Despite its remarkable performance. under low oxygen over-stoichiometry. this oxide is prone to a certain extent to subsurface/bulk chlorination. which leads to deactivation. In situ Prompt Gamma Activation Analysis (PGAA) studies evidenced that the chlorination rate is independent of the pre-chlorination degree but increases at lower oxygen over-stoichiometry. while dechlorination is effective in oxygen-rich feeds. and its rate is higher for a more extensively pre-chlorinated ceria.

Polymer droplets. formed by shearing a photopolymer using a continuous water phase at a T-junction. were constrained to adopt nonspherical shapes by confining them using appropriate microchannel geometries. Plugs were obtained by shearing the polymer phase at low shear rates. while disks were obtained by flattening droplets using a channel of low height. The nonspherical shapes formed were permanently preserved by photopolymerizing the constrained droplets in situ using ultraviolet light. Monodisperse plugs and disks of different lengths and diameters were obtained by varying the flow rates of the two phases. ,True,qyG7UPlK1RUC:9yKSN-GCB0IC,524,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la047368k,4106399770161568500,/scholar?cites=4106399770161568500,,http://web.mit.edu/doylegroup/pubs/Langmuir-DD05.pdf,0,0,0
1104494,Static and dynamic errors in particle tracking microrheology,2005,Thierry Savin and Patrick S Doyle,88,Biophysical journal,1,623-638,Cell Press,Particle tracking techniques are often used to assess the local mechanical properties of cells and biological fluids. The extracted trajectories are exploited to compute the mean-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. Limited spatial resolution and statistical uncertainty are the limiting factors that alter the accuracy of the mean-squared displacement estimation. We precisely quantified the effect of localization errors in the determination of the mean-squared displacement by separating the sources of these errors into two separate contributions. A “static error” arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A “dynamic error” comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement.

The rate of these fluctuations initially decreased for increasing shear rate γ ̇ and increased above a critical γ ̇.

As the size of these devices decreases. a significant hydrodynamic flow is generated due to permeation of fluid through the channel walls.

We consider two model linear flows. steady shear and uniaxial extensional flow. in which we calculate the non-Newtonian Brownian and viscous stress contribution of the polymers. their birefringence and a stress-optic coefficient. We have developed a computer algorithm to differentiate the Brownian from the viscous stress contributions which also avoids the order (δt)− 1/2 noise associated with the Brownian forces. The strain or shear rate is made dimensionless with a molecular relaxation time determined by simulated relaxation of the birefringence and stress after a strong flow is applied. The characteristic long relaxation time obtained from the birefringence and stress are equivalent and shown to scale with N2 where N is the number of beads in the chain. For small shear or extension rates the viscous contribution to the effective viscosity is constant and scales as N. We obtain an analytic expression which explains the scaling and magnitude of this viscous contribution. In uniaxial extensional flow we find an increase in the extensional viscosity with the dimensionless flow strength up to a plateau value. Moreover. the Brownian stress also reaches a plateau and we develop an analytic expression which shows that the Brownian stress in an aligned bead–rod chain scales as N3. Using scaling arguments we show that the Brownian stress dominates in steady uniaxial extensional flow until large Wi. Wi≈ 0. 06N2. where Wi is the chain Weissenberg number.

The channel heights span the regime from moderate confinement (height ∼ bulk radius of gyration of the DNA) to strong confinement (height ∼ persistence length). Scalings of diffusivity with channel height differ from blob model predictions. The diffusivity scales inversely with molecular weight when the channel height is smaller than the bulk radius of gyration. This scaling is indicative of hydrodynamic screening. A scaling analysis shows that the screening of hydrodynamic interactions arises from a combination of two mechanisms.

Conducting polymers with conjugated backbones. though conductive. may suffer from insufficient exposure to the electrolyte due to the often formed nonporous structures.

1104534,Analogy between enzyme and nanoparticle catalysis: a single-molecule perspective,2019,Rong Ye* and Xianwen Mao* and Xiangcheng Sun and Peng Chen,,ACS Catalysis,,,American Chemical Society,Catalysis as a field is classically divided into three areas: homogeneous. heterogeneous. and biological catalysis. 1 For the latter two (ie. biological catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis). their dissimilarity can be apparent intuitively. from the scenes of fruit fermentation in a rural winery to make wine and oil refining in a process plant to produce gasoline. In addition to the practical differences. technological terms common in both areas show divergences in meaning. A highly relevant example is the term turnover number. 2 It refers to the maximum number of substrate molecules converted to products per enzyme molecule per second. often written as kcat in enzyme catalysis; while the same term means the number of moles of reactants that a mole of catalyst converts before deactivation. usually abbreviated as TON in heterogeneous catalysis.However. the development of characterization tools provides increasingly …,True,MG9uMvAVl3YC:mVmsd5A6BfQC,9,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.8b04926,13368912475762966487,/scholar?cites=13368912475762966487,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.8b04926,0,0,0

Here we investigate. for the first time. the redox transformation efficiency (RTE) of unconjugated EAPs with discrete electron donor/acceptors.

Fabric weaving is a mature. scalable manufacturing technology and can be used as a platform to manufacture microfluidic diagnostic tests with controlled. tunable flow. Given its scalability. low manufacturing cost (<$0.25 per device). and potential for patterning multiplexed channel geometries. fabric is a viable platform for the development of analytical devices. In this paper. we describe a fabric-based electrophoretic platform for protein separation. Appropriate yarns were selected for each region of the device and weaved into straight channel electrophoretic chips in a single step. A wide dynamic range of analyte molecules ranging from small molecule dyes (<1 kDa) to macromolecule proteins (67–150 kDa) were separated in the device.

The processes used hydrophilic MF membranes to separate oil and protein. The most successful processing sequence consisted of alkaline extraction of oil and protein from the flour at pH 11. centrifugation to remove undissolved solids. and an initial microfiltration step to separate oil and dissolved protein. This was followed by proteolytic enzyme treatment of the retentate and a second-stage MF step to recover further protein. The proteolytic enzyme treatment was designed to break aggregated proteins into smaller fractions to permit their passage through the MF membrane.

An attempt was made to elucidate the gel network structure and the validity of scaling laws. Thermal gelation was observed on heating. and it reverted to the liquid state on cooling. The thermoreversibility was a heating/cooling rate dependent process. For isothermally stabilized samples. 42.5 °C was found to be the critical temperature differentiating the weak gels from the strong gels.

1104576,New insights on the interaction mechanism within oppositely charged polymer/surfactant systems,2002,C Wang and KC Tam,18,Langmuir,17,6484-6490,American Chemical Society,The interactions between dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide and anionic polymers such as neutralized poly(acrylic acid) and methacrylic acid/ethyl acrylate copolymers were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The ITC results suggest that in the initial stage of titration. the cationic headgroups of surfactant individually bind to the anionic carboxylate groups on the polymer chains due to electrostatic attraction. When the surfactant concentration reaches a critical value C‘. the micellization of polymer-bound surfactant occurs. resulting in the formation of insoluble polymer/surfactant complexes. The thermodynamic parameters derived from ITC measurements suggest that the electrostatic binding is an endothermic process driven by entropy. The positive entropy is attributed to the recovery of translational entropy of released counterions by the bound surfactant.

These polymers are the polymerization product of methacrylic acid. ethyl acrylate. and macromonomers which contain hydrophobes with the alkyl chain ranging in length from C12 to C20. At high pH. the polymers form a network of temporarily associating hydrophobic junctions. resulting in an enhancement of the shear viscosity which increases with the hydrophobe chain length. Strain amplitude sweep results show that the strength of the hydrophobic association increases with the length of the hydrophobe.

Notably. crystallization is an attractive isolation step for manufacturing because this single process combines both particle formation and purification. Almost all of the products based on fine chemicals. such as dyes. explosives. and photographic materials. require crystallization in their manufacture. and more than 90% of all pharmaceutical products contain bioactive drug substances and excipients in the crystalline solid state.

1104664,Filtering microfluidic bubble trains at a symmetric junction,2012,Pravien Parthiban and Saif A Khan,12,Lab on a Chip,3,582-588,Royal Society of Chemistry,We report how a nominally symmetric microfluidic junction can be used to sort all bubbles of an incoming train exclusively into one of its arms. The existence of this “filter” regime is unexpected. given that the junction is symmetric. We analyze this behavior by quantifying how bubbles modulate the hydrodynamic resistance in microchannels and show how speeding up a bubble train whilst preserving its spatial periodicity can lead to filtering at a nominally symmetric junction. We further show how such an asymmetric traffic of bubble trains can be triggered in symmetric geometries by identifying conditions wherein the resistance to flow decreases with an increase in the number of bubbles in the microchannel and derive an exact criterion to predict the same.,True,eVRGIGkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,35,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2012/lc/c1lc20639g,6676809688900287804,/scholar?cites=6676809688900287804,,,0,0,0

The calculated values of the hydrodynamic radius are compared with the results of other theoretical approaches proposed in the literature. as well as several experimental data.

Evidence is shown that as long as the inner density decay with linear size within the aggregate (due to fractality) is not negligible (as for d f≃ 2.4–2.8). this imposes a substantial limitation to the hydrodynamic fragmentation process as compared with nonfractal aggregates (where the critical stress is practically size independent).

We present a first detailed thermodynamic analysis of atomically thin 2D materials at organic–aqueous liquid–liquid interfaces and derive expressions for the transfer free energies of emulsion stabilization that account for material geometry. van der Waals transparency or opacity. and variable hydrophobicity.

Composites having four different volume fractions of cenospheres (hollow ceramic microspheres) ranging from 10 to 40% in increments of 10% were prepared and their mechanical properties were evaluated. A predictive model to estimate the fracture toughness of the composite was developed.

This assembly process is driven by the tendency of multiphase liquid–liquid systems to minimize the surface area and the resulting surface free energy between the phases. We demonstrate that shape-controlled microgels spontaneously assemble within multiphase reactor systems into predetermined geometric configurations. Furthermore. we characterize the parameters that influence the assembly process. such as external energy input. surface tension. and microgel dimensions.

In forming an equilibrium structure. such a material may separate into distinct phases. creating domains of component A and component B. A dominant factor in the determination of the domain morphology is area-minimization of the intermaterial surface. subject to fixed volume fraction. Surfaces that satisfy this mathematical condition are said to have constant mean curvature (CMC). The geometry of such surfaces strongly influences the physical properties of the material and they have been proposed as candidates for microstructural models in a variety of physical and biological systems. We have discovered domain structures in phase-separated diblock copolymers that closely approximate periodic CMC surfaces.

A laboratory cell achieved 195.000 cycles with stable performance. The maximal cell voltage was 2 V associated with 21 ± 2 F g−1 of total composite electrode materials (including activated carbon and MnO2. binder and conductive additive) and an equivalent serie resistance (ESR) below 1.3 Ω cm2. Long-life cycling was achieved by removing dissolved oxygen from the electrolyte. which limits the corrosion of current collectors. Scaling up has been realized by assembling several electrodes in parallel to build a prismatic cell. A stable capacity of 380 F and a cell voltage of 2 V were maintained over 600 cycles. These encouraging results show the interest of developing such devices. including non-toxic and safer components as compared to the current organic-based devices.,True,VdZLmaEAAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC,505,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775307008907,11849050371394817239,/scholar?cites=11849050371394817239,,https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/2476/1/Brousse_2476.pdf,0,0,0
