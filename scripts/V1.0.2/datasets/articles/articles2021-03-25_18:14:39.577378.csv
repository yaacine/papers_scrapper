Economic theory suggests that. in many sectors. businesses will pass on costs to customers and make net profits due to the impact on product prices combined with the extensive free allocations of allowances. This study applies the Cournot representation of an oligopoly market to five energy-intensive sectors: cement. newsprint. steel. aluminium and petroleum. By populating the model with empirical data. the results are shown for three future emissions price scenarios. The results encompass the extent of cost pass-through to customers. changes in output. changes in UK market share. and changes in firm profits.

Here we use a model approach to examine optimal CO 2-emission abatement paths for specified long-term constraints on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Our analysis highlights the interplay of uncertainty (in target greenhouse-gas concentrations) and the inertia in the energy systems that produce CO 2 emissions. We find that the ‘integrated assessment’models previously applied to these issues under-represent inertia. A more appropriate representation of inertia increases the costs of deferring abatement and makes it optimal to spread the effort of abatement across generations. Balancing the costs of early action against the potentially higher costs of more rapid and forced later action. we show that early attention to …,True,1Fp2oo0AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,354,https://www.nature.com/articles/36825,6440153476517190707,/scholar?cites=6440153476517190707,,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00002452/document,0,0,0

This article reviews and extends the long-standing debate about auctioning. in which economists have generally supported and industries opposed a greater use of auctioning. The article clarifies the key issues by reviewing six ‘traditional’ considerations. examines several credible options for auction design. and then proposes some new issues relevant to auctioning. It is concluded that greater auctioning in aggregate need not increase adverse competitiveness impacts. and could in some respects alleviate them. particularly by supporting border-tax adjustments. Auctioning within the 10% limit might also be used to dampen price volatility during 2008–2012 and. in subsequent periods. it offers the prospect of supporting a long-term price …,True,1Fp2oo0AAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C,350,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2006.9685592,8622825980015421416,/scholar?cites=8622825980015421416,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/183630/eprg0621.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

We consider diversity of fuel source mix to represent one dimension of security—robustness against interruptions of any one source—and apply two different diversity indices to the range of electricity system scenarios produced by the UK government and independent researchers. Our results show that low-carbon objectives are uniformly associated with greater long-term diversity in UK electricity generation. With reference to data on wind generation we also consider the impact of source variability on a second dimension of security—the reliability of generation availability. We conclude that this does not undermine our fundamental conclusion that low-carbon scenarios are associated with greater strategic security of supply in UK electricity.

Many studies focussed on the options for limiting anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse-related gases and managing the consequences of global warming and climate change. Making appropriate policy choices requires information on both the costs and benefits. as they occur over time. of policy interventions. and an increasing number of studies have sought to quantify the costs especially of limiting CO2 emissions. as the dominant anthropogenic source. Such analyses now form an important part of overall policy assessments and influence international negotiations on policy re sponses. However. these studies are not well understood.

1233473,The greenhouse effect: negotiating targets,1989,Michael Grubb,,,,,,This paper examines the ensuing debate on international negotiations aimed at limiting emissions of greenhouse gases. particularly carbon dioxide. It maintains that a policy of target reductions in carbon dioxide emissions applied either across the board to developed countries or negotiated on a country-by-country basis is unlikely to succeed. Alternative approaches. which include carbon taxes. production quotas. and systems of tradeable or leasable emission permits are examined. with the latter option being deemed the most promising. The difficulties associated with monitoring of fossil carbon emissions and enforcement of an agreement are not thought to pose major obstacles. More serious is the problem of universality: countries which did not join a carbon abatement protocol stand to gain. Applying carbon taxes on trade with non-participants could be a legitimate and effective sanction against recalcitrant countries. However. an effective carbon abatement agreement will be extremely difficult to achieve and success is far from guaranteed. Alternatives to global agreement include regional accords. agreements between select groups of countries. and agreements on various component activities. Countries can and should also act unilaterally. 9 figs.. 6 tabs.,True,1Fp2oo0AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,332,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/7172331,7465084343894074306,/scholar?cites=7465084343894074306,,,,0,0,0
1233474,Induced technological change: Exploring its implications for the economics of atmospheric stabilization: Synthesis report from the innovation modeling comparison project,2006,Ottmar Edenhofer and Kai Lessmann and Claudia Kemfert and Michael Grubb and Jonathan Kohler,,The Energy Journal,Special Issue# 1,,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper summarizes results from ten global economy-energy-environment models implementing mechanisms of endogenous technological change (ETC). Climate policy goals represented as different CO2 stabilization levels are imposed. and the contribution of induced technological change (ITC) to meeting the goals is assessed. Findings indicate that climate policy induces additional technological change. in some models substantially. Its effect is a reduction of abatement costs in all participating models. The majority of models calculate abatement costs below 1 percent of present value aggregate gross world product for the period 2000-2100. The models predict different dynamics for rising carbon costs. with some showing a decline in carbon costs towards the end of the century. There are a number of reasons for differences in results between models; however four major drivers of differences are identified. First. the extent of the necessary CO2 reduction which depends mainly on predicted baseline emissions. determines how much a model is challenged to comply with climate policy. Second. when climate policy can offset market distortions. some models show that not costs but benefits accrue from climate policy. Third. assumptions about long-term investment behavior. eg foresight of actors and number of available investment options. exert a major influence. Finally. whether and how options for carbon-free energy are implemented (backstop and end-of-the-pipe technologies) strongly affects both the mitigation strategy and the abatement costs.,True,1Fp2oo0AAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,322,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2134,18250279093725230431,/scholar?cites=18250279093725230431,,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2134,0,0,0

Feedback between energy intensities and energy uses in IEA countries,2000,Lee Schipper and Michael Grubb,28,Energy policy,6-7,367-388,Elsevier,The interaction or feedback between energy efficiencies or energy intensities and energy use has long been the topic of debate. Some have argued that energy efficiency improvements. by reducing energy intensities and therefore lowering the cost of energy services. would lead to 'rebound’ effects offsetting much or all of any initial savings in energy. In this paper we analyse historical data on energy use. efficiency and pricing in different sectors to try and identify 'rebounds'. For the period of our data (since about 1970) we show that key measures of activity (car use. manufacturing output and structure. house area. etc.) have changed little in response to changes in energy prices or efficiency. instead continuing their long-term evolution relative to GDP or other driving factors. While our analysis cannot disentangle more macro-level economic feedbacks in a detailed way. we show indirectly that such effects also …,True,1Fp2oo0AAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC,315,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421500000185,15334211591075877584,/scholar?cites=15334211591075877584,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Grubb/publication/222955316_On_the_Rebound_Feedback_Between_Energy_Intensities_and_Energy_Uses_in_IEA_Countries/links/58ac7aac92851c3cfda05432/On-the-Rebound-Feedback-Between-Energy-Intensities-and-Energy-Uses-in-IEA-Countries.pdf,0,0,0

Most models of energy. economy. and the environment (E3 models) use exogenous assumptions for this. This is an important weakness. We show that there is strong evidence that technical change in the energy sector is to an important degree induced by market circumstances and expectations and. by implication. by environmental policies such as CO2 abatement. We classify the main approaches to modeling such induced technical change and review results with particular reference to climate change.

A simple integrated model of optimal greenhouse gas abatement over time is presented. in which the abatement cost depends on both fixed and transitional elements. It is shown that the optimal current response and long-run prospects differ radically between the classical economic case — in which the cost of a given cutback in emissions is fixed exogenously — and the adaptive case — in which the response is ultimately adaptive but heavily constrained by inertia (ie low fixed but high transitional cost).

Although climate change is firmly positioned on the political agenda and some initial targets have been agreed within a global framework. we are still far away from a mature political and practical policy which may deliver timely and appropriate results. to tum the tide. This is partly due to the complex nature of a possible global climate change regime. the still early stage of the development of effective and efficient instruments and the wide variety of possible ramifications for individual countries and economic sectors. But it is also due to the complexity of the negotiation process. and the lack of effective international or even global governance and leadership to tackle a multi-dimensional problem of this size and nature.

Electron injection dynamics are studied by transient absorption and emission studies of DSSCs and correlated with device photovoltaic performance and charge recombination dynamics. We find that the electron injection dynamics are dependent upon the composition of the redox electrolyte employed in the device. In a device with an electrolyte composition yielding optimum photovoltaic device efficiency. electron injection kinetics exhibit a half time of 150 ps. This half time is 20 times slower than that for control dye-sensitized films covered in inert organic liquids.

In addition. the dye sensitizer can influence many of the key electron transfer processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface which also determine efficiency. Dye structure can influence and drive forward electron injection into the conduction band of the TiO2. Conversely. dye structure can help retard loss electron transfer processes such as charge recombination of injected electrons in the TiO2 with dye cations and also recombination of these electrons with the electrolyte. Therefore tuning dye sensitizer light absorbing properties and control of the aforementioned electron transfer processes through structural design of the dye sensitizer is an important avenue through which optimization of DSSC efficiency should be pursued.

Results show that kpfo is dependent on Voc with the same form as in TiO2/dye/electrolyte cells. The added Al2O3 layer acts as a “tunnel barrier”. reducing the kpfo and thus increasing Voc. The decrease in kpfo also results in an increased fill factor. Capacitance vs voltage plots show the same curvature (∼150 mV/decade) as found in TiO2/dye/electrolyte cells.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have a significant potential as low-cost solar cells [1] and are able to reach sunlight-to-electric power conversion efficiencies of 8–11%.[2] In these cells. the sensitizer is one of the key elements in achieving a high power conversion efficiency. The design of optimal sensitizers. which combine broad visible light absorption with an excited-state directionality for favorable electron-transfer dynamics. is a key issue in the development of dye-sensitized solar cells. In the first approach. the simultaneous adsorption of the multiple dyes. which have complimentary absorption in the visible region. on TiO2 electrodes was utilized to broaden the absorption spectrum.

Emission quenching data. coupled with transient absorption studies. indicate that efficient electron injection was only achieved by the monomeric dyes. with the aggregated dye population having an injection yield an order of magnitude lower. In liquid electrolyte devices. transient absorption studies indicate that photocurrent generation is further limited by slow kinetics of the regeneration of monomeric dye cations by the iodide/iodine redox couple.

It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking-through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task. CMS must be prepared to search for new particles. such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles. from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb-1 or less.

The prime motivation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking for which the Higgs mechanism is presumed to be responsible. The experimental study of the Higgs mechanism also can shed light on the mathematical consistency of the SM at energy scales above about 1 TeV. However. there are alternatives that invoke more symmetry such as supersymmetry or invoke new forces or constituents such as strongly-broken electroweak symmetry. technicolour. etc. An as yet unknown mechanism is also possible. Furthermore there are high hopes for discoveries that could pave the way towards a unified theory. These discoveries could take the form of supersymmetry or extra dimensions. the latter requiring modification of gravity at the TeV scale. Hence there are many compelling reasons to investigate the TeV energy scale. Hadron colliders are well suited to the task of exploring new energy domains. and the region of 1 TeV constituent centre-of-mass energy can be explored if the proton energy and the luminosity are high enough. The beam energy (7 TeV) and the design luminosity (L= 1034 cm− 2 s− 1) of the LHC have been chosen in order to study physics at the TeV energy scale. Hence a wide range of physics is potentially possible with the seven-fold increase in energy and a hundred-fold increase in integrated luminosity over the current hadron collider experiments.

This comment reflects a long-standing controversy over the estimates presented by Fearnside and the experimental results that we have obtained so far on greenhouse gases emissions by hydroelectric dams in Brazil (Rosa et al.. 1996; Fearnside. 1996). The key issue in this latest comment by Fearnside is based on the fact that the water intake for the Tucuruı hydroelectric dam turbines is located at an average depth of 35m. with a high methane concentration at a pressure of around three atmospheres1 and an estimated temperature of 15◦ C. This water pressure is suddenly eased after running through the turbines to the tailrace. flowing downstream from the hydroelectric dam. while it is drawn into the spillway at a depth of no more than twenty meters. far shallower than the water intake point for the turbines. The author of these comments uses the data published by us (Rosa et al.. 1997) on the methane concentration measured by Tundisi2. who worked in cooperation with our research group.
