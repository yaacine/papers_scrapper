Here. we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets. that is. groups of genes that share common biological function. chromosomal location. or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets. including leukemia and lung cancer.

Although studies have discovered >1.200 variants associated with common diseases and traits. these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability.

The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator—that is. in as-yet undiscovered variants.

Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective. molecularly targeted therapies in some cases. KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that. when inhibited. result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele 1. 2. Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IκB kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS.

To further investigate the molecular basis of this notion. we use two methods to inhibit E-cadherin function that distinguish between E-cadherin9s cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling functions.

While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states. the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here. we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that. given certain conditions. any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells.

The method involves detection of the disease locus by virtue of the fact that the adjacent region will preferentially be homozygous by descent in such inbred children. A single affected child of a first-cousin marriage is shown to contain the same total information about linkage as a nuclear family with three affected children. Calculations show that it should be practical to map a recessive disease gene by studying DNA from fewer than a dozen unrelated. affected inbred children. given a complete RFLP linkage map.

To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains. we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation. followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes—the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation. show stringent conservation of chromatin state. and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters.

Distinctive features of the opossum chromosomes provide support for recent theories about genome evolution and function. including a strong influence of biased gene conversion on nucleotide sequence composition. and a relationship between chromosomal characteristics and X chromosome inactivation. Comparison of opossum and eutherian genomes also reveals a sharp difference in evolutionary innovation between protein-coding and non-coding functional elements. True innovation in protein-coding genes seems to be relatively rare. with lineage-specific differences being largely due to diversification and rapid turnover in gene …,True,LXVfPc8AAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,694,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05805,11829741316570512329,/scholar?cites=11829741316570512329,,https://researchprofiles.canberra.edu.au/en/publications/genome-of-the-marsupial-monodelphis-domestica-reveals-innovation-,0,0,0

For example. RNA interference 1. 2. 3 can efficiently knockdown RNAs. but it is prone to off-target effects 4. and visualizing RNAs typically relies on the introduction of exogenous tags 5. Here we demonstrate that the class 2 type VI 6. 7 RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR–Cas effector Cas13a 8 (previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for mammalian cell RNA knockdown and binding. After initial screening of 15 orthologues. we identified Cas13a from Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) as the most effective in an interference assay in Escherichia coli. LwaCas13a can be heterologously expressed in mammalian and plant cells for targeted knockdown of either reporter or endogenous transcripts with comparable levels of knockdown as RNA interference and improved specificity.

Association between 76 candidate genes and bipolar disorder was tested by genotyping 90 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes in 136 parent-proband trios. In this preliminary analysis. SNPs in two genes. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the alpha subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel were associated with bipolar disorder at the P< 0.05 level. In view of the large number of hypotheses tested. the two nominally positive associations were then tested in independent populations of bipolar patients and only BDNF remains a potential risk gene. In the replication samples. excess transmission of the valine allele of amino acid 66 of BDNF was observed in the direction of the original result in an additional sample of 334 parent-proband trios (T/U= 108/87.

Current catalogs list a total of ≈24.500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts. because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However. there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here. we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs—specifically. their properties in other primates.

The genome is relatively repetitive but has little segmental duplication. Chromosomes appear to have undergone few historical rearrangements: 53% of equine chromosomes show conserved synteny to a single human chromosome. Equine chromosome 11 is shown to have an evolutionary new centromere devoid of centromeric satellite DNA. suggesting that centromeric function may arise before satellite repeat accumulation.

Here we develop a framework for studying this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned sequence from humans. chimpanzees. gorillas and more distantly related primates. Human–chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than 84% to more than 147% of the average. a range of more than 4 million years. Our analysis also shows that human–chimpanzee speciation occurred less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently. conflicting with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly. chromosome X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time. close to the genome minimum along nearly its entire length.

Approximately 90% of the genome lies within 1.1 cM of a marker and 99% lies within 2.2 cM. The markers have an average polymorphism rate of 50% in crosses between laboratory strains. The markers are distributed in a relatively uniform fashion across the genome. although some deviations from randomness can be detected.
