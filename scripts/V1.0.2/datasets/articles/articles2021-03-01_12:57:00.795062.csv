The idea is to produce this and some extra electricity within the furnace in order to save resources and to gain operation reliability and independency. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) allow direct conversion of heat to electrical power. They have the advantage of a long maintenance-free durability and noiseless operation without moving parts or any working fluid. The useful heat remains almost the same and still can be used for heating. The challenge is the system integration and optimisation of TEGs in pellet burners.

Though. steady state measurements represent results only for optimal operation. In practice results differ due to varying operating conditions. Therefore. of a test stand measurement method to derive realistic annual system efficiencies and emission factors is developed. The method includes a heat loss model for thermal storages too. It can be used to test automatically fed biomass boiler. manually loaded biomass boilers and boiler/heat accumulator combinations. For the evaluation of the measurement data a calculation method based on mass flows was developed. The results of our experiments show that the newly developed method is a good tool to evaluate small-scale biomass boilers. With this method an easy and reliable instrument to determine annual system efficiencies and emission factors for realistic boiler operation is provided.

1093346,Efficiency optimization of biomass boilers by a combined condensation-heat pump-system,2011,Babette Hebenstreit and Rosemarie Schnetzinger and Ralf Ohnmacht and Ernst Höftberger and Walter Haslinger,,Proceedings of ECOS,,1465-1477,,About 30% of the total energy use in Austria is dedicated to heating purposes and hot water provision. During the last decade. biomass boilers had a major comeback due to increasing prizes for fossil fuels and the renewable character of the fuel. In 2009. 20.000 biomass boilers with a nominal thermal output up to 100kW were installed in Austria. However. conventional small scale biomass boilers reach only about 73% to 89% energy efficiency based on the gross calorific value [1]. This disadvantage originates mainly from the flue gas temperature. The sensible heat and. more importantly. the latent heat of water are lost to the ambient. Therefore. a module. which transfers the heat of condensation to the return flow. strongly enhances the efficiency.In this paper we present the concept of active condensation. which combines a condensation device and a heat pump. In a first step the flue gas is cooled down until almost complete condensation of the water vapor. Afterwards a heat pump transforms the recovered low temperature energy to the temperature of the return flow. This technology can be used independently of the return flow temperature. which is especially important for retrofitted houses. where the return flow temperature is often higher than the condensation temperature of the flue gas.,True,KyGnCx8AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,10,https://www.bioenergy2020.eu/files/publications/pdf/ECOS2011_Paper.pdf,8089004673561365579,/scholar?cites=8089004673561365579,,https://www.bioenergy2020.eu/files/publications/pdf/ECOS2011_Paper.pdf,0,0,0

As the thresholds for ambient levels of harmful particulate matter (PM10 and PM2. 5) are exceeded in many regions. public authorities are forced to implement effective emission reduction measures. But it seems that especially in real life operation RWC appliances are far away from test stand results regarding emissions and efficiency [3]. Prohibition as the most effective measure. however. is clearly in conflict with Europe’s renewable energy targets. Therefore it is essential to understand the reasons for high emissions of RWC appliances in real life operation to be able to improve the situation.

If an airline decides how many seats to protect for sale at a high fare based on past high-fare sales. while neglecting to account for the fact that availability of low-fare tickets will reduce high-fare sales. then high-fare sales will decrease. resulting in lower future estimates of high-fare demand. This subsequently yields lower protection levels for high-fare tickets. greater availability of low-fare tickets. and even lower high-fare ticket sales.

This class of problems allows for the modeling of optimization problems where a risk-averse decision maker wants to ensure that the solution produced by the model dominates certain benchmarks. Here we deal with the case of multi-variate stochastic dominance under general distributions and nonlinear functions. We introduce the concept of -dominance. which generalizes some notions of multi-variate dominance found in the literature. We apply the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method to this problem. which results in a semi-infinite program. and study asymptotic convergence of optimal values and optimal solutions. as well as the rate of convergence of the feasibility set of the resulting semi-infinite program as the sample size goes to infinity.

The cut generation problem is a difference of convex functions (DC) optimization problem.

In particular. we focus on the traditional probabilistic model proposed in the literature. The approach we study consists of solving a sequence of two-stage stochastic programs with simple recourse. which can be viewed as an approximation to a multi-stage stochastic programming formulation to the seat allocation problem. Our theoretical results show that the proposed approximation is robust. in the sense that solving more successive two-stage programs can never worsen the expected revenue obtained with the corresponding allocation policy. Although intuitive. such a property is known not to hold for the traditional deterministic linear programming model found in the literature. We also show that this property does not hold for some bid-price policies.

While much attention has been recently devoted in the literature to this type of model. it appears that there is no consensus on the best way to accomplish that goal. In this paper. we discuss pros and cons of some of the existing approaches. A key notion that must be considered in the analysis is that of consistency. which roughly speaking means that decisions made today should agree with the planning made yesterday for the scenario that actually occurred. Several definitions of consistency have been proposed in the literature. with various levels of rigor; we provide our own definition and give conditions for a multi-period risk measure to be consistent.

These problems arise from applications where travelers are concerned with the trade off between the risks associated with random travel time and other travel costs. Risk-averse behavior is embedded by requiring the random travel times on the optimal paths to stochastically dominate that on a benchmark path in the second order. A general linear operating cost is introduced to combine link- and path-based costs. The latter. which is the focus of the paper. is employed to address schedule costs pertinent to late and early arrival.

Even in settings where the demand for a seller’s products also depends on decisions of other sellers. the models often do not explicitly account for such decisions. It has been conjectured in the revenue management literature that such monopoly models may incorporate the effects of competition. because the parameter estimates of the monopoly models are based on data collected in the presence of competition. In this paper we take a closer look at such a setting to investigate the behavior of parameter estimates and decisions if monopoly models are used in the presence of competition.

However. in practice. the probability distribution oftentimes is not known or cannot be accurately approximated.

In this paper we analyze the case where there is a finite number of possible scenarios and study the question of how to identify the critical scenarios resulting from solving a DRSP. We illustrate that not all. but only some scenarios might have “effect” on the optimal value. and we formally define this notion for our general class of problems.

We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic program. The first-stage decisions are strategic location decisions. whereas the second stage consists of operational decisions. The objective is to minimize the sum of investment costs and expected costs of operating the supply chain. In particular the model emphasizes the importance of operational flexibility when making strategic decisions. For that reason short-term uncertainty is considered as well as long-term uncertainty. The real-world case used to illustrate the model is from the Norwegian meat industry. We solve the problem by sample average approximation in combination with dual decomposition.

A frequently taken approach. the two-stage paradigm. involves partitioning the problem variables into two stages:  those that have to be decided before and those that can be decided after the uncertain parameters reveal themselves. The resulting two-stage stochastic optimization models minimize the sum of the costs of the first stage and the expected cost of the second stage. A potential limitation of this approach is that it does not account for the variability of the second-stage costs and might lead to solutions where the actual second-stage costs are unacceptably high. In order to resolve this difficulty. we introduce a robustness measure that penalizes second-stage costs that are above the expected cost.

The work focuses on providing closed expressions for the optimal harvesting policy in terms of the parameters of the price process and the discount factor. with finite and infinite time horizon. We assume that harvest is restricted to mature trees older than a certain age and that growth and natural mortality after maturity are neglected. We use stochastic dynamic programming techniques to characterize the optimal policy and we model price using a geometric Brownian motion and an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. In the first case we completely characterize the optimal policy for all possible choices of the parameters. In the second case we provide sufficient conditions. based on explicit expressions for reservation prices. assuring that harvesting everything available is optimal.

We show that if deforestation occurs from some initial state. then it must occur in finite time along every optimal path so that zero forest cover is the globally stable optimal steady state. We develop a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for deforestation. Deforestation is less likely if the immediate profitability of timber harvest. the benefits from stocks of standing forests and the timber content of trees are higher.

It distinguishes the 1949 conception. a response of Samuelson to a 1945 von Neumann challenge to the reception of his growth model in the economic literature. from the more capacious 1976 outline furnished by McKenzie. Thus. it differentiates asymptotic convergence of infinite-horizon optimal programs from what it terms their finite-horizon. classical turnpike counterparts. It identifies a move from the investigation of general theorems to a more detailed working of simple examples. and reports results on specific models of ‘choice of technique’ in development planning. and of lumber extraction in the economics of forestry. Drawing on ongoing advances in the field of dynamical systems. it sees such models as both litmus tests of the general theory and as productive settings to study the rationalisability of policy functions and a ‘folk theorem of intertemporal resource allocation'.

We analyze the effect of such irreversibility (reforestation cost) on the efficiency of forest conservation in a general model of optimal forest management where trees are classified in age classes and land has alternative economic use. Irreversibility may lead to a continuum of optimal steady states that differ in the area under forest cover; increase in irreversibility can only add steady states with smaller forest cover. High irreversibility discourages expansion of forests but at the same time. makes it optimal to conserve a minimal forested area in the long run; in particular. it is optimal to maintain a forested area above a critical size if the initial forest cover lies above it. while forests that are initially smaller than the critical level are optimally managed at constant size.

Modern forest-management needs models taking into account the relatively long rotation. the multiaged structure. the age-dependent timber content of trees. and the multiple services forests provide. Approaches to characterize the optimal management policy range from models that represent the forest by a unique state variable that can usually be solved analytically (i.e.. models that consider forests composed by a unique even-aged stand or allow a uneven aged forest but only consider its total biomass). to much more sophisticated linear and integer programming harvest scheduling models. In this survey. we focus on dynamic optimization problems where the forest is represented with an age-class structure.

As a consequence of this trade-off. parties have different preferences over the level of the environmental stock even when there is no cost of changing policy. The possibility of costly policy change introduces an additional conflict of interest. Reducing the environmental stock is costless but increasing the environmental stock involves direct transaction costs in addition to the indirect costs of tighter policies.

1093456,Classical Turnpike Theory and the Economics of Forestry: The Discounted Case,2009,M Ali Khan and Adriana Piazza,,,,,,In recent work [1. 2]. the authors frame the (Ramseyian) economics of forestry in the undiscounted setting of upper semicontinuous benefit (felicity) functions that are required to be price-supported at the yields of a golden-rule forest configuration. but not necessarily to be concave. Through a non-interiority condition on the convex hull of the zeroes of a resulting “discrepancy function.” they present a unified theory. one for which robust asymptotic convergence and classical turnpike theorems can be obtained. These results are of particular interest for the general theory of intertemporal resource allocation in that they pertain to a transitional production set which does not satisfy the assumptions of inaction and free disposal. In this paper. we trace out the ramifications of this work for the discounted setting. and thereby present a generalized theory that covers the economics of the Mitra-Wan tree farm under one rubric that moves seamlessly between the discounted and undiscounted cases. and thereby gives additional insight into both.

Since the 1960s. it has been known that this problem can be cast as an integer programming model.

The ultimate pit limit problem determines a set of notional three-dimensional blocks containing ore and/or waste material to extract to maximize value subject to geospatial precedence constraints. Open pit production scheduling problems seek to determine when. if ever. a block is extracted from an open pit mine.

Since  is a convex function. it is suitable as an objective for optimization problems when we desire to minimize risk. In the case that the underlying distribution has discrete support. this problem can be formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem.

This includes the wide class of NP-hard control problems representable by means of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown in this paper that by appropriate sampling of the constraints one obtains a standard convex optimization problem (the scenario problem) whose solution is approximately feasible for the original (usually infinite) set of constraints. i.e.. the measure of the set of original constraints that are violated by the scenario solution rapidly decreases to zero as the number of samples is increased.

Two main approaches are generally available to tackle constrained optimization problems in presence of uncertainty: robust optimization and chance-constrained optimization. Robust optimization is a deterministic paradigm where one seeks a solution which simultaneously satisfies all possible constraint instances.

Along a robust approach. the decision should be guaranteed to work well in all possible realizations of the uncertainty. A less restrictive approach consists instead of requiring that the risk of failure associated to the decision should be small in some–possibly probabilistic–sense. From a mathematical viewpoint. the latter formulation leads to a chance-constrained optimization program. ie to an optimization program subject to constraints in probability. Unfortunately. however. both the robust approach as well as the chance-constrained approach are computationally intractable in general.In this paper. we present a computationally efficient methodology for dealing with uncertainty in optimization based on sampling a finite number of instances (or scenarios) of the uncertainty. In particular. we consider uncertain programs with convexity structure. and show that the scenario-based solution is. with high confidence. a feasible solution for the chance-constrained problem.

1093505,Learning dynamical systems in a stationary environment,1998,MC Campi and PR Kumar,34,Systems & control letters,3,125-132,North-Holland,We consider the problem of learning the input–output relation of a dynamical system from noisy data. Our method rests on the use of a smooth simultaneous estimator which generalizes the standard empirical estimator. In a stationary environment. our algorithm is shown to select a model which exhibits the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) property under very mild conditions.This contribution should be thought of as a first attempt to extend concepts developed in learning theory to the field of system identification where. due to the presence of the system dynamics. the typical i.i.d. assumption on the data made in learning theory is not satisfied.,True,Hr-GvgQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016769119800005X,1140912883762063780,/scholar?cites=1140912883762063780,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.6327&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1093506,Recursive Least-Squares Identification Algorithms with Incomplete Excitation: Convergence Analysis,1990,Sergio Bittanti and Paolo Bolzern,35,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,12,,,In this note. the convergence properties of a fairly general class of adaptive recursive least-squares algorithms are studied under the assumption that the data generation mechanism is deterministic and time invariant. First. the (open-loop) identification case is considered. By a suitable notion of excitation subspace. the convergence analysis of the identification algorithm is carried out with no persistent excitation hypothesis. Precisely. it is proven that the projection of the parameter error on the excitation subspace tends to zero. while the orthogonal component of the error remains bounded. Then. the convergence of an adaptive control scheme based on the minimum variance control law is dealt with. By suitably exploiting the previously-mentioned convergence result relative to the identification case. it can be shown that. under the standard minimum-phase assumption. the tracking error tends to zero and the control …,True,Hr-GvgQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,58,https://marco-campi.unibs.it/pdf-pszip/IEEE-RLS.pdf,10311306929416081112,/scholar?cites=10311306929416081112,,https://marco-campi.unibs.it/pdf-pszip/IEEE-RLS.pdf,0,0,0

As a consequence of this philosophy. the estimation problem is decoupled from the control problem and this substantially simplifies the corresponding adaptive control scheme. On the other hand. the complete absence of dual properties makes certainty equivalent controllers run into an identifiability problem which generally leads to a strictly suboptimal performance.In this paper. we introduce a cost-biased parameter estimator to overcome this difficulty. This estimator is applied to a linear quadratic Gaussian controller. The corresponding adaptive scheme is proven to be stable and optimal when the unknown system parameter lies in an infinite. yet compact. parameter set.,True,Hr-GvgQAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,57,https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0363012997317499,14790925635844391439,/scholar?cites=14790925635844391439,,https://cesg.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ps_files/adaptive_lqg_5.pdf,0,0,0

1093510,Optimal capital allocation principles,2012,Jan Dhaene and Andreas Tsanakas and Emiliano A Valdez and Steven Vanduffel,79,Journal of Risk and Insurance,1,1-28,Blackwell Publishing Inc,This article develops a unifying framework for allocating the aggregate capital of a financial firm to its business units. The approach relies on an optimization argument. requiring that the weighted sum of measures for the deviations of the business unit's losses from their respective allocated capitals be minimized. The approach is fair insofar as it requires capital to be close to the risk that necessitates holding it. The approach is additionally very flexible in the sense that different forms of the objective function can reflect alternative definitions of corporate risk tolerance. Owing to this flexibility. the general framework reproduces several capital allocation methods that appear in the literature and allows for alternative interpretations and possible extensions.,True,FzSoS7wAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,230,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1539-6975.2011.01408.x,14149917392772452813,/scholar?cites=14149917392772452813,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/13574/1/MPRA_paper_13574.pdf,0,0,0

We propose to complement the subadditivity condition by a regulator's condition. We find that for an explicitly specified confidence level. the Value‐at‐Risk satisfies the regulator's condition and is the “most efficient” capital requirement in the sense that it minimizes some reasonable cost function.

We discuss when the bounds are sharp (attainable) and also point out a new connection between the study of VaR bounds and the convex ordering of aggregate risk. This connection leads to the construction of an algorithm. called Extended Rearrangement Algorithm (ERA). that makes it possible to approximate sharp VaR bounds.

We highlight the connections between cost-efficiency and dependence. This allows us to extend the theory to deal with state-dependent constraints to better reflect real-world preferences.

However. in practice only default correlations are often available but not the factor loadings.

We then assume that investors use a stochastic benchmark (linked to the market) as a reference portfolio. We derive mean–variance efficient portfolios when investors aim to achieve a given correlation (or a given dependence structure) with this benchmark. We also provide upper bounds on Sharpe ratios and show how these bounds can be useful for fraud detection.

In the first part. we extend Cheung (2008b) to show that when the marginal distributions are fixed. a sum with maximal variance is in fact a comonotonic sum. Thus the convex upper bound is achieved if and only if the marginal variables are comonotonic. Next. we study the situation where besides the marginal distributions; the variance of the sum is also fixed. Intuitively one expects that adding this information may lead to a bound that is sharper than the comonotonic upper bound. However. we show that such upper bound does not even exist. Nevertheless. we can still identify a special dependence structure known as upper comonotonicity. in which case the sum behaves like a convex largest sum in the upper tail.

Its outstanding functional importance in the organism implies a strong need for brain imaging modalities. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides deep insights. its spatial resolution is insufficient to study the structure on the level of individual cells. Therefore. our knowledge of brain microstructure currently relies on two-dimensional techniques. optical and electron microscopy. which generally require severe preparation procedures including sectioning and staining. X-ray absorption microtomography yields the necessary spatial resolution. but since the composition of the different types of brain tissue is similar. the images show only marginal contrast.

Among these challenges are malicious activities that target IoT devices and cause serious damage. such as data leakage. phishing and spamming campaigns. distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. and security breaches. In this paper. a stacked deep learning method is proposed to detect malicious traffic data. particularly malicious attacks targeting IoT devices. The proposed stacked deep learning method is bundled with five pretrained residual networks (ResNets) to deeply learn the characteristics of the suspicious activities and distinguish them from normal traffic. Each pretrained ResNet model consists of 10 residual blocks. We used two large datasets to evaluate the performance of our detection method. We investigated two heterogeneous IoT environments to make our approach deployable in any IoT setting.

The incorporation of highly defective nickel hydroxide nanostructures is believed to play the decisive role in promoting the dissociative adsorption of water molecules and subsequent oxidative removal of carbonaceous poison on neighbouring platinum sites. As a result. the ternary hybrids exhibit exceptional activity and durability towards efficient methanol oxidation reaction. Under periodic reactivations. the hybrids can endure at least 500.000 s with negligible activity loss. which is. to the best of our knowledge. two …,True,RK7GT_AAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,306,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10035?origin=ppub,15590941419426803272,/scholar?cites=15590941419426803272,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10035?origin=ppub,0,0,0

By changing the polarization direction of the incident laser at 785 nm with respect to the film stretching direction. the magnitude of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance of AuNRs can be varied continuously. which determines the amount of heat generated upon laser exposure and thus the local temperature rise in the composite relative to the glass transition of the PVA matrix. Consequently. the temporary‐to‐permanent shape recovery process of the composite can be made to occur to different extents by tuning the polarization of laser while keeping all other conditions unchanged. This finding enhances the toolbox for controlling light‐triggered SMPs.       ,True,RJHBEyQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,55,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.201300629,18080038865000272066,/scholar?cites=18080038865000272066,,,0,0,0

Claverie,29,Chemistry of Materials,21,9579-9587,American Chemical Society,Nanostructures constituted of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on carbon materials are considered to be among the most active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for fuel cells. However. in practice. the usage of such ORR catalysts is limited by their insufficient durability caused by the low physical and chemical stability of Pt NPs during the reaction. We herein present a strategy to synthesize highly durable and active electrocatalysts composed of Pt NPs supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and covered with an ultrathin layer of graphitic carbon. Such hybrid ORR catalysts were obtained by an interfacial in situ polymer encapsulation–graphitization method. where a glucose-containing polymer was grown directly on the surface of Pt/CNTs. The thickness of the carbon-coating layer can be precisely tuned between 0.5 nm and several nanometers by simply programming the polymer growth on Pt/CNTs.

The Au100-xPtx NPs were prepared by pulsed laser ablation in an alkaline solution without using any surfactants or capping agents. The diameter of the particle ranges from 2.5 nm for pure Pt to 5.2 nm for pure Au NPs. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the number of DA molecules being oxidized on the NPs surface decreases with the Au content (from 9.0 × 10−11 mol on Au to 4.8 × 10−11 mol on Pt NPs). which emphasizes the preponderant role of Au surface sites on the electrochemical oxidation of DA.

The Diels–Alder reaction has been successfully extended with graphene oxide as a source of diene by using maleic anhydride as a dienophile. thereby outlining the presence of the cis diene present in the graphene oxide framework. This reaction provides fundamental information for understanding the exact structure and chemical nature of graphene oxide. On the basis of high‐resolution 13C‐SS NMR spectra. we show evidence for the formation of new sp3 carbon centers covalently bonded to graphene oxide following hydrolysis of the reaction product.

The humidity-sensing characteristics of aligned suspended single-walled carbon nanotube films are studied. A comparative study between suspended and non-suspended architectures is done by recording the resistance change in the nanotubes under humidity. For the tests. the humidity was varied from 15% to 98% RH. A comparative study between suspended and non-suspended devices shows that the response and recovery times of the suspended devices was found to be almost 3 times shorter than the non-suspended devices. The suspended devices also showed minimal hysteresis even after 10 humidity cycles. and also exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Repeatability tests were performed by subjecting the sensors to continuous humidification cycles. All tests reported here have been performed using pristine non-functionalized nanotubes.

Introduction: The drag (D) of seven (7) male swimmers wearing five (5) swimsuits was investigated. Methods: The drag was measured during passive surface tows at speeds from 0.2 up to 2.2 m· s 1 and during starts and push-offs. The swimsuits varied in body coverage from shoulder-to-ankle (SA). shoulder-to-knee (SK). waist-to-ankle (WA) and waist-to-knee (WK) and briefs (CS). Results: Differences in total drag among the suits were small. but significant. In terms of least drag at 2.2 m· s 1. the swimsuits ranked: SK. SA. WA. WK and CS. The drag was decomposed into its pressure drag (DP). skin friction drag (DSF) and wave drag (DW) components using nonlinear regression and classical formulations for each drag component. The transition-to-turbulence Reynolds number and decreasing frontal area with speed were taken into account. The transition-to-turbulence Reynolds number location was found to be very close to the swimmers’“leading edge.” ie the head. Flow was neither completely laminar. nor completely turbulent; but rather. it was transitional over most of the body. The DP contributed the most to drag at low speeds (1.0 m· s 1) and DW the least at all speeds. DSF contributed the most at higher speeds for SA and SK suits. whereas DP and DW were reduced compared with the other suits. Conclusion: The decomposition of swimmer drag into DSF.

While these flows have well-known power-law similarity solutions when the fluid viscosity is taken to be constant. they are non-similar when the viscosity is considered to be a function of temperature. A single similar flow. that adjacent to a vertical isothermal surface. is also analyzed for comparison in order to estimate the extent of validity of the perturbation analysis. The formulation used here provides a unified treatment of variable viscosity effects on these four flows. With the exception of water. the major temperature variation of the fluid properties of common liquids is seen to be in the absolute viscosity.

The performance of divers using fins is impacted by the energy cost of swimming. as it determines their breathing-air use. and thus their dive time. oxygen exposure and thermal status. as well as potential fatigue. The energy cost of swimming is determined by the average velocity of forward progression and the ratio of the power required (including drag and internal and kinetic power) to the mechanical efficiency while actually swimming (active)(1).

This process employs a Roots-type mechanism to heat gases to very high temperatures by compressive gas heating. A CFD model predicting the leakage flows in the machine was developed. and an excellent comparison with experimental data taken on a two-lobe Roots blower was obtained.

The general formulation is applied to the steam-air system. and the heat transfer with and without the noncondensable is compared for a wide range of operating conditions. The reductions in heat transfer due to the non-condensable are accentuated at low operating pressures. In general. condensation in the forced convection flow is much less sensitive than that in a gravity flow. The effect of an interfacial resistance (i.e. a temperature jump at the liquid-vapor interface) is also examined.

Examination of non-equilibrium phenomena shows that this hypothesis is usually not valid during rapid heating or cooling. The results from this theoretical study confirm that local thermal equilibrium in a fluidized bed depends on the size of the layer. mean pore size. interstitial heat transfer coefficient. and thermophysical properties. For a porous medium subject to rapid transient heating. the existence of the local thermal equilibrium depends on the magnitude of the Sparrow number and on the rate of change of the heat input.,True,-th0SVMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,278,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931099000435,11905824048382271722,/scholar?cites=11905824048382271722,,https://intra.engr.ucr.edu/~vafai/Publications/new/PDF%20Papers/Minkowcys.pdf,0,0,0

The difference occurs in approximating the Forchheimer term in the time-averaged momentum equation. Unlike the Antohe and Lage’s work. where only the linear terms of the expansion are kept. in the presently proposed model we include the second-order correlation term. This inclusion gives rise to an extra term in the transport momentum equation which. in turn. gives rise to additional terms in the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation rate. The additional higher order terms produce correlation coefficients that are used to absorb any departure from the clear flow when expressing the two-equation turbulence model for incompressible flow in a porous medium.,True,-th0SVMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,188,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931099003452,10004103137248289488,/scholar?cites=10004103137248289488,,,0,0,0

The current method of solving these equations is forward integration in conjunction with a shooting method for determining certain of the starting values for the integration. This approach has been found to be less and less effective as the number of simultaneous equations increases. The numerical solution scheme described here is able to deal effectively with the multiequation systems encountered in local nonsimilarity boundary-layer analysis.

Here. the flow in a conical diffuser fed by a fully developed velocity at its inlet and mated at its downstream end to a long circular pipe is investigated by means of numerical simulation. A universal flow-regime model was used to accommodate possible laminarization of flows having moderate-turbulent and transitional Reynolds numbers at the diffuser inlet. It was found that flow separation occurred for a diffuser expansion angle of 5° for inlet Reynolds numbers less than about 2000. This finding invalidates a prior rule-of-thumb that flow separation first occurs at a divergence angle of seven degrees.

The currently accepted Nusselt number correlation for the transition regime. due to Gnielinski. is restricted to the high-Reynolds-number end of that regime. This limitation results from the need for a valid friction factor—Reynolds correlation for input to the Gnielinski equation. Heretofore. such correlations have been unavailable for the low-Reynolds-number end.

The solution method is applicable to free stream flows that are either binary mixtures of a condensable vapor and a noncondensable gas or pure condensable vapors. Specific numerical results are obtained for the condensation of steam with air as noncondensable. The effect of superheating on condensation heat transfer is found to be significant only in the range of relaively small differences between the free stream saturation temperature and the wall temperature. Furthermore. the influence of superheating is markedly augmented by the presence of noncondensable gases.

Specific consideration is given to helium injection into air in the stagnation-point region of a horizontal cylinder. Mass and energy transport by thermal diffusion and diffusion thermo are also included in the analysis. It is found that both the transpiration-induced buoyancy and the diffusional transports play a decisive role in determining the heat transfer when the wall-to-stream temperature ratio (Tw/T∞) is only moderately different from unity. In particular. when Tw/T∞ > 1. the tendency of the transpiration-induced buoyancy to increase the heat transfer is opposed by the action of diffusion thermo.

Effects of mass flux. heat flux. pressure and inlet temperature on the heat transfer performance were given in detail. The influences of buoyancy and flow acceleration under different flow conditions were discussed as well. It was found that the inner wall temperature varies non-linearly at different mass fluxes. Heat transfer is improved when the fuel temperature is around the critical temperature. The heat transfer coefficient increases as heat flux or inlet temperature increases. while increase in inlet pressure reduces heat transfer coefficient. Besides. as nanofluids generally have higher thermal conductivity compared to their corresponding base fluids (i.e. kerosene). the heat transfer characteristics of Fe3O4-kerosene nanofluid was also investigated.

A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that CD8+ T cells of different specificities compete for access to epitopes on antigen-presenting cells. and that the outcome of this so-called cross-competition reflects the number of induced T cells. In our study using a vaccinia virus infection model. we found that T cell cross-competition is highly relevant during boost vaccination. thereby shaping the immunodominance hierarchy in the recall. We demonstrate that competition was of no importance during priming and was unaffected by the applied route of immunization. It strongly depended on the timing of viral antigen expression in infected APCs. and it was characterized by poor proliferation of T cells recognizing epitopes derived from late viral proteins.

It is formulated as the mathematical problem of finding the minimal value for implicit nonlinear discrete/continues objective function with inequality constraints. The optimizing variables include the number of passes for both streams. the numbers of plates with different corrugation geometries in each pass. the plate type and size.

We denote the periods with visibility below 2 km as extreme haze and refer to the rest as reference periods. During the measurements in Xi'an an extreme haze covered the city for about a week and the total non-refractory (NR)-PM2.5 mass fraction reached peak concentrations of over 1000 µg m−3. During the measurements in Beijing two extreme haze events occurred. but the temporal extent and the total concentrations reached during these events were lower than in Xi'an. Average PM2.5 concentrations of 537 ± 146 and 243 ± 47 µg m−3 (including NR species and equivalent black carbon. eBC) were recorded during the extreme haze events in Xi'an and Beijing. respectively. During the reference periods the measured average concentrations were 140 ± 99 µg m−3 in Xi'an and 75 ± 61 µg m−3 in Beijing. The relative composition of the NR-PM2.5 evolved substantially during the extreme haze periods. with increased contributions of the inorganic components (mostly sulfate and nitrate). Our results suggest that the high relative humidity present during the extreme haze events had a strong effect on the increase of sulfate mass (via aqueous phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide). Another relevant characteristic of the extreme haze is the size of the measured particles.

The main advantage of our method lies in a feedback-control framework which faithfully recovers the high-resolution image information from the input data. without imposing additional local structure constraints learned from other examples. This makes our method independent of the quality and number of the selected examples. which are issues typical of learning-based algorithms. while producing high-quality results without observable unsightly artifacts. Another advantage is that our method naturally extends to video upsampling. where the temporal coherence is maintained automatically. Finally. our method runs very fast.

Berberine (BBR) is a natural compound isolated from plants such as Coptis chinensis and Hydrastis canadensis and with multiple pharmacological activities. Recent studies showed that BBR had antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. which contributed in part to its efficacy against diabetes mellitus. In this review. we summarized the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of BBR as well as their molecular basis.

Graphite is traditionally known to be hydrophobic with water contact angle (WCA) within the 75–95° range. We found that the WCA of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) was 64.4 ± 2.9° when measured within 10 s after exfoliation in air and increased to ca. 90° after exposure to the ambient air. Ellipsometry measurement showed growth of an adsorptive layer on exfoliated HOPG and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) data indicated that the layer is airborne hydrocarbon.

Despite their importance. not much is known about the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways involved. In this study. we therefore sought to identify the signaling pathways and mechanisms involved in c-KIT mediated regulation of Mitf. We report that c-KIT stimulation leads to the activation of Mitf specifically through the c-KIT phosphorylation sites Y721 (PI3 kinase binding site). Y568 and Y570 (Src binding site). Our study not only confirms the involvement of Ras-Erk signaling pathway in the activation of Mitf. but also establishes that Src kinase binding to Y568 and Y570 of c-KIT is required. Using specific inhibitors we observe and verify that c-KIT induced activation of Mitf is dependent on PI3-. Akt-. Src-. p38- or Mek kinases. Moreover. the proliferative effect of c-KIT is dependent on Mitf in HEK293T cells.

Substitution of aspartic acid with valine (D816V) renders the receptor independent of ligand for activation and signaling. Wild-type c-Kit is a tyrosine kinase receptor that requires its ligand. stem cell factor (SCF). for activation. Several isoforms of c-Kit exist as a result of alternative mRNA splicing. of which two are characterized by the presence or absence of four amino acids (GNNK− and GNNK+. respectively) in the extracellular domain. The two isoforms show differences in signal transduction and biological activities and the shorter isoform seems to be highly expressed than the longer isoform in human malignancies.

Approximately one third of all patients with AML carry an activating mutation in FLT3 that drives proliferation and survival of the leukemic cells. The most common activating mutation is the so-called internal tandem duplication (ITD). which involves an in-frame duplication of a segment of varying length in the region of the FLT3 gene that encodes the juxtamembrane domain. The pathways downstream of FLT3-ITD are partially known but further knowledge regarding the downstream signal transduction molecules is important in order to develop alternative strategies for pharmacological intervention.In this paper we have studied the role of MEK/ERK5 in FLT3-ITD mediated transformation.

Ltd.,Drawing upon previously published results. we evaluate the offshore potential for storing CO2 within marine sediments located inside the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We then model the cost for transporting and injecting CO2 into these strata. including into deep‐marine (>3000m water depth) strata that we refer to as being ‘self‐sealing' because pressure and temperature regimes would form an overlying gravitational seal. Finally. we compare the integrated transport and injection cost estimates for self‐sealing and non‐self‐sealing offshore storage against the same integrated cost estimates for onshore storage in 15 deep‐saline sandstone aquifers located throughout the continental USA. The comparison is presented in the form of marginal abatement cost curves. which show that ocean storage is likely to be two or more times as expensive as onshore storage: 500 million tonnes of annual CO2 emissions …,True,x4y7LHQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,10,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ghg.1308,4700240055171213996,/scholar?cites=4700240055171213996,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ghg.1308,0,0,0

Using possible injection rates for deep-saline sandstone aquifers. we estimate that the footprint of a sequestration site could range from <100 km2 to >100 000 km2. and that distribution costs could be <$0.10/tonne to >$10/tonne. Our findings are based on two models for determining well spacing: one which minimizes spacing in order to maximize use of the volumetric capacity of the reservoir. and a second that determines spacing to minimize subsurface pressure interference between injection wells.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a group of technologies that would permit the continued use of carbon-intense fuels such as coal for energy production while avoiding further impact on the global climate system. The mechanism most often proposed for storage is injection of CO 2 below the surface of the Earth in geological media. with the most promising option for CO 2 reservoirs being deep saline aquifers (DSA’s). Unlike oil and gas reservoirs. deep saline aquifers are poorly characterized and the variability in their properties is large enough to have a high impact on the overall physical and economic viability of CCS.

The onset criterion currently in use emphasizes the time-averaged boundary shear stress and therefore is incapable of accounting for the fluctuating forces encountered in turbulent flows. We have validated through laboratory experiments and analytical formulation of the problem a criterion based upon the impulse imparted to a sediment grain.

Revegetation of riverbanks is commonly used as a means of stream rehabilitation and management of bank instability and erosion. In this experimental study. the effect of different riverbank vegetation densities on flow hydrodynamics across the channel. including the riparian zone. are reported and discussed. The configuration of vegetation elements follows either linear or staggered arrangements as vegetation density is progressively increased. within a representative range of vegetation densities found in nature. Hydrodynamic measurements including mean streamwise velocity and turbulent intensity flow profiles are recorded via acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV)—both at the main channel and within the riverbank. These results show that for the main channel and the toe of riverbank. turbulence intensity for the low densities (λ≈ 0 to 0.12 m− 1) can increase up to 40% compared the case of high densities (λ= 0.94 to 1.9 m− 1). Further analysis of these data allowed the estimation of bed-shear stresses. demonstrating 84% and 23% increase at the main channel and near the toe region. for increasing densities (λ= 0 to 1.9 m− 1). Quantifying these hydrodynamic effects is important for assessing the contribution of physically representative ranges of riparian vegetation densities on hydrogeomorphologic feedback.

1094414,A new system for bridge scour monitoring and prediction,2015,Manousos Valyrakis and Panagiotis Michalis and Hanqing Zhang,,"Proceedings of the 36th IAHR World Congress, The Hague, the Netherlands",,1-4,,Earth's surface is continuously shaped due to the action of geophysical flows. Erosion due to the flow of water in river systems has been identified as a key problem in preserving ecological health but also a threat to our built environment and critical infrastructure. worldwide. As an example. it has been estimated that a major reason for bridge failure is due to scour. Even though the flow past bridge piers has been investigated both experimentally and numerically. and the mechanisms of scouring are relatively understood. there still lacks a tool that can offer fast and reliable predictions. Most of the existing formulas for prediction of bridge pier scour depth are empirical in nature. based on a limited range of data or for piers of specific shape. In this work. the use of a novel methodology is proposed for the prediction of bridge scour. Specifically. the use of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is proposed to estimate the scour depth around bridge piers. In particular. various complexity architectures are sequentially built. in order to identify the optimal for scour depth predictions. using appropriate training and validation subsets obtained from the USGS database (and preprocessed to remove incomplete records). The model has five variables. namely the effective pier width (b). the approach velocity (v). the approach depth (y). the mean grain diameter (D50) and the skew to flow. Simulations are conducted with data groups (bed material type. pier type and shape) and different number of input variables. to produce reduced complexity and easily interpretable models.

1094416,The critical role of the boundary layer thickness for the initiation of aeolian sediment transport,2018,Thomas Pähtz and Manousos Valyrakis and Xiao-Hu Zhao and Zhen-Shan Li,8,Geosciences,9,314,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Here. we propose a conceptual framework of Aeolian sediment transport initiation that includes the role of turbulence. Upon increasing the wind shear stress τ above a threshold value τ t′. particles resting at the bed surface begin to rock in their pockets because the largest turbulent fluctuations of the instantaneous wind velocity above its mean value u induce fluid torques that exceed resisting torques. Upon a slight further increase of τ. rocking turns into a rolling regime (ie. rolling threshold τ t≃ τ t′) provided that the ratio between the integral time scale T i∝ δ/u (where δ is the boundary layer thickness) and the time T e∝ d/[(1− 1/s) g] required for entrainment (where d is the particle diameter and s the particle–air–density ratio) is sufficiently large. Rolling then evolves into mean-wind-sustained saltation transport provided that the mean wind is able to compensate energy losses from particle-bed rebounds. However. when T i/T e is too small. the threshold ratio scales as τ t/τ t′∝ T e/T i∝ s d 2/δ 2. consistent with experiments. Because δ/d controls T i/T e and the relative amplitude of turbulent wind velocity fluctuations. we qualitatively predict that Aeolian sediment transport in natural atmospheres can be initiated under weaker (potentially much weaker) winds than in wind tunnels. consistent with indirect observational evidence on Earth and Mars.

Cascading effects of structural failures to other types of critical infrastructure have been evident by many recent cases. such as the Oroville dam incident (2017). with substantial costs for asset owners. insurers and maintainers and significant disruption to civil society. Over the last two decades. there is an increasing trend that employs Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems in industrial sectors to improve the maintenance of various systems. The transferability of such developments in civil infrastructure could enhance substantially their management and long-term structural resilience. This study aims to introduce this upcoming trend that is entitled Civil Infrastructure 4.0 (CI4. 0) and primarily focuses on the Intelligent Asset Management. CI4. 0 aims to enlarge the focus from the single structure to the infrastructure system perspective. The principles of CI4. 0 are presented for smart infrastructure systems that enable to obtain real-time and forecasted insights by taking into account different key parameters (eg combination of climate risks. engineering and socio-economic parameters).

Methodology: We developed a dynamic water input-output model extension to analyze the drought vulnerability and resilience of economic sectors in an urban region. The model utilizes the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). which encompasses 65 economic sectors in our regional analysis. The model is applied to a case study of the United States (US) National Capital Region. a predominantly urban region that is considered one of the major economic drivers of the US. Results: Simulation results identify the critical economic sectors that experience the highest inoperability and economic losses as a result of water reduction schemes implemented during drought events. In the two scenarios studied (drought warning and drought emergency). sectors exhibit disproportionate levels of resilience and sensitivity to the magnitude and duration of water reduction. In each case. the economic loss and inoperability rankings of critical sectors differ due to differences in the quantity and value of the sectors' production outputs.

1094434,Analysis of coastal damage of a beach profile under the protection of emergent vegetation,2006,U Türker and Oral Yagci and MS Kabdaşlı,33,Ocean Engineering,5-6,810-828,Pergamon,The primary objective of the study was to experimentally explore the protection performance of the emergent vegetation on the morphological changes of a coastal zone. The experiments were conducted under both regular and irregular waves in two different wave flumes. A dimensionless number was derived to characterize the beach profile response under the protection of emergent vegetation. Accordingly. empirical relations were derived that explained the pattern exhibited by the experimental data. The list of wave parameters and beach erosion related functions were incorporated in relation to vegetation intensity in order to define coastal zone response.

Two acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADV) were used to measure vertical profiles of the streamwise and vertical velocity components in the centreline of the wake of the plant. A cypress plant (cupressus macrocarpa) was used in the experiments of which the topmost 30 cm of the crown were installed in the flume. This species has finestructured branches and needles and makes an ideal model plant with a high geometric similarity to real-sized bushy floodplain vegetation. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the permeability of the plant canopy on the flow. Hereby. the plant was wrapped in cling-film and made hydraulically impermeable. Results are compared with the fully permeable plant and show significantly different velocity and turbulence distributions. The recirculation zone in the near wake is much more pronounced for the impermeable plant causing a single large vortex street. In case of the permeable plant. the turbulence characteristics in the near wake are more isotropic due to the occurrence of multiple vortex streets on much smaller scales around branches and needles. The findings of this study show that the classical flow theory past immersed impermeable bodies is not directly transferable to vegetation with natural canopies. In the latter case. the permeability has to be taken into account as an additional parameter. This implies limitations to the approach of modelling natural vegetation as rigid cylinders which is common practice in numerical and physical models.,True,LUxOEQsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,11,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=602632707731702960&hl=en&oi=scholarr,602632707731702960,/scholar?cites=602632707731702960,,,0,0,0

Especially. when the topography and geomorphology of study area are considered. GIS can ease the work load. Detailed data should be used in this kind of studies. Because of. either the complication of the models or the requirement of highly detailed data. model outputs can be obtained fast only with a good optimization. The aim in this study. firstly. is to determine flood-prone areas in a watershed by using a hydrological model considering two wetness indexes; the topographical wetness index. and the SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) wetness index. The wetness indexes were obtained in the Quantum GIS (QGIS) software by using the Digital Elevation Model of the study area. Flood-prone areas are determined by considering the wetness index maps of the watershed. As the second stage of this study. a hydraulic model. HEC-RAS. was executed to determine flood inundation areas under different return period-flood events. River network cross-sections required for this study were derived from highly detailed digital elevation models by QGIS. Also river hydraulic parameters were used in the hydraulic model.

Firstly. measurements were taken downstream of a rigid cylinder. a widely studied and well-known problem. which serves as benchmark for the subsequent experiments and provides a basis from which the additional relevant mechanisms can be inferred.

The aim of the present study is twofold:(1) to derive the force-balance equation for soils with a sloping surface exposed to a steady hydraulic gradient (relevant to hydraulic structures) and to seek a criterion for piping. including the friction terms;(2) to study the case of unsteady hydraulic gradient forcing (relevant to coastal structures) by means of a series of experiments. The derived force-balance equation is compared with the available experimental and numerical model data from the literature and extended to soils protected by a filter/armour layer or rip rap. The experiments conducted to study the mechanism of piping under unsteady hydraulic gradients involved two types of loadings; sudden and oscillatory. The results show that although the mechanism of steady and unsteady piping has some similar aspects. the soil is generally more prone to piping in the unsteady hydraulic loading compared to the steady case. attributed to the inertia terms. The hydraulic conductivity of the soil becomes more distinctive for the unsteady piping case. Finally. remarks are made about practical applications.

Using an AlN buffer layer can significantly improve the structural and electrical properties of InN.

The surface morphology of the film also improves. A Hall mobility of more than 800 cm2/V s with a carrier concentration of 2–3×1018 cm−3 at room temperature can be routinely obtained on ∼0.1 μm InN film.

Simultaneous measurements of drain current and surface potential indicate that large change in surface potential after stress is responsible for the reduction in drain current in these devices. Measurements of surface potential profile from the gate edge toward the drain as a function of time indicate that surface potential changes occur mostly near the gate. It is proposed that the surface potential changes are caused by electrons which tunnel from the gate under high bias stress and get trapped at the surface states near the gate. Passivation of the surface with SiN/sub x/ reduces the transient magnitudes to a large extent. This correlates with a large improvement in microwave power performance in these devices after passivation.

1094653,A review on the human health impact of airborne particulate matter,2015,Ki-Hyun Kim and Ehsanul Kabir and Shamin Kabir,74,,,136-143,Pergamon,Particulate matter (PM) is a key indicator of air pollution brought into the air by a variety of natural and human activities. As it can be suspended over long time and travel over long distances in the atmosphere. it can cause a wide range of diseases that lead to a significant reduction of human life. The size of particles has been directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Small particles of concern include “inhalable coarse particles” with a diameter of 2.5 to 10 μm and “fine particles” smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter. As the source–effect relationship of PM remains unclear. it is not easy to define such effects from individual sources such as long-range transport of pollution. Because of the potent role of PM and its associated pollutants. detailed knowledge of their human health impacts is of primary importance.

Korea during spring 2001. The results of our measurements were analyzed to explain the behavior of metallic components by comparing their compositions mainly in terms of between Asian Dust (AD) and non-AD (NAD) period and between fine and coarse particle fraction. The computation of enrichment factor (EF) indicated that the magnitude of EF values for most hazardous metals during the AD period were even smaller than the NAD counterpart. The existence of low EF values during the AD period may be ascribable to the excessive input of crustal components like Al accompanied by the AD event. In accordance with this finding. the effects of the AD events were also reflected in diverse manners. when assessed by the concentration ratios of a given element for both AD/NAD period and fine-to …,True,RpkzepcAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC,221,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231002009548,13737185671507059815,/scholar?cites=13737185671507059815,,http://www.kenrahn.com/DustClub/Articles/Kim%202003%20Composition%20of%20FC%20particles.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,We review the performance of various nanoscaled structures needed to support the propagation of the surface plasmons responsible for surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). and assess the potential for the optimisation of the compromise between enhancement and reproducibility that they provide. and hence their utility for relevant applications. We divide these nanostructures into those comprising structured arrays of discrete nanoparticles in two or three dimensions. and those comprising structured or regularly patterned surfaces in two or three dimensions. The most promising in terms of this compromise are those that involve the tethering of functionalised metal nanoparticles to surfaces. They are not only reproducible. but the functionalisation provides a measure of selectivity to relevant target analytes that the majority of SERS applications require.

The system uses a microfluidic reactor to carry out the synthesis and an in-line spectrometer to monitor the emission spectra of the emergent particles. The acquired data is fed into a control algorithm which reduces each spectrum to a scalar ‘dissatisfaction coefficient’ and then intelligently updates the reaction conditions in an effort to minimise this coefficient and so drive the system towards a desired goal. In the tests reported here. CdSe nanoparticles were prepared by separately injecting solutions of CdO and Se into the two inlets of a heated y-shaped microfluidic reactor.

1094692,Strategy to improve the reproducibility of colloidal SERS,2007,Ratna Tantra and Richard JC Brown and Martin JT Milton,38,"Journal of Raman Spectroscopy: An International Journal for Original Work in all Aspects of Raman Spectroscopy, Including Higher Order Processes, and also Brillouin and Rayleigh Scattering",11,1469-1479,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,There is a pressing need to improve the reproducibility of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements. if the technique is to be used routinely for trace analysis. This is particularly true for colloidal SERS. in which data reproducibility is dominated by the final shape and size of metal clusters produced during colloid aggregation. This study presents general guidelines for designing appropriate measurement strategies that can be used to identify and optimise crucial steps in a protocol that leads to better reproducibility of the results. We show that the data reproducibility can be improved by optimising vortexing time during colloid aggregation. which we attribute to the formation of more reproducible metal clusters under conditions of ‘forced convection’. The study also investigated the effects of different storage conditions on the data reproducibility of SERS during a 6‐month study period.

The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The signal is defined as the production of a tt-bar pair in association with a photon having a transverse energy larger than 25 GeV and an absolute pseudorapidity smaller than 1.44. The measurement is performed in the fiducial phase space corresponding to the semileptonic decay chain of the tt-bar pair. and the cross section is measured relative to the inclusive tt-bar pair production cross section. The fiducial cross section for associated tt-bar pair and photon production is found to be 127+/-27 (stat+ syst) fb per semileptonic final state.

The spectra are characterized by massive transient amplifications which we assign to a charge-transfer mechanism during the opening of the heme-pockets in the release of oxygen. This transient lifts the selection rule specificity of normal Raman active modes and allows for the full density of states of the hemes to be observed. The amplification of specific forbidden modes is controlled by the orientation alignment of individual molecules in proximity with the colloid surface.

The case of LED lamps considering product development and energy contexts,2019,Jessika Luth Richter and Leena Tähkämö and Carl Dalhammar,226,Journal of Cleaner Production,,195-209,Elsevier,Longer product lifetimes are promoted by the EU's Circular Economy Action Plan. but incentivising longer lifetimes could also result in trade-offs between different environmental impacts for some product categories. LED lamps are still experiencing improvements in efficacy and material design. which raises questions about whether longer lifetimes are desirable from an overall environmental perspective. Applying a comprehensive life cycle assessment using actual product cases from 2012 to 2017. the research builds on previous product lifetime studies and lighting product research to determine the scenarios in which longer lifetimes are desirable from an overall environmental perspective. The factors explored in the scenarios included improving products in terms of efficiency and dematerialisation as well as decarbonised electricity contexts.

1094716,Governance and risk–value constructions in closing loops of rare earth elements in global value chains,2017,Erika Machacek and Jessika Luth Richter and Ruth Lane,6,,4,59,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This article addresses a research gap on the challenges—specifically risk and value—connected to realizing the potential for closing loops for rare earth elements (REE). We develop an analytical framework from conceptual elements of the global value chain (GVC) framework and the relational theory of risk to examine several empirical REE industry cases for loop closure. The aim of the paper is to identify how risk–value relationships are constructed by different actors as governance structures form in transactions prior to price setting and how these have impacts on the closure of REE loops. Often. REE loops are not closed. and we find that constructions of the risk–value relationship by industrial actors and by government agencies are unstable as they pursue different motivations. consequently hindering REE loop closure in GVCs. In light of this. we propose that governments mediate against the construction of risk–value relationships by facilitating information on the characteristics of end-of-life materials that qualify these for re-entry into loops.

Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) are a widely applied policy instrument to improve the energy efficiency of appliances and reduce CO2 emissions. but they are criticized as redundant if an overarching carbon pricing scheme is in place. In order to better understand how MEPS could play a more effective role in reaching the 1.5 °C target. life cycle costs (LCC) for four home appliances were modelled considering a cost for emitting CO2. First. a significant social cost of carbon was introduced in a LCC optimisation model and it was found that a modest tightening of MEPS is sufficient to account for the climate externality.

In 2012. an updated book called “A New Blueprint for a Green Economy” was published. There are many initiatives that have been launched around the world to green economies. This compendium explores greening the economy on four levels–individual. business. city. and nation. We will look at the relationships between these levels and give many practical examples of the complexities and solutions across the levels. Scandinavia. a pioneering place advancing sustainability and combating climate change. is a unique starting point for learning about greening economies.

1094721,Energy efficiency regulations. market and behavioural failures and standardization,2018,Carl Dalhammar and Jessika Luth Richter and Erika Machacek,,,,176-228,Cambridge University Press,Introduction: A large number of policy instruments have been developed to induce energy efficiency and mitigate climate change. Traditional policy evaluations have assessed the performance of individual policy instruments. applying criteria such as target effectiveness. cost-effectiveness. legitimacy and distributional effects. More recently there has been a shift of interest in how policy instruments interact and the role of the policy mix. There is growing recognition that it is difficult to design ‘optimal’ policy solutions. and that the existence of multiple market failures implies that a wider mix of policy approaches are required in order to overcome them. Therefore. more effort is devoted to finding suitable ‘policy packages’. where the instruments work in synergy and inconsistencies are minimized. While carbon pricing policies have often been considered the best option for cutting carbon emissions in the most cost-effective way. this is increasingly questioned. For instance. mandatory regulations offer certain benefits relative to pricing. which could include: (1) they send a clear signal to industries. and provide more information than price signals which are often too diffused. resulting in decisions constrained by bounded rationality; (2) they may have lower transaction costs. as transaction costs are quite high. especially in emission trading schemes; and (3) they may overcome market and behavioural failures such as information asymmetries and computational constraints affecting the transmission and analysis of information. leading to sub-optimal decisions among societal actors. As experience with carbon pricing has also demonstrated. there are political …,True,YVTr0zoAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,3,https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/1dd0f4b9-fb00-4863-82a6-fc9b2acb786e,4813818018503762375,/scholar?cites=4813818018503762375,,,0,0,0

This exploratory study analyses whether and when long lifetimes are preferable when considering the trade-offs between durability and other important parameters such as costs and environmental impacts. examining the case of LED lamps. This is an interesting product group to examine because of the improving lumen efficiency of the technology as well as the increasing emphasis on lifetimes by both producers and policymakers. This research integrates both economic and environmental approaches to examine optimal lifetimes in the case of LED lamps. The first part of the research utilised an optimised least lifecycle cost (LCC) model of LED household lamps for sale in a Swedish online market. finding that optimal lifetimes were in the range of 25000-30000 hours for these lamps. However. this modelling did not consider dynamic factors such as changing prices and efficiencies. This study took the case of 800 lumen lamps to consider these factors. utilising both LCC scenarios. varying lifetime. purchase prices. energy cost and efficiency as well as LCA scenarios. varying electricity mix and lifetimes.

Product policies. in turn. can support CE objectives by promoting reuse of products. recycling of materials. and providing ecodesign incentives for more durable products. This thesis examined the role of product policies in meeting CE objectives in the EU. with specific focus on lighting products in the context of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Ecodesign Directives. The research findings contributed to current policy questions. including how well WEEE systems have performed in closing material loops; the potential for closing loops for critical materials; and what trade-offs can occur in promoting longer lifetimes for rapidly developing products. A theory-based evaluation was used to assess the performance of extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies for lighting products in the Nordic countries. While the WEEE systems were generally performing well. there were issues identified. including the downcycling and loss of many recycled materials and lack of ecodesign incentives. The research also found that the requirements of the WEEE Directive were a key enabler for closing loops for rare earth elements (REE) from lighting products. but that the recycling efforts in the EU face challenges with economic feasibility and complex transactions in the value chain.

It is driven by increasing competition and the need to identify new profit centres for producers of mature products. This paper identifies a new product group that could be interesting from the product-service system perspective – baby prams. The study presents a new business model based on selling the function that baby prams provide through leasing prams. It discusses potential barriers and necessary changes in product design and the supply chain to make it work. The product-service system in this case could include the organisation of a reverse logistics system with different levels of refurbishment and remanufacturing of prams. partially by retailers.

With the emergence of the circular economy as an important policy objective in the European Union (EU). there is renewed interest in policies to promote durability and address planned obsolescence. Different legislative approaches are currently used to provide incentives for design for durability and reparability at the EU and Member State levels. The EU has started to regulate durability through the Ecodesign Directive. whereas Member States have made use of other legal approaches such as longer consumer warranties. the criminalization of planned obsolescence and measures to incentivize the availability of spare parts.

1094738,Governance of integrated product policy: in search of sustainable production and consumption,2017,Dirk Scheer and Frieder Rubik,,,,,Routledge,European policy patterns are in a state of transformation. New governance models are shifting power away from states and toward the involvement of all stakeholders and the idea of shared responsibility. It's a move from command and control to push and pull. What's in this new approach for the environment? This book provides a detailed analysis of the example of integrated product policy (IPP) which aims to improve the environmental performance of products and services through their life-cycle. All products cause environmental degradation in some way. whether from their manufacturing. use or disposal. The life-cycle of a product is often long and complicated. It covers all the areas from the extraction of natural resources. through their design. manufacture. assembly. marketing. distribution. sale and use to their eventual disposal as waste. At the same time it also involves many different actors such as designers. manufacturers. marketers. retailers and consumers. IPP attempts to systematically stimulate each phase of this complicated chain to improve its environmental performance. With the involvement of so many different products and actors there cannot be one simple policy measure for everything. Instead. IPP employs a whole variety of tools–both voluntary and mandatory–which are used to achieve identified objectives. These include economic instruments. the phase-out of dangerous materials. voluntary agreements. eco-labelling and product design guidelines. IPP is still in relative infancy and can be seen as an ongoing process hugely dependent on effective governance measures to ensure its continued success.

The Ecodesign Directive is one of the policy instruments that could aid the transition towards a more resource efficient economy.

The efforts of environmental policy makers to pay more attention to the consumption side are still rather meagre. and there is little integration of environmental issues into consumer policy. This paper addresses these problems by providing an overview of consumption-related EU policies and by evaluating strategies of consumer and environmental organisations in this field.

1094741,An emerging product approach in environmental law: Incorporating the life cycle perspective,2007,Carl Dalhammar,,,,,,One of the noticeable trends in recent years is that products have received increasing attention in environmental policy. The focus on products and their life cycle impacts is often referred to as? life cycle thinking?. This implies a shift away from the traditional focus on production processes and the environmental impacts of point-source pollution. towards a stronger focus on emissions from the other stages of the life cycle of products. Consumer products have a number of life cycle phases. including: the extraction of raw materials and refinement. production of intermediates and finished goods. sales. transportation. storage. use/consumption and final disposal. The environmental impacts from various life cycle phases can be reduced through improved product design and various measures taken by actors throughout the product chain. Minimising life cycle environmental impacts requires initiative and participation from several key actors throughout the product chain. and this in turn requires clear incentives. A key question concerns how much government intervention is necessary for this purpose. or what type of government policies that are necessary or desirable. The aim of this research has been to explore the potential to use law as a tool to improve the environmental performance of products over the entire life cycle. In doing so. it examines the potential to use mandatory legal standards for life cycle environmental improvements. taking into account the political and economic context where laws are initiated. negotiated and implemented.,True,IDJz2voAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,23,https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/548985,10445127314379445868,/scholar?cites=10445127314379445868,,https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/548985,0,0,0
1094742,Promoting energy and resource efficiency through the Ecodesign Directive,2014,Carl Dalhammar,59,Scandinavian Studies in Law,,147-179,Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law,Looking at the developments in environmental policy and law and during the last decades. one of the noticeable trends is that products–and the environmental impacts throughout products’ life cycles-have received greater attention in environmental policy. 2 In the 1970s and 1980s the main focus of product-related policies was dangerous chemicals in products and the health risks they posed to humans and the environment. Later policies promoted the recycling of products in order to reduce the increasing amounts of waste in society and reduce the extraction of natural resources. The introduction of laws that mandated the recycling of products and promoted “extended producer responsibility”(EPR) 3–where producers are assigned financial responsibility for the take-back and recycling of products–have provided better recycling practices and higher amounts of recycled materials. and in some cases helped to reduce the amount of waste being generated. 4 But more holistic approaches to deal with products were considered necessary. As a reaction to the rising quantities. varieties and complexities of products. the European Commission introduced the concept of Integrated Product Policy (IPP) in a Green Paper in 2001. 5 With IPP the focus of the policies was placed on the products and how the entire life cycle of the products could be considered when regulating their environmental impact. By considering the entire life cycle. cumulative environmental impacts can be assessed and addressed. A specific aim is to avoid burden shifting. where an environmental improvement in one life cycle phase may lead to increasing environmental impacts in …,True,IDJz2voAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,21,https://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/59-4.pdf,2745275552252598192,/scholar?cites=2745275552252598192,,https://www.scandinavianlaw.se/pdf/59-4.pdf,0,0,0

Among the priorities are avoiding the purchase of single-use and unnecessary products. prolonging the lifetime of products through maintenance and engaging in repair activities. Moreover. the hierarchy intends to privilege sharing and leasing to buying and second-hand products to new ones. Finally. consumption in the circular economy also requires allowing products to re-circulate.

1094751,Public policy issues research trends,2008,Sophie J Evans,,,,,Nova Publishers,In any society. governmental entities enact laws. make policies. and allocate resources. This is true at all levels. Public policy can be generally defined as a system of laws. regulatory measures. courses of action. and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives. Individuals and groups often attempt to shape public policy through education. advocacy. or mobilisation of interest groups. Shaping public policy is obviously different in Western-style democracies than in other forms of government. But it is reasonable to assume that the process always involves efforts by competing interest groups to influence policy makers in their favour. A major aspect of public policy is law. In a general sense. the law includes specific legislation and more broadly defined provisions of constitutional or international law. There are many ways that the law can influence how survivors of violence against women are treated and the types of services they receive.,True,IDJz2voAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,12,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8FimyKiZOXUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:Mq8OhQhF-N4J:scholar.google.com&ots=ATkafrzI29&sig=Gz8jIxpU21Z3g8esVB33tymseyA,16066667573538631474,/scholar?cites=16066667573538631474,,,0,0,0
1094752,An emerging product approach in environmental law,2007,Carl Dalhammar,3,Incorporating the life cycle perspective. IIIEE Dissertations,,,,Background and purposeThere is a growing understanding that traditionally. environmental policy has been too focused on point-source emissions. There is an evident need to better address diffuse emissions connected to waste. transport. chemicals and energy use. and tackle the problems associated with ever-higher consumption levels. One of the noticeable trends in later years is that products have received more attention in environmental policy. All products cause environmental impacts during different phases in the life cycle. from cradle to grave. The design stage is crucial. as much of the environmental impacts in the different life cycle stages are determined by the product design.Targeting the product and its life cycle provides an integrated approach to deal with diffuse emissions. as it improves our understanding of how different phases in the product life cycle are connected. and helps to identify where the main environmental problems occur. The increasing focus on products and their life cycle impacts is often referred to as ‘life cycle thinking’. A core building block of life cycle thinking is that relevant actors. most notably producers and consumers. should be aware of environmental (and social) problems throughout the product life cycle. and take measures to address these problems. However. the exact meaning and content of the life cycle thinking is in no way established or unchallenged.,True,IDJz2voAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carl_Dalhammar/publication/258260564_An_emerging_product_approach_in_environmental_law_-_Incorporating_the_lifecycle_perspective/links/57469e1a08ae9f741b431ba4.pdf,12552302830054247491,/scholar?cites=12552302830054247491,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carl_Dalhammar/publication/258260564_An_emerging_product_approach_in_environmental_law_-_Incorporating_the_lifecycle_perspective/links/57469e1a08ae9f741b431ba4.pdf,0,0,0

In other words. there is a transformation of European governance. shifting power relations within state and society. Generally speaking. the transformation process towards new models of governance aims at stronger involvement by stakeholders in decision-making processes and the promotion of so-called new policy instruments based on co-operation and self-regulation patterns. New governance patterns have been identified in several policy fields such as social. economic and environmental policy regulation. What’s in it for the environment? Taking environmental policy as an example. there has been a fundamental change over time. Early environmental policy focused on different environmental media. ie air. water. soil. noise and waste removal. based on punctual state …,True,IDJz2voAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,11,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9751380397802906541&hl=en&oi=scholarr,9751380397802906541,/scholar?cites=9751380397802906541,,,0,0,0

Durability standards can bring environmental and consumer benefits. but the question remains about what optimal durability is. In this paper. the product lifetime aspect of durability is considered. and optimal lifetimes in relation to least life cycle cost (LCC) for the consumer are analysed. The paper focusses the analysis on a case of LED lamps available in an online market in December 2016 and models optimal lifetimes from an LCC perspective. The statistical error of the regression does not allow for calculation of the optima with precision. but the calculation indicates optimal lifetime is close to 25.000 hours.
