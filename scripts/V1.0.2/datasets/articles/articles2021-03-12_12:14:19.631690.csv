Normally the chirality in semiconductor nanocrystals is induced by the initial presence of chiral ligands/stabilizer molecules. Here we report intrinsic chirality of ZnS coated CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and quantum rods (QRs) stabilized by achiral ligands.

Although most research has focused on graphene. atomic layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and particularly MoS2 have gathered much deserved attention recently. Here. we report the induction of chirality into 2D chiral nanomaterials by carrying out liquid exfoliation of MoS2 in the presence of chiral ligands (cysteine and penicillamine) in water. This processing resulted in exfoliated chiral 2D MoS2 nanosheets showing strong circular dichroism signals. which were far past the onset of the original chiral ligand signals.

The Au-TiO2 nanocomposite material was prepared by the electrophoretic deposition of gold nanoparticles into a porous nanoparticulate titanium dioxide film. creating a photoactive electrode. The composite film demonstrates a significant increase in the short circuit current (I                 sc) compared to unmodified TiO2 when excited at or close to the plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticles. Then. we employed a thermal ripening process as a method of increasing the I                 sc of these electrodes and also as a method of tuning the plasmon peak position. with a high degree of selectivity. Photo-electrochemical investigations revealed that the increase in photocurrent is attributed to the generation and separation of plasmonically generated hot electrons at the gold/TiO2 interface and also the inter-band generation of holes in gold nanoparticles by photons with λ < 520 nm.

However. InP QDs generally suffer from lower size tunability and broader ensemble emission linewidths because of imperfect synthetic control of nucleation and growth. Despite evidence that InP QDs do not follow the mechanisms that hot-injection and heat-up syntheses were designed to facilitate. these methods are still used. at least as the first step. in most syntheses of InP QDs. In this article. we describe a new method to synthesize large InP QDs with low size dispersity that does not require a hot-injection or heat-up step. Instead. nucleation. growth. and size focusing all take place continuously during a slow syringe-pump-mediated continuous injection of precursors into the reaction mixture.

Instead. there are a number of linewidth broadening mechanisms which are relevant under various conditions. such as spectral diffusion. charging. and excitonic fine structure. While spectral diffusion and charging are most likely photoinduced effects and thus can be modulated by the excitation rate of the nanocrystals. fine-structure broadening is fundamental to the photophysics of nanocrystals and most likely unavoidable. A complete understanding of the excitonic energy landscape enables us to determine dephasing rates. linewidths. lifetimes. and other parameters essential to optical applications.

Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (""margination""). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils. and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically. nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils. while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally. we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs. illustrating translational potential.

TDA Research. Inc. has been developing solvent processable forms of poly (3. 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) commonly known as"" PEDOT"". Our approach is to make block copolymers with alternating conducting and non-conducting blocks. The conducting segments provide the electronic properties. while the non-conducting segments are designed to promote dispersion. TDA has two lines of conducting polymer products named AedotronTM and OligotronTM. and this paper focuses on our family of ABA end-capped oligomers (trade named OligotronTM). These capped oligomers have a center block consisting of PEDOT and two non-conducting end-capping blocks. which can contain polymerizable methacrylate groups (see Figure 1). OligotronTM oligomers are dispersible in non-corrosive organic solvents and can be used to dip coat. spin coat or print thin films for electronic devices. The oligomers that have polymerizable methacrylate groups in the endcaps. can theoretically be printed using a lithographic technique by crosslinking the oligomers at the methacrylate groups to render them fixed in place. Alternatively. the organic dispersion containing the conducting oligomers can be formulated into inks for inkjet printing with a post photo-initiated or thermal-initiated curing step.

In agreement with experimental evidence. Lewis acid coordination to the nitrile strongly promotes reaction at the CN bond over reaction at the alkene moiety. The main factors responsible for this inversion of the chemoselectivity were identified as the following: (i) the Lewis acid strongly stabilises the product of CN addition and the transition state leading to it. thus favouring this reaction both kinetically and thermodynamically. Addition across the CC bond. in contrast. only receives weak kinetic activation; (ii) the cycloaddition to the CC or CN bonds involves different molecular orbitals at the cinnamonitrile. and the Lewis acid influences the orbital involved in CN …,True,p5pdcYkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,17,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040402007019370,895469333403202852,/scholar?cites=895469333403202852,,,0,0,0

So far synthetic organic chemistry had focussed on methodology development which mainly deals with the develop ment of new reactions as well as new reagents and catalysts. These ought to be able to perform preferentially highly selective (chemo-. regio-and stereose lective) synthetic transformations. often applied in the context of complex and highly functionalized molecules. Except for the synthesis of peptides and oligonucleic acids. little attention has been spent on the question of how synthesis can be carried out in an envi ronment of sophisticated technologies which includes improved hardware. While peptides and oligonucleotides are conveniently prepared by Merrifield's solid phase technique. solution phase synthesis of most other synthetic targets have not been substantially replaced by this solid phase approach.

For example. the C13 side chain of drugs such as Taxol [1. 2] can be prepared from the valuable (2R. 3S)-phenylglycidate intermediate. At the industrial level. its production consists of the enzymatic kinetic resolution of (+)-phenylglycidate racemates.[3] Unfortunately. this method suffers from several drawbacks. The most important of which is the poor yield (42%) of (2R. 3S)-phenylglycidate that arises from the unwanted enantiomer.(2S. 3R)-phenylglycidate; this generates large amounts of waste (ca. 200 tons per year). Catalytic asymmetric synthesis of (2R. 3S)-phenylglycidate is therefore highly desirable. For such a purpose. the asymmetric epoxidation (AE) and asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) of cis-methyl cinnamates are among the most important methodologies developed.[4–8] AE provides chiral glycidates in a single step. and therefore. is considered to be a more efficient route than that of AD.Studies in this area have shown that manganese–salen complexes display high enantioselectivities in the epoxidation of Z (cis) alkenes.[9] but do not eliminate difficulties in the synthesis of cis-cinnamic esters.[8] On the other hand. homogeneous chiral organometallic complexes. often prepared from challenging and expensive ligands. are mainly undesired at the end of the synthesis. and therefore. are considered to be pollutants that must be separated from the desired product.

For the first time. it is shown that a donor ligand (e.g.. Et3N) can be involved into the enantioselective mechanism of the product configuration.

In the presence of water. this epoxide led to methyl (2S.3R)-2.3-dihydroxy-3-phenylpropionate.

Comparison of the bimolecular reduction of [1]BF4 and 2 by triarylphosphines reveals a pronounced charge effect. with the cationic species being reduced by PPh3 about 1000 times faster than its neutral analogue in CH2Cl2 at room temperature. Ligand substitution of the adducts [3]+ and 4 is dissociative. with the cationic complex dissociating phosphine oxide about 56 times more slowly than the neutral compound.

Although gauging possession is usually straightforward for simple inventions. it can be difficult for those in complex fields like biotechnology. chemistry. and pharmaceuticals. For example. if a drug company seeks to patent a promising molecule that was disclosed but never physically made in the prior art. the key possession question is whether a person having ordinary skill in the art (PHOSITA) could have made it at the time of the prior disclosure. Put differently. could the PHOSITA rely on then-existing knowledge in the field to fill in any missing technical details from the prior disclosure?

The activated carbon produced from the precursors were investigated using BET and DSC. On TGA Profile. Balanite aegyptiaca shell decomposed initially with a weight loss of 12.84% at temperature range within 27.4oC to 245.9oC. The decomposition profile shows weight losses of 41.6% for hemicellulose. 43.2% for both cellulose and lignin. which occur at temperature range of 2500C to 3500C. slightly> 3500C and up to 8900C respectively. Detarium microcarpum decomposed initially with weight loss of 15.9% at temperature range of 42.40C to 386.70C due to moisture and volatile matter. The volatilization associated with weight loss of 75.5% within temperature range of 3970C to 5360C is due to the release of hemicellulose and cellulose. Finally. a weight loss of 2.58% occurred within a temperature range of 5400C to 8900C. due to the released of lignin.

Concentrations of Cu and Zn are within the standard limits of EPA and WHO for these metals in drinking water while Pb. Cr. and Cd have their concentrations higher than EPA and WHO standard limits. Analysis of relationship between metals indicated significant positive correlation () between Cr and Zn. in all seasons with exception of warm and dry season. This might explain the consistent variation of these metals in the sites in a particular season. Also. significant negative correlation was observed between Cd and Cu (hot and dry season). The chemical fractionation trends were found to be dominated by particulate fractions of metals studied except Zn (cool and dry season) and Cd. The highest percentages of all metals analysed were found in the particulate fraction with exception of Cd. This could reflect less availability of this metal to the immediate environment.

A field study was conducted to determine the physico-chemical parameters and level of Cd and Cr bioavailability of the river sediment of Challawa. The study revealed that the physiochemical parameters of river Challawa such as pH and organic matter favours bioavailability of Cd and Cr. The distribution pattern of Cr chromium in different fractions was in the order; Residual> Carbonate bound> Fe-Mn oxide bound> Organic bound> Exchangeable in the study and control areas. Chromium was associated mainly (65–93.3%) with the residual fraction in all the samples and relatively small amount of chromium occur in the non-residual fractions. The Cd association with different sediment fraction followed the order: Residual bound> Exchangeable> Carbonate bound> Fe-Mn oxide bound> Organic bound. In the residual fractions. 26.68% was associated with exchangeable. Also. despite the high levels of Cr. the very low percentages of the metal in the non-residual fraction indicate their limited environmental mobility. Cd is associated more with exchangeable and carbonate fractions. an indication of potential bioavailability of the metals.

This short-lived highly reactive molecule plays an important role in the degradation of volatile organic compounds. leading to the production of ozone and the formation and growth of aerosol particles 1. 2. 3. In this way. hydroxyl radicals influence air quality and regional climate. Measurements over tropical forests suggest that hydroxyl radicals are recycled following reaction with the volatile organic compound isoprene 4. 5. but the chemistry underpinning this observation is uncertain. Here. we propose a detailed chemical mechanism for the oxidation of isoprene by hydroxyl radicals. The photo-oxidation of unsaturated hydroperoxy-aldehydes—a product of isoprene oxidation—is a central part of the mechanism; their photolysis initiates a hydroxyl radical production cascade that is limited by the reaction of hydroperoxy-aldehydes with the hydroxyl radical …,True,iiEXdtgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,170,https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1405,7748678059972053569,/scholar?cites=7748678059972053569,,,0,0,0

Hydroxyl has primary (P) and secondary (S) sources. the former mainly through the photodissociation of ozone. the latter through OH recycling in radical reaction chains. We used the recent Mainz Organics Mechanism (MOM) to advance volatile organic carbon (VOC) chemistry in the general circulation model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) and show that S is larger than previously assumed. By including emissions of a large number of primary VOC. and accounting for their complete breakdown and intermediate products. MOM is mass-conserving and calculates substantially higher OH reactivity from VOC oxidation compared to predecessor models. Whereas previously P and S were found to be of similar magnitude. the present work indicates that S may be twice as large. mostly due to OH recycling in the free troposphere. Further. we find that nighttime OH formation may be significant in the polluted subtropical boundary layer in summer. With a mean OH recycling probability of about 67 %. global OH is buffered and not sensitive to perturbations by natural or anthropogenic emission changes.

Vital to the interpretation and use of an increasing number of isotope analyses is appropriate modelling. However. the exact implementation of isotopic information in chemistry-climate models is a challenge. and often studies use simplifications which limit their applicability. Here we implement a thorough isotopic extension in MECCA. a comprehensive kinetic chemistry sub-model. To this end. we devise a generic tagging technique for the kinetic chemistry mechanisms implemented as the sub-submodel MECCA-TAG. The technique is diagnostic and numerically efficient and supports the investigation of various aspects of kinetic chemistry schemes. We focus specifically on the application to the modelling of stable isotopic composition. The results of MECCA-TAG are evaluated against the reference sub-submodel MECCA-DBL. which is implicitly full-detailed. but computationally expensive and thus sub-optimal in practical applications. Furthermore. we evaluate the elaborate carbon and oxygen isotopic mechanism by simulating the multi-isotope composition of CO and other trace gases in the CAABA/MECCA box-model. The mechanism realistically simulates the oxygen isotope composition of key species. as well as the carbon isotope signature transfer.

In order to parameterize the production of water vapor (H2O) from CH4 oxidation. it is often assumed that the oxidation of one CH4 molecule yields exactly two molecules of H2O. However. this assumption is based on an early study. which also gives evidence that this is not true at all altitudes.  In the current study. we re-evaluate this assumption with a comprehensive systematic analysis using a state-of-the-art chemistry–climate model (CCM). namely the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model. and present three approaches to investigate the yield of H2O and hydrogen gas (H2) from CH4 oxidation. We thereby make use of the Module Efficiently Calculating the Chemistry of the Atmosphere (MECCA) in a box model and global model configuration. Furthermore. we use the kinetic chemistry tagging technique (MECCA-TAG) to investigate the chemical pathways between CH4. H2O and H2. by being able to distinguish hydrogen atoms produced by CH4 from H2 from other sources.We apply three approaches. which all agree that assuming a yield of 2 overestimates the production of H2O in the lower stratosphere (calculated as 1.5–1.7). Additionally. transport and subsequent photochemical processing of longer-lived intermediates (mostly H2) raise the local yield values in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere above 2 (maximum  >  2.2).

Our analysis of concurrent New Zealand and Antarctic time series of CH4 and CO mixing and isotope ratios shows that a corresponding 13C ∕ 12C variability is absent in CO. Using the AC-GCM EMAC model and isotopic mass balancing for comparing the periods of presumably high and low Cl. it is shown that variations in extra-tropical Southern Hemisphere Cl cannot have exceeded 0.9 × 103 atoms cm−3. It is demonstrated that the 13C ∕ 12C ratio of CO is a sensitive indicator for the isotopic composition of reacted CH4 and therefore for its sources. Despite ambiguities about the yield of CO from CH4 oxidation (with this yield being an important factor in the budget of CO) and uncertainties about the isotopic composition of sources of CO (in particular biomass burning). the contribution of Cl to the removal of CH4 in the troposphere is probably much lower than currently assumed.,True,iiEXdtgAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,14,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/9831/2018/,3705747823053497775,/scholar?cites=3705747823053497775,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/9831/2018/,0,0,0

By confronting the CO mixing and isotope ratios obtained from different analytical instrumentation. we (i) reject natural/artificial sampling and mixing effects as possible culprits of the problem.

The δ18O values of the latter indicate that the oxygen is very likely being inherited from O3. The δ13C values hint at reactions of trace amounts of organics with stratospheric O3 that could have yielded the artificial CO.

Their oxidation in lab experiments is known to lead to the formation of ozone and aerosol precursors. However. their overall impact on tropospheric composition is uncertain as it depends on transport. multiphase chemistry. and removal processes of the oxidation intermediates. Representation of aromatics in global atmospheric models has been either neglected or highly simplified. Here. we present an assessment of their impact on gas-phase chemistry. using the general circulation model EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). We employ a comprehensive kinetic model to represent the oxidation of the following monocyclic aromatics: benzene. toluene. xylenes. phenol. styrene. ethylbenzene. trimethylbenzenes. benzaldehyde. and lumped higher aromatics that contain more than nine C atoms.Significant regional changes are identified for several species. For instance. glyoxal increases by 130 % in Europe and 260 % in East Asia. respectively. Large increases in HCHO are also predicted in these regions. In general. the influence of aromatics is particularly evident in areas with high concentrations of NOx. with increases up to 12 % in O3 and 17 % in OH.On a global scale. the estimated net changes of trace gas levels are minor when aromatic compounds are included in our model. For instance. the tropospheric burden of CO increases by about 6 %. while the burdens of OH. O3. and NOx (NO+NO2) decrease between 3 % and 9 %.

Although the emissions from individual vehicles are regulated by the European emission standards. real driving emissions often exceed these limits. In this study. two multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments on opposite sides of the motorway were used to measure the NO2 absorption caused by road traffic at the A60 motorway close to Mainz.

Hereto. the ozone-dependent photochemical equilibrium between NO and NO2 is considered. We show that for 10 May 2019 the measured emissions exceed the maximum expected emissions calculated from the European emission standards for standardised test cycles by a factor of 11±7. One major advantage of the method used here is that MAX-DOAS measurements are very sensitive to the integrated NO2 concentration close to the surface. Thus. all emitted NO2 molecules are detected independently from their altitude. and therefore the whole emission plume originating from the nearby motorway is captured. which is a key advantage compared to other approaches such as in situ measurements.,True,iiEXdtgAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,0,https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/769/2021/amt-14-769-2021.html,,,,https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/769/2021/amt-14-769-2021.html,0,0,0

While most TiO2 with facets reported in the past was in a particle form. herein we directly grow TiO2 with arbitrarily tunable facets onto a transparent conductive substrate. This could reduce interparticle boundaries. and thus suppress charge recombination and facilitate more efficient charge transport compared to particle-assembled films. Combined systematic experimental and theoretical (density functional theory. DFT) studies reveal that fluoride ions (F−) and protons (H+) could play a synergistic role in controlling TiO2 crystals in the way that F− ions change the crystal phase of TiO2 to anatase with low-index facets. while H+ ions increase the {001}/{101} ratio.

On the contrary. the metallic Cu phase was stabilized on γ-Al 2 O 3 support. Metal phosphide particles were highly dispersed on the USY support. Cu 3 P/USY exhibited much larger surface area and higher acidity compared to Cu 3 P/SiO 2. owing to the textural and acidic properties of the USY zeolite support.

To date. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most promising energy-dense commercialized systems. Recent decades have witnessed the increasingly widespread usage of LIBs in a broad range of applications. from consumer electronics to electric vehicles (EVs). LIB technology has been advanced considerably; for example. the energy density of commercial LIBs has increased from around 90 WhkgÀ1 for the first LIB in 1991 to around 250 WhkgÀ1 for modern state-ofthe-art LIBs.[1] However. there are still some critical challenges that need to be addressed for the growing markets. A representative example is the ever-increasing popularity of EVs. which require batteries with not only high energy and power densities but also outstanding cost-efficiency. safety. and lifetime.[1b. 2] To meet these requirements. all the essential components of LIBs. including the anode. cathode. separator. and electrolyte. should be upgraded. As energy density depends on the anode and cathode materials. most research efforts have been focused on developing high-capacity anodes and cathodes. including near-term silicon anodes. layered Ni-rich and Li-and Mn-rich cathode materials. and long-term sulfurbased cathodes and metal anodes (MAs; eg.

1173767,NANOPOROUS PMMA-QD COMPOSITE FIBERS TOWARDS BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS,,N Anumandla and J Sampathi and D Rutman and A Kucknoor and Y Li and S Wei,,,,,,Objective: In tissue engineering. a 3-D polymer scaffold creates an environment for cells to produce new tissue in a desired geometry. In healthy tissues. the native extracellular matrix (ECM) controls cell behavior. including regeneration. via signaling cascades involving not only specific binding events but also non-specific chemical and physical properties. 2 Limited knowledge exists regarding what precise scaffold chemical and physical properties produce cell behavior leading to the regeneration of tissues whose properties parallel that of native tissues (eg strength). Photopolymerized poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) based hydrogels have been widely used as scaffolds for tissue engineering. They are particularly useful for controlled studies of cell-material interactions because they are “biological blank slates”–proteins and cells cannot adhere without the controlled introduction of adhesive ligands. 3 Scaffold chemical properties as well as physical properties such as porosity. hydration and modulus impact cell behavior. 4 Thus. hydrogel scaffolds which maintain the benefits of PEG-DA while tuning their properties over a broader range would allow us to establish predictive relationships between scaffold properties. cell regeneration and regenerated tissue properties. In this work. the chemical and physical properties of PEG-DA hydrogels were extended by introduction of inorganic methacrylated star polydimethylsiloxane (PDMSstar-MA) as well as use of dichloromethane (DCM.

1173779,Biomimetic adhesion for transfer printing via microstructured surfaces,2011,Anton Kovalsky,,,,,,Demand for robust engineering techniques on the micro and nano scales has been steadily growing in the age of modern technology. not only because of the driving force to fit electronics into smaller form factors. but also for a variety of other applications. from devices with microfluidic functions to components whose interfacial behaviors are key features. In our research we attempted to develop a tool that facilitates assembly of a wide variety of devices on both conventional and novel surfaces in the hopes of both improving modern capabilities of technological fabrication. as well as opening up possibilities for new classes of devices that can be easily assembled on surfaces and in form factors that were not previously possible. In summary. primary benefit of this technology is the potential ability to fabricate a variety of electronic devices on any surface – thus expanding the versatility and ability to integrate different classes of technology in way that is not possible using modern. competing fabrication methods for micro and nano-scale chemical/electronic/mechanical devices.

A transfer matrix model is used to separate electronic losses from optical losses in the form of parasitic absorption. It is reported that MAPbI3−xClx is the superior absorber due to increased crystallinity. but that the benefit from using the chloride‐assisted formulation is negated when the absorber is deposited on a mesoporous substrate. It is also reported that some beneficial electronic and optical effects are associated with the mesoporous TiO2: decreased parasitic absorption at short wavelengths and possible enhancement of charge transfer; the overall use of the mesoporous scaffold typically …,True,TxOEfzoAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smtd.201700275,16660499159389093211,/scholar?cites=16660499159389093211,,,0,0,0

The introduction of chloride by substituting a fraction of the bromide leads to a decreased lattice constant compared to pure bromide perovskite (x= 0) and a higher concentration of surface defects. The measured kinetics under one-photon excitation (1PE) shows that increasing the chloride addition quenches the photoluminescence (PL) lifetimes. due to substitution-induced surface defects. In stark contrast. upon 2PE. the PL lifetimes measured deeper in the bulk become longer with increasing chloride addition. until the halide substitution reaches the critical concentration of∼ 19%. At x= 19% Cl concentration. a significant reversal of this behavior is observed indicating a change in crystal structure beyond the continuous trends observed at lower percentages of halide substitution (x≤ 11%). The observed opposing trends. based on 1PE versus 2PE. highlight a dichotomy between extrinsic (surface) and intrinsic (bulk) effects of chloride substitution on the carrier dynamics in lead bromide perovskites. We discuss the physical relation between halide exchange and bulk carrier lifetimes in CH₃NH₃PbBr₃ in terms of the Rashba effect. We propose that the latter is suppressed at the surface due to disorder in the alignment of the MA and that it increases in the bulk with Cl concentration because of the reduction in lattice parameters. which compresses the space available for …,True,TxOEfzoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201900192545,,,,,0,0,0

Bor,Many of modern technologies require materials with unusual combinations of properties that cannot be met by the conventional metal alloys. ceramics. and polymeric materials. Material property combinations and ranges have been extended by the development of composite materials. Development of Nd-Fe-B/polymer composite magnetic materials has significantly increased interest in research and development of bonded magnets. since particles of Nd-Fe-B alloys are proved to be very suitable for their production. This study investigates the mechanical and magnetic properties of compression molded Nd-Fe-B magnets with different content of magnetic powder in epoxy matrix. Mechanical properties were investigated at ambient temperature according to ASTM standard D 3039-00. The obtained results show that tensile strength and elongation decrease with an increase of Nd-Fe-B particles content in epoxy matrix. The modulus of elasticity increases. which means that in exploitation material with higher magnetic powder content. subjected to the same level of stress. undergoes 2 to 3.5 times smaller deformation.

In this study. we have explored the use of a 4‐dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO)‐containing chain transfer agent in reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerizations. The controlled radical polymerization resulted in well‐defined DIBO‐terminating polymers that could be modified by 1.3‐dipolar cycloadditions using nitrones. nitrile oxides. and azides having a hydrophilic moiety. The self‐assembly properties of the resulting block copolymers have been examined.

Using real-time surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy. a >18-fold enhancement of surface coverage of CO2 is observed at the interface. The high surface concentration leads CO2 molecules to be in close proximity with the probe molecules on the metal surface (4-methylbenzenethiol). and transforms CO2 molecules into a bent conformation without the formation of chemical bonds.

However. the reason for this success and the intimate mechanism remained basically speculative. Herein. two mechanisms are shown to coexist: the reversible termination of the growing poly(vinyl acetate) chains by the Co(acac)2 complex (acac: acetylacetonato). and a degenerative chain‐transfer process. The importance of one contribution over the other strongly depends on the polymerization conditions. including complexation of cobalt by ligands. such as water and pyridine. This significant progress in the CMRP mechanism relies on the isolation and characterization of the very first cobalt adducts formed in the polymerization medium and their use as CMRP initiators.

Among the species that alter the NCs properties. water molecules are of tremendous importance. We used 17O solid-state NMR spectroscopy to follow this process and the dynamics of O atoms in metal oxide NCs. Using ZnO as reference material. different chemical environments for the O atoms are characterized and a dynamic exchange process between the NCs and the O atoms from water is evidenced. The exchange does not involve only surface atoms but also ones located deeper inside the ZnO core of the NCs.

WS6. and WS7) were synthesized and investigated in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) exploring the effect of conjugated linkers on device performance. The new dyes showed strong light-harvesting ability in the visible region with relatively high molar absorption coefficients (>21 800 M–1 cm–1). This can be attributed to their intrinsic charge transfer (CT) from the arylamine to the acceptor group. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a favorable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level. allowing efficient injection into the semiconductor conduction band after excitation. Upon application in DSSC devices. the WS5 dye containing 4.7-di(furan-2-yl)benzo[c][1.2.5]thiadiazole as conjugated linker mediated the highest device power conversion efficiency (PCE) amounting to 5.5%.

1174033,Ferrocene as a Rapid Charge Regenerator in Grätzel Cells,2015,Ahmed M El-Zohry and Jiayan Cong and Martin Karlsson and Lars Kloo and Burkhard Zietz,,,,,,Grätzel cells or Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are considered one of the most promising methods to convert the sun's energy into electricity due to their low cost and simple technology of production. The Grätzel cell is based on a photosensitizer adsorbed on a low band gap semiconductor. The photosensitizer can be a metal complex or an organic dye. Organic dyes can be produced on a large scale resulting in cheaper dyes than complexes based on rare elements. However. the performance of Grätzel cells based on metal-free. organic dyes is not high enough yet. The dye's performance depends primarily on the electron dynamics. The electron dynamics in Grätzel cells includes electron injection. recombination. and regeneration. Different deactivation processes affect the electron dynamics and the cells’ performance.In this thesis. the electron dynamics was explored by various time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. namely time-correlated single photon counting. streak camera. and femtosecond transient absorption. Using these techniques. new deactivation processes for organic dyes used in DSSCs were uncovered. These processes include photoisomerization. and quenching through complexation with the electrolyte. These deactivation processes affect the performance of organic dyes in Grätzel cells. and should be avoided. For instance. the photoisomerization can compete with the electron injection and produce isomers with unknown performance. Photoisomerization as a general phenomenon in DSSC dyes has not been shown before. but is shown to occur in several organic dyes. among them D149. D102. L0 and L0Br.

The enzyme therefore represents an important control point and is allosterically activated by fructose-1.6-bisphosphate (FBP). In mammals the enzyme is found as four different isozymes with different regulatory properties: two of these isozymes are produced by alternate splicing. The allosteric regulation of PK is directly related to proliferation of certain cell types. as demonstrated by the expression of an allosterically regulated isozyme in tumor cells. A model for the allosteric transition from the inactive (T) state to the active (R) state has been proposed previously. but until now the FBP-binding site had not been identified.Results: We report here the structures of PK from yeast complexed with a substrate analog and catalytic metal ions in the presence and absence of bound FBP.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Group I intron endonuclease I‐CreI is encoded by an open reading frame contained within a self‐splicing intron in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast 23S rRNA gene. I‐CreI initiates the lateral transfer or homing of this intron by specifically recognizing and cleaving a pseudopalindromic 19–24 bp homing site in chloroplast 23S rRNA genes that lack the intron. The gene encoding this enzyme has been subcloned. and the protein product has been purified and crystallized. The crystals belong to space group P321. with unit cell dimensions a = b = 78.2 Å. c = 67.4 Å. The crystal unit cell is consistent with an asymmetric unit consisting of the enzyme monomer. The specific volume of this unit cell is 3.3 Å3/Da. The crystals diffract to at least 3.0 Å resolution after flash‐cooling. when using a rotating anode x‐ray source and an RAXIS image plate detector. © 1997 Wiley‐Liss Inc.,True,uRsIdW4AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,11,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199705)28:1%3C137::AID-PROT15%3E3.0.CO;2-K,14134519767751546497,/scholar?cites=14134519767751546497,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.494.6381&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

An analytical theory of that mutual-rotational correlation function is developed by extending a previous theory for self-rotational correlation functions of subunits in macromolecules with mean local cylindrical symmetry. and the result is formulated in termsof a previous normal mode theory for discrete weakly bending rods. Results from this analytical theory are compared with those of Brownian dynamics simulations with generally good agreement.

Upon circularization. the torsion constant undergoes a substantial increase. and the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum indicates a significant perturbation of the secondary structure. The torsion constant of the circular form lies in the range of values determined previously for similarly small circular DNAs by static methods. It is suggested that the long-standing discrepancy between torsion constants obtained via static methods for small circles and those obtained via the FPA method for linear DNAs may be due to such an alteration of the secondary structure and enhancement of the torsion constant by coherent bending strain present in the small circles.,True,uRsIdW4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/2370/0000/Effect-of-bending-strain-on-the-torsion-constant-of-DNA/10.1117/12.197454.short,,,,,0,0,0

Formerly we detected GBB-esterase enzymatic activity in rat blood serum using phenylated gamma-butyrobetaine as an artificial substrate of the enzyme and HPLC. The aim of the present work was to develop an assay that would enable spectrophotometric or colorimetric determination of the reaction products of GBB-esterase activity and to reveal individual proteins performing GBB-esterase activity in rat blood serum. For this purpose gammabutyrobetaine 1-naphthyl ester was synthesised. Hydrolysis of this ester releases 1-naphthol. which increases the optical absorbance at 322 nm. We have shown that the enzymatic hydrolysis of GBB 1-naphthyl ester to 1-naphthol in rat blood serum is due to GBB-esterase activity. An attempt was done to purify the enzyme from rat blood serum. By combining DEAE Sepharose at pH 4.2 and affinity chromatography with procainamide we achieved a 68-fold enrichment of GBB-esterase activity in our preparations. Separation of fraction proteins in 2D protein electrophoresis with following mass-spectrometry indicated that GBB esterase activity in rat blood serum is performed in part by carboxylesterase.,True,m3Q2trQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,5,https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=60353,13045260637943731697,/scholar?cites=13045260637943731697,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/60353,0,0,0

1174167,Characterization of the Interfacial Perimeter Active Sites in TiO2/AuNP Composites,2019,Aleksandrs Prokofjevs and Mayfair C Kung and Harold H Kung,,2019 North American Catalysis Society Meeting,,,NAM,Catalytic activity of Au in selective oxidation of organic substrates is well established. Of particular interest is the oxidation of propane with O2 in presence of H2. first demonstrated by Oyama [1]. Acetone is the dominant product when Au/TS–1 catalyst is employed. while the use of Au/TiO2 favors propene formation. It was subsequently found that inverse catalysts of Au decorated with TiO2 clusters are also active for acetone production in this reaction. which led to the proposal that the active center of the acetone formation includes interfacial perimeter sites between Au and TiO2 [2]. The key step determining the selectivity is the decomposition of i-PrO–Ti species. where α–hydrogen abstraction leads to acetone. while β–deprotonation along with C–O bond cleavage produces propene. Indeed. inverse TiO2/Au catalysts are also active in catalytic isopropanol decomposition to acetone [3]. In this study. we focus on gathering more detailed structural information of the interfacial perimeter active sites. A new solution process to generate the inverse TiO2/Au catalysts was developed. utilizing an anionic. hydrolytically stable Ti (IV) catecholate complex as the TiO2 precursor. This method offers better control of the TiO2 thickness and is more amenable to detailed structural characterization.,True,m3Q2trQAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper20184/2018-12-10%20-%20NAM26_Prokofjevs.pdf,,,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper20184/2018-12-10%20-%20NAM26_Prokofjevs.pdf,0,0,0

This uncommon mechanical behavior is not restricted to specific types of molecules and the most important feature characterizing their crystal structures is an anisotropy of intermolecular interactions.[5] The uneven distribution of the interactions which differ in strength in different directions of the crystal lattice allows the molecules to change their positions when an external force is applied.

The reactions of Lewis base borane complexes with potent electrophiles such as the trityl cation. bistriflimide and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane were explored. and the product structures were assigned based on the X ray crystallographic and spectroscopic data.  Hydride abstraction from Lewis base borane complexes by trityl cation was shown to be a viable method for generation of unstabilized primary borenium species. and several such L-BH2+ cations were shown to exist in the condensed phase in the form of diborane(6)-type dicationic dimers.  We also explored the aliphatic and aromatic borylation chemistry involving B-H borocations. and developed a procedure for the intramolecular C-H borylation of amine boranes that uses only a catalytic amount of a strong electrophile. and produces H2 gas as the sole byproduct. Additionally. the methodology for generation of more substituted unstabilized borocations derived from 9-BBN was developed. and subsequently applied to the borylation of electron rich heteroaromatic compounds.

To understand the significance of this angular variation. we have synthesized two isomeric compounds of the heteroscorpionato ligand (L1OH) (cis- and trans-(L1O)MoVOCl2). where the phenolic oxygen mimics the serinato oxygen donor. Density functional and semiempirical calculations indicate that the trans isomer is more stable than the cis. The lower stability of the cis isomer can be attributed to two factors. First. a strong antibonding interaction between the phenolic oxygen with molybdenum dxy orbital raises the energy of this orbital. Second. the strong trans influence of the terminal oxo group in the trans isomer places the phenol ring. and hence the …,True,n5dXVHUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,37,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic011169w,14285075682499377296,/scholar?cites=14285075682499377296,,,0,0,0

One of the most important proteins of the virus is an enzyme. called 3CLpro or main protease. already identified as an important pharmacological target also in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) viruses. This protein triggers the production of a whole series of enzymes necessary for the virus to carry out its replicating and infectious activities. Therefore. it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of 3CLpro structure and function in order to effectively target this enzyme. All-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the different conformational behaviors of the monomeric and dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro apo structure. as revealed by microsecond time scale MD simulations. Our results also shed light on the conformational dynamics of the loop regions at the entry of the catalytic site. Studying. at atomic level. the characteristics of the active site and obtaining information on how the protein can interact with its substrates will allow the design of molecules able to block the enzymatic function crucial for the virus.

For example. Kerr & Neukom (1952) reported the preparation of the 2-aminoethyl ether derivative of starch which readily flocculated aqueous suspensions of negatively charged colloids such as algin and carboxymethylcellulose. Additionally. Pasehall & Minkema (1961) have described the preparation of a cationic quaternary ammonium starch ether which was found to be an excellent flocculant for materials in aqueous systems. Though these starches are effective flocculating agents for aqueous suspensions of negatively charged inorganic and organic particles. their precise mode of action is not well understood.

The following electronic properties were evaluated: frontier orbitals nature. ionization potential. OH bond dissociation energy (BDE OH). stabilization energy. and spin density distribution. An important factor that shows an influence in the antioxidant property of THC is the electron abstraction at the phenol position. Our data indicate that the decrease of the HOMO values and the highest ionization potential values are related to phenol. ether. and alkyl moieties. On the other hand. BDE OH in molecules with the cyclohexenyl group at ortho position of phenol are formed from lower energies than the molecules with an ether group at the meta position.

1174272,Enantiomeric mixtures in natural product chemistry: Separation and absolute configuration assignment,2018,Andrea NL Batista and Fernando M dos Santos and João M Batista and Quezia B Cass,23,,2,492,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Chiral natural product molecules are generally assumed to be biosynthesized in an enantiomerically pure or enriched fashion. Nevertheless. a significant amount of racemates or enantiomerically enriched mixtures has been reported from natural sources. This number is estimated to be even larger since the enantiomeric purity of secondary metabolites is rarely checked in the natural product isolation pipeline. This latter fact may have drastic effects on the evaluation of the biological activity of chiral natural products. A second bottleneck is the determination of their absolute configurations. Despite the widespread use of optical rotation and electronic circular dichroism. most of the stereochemical assignments are based on empirical correlations with similar compounds reported in the literature. As an alternative. the combination of vibrational circular dichroism and quantum chemical calculations has emerged as a powerful and reliable tool for both conformational and configurational analysis of natural products. even for those lacking UV-Vis chromophores. In this review. we aim to provide the reader with a critical overview of the occurrence of enantiomeric mixtures of secondary metabolites in nature as well the best practices for their detection. enantioselective separation using liquid chromatography. and determination of absolute configuration by means of vibrational circular dichroism and density functional theory calculations.

1174281,Determination of the absolute configuration of natural product molecules using vibrational circular dichroism,2014,João M Batista Jr and Vanderlan da Silva Bolzani,41,,,383-417,Elsevier,The determination of absolute configuration (AC) has been a long-standing problem in natural product chemistry. Although there are several methods capable of determining the AC of chiral molecules. some specific requirements may limit their application. such as the presence of high-quality single crystals for X-ray analysis. UV–vis chromophores for electronic circular dichroism (ECD). chiral auxiliaries for NMR methods. and derivatizations for stereoselective organic synthesis. As an alternative. vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) has become a powerful tool for the determination of the AC and conformations of chiral compounds in the solution state after nearly 40 years of evolution. VCD results from the difference in the infrared (IR) absorbance of a chiral molecule for left versus right circularly polarized radiation. VCD is thus the extension of ECD into infrared and near-infrared regions of the spectrum where …,True,UhHdXCcAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444632944000139,10523803595388675385,/scholar?cites=10523803595388675385,,,0,0,0

Pilani Rajasthan 333 031 Email: singhvigautam@ gmail. com INTRODUCTION Drug release is the process by which a drug leaves a drug product and is subjected to absorption. distribution. metabolism. and excretion (ADME). eventually becoming available for pharmacological action. Drug release is described in several ways. Immediate release drug products allow drugs to dissolve with no intention of delaying or prolonging dissolution or absorption of the drug. Modified release dosage forms include both delayed and extended release drug products. Delayed release is defined as the release of a drug at a time other than immediately following administration. Extended release products are formulated to make the drug available over an extended period after administration. Finally. controlled release includes extended and pulsatile release products. Pulsatile release involves the release of finite amounts of drug at distinct time intervals that are programmed into the drug product.In vitro dissolution has been recognized as an important element in drug development. Under certain conditions it can be used as a surrogate for assessment of bioequivalence. Several theories/kinetics models describe drug dissolution from immediate and modified release dosage forms. There are several models to represent the drug dissolution profiles where ft is a function of t (time) related to the amount of drug,True,RrzwWhYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,485,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9995263961320221543&hl=en&oi=scholarr,9995263961320221543,/scholar?cites=9995263961320221543,,,0,0,0

Its synthesis occurs in various locations throughout the body. including the pineal gland. skin. lymphocytes and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Its synthesis and secretion is controlled by light and dark conditions. whereby light decreases and darkness increases its production. Thus. melatonin is also known as the ‘hormone of darkness’. Melatonin and analogs that bind to the melatonin receptors are important because of their role in the management of depression. insomnia. epilepsy. Alzheimer's disease (AD). diabetes. obesity. alopecia. migraine. cancer. and immune and cardiac disorders.

The effect of most of the therapeutic agents is limited due to the stratum corneum layer of the skin. which serves as a barrier for the molecules and thus only a few molecules are able to reach the site of action. A new form of delivery system called the microneedles helps to enhance the delivery of the drug through this route and overcoming the various problems associated with the conventional formulations. The primary principle involves disruption of the skin layer. thus creating micron size pathways that lead the drug directly to the epidermis or upper dermis region from where the drug can directly go into the systemic circulation without facing the barrier.

Here the novel fast dissolving oral film (FDOF) technology gives new hope to overcome these problems. Oral films made from active ingredient and hydrophilic polymers are capable of rapidly dissolution/disintegration in the buccal cavity. A part of the drug is absorbed from buccal route providing the advantages of quicker onset. bypassing first pass effect and reducing gastric degradation or metabolism.

In this paper a more comprehensive numerical model which incorporates most of the significant processes and heat transfer modes proposed in earlier models is given. Therefore. sub-models are available to describe the relationship between airflow rate through the bed and flame front speed. the evaporation and condensation of water ahead of the front. the calcination of fluxes nearer to the front. the reactions that occur in the front and cooling of the bed with the departure of the front.

1174398,Characterization of granule structure and packed bed properties of iron ore sinter feeds that contain concentrate,2017,Mingxi Zhou and Hao Zhou and Damien Paul O’dea and Benjamin George Ellis and Tom Honeyands and Xutao Guo,57,ISIJ International,6,1004-1011,The Iron and Steel Institute of Japan,Several sinter plants in China are still using significant proportions of local magnetite concentrate in the sinter blend based on supply proximity. However the overall trend is that concentrates are being replaced by more cost effective sinter fines. The fine size of concentrates results in additional challenges for sintering. In this study. granulation and packing experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of concentrate addition level on granule structure and green bed properties under a wide range of moisture and hydrated lime dosage levels. Provided sufficient water is added during granulation. the existence of micro-particles including concentrate and hydrated lime favours granule growth and increases the mass ratio of adhering layer to nuclei. However. at the same moisture and hydrated lime content. the introduction of more concentrate decreases the bed voidage remarkably since the thicker and weaker adhering layer deforms during dynamic packing. Compared to the 100% sinter fines base blend. introducing concentrate has a negative effect on bed permeability and therefore sinter productivity. For the 10% and 30% concentrate blends tested. increasing hydrated lime from 0 wt% to 4 wt% could improve the green bed permeability in JPU from 53.0 to 65.8 and 39.4 to 60.8 respectively. Based on the experimental results. a semi-empirical green bed voidage model was improved in two aspects. One is applying a one dimensional packing algorithm to get the ideal porosity of dry coarse particles utilising size distribution data rather than the simple log-normal deviation parameter. The other is to add a probability term considering the …,True,cU6KIaMAAAAJ:lK9BDNCuzFgC,16,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/57/6/57_ISIJINT-2016-734/_article/-char/ja/,10274128984729842864,/scholar?cites=10274128984729842864,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/57/6/57_ISIJINT-2016-734/_pdf,0,0,0

This study explores the impact of further decreasing the bulk density of a fairly typical ore blend. This was done by introducing small amounts of a very porous ore into the blend. Measured decreases in bulk density were up to 3%. All the sinter quality parameters could be maintained or improved without the need to increase coke rate. Changes in sinter density results were not significant. indicating that the changes in bed bulk density did not have a significant effect on sinter porosity. The study was then extended to include a comparable blend and two hematite blends of higher bulk density. Decreasing green bed bulk density. bed shrinkage and sinter density did not have a detrimental effect on sinter tumble strength. The associated increase in porosity with the measured changes in sinter density is estimated to be up to 10%. Results showed that sinter density values obtained for the low bulk density mixes at increased coke addition were still lower than equivalent values for the hematite mixes. As expected flame front speed was dependent on post-ignition airflow rate and both these parameters influence sinter strength. Many blends studied have binders and results indicated that their inclusion into sinter mixes gave increased post-ignition airflow values.,True,cU6KIaMAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,15,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/54/1/54_19/_article/-char/ja/,906451696092641351,/scholar?cites=906451696092641351,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/54/1/54_19/_pdf,0,0,0

To find the optimum level of segregation for a given blend. intensive experimental work will be necessary to assess the impact of different segregation levels. The impact of segregation on sintering performance can also be quantified using mathematical modelling. In this work. a well-validated sintering mathematical model has been developed and the effects of mean granule size. bed voidage. bed bulk density. coke mass segregation as well as increased bed permeability on the sintering performance have been investigated. It was concluded that the variation in coke mass down the bed and increased bed permeability are the major factors giving increased sinter yield and productivity in segregated beds. Coke mass segregation has a large impact on maximum bed temperature. residence time above the critical temperature and. consequently. the total heat available to the bed at the critical melt formation period. The effect of variations in granule size and bulk density. caused by segregation. on coke combustion efficiency and bed temperature is small. Bed permeability has the largest impact on flame front speed and. therefore. sinter productivity. Based on differences in bottom and top bed temperatures. the optimal coke mass segregation level was identified.

1174417,DFT+ U investigation of propene oxidation over bismuth molybdate: active sites. reaction intermediates. and the role of bismuth,2013,Andrew “Bean” Getsoian and Vladimir Shapovalov and Alexis T Bell,117,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,14,7123-7137,American Chemical Society,The mechanism by which propene is selectively oxidized to acrolein over bismuth molybdate has been investigated using the DFT+U variant of density functional theory. In agreement with experiment. the kinetically relevant step is found to be the initial abstraction of hydrogen by lattice oxygen. Several candidate lattice oxygen sites have been examined. the most active of which is found to be a bismuth-perturbed molybdenyl MoO oxygen. Hydrogen abstraction generates an allyl radical intermediate. which can diffuse freely across the catalyst surface and ultimately binds to a second molybdenyl oxygen to form an allyl alkoxy intermediate. A second hydrogen is abstracted from this intermediate to produce acrolein. Calculations suggest that only molybdenum centers are reduced during the reaction. However. presence of bismuth in the catalyst is essential for providing the requisite structural and electronic …,True,C0Yva6UAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,53,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp400440p,15848344742563847677,/scholar?cites=15848344742563847677,,,0,0,0

We find that. contrary to statements made in the literature. the structure of the clusters supported on ceria is different from that supported on titania and so is their oxidation chemistry. The most stable structures found here are also different from those suggested by previous work. The structure of the VOx is very strongly influenced by the position of the oxygen atoms and of the cations on the surface of the support.

1174420,A theoretical study of methanol oxidation catalyzed by isolated vanadia clusters supported on the (101) surface of anatase,2012,Vladimir Shapovalov and Tim Fievez and Alexis T Bell,116,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,35,18728-18735,American Chemical Society,A theoretical model has been developed for describing isolated vanadate species dispersed on the (101) surface of anatase that takes into account the equilibration of the supported species with gas-phase oxygen. The lowest energy of the combined solid and gas phases identifies the VOx species with the optimal structure and composition. This model of VOx species supported on the surface of anatase is then used to analyze the reaction path for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde. The chemisorption of methanol is found to proceed preferentially by addition across a V–O–Ti bond to form V–OCH3 and Ti–OH species. The rate-limiting step for the formation of formaldehyde takes place via the transfer of a hydrogen atom from V–OCH3 bound to an oxygen atom bridging two Ti atoms. i.e.. a Ti–O–Ti group located adjacent to the supported vanadate species.

This reaction is a critical step in the synthesis of monoethylene glycol (MEG). a widely used chemical. from synthesis gas. The mechanism of DMM carbonylation occurring on H−MFI and H−FAU zeolites has been investigated using density functional theory. We find that the reaction involves three steps: initiation via reaction of zeolite protons with DMM to form methoxymethoxy species. carbonylation of the resulting species. and subsequent methoxylation of the resulting acyl species. Both the carbonylation and methoxylation processes proceed via carbocationic transition states that are stabilized by the framework O atoms of the zeolite.

The role of the pore size heterogeneity is investigated by measuring separately the desaturation curves of the two pore populations. The displaced wetting fluid remains trapped in small pores at low capillary numbers and is swept only above a critical capillary number proportional to the permeability of the big pores network. Based on this observation. we derive a simple criterion for phase trapping based on the balance of viscous to capillary forces. Numerical implementation of this theory in a pore network model quantitatively fits our experimental results. This combination of approaches demonstrates quantitatively the influence of geometrical heterogeneities on drainage in porous media.,True,f4q9pPUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,14,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.84.065302,2059768068253133196,/scholar?cites=2059768068253133196,,http://hugues.bodiguel.free.fr/pdf/e065302_romano2011.pdf,0,0,0

It is shown that due to the isoperibolic boundary condition. the thermal behaviour at the established periodic state can be managed according to different orders. i.e. either a continuous or fluctuating contribution. A complete analytical solution is proposed for the complex problem model. then a simplified model is proposed. Finally. a simple homogeneous equivalent thin body model approximation with a characteristic coefficient function of a biphasic flow mixing law is sufficient for describing the thermal behaviour of the media under isoperibolic conditions.

Number of obese people in Europe has increased threefold over the last 20 years. The paradox of obesity and poverty relationship is observed especially in the developed and developing countries. In developing countries. along with economic development and income growth. the number of people with overweight and obesity is increasing. This paradox has a relationship with both the easy availability and low cost of highly processed foods containing ‘empty calories’ and no nutritional value. To date. this paradox has been described in the United States and the United Kingdom. although many European countries are also experiencing high percentages of obese people. Among the reasons for the growing obesity in the population of poor people are: higher unemployment. lower education level. and irregular meals. Another cause of obesity is low physical activity. which among the poor is associated with a lack of money for sports equipment. Due to the large rate of deaths caused by diseases directly linked to obesity. the governments of many countries implement prevention programmes of overweight and obesity.

However. there is still limited empirical evidence from natural environments evaluating the direct and indirect (i.e. via biota) effects of disturbance on ecosystem functioning. Oxygen deficiency is a widespread threat to coastal and estuarine communities. While the negative impacts of hypoxia on benthic communities are well known. few studies have assessed in situ how benthic communities subjected to different degrees of hypoxic stress alter their contribution to ecosystem functioning. We studied changes in sediment ecosystem function (i.e. oxygen and nutrient fluxes across the sediment water-interface) by artificially inducing hypoxia of different durations (0. 3. 7 and 48 days) in a subtidal sandy habitat. Benthic chamber incubations were used for measuring responses in sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes. Changes in benthic species richness. structure and traits were quantified. while stress-induced behavioral changes were documented by observing bivalve reburial rates. The initial change in faunal behavior was followed by non-linear degradation in benthic parameters (abundance. biomass. bioturbation potential). gradually impairing the structural and functional composition of the benthic community. In terms of ecosystem function. the increasing duration of hypoxia altered sediment oxygen consumption and enhanced sediment effluxes of NH4+ and dissolved Si. Although effluxes of PO43− were not altered significantly. changes were observed in sediment PO43− sorption capability.

However. few empirical studies have assessed to what extent an ecosystem can tolerate repeated disturbances and sustain its multiple functions. By inducing increasingly recurring hypoxic disturbances to a sedimentary ecosystem. we show that the majority of individual ecosystem functions experience gradual degradation patterns in response to repetitive pulse disturbances. The degradation in overall ecosystem functioning was. however. evident at an earlier stage than for single ecosystem functions and was induced after a short pulse of hypoxia (i.e.. three days). which likely reduced ecosystem resistance to further hypoxic perturbations.

Here. we present a case study of a hypoxic sea. which receives riverine nutrient loading and in which microbe-mediated vicious cycles of nutrients prevail. We showed that bacterial communities changed along the horizontal loading and vertical mineralization gradients in the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea. using multivariate statistics of terminal restriction fragments and sediment chemical. spatial and other properties of the sampling sites. The change was mainly explained by concentrations of organic carbon. nitrogen and phosphorus. which showed strong positive correlation with Flavobacteria. Sphingobacteria. Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. These bacteria predominated in the most organic-rich coastal surface sediments overlain by oxic bottom water. whereas sulphate-reducing bacteria. particularly the genus Desulfobacula. prevailed in the reduced organic-rich surface sediments in the open sea. They correlated positively with organic nitrogen and phosphorus. as well as manganese oxides. These relationships suggest that the bacterial groups participated in the aerobic and anaerobic degradation of organic matter and contributed to nutrient cycling.

Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds are the major nutrients and control organic matter (biomass) production in the surface water. Due to various anthropogenic activities. the input of these nutrients into the Baltic Sea has increased drastically during the last century and has enhanced the net organic matter production by a factor of 2–4 (eutrophication). This has led to detrimental oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulphide production in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea. Model simulations based on the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) indicate that current eutrophication and thus extension of oxygen-depleted areas cannot be reversed within the next hundred years by the proposed nutrient reduction measures.

1174524,Chemical characteristics and behaviour of sediment phosphorus in the northeastern Baltic Sea.,2008,Kaarina Lukkari,,,,,Helsingin yliopisto,Chemical characteristics and behaviour of sediment phosphorus in the northeastern Baltic Sea   Eutrophication is a severe environmental problem in the Baltic Sea. especially in the Gulf of Finland and the Archipelago Sea. and it is enhanced by the release of phosphorus (P) from bottom sediments. The release of P from sediment reserves largely depends on the occurrence of P in different chemical forms and on the prevailing conditions. especially on the presence of oxygen. This study examines the chemical character and the vertical distribution of sediment P in two shallow estuaries. in shallow coastal sediments overlain by oxic near-bottom water. and in poorly oxygenated open sea sediments in the northeastern Baltic Sea. The objective was to evaluate how much of the sediment P is buried and removed from the nutrient cycle. and how much of it is in forms that can be released from the sediment to the overlaying water over time. Relationships between the distribution of the different P forms and the chemical and physical properties of the sediment. sediment pore water. and near-bottom water were determined in order to examine the behaviour of P at the sediment-water interface.   The results show that the chemical character of sediment P varied in the different areas. Generally. in the outer estuaries and in the organic-rich coastal areas in the eastern Gulf of Finland. the sediments were higher in P than the sediments in the poorly oxygenated open sea areas in the central and western Gulf. The estuary sediments that received erosion-transported material were characterised by P bound to hydrated oxides of iron and aluminum.

In the organicrich. low-salinity-water bay studied. the release of phosphorus from the sediments was sensitive to bioirrigation and oxygen conditions in the water. This was explained by the importance of hydrated iron oxides in binding phosphorus at the sediment surface. the sensitivity of iron-bound phosphorus to redox conditions. and the presence of soluble iron and sulphate. Chemical forms of phosphorus. especially phosphorus bound by redox-sensitive hydrated iron oxides. are regulated by the amount of degradable organic matter. availability of oxygen. iron and sulphate as well as bioirrigation by benthic fauna.

1174531,OLD CLAYS− A FORGOTTEN SOURCE OF PHOSPHORUS TO THE BALTIC SEA,2012,Per Jonsson and Tuula Kohonen and Kaarina Lukkari and Magnus Karlsson and Mikael Malmaéus and Johanna Mattila and Irma Puttonen,,GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF FINLAND,,32,,The Baltic Sea area is subjected to a considerable land up-lift after the last glaciation of Scandinavia. In the Baltic Proper the crustal rebound is ranging from 0 mm yr-1 in the south to 5 in the north and in the Gulf of Bothnia it ranges from 5 to 9 mm yr-1. This triggers off a gradual exposition of old glacial and post glacial clays to waves and currents leading to substantial erosion along the Baltic coastal areas. Estimates from literature yield that as much as 70− 80% of the bulk accumulation of fine material in the Baltic Sea derives from relocalisation of old sediments. Our hypothesis is that a substantial part of the sediment phosphorus may be in the form of mobile phosphorus. We also hypothesize that due to the overall large bulk sediment input from erosion the bioavailable portion of phosphorus is important for the mass balance of phosphorus in the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Within a joint NMR/EU project. speciation of Baltic glacial and post-glacial clays (n= 52) resulted in a total phosphorus content of 310− 1446 with a median value of 701 µg g-1 dw (SD= 199). The corresponding values of potentially mobile P were 33− 582 with a median value of 119 µg g-1 dw (SD= 92). which as an average constitutes 18% of the total phosphorus content. Based on literature data from 105 dated sediment cores the dry matter deposition in the entire Baltic Sea has been estimated to 95.000. 000 tonnes yr-1. Assuming that 70− 80% of this derives from erosion of old clays and that the median mobile phosphorus content is 119 µg g-1 dw. 7 900− 9 000 tonnes potentially mobile phosphorus may be released to the water mass per year. which is 28− 32% of the total …,True,zM2-VVcAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henry_Vallius/publication/257985833_11th_Colloquium_on_Baltic_Sea_Marine_Geology_Helsinki_19th-21st_September_2012_Abstract_Book/links/00b495268c67532725000000/11th-Colloquium-on-Baltic-Sea-Marine-Geology-Helsinki-19th-21st-September-2012-Abstract-Book.pdf#page=34,7832463877349821462,/scholar?cites=7832463877349821462,,,0,0,0

Fatigue crack damage depends on a number of stress range cycles. Three sizes are important for the characteristics of the propagation of fatigue cracks - the initial size. detectable size and acceptable size. The theoretical model of fatigue crack progression in paper is based on a linear fracture mechanics. When determining the required degree of reliability. it is possible to specify the time of the first inspection of the construction which will focus on the fatigue damage. Using a conditional probability. times for subsequent inspections can be determined.

The molybdenum selenide displays attractive catalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water over a wide range of pH. In a pH 0 solution. it operates with a small onset overpotential of 125 mV and requires an overpotential of 270 mV for generating a catalytic current of 10 mA/cm2. Compared with molybdenum sulfide. the selenide analogue is more robust in a basic electrolyte.

However. most antimycobacterial β-lactams kill Mtb only or best when the bacilli are replicating.

Here we investigated the targets of recently described cephalosporins that are selectively active against nonreplicating (NR) Mtb. NR-active cephalosporins failed to inhibit recombinant Mtb transpeptidases. Accordingly. we used alkyne analogs of NR-active cephalosporins to pull down potential targets through unbiased activity-based protein profiling and identified over 30 protein binders. None was a transpeptidase. Several of the target candidates are plausibly related to Mtb’s survival in an NR state. However. biochemical tests and studies of loss of function mutants did not identify a unique target that accounts for the bactericidal activity of these beta-lactams against NR Mtb. Instead. NR-active cephalosporins appear to kill Mtb by collective action on multiple targets.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the sorption capacity of the natural Turkish (Reşadiye) bentonite (NTB) for the removal of ammonium (NH+4) ions from aqueous solution from the viewpoint of both the sorption isotherms and the associated thermodynamics. The influence of pH. adsorbent dosage and temperature on the sorption of NH+4 ions onto NTB was also studied.It was found that the non-linear Langmuir model was more suitable for describing the sorption of NH+4 ions onto NTB since the application of this model exhibited a higher coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.99) than that for the non-linear Freundlich model (R2 = 0.98).

Turkey,2005,K Saltali and DA Mendil and H Sari,,Agrochimica (Italy),,,,One of the most important sources of trace metals in agricultural soils is mineral fertilizer. A large quantity of fertilizers containing trace metals has been used under farming systems in Turkey and world since years. In this research. cadmium (Cd). lead (Pb). nickel (Ni). copper (Cu). zinc (Zn). iron (Fe). manganese (Mn) concentrations in sixteen solid fertilizer samples. produced in different fertilizers factories in Turkey. were analysed and trace metals contamination risk was evaluated in Turkish soils. Phosphorus fertilizers contained trace metals at concentration above those found in all other fertilizers and ammonium nitrate and urea fertilizers contained the lowest levels of trace metals. Trace metals concentrations. except Cd. in fertilizers were lower than the median soil trace metals values. Taking into consideration the calcareous and basic soil properties in Turkish soils. trace metal toxicity due to fertilizers use is not expected to be a major problem at present.

A fundamental impediment is the transient interactions between an enzyme and its substrates. In contrast. tight binding is often observed for multisubstrate-adduct inhibitors due to synergistic interactions. Extending this venerable concept to enzyme-catalyzed in situ adduct formation. unknown substrates were affinity-captured by an S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet. SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (MTase). Specifically. the electrophilic methyl sulfonium (alkyl donor) in AdoMet is replaced with a vinyl sulfonium (Michael acceptor) in S-adenosyl-vinthionine (AdoVin). Via an addition reaction.
