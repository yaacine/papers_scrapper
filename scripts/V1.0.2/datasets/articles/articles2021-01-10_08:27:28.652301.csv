The kinase Akt and p21-Ras. an Akt activator. induced phosphorylation of pro–caspase-9 (pro-Casp9) in cells.

Akt phosphorylated recombinant Casp9 in vitro on serine-196 and inhibited its protease activity. Mutant pro-Casp9(Ser196Ala) was resistant to Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition in vitro and in cells. resulting in Akt-resistant induction of apoptosis.

To date. ten homologs of human origin have been published (Figure 1). The frenetic pace of identification of new homologs has led to inconsistent and multiple names for many of these enzymes. As a consequence. the general scientific community is finding it increasingly difficult to follow this provocative and rapidly moving field. In an effort to remedy this situation. several of us who have been involved in the identification and characterization of these enzymes have formed a committee. with the objective of proposing a nomenclature for the human members of this protease family that is sensible and easy to use.

A majority of studies on apoptosis are based on the assumption that caspase precursors are activated by cleavage. a common mechanism for most protease zymogen activations.

39226,Caspase activation: the induced-proximity model,1999,Guy S Salvesen and Vishva M Dixit,96,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,20,10964-10967,National Academy of Sciences,Members of the caspase family of proteases transmit the events that  lead to apoptosis of animal cells. Distinct members of the  family are involved in both the initiation and execution phases of cell  death. with the initiator caspases being recruited to multicomponent  signaling complexes. Initiation of apoptotic events depends on  the ability of the signaling complexes to generate an active protease.  The mechanism of activation of the caspases that constitute the  different apoptosis-signaling complexes can be explained by an  unusual property of the caspase zymogens to autoprocess to an active  form. This autoprocessing depends on intrinsic activity that resides in  the zymogens of the initiator caspases. We review evidence for a  hypothesis—the induced-proximity model—that describes how the first  proteolytic signal is produced after adapter-mediated clustering of  initiator caspase zymogens.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1186,https://www.pnas.org/content/96/20/10964.short,13583829103680727596,/scholar?cites=13583829103680727596,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/96/20/10964.full.pdf,0
39227,Viral inhibition of inflammation: cowpox virus encodes an inhibitor of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme,1992,Caroline A Ray and Roy A Black and Shirley R Kronheim and Teresa A Greenstreet and Paul R Sleath and Guy S Salvesen and David J Pickup,69,Cell,4,597-604,Cell Press,Cowpox virus effectively inhibits inflammatory responses against viral infection in the chick embryo. This study demonstrates that one of the viral genes necessary for this inhibition. the crmA gene (a cytokine response modifier gene). encodes a serpin that is a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme. This serpin can prevent the proteolytic activation of interleukin-1β. thereby suppressing an interleukin-1β response to infection. However. the modification of this single cytokine response is not sufficient to inhibit inflammatory responses. This suggests that cowpox virus encodes several cytokine response modifiers that act together to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection. These viral countermeasures to host defenses against infection may contribute significantly to the pathology associated with poxvirus infections.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1173,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286749290223Y,16841104351222793030,/scholar?cites=16841104351222793030,,,0

The Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in and promotes anoikis. This activation requires caspase activity. We presently report that a DEVD motif–specific caspase that cleaves MEKK-1 specifically is activated when cells lose matrix contact. This cleavage is required for the activation of the kinase activity. When overexpressed. the MEKK-1 cleavage product stimulates apoptosis; the wild-type. full-length MEKK-1 sensitizes cells to anoikis; and a cleavage-resistant mutant of MEKK-1 partially protects cells against anoikis. The cleavage-resistant or kinase-inactive mutants also prevent caspase-7 from being activated completely.

39247,Solution structure of BID. an intracellular amplifier of apoptotic signaling,1999,James J Chou and Honglin Li and Guy S Salvesen and Junying Yuan and Gerhard Wagner,96,Cell,5,615-624,Cell Press,We report the solution structure of BID. an intracellular cross-talk agent that can amplify FAS/TNF apoptotic signal through the mitochondria death pathway after Caspase 8 cleavage. BID contains eight α helices where two central hydrophobic helices are surrounded by six amphipathic ones. The fold resembles pore-forming bacterial toxins and shows similarity to BCL-XL although sequence homology to BCL-XL is limited to the 16-residue BH3 domain. Furthermore. we modeled a complex of BCL-XL and BID by aligning the BID and BAK BH3 motifs in the known BCL-XL–BAK BH3 complex. Additionally. we show that the overall structure of BID is preserved after cleavage by Caspase 8. We propose that BID has both BH3 domain–dependent and –independent modes of action in inducing mitochondrial damage.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,576,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400805723,11994997006691036718,/scholar?cites=11994997006691036718,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400805723,0

To explore this hypothesis we produced recombinant forms of procaspase-9 containing mutations that disabled one or both of the interdomain processing sites of the zymogen. These mutants were able to activate downstream caspases. but only in the presence of cytosolic factors. The mutant with both processing sites abolished had 10% of the activity of wild-type. and was able to support apoptosis. with equal vigor to wild-type. when transiently expressed in 293 cells.

At the high concentrations used for crystal formation.  caspase 9 is dimeric. and the structure reveals two very different  active-site conformations within each dimer. One site closely resembles  the catalytically competent sites of other caspases. whereas in the  second. expulsion of the “activation loop” disrupts the  catalytic machinery. We propose that the inactive domain resembles  monomeric caspase 9. Activation is induced by dimerization. with  interactions at the dimer interface promoting reorientation of the  activation loop.

Incubation of proMMP-3 with neutrophil elastase. plasma kallikrein. plasmin. or chymotrypsin at 37 C resulted in the formation of MMP-3 of Afr=45000 by cleaving of the His82-Phe83 bond.

Physiologic. and sometimes pathologic. cell death – apoptosis – is driven by activation of a family of proteases known as the caspases. present in almost all nucleated animal cells. The enzymatic properties of these proteases are governed by a dominant specificity for substrates containing Asp. and by the use of a Cys side chain for catalyzing peptide bond cleavage. The primary specificity for Asp turns out to be very rare among proteases. and currently the only other known mammalian proteases with the same primary specificity is the physiological caspase activator granzyme B. Like most other proteases. the caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens whose activation requires limited proteolysis or binding to co-factors.

Dordrecht,The main effectors of apoptosis encompass proteases from the caspase family. which reside as latent precursors in most nucleated animal cells. The apoptotic caspases constitute a minimal two-step signaling pathway. The apical (initiator) caspases are activated within oligomeric signaling complexes in response to apoptotic stimuli. Their mechanism of activation probably results from proximity-induced clustering to the dimeric active forms. Once activated. the apical caspases directly activate the executioner (effector) caspases by limited proteolytic cleavage. The distinct activation mechanisms explain how an apoptotic stimulus is converted to proteolytic activity. and how this activity is amplified to allow for limited proteolysis of the dozens of protein substrates whose cleavage is required for efficient apoptosis.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,279,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6554-5_2,16545497029838955970,/scholar?cites=16545497029838955970,,,0

Kennedy's disease. is a degenerative disease of the motor neurons that is associated with an increase in the number of CAG repeats encoding a polyglutamine stretch within the androgen receptor (AR). Recent work has demonstrated that the gene products associated with open reading frame triplet repeat expansions may be substrates for the cysteine protease cell death executioners. the caspases. However. the role that caspase cleavage plays in the cytotoxicity associated with expression of the disease‐associated alleles is unknown. Here. we report the first conclusive evidence that caspase cleavage is a critical step in cytotoxicity ; the expression of the AR with an expanded polyglutamine stretch enhances its ability to induce apoptosis when compared with the normal AR. The AR is cleaved by a caspase‐3 subfamily protease at Asp146. and this cleavage …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,266,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0720185.x,10539203188893442017,/scholar?cites=10539203188893442017,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0720185.x,0

The use of a Cys side chain as a nucleophile during peptide bond hydrolysis is common to several protease families. However. the primary specificity for Asp turns out to be very rare among protease families throughout biotic kingdoms. Of all known mammalian proteases only the caspase activator granzyme B. a serine protease. has the same primary specificity. In addition to this unusual primary specificity. caspases are remarkable in that certain of their zymogens have intrinsic proteolytic activity.

Apoptosis—the primary form of regulated cell death—is relatively well defined. Necroptosis—an alternative. distinct kind of regulated cell death discovered more recently—is less well understood. Apoptosis and necroptosis can be triggered either from within the cell or by extracellular stimuli. Certain signaling components. including several death ligands and receptors. can regulate both processes. Whereas apoptosis is triggered and executed via intracellular proteases called caspases. necroptosis is suppressed by caspase activity.

SfIAP and baculoviral CpIAP inhibit Bax but not Fas-induced apoptosis in human cells. Their apoptosis-suppressing activity in mammalian cells requires both baculovirus IAP repeat and RING domains. Further biochemical data suggest that SfIAP and CpIAP are specific inhibitors of mammalian caspase-9. the pinnacle caspase in the mitochondria/cytochrome c pathway for apoptosis. but are not inhibitors of downstream caspase-3 and caspase-7.

The past decade has seen huge leaps in understanding the biology and chemistry of the caspases. largely through the development of synthetic substrates and inhibitors. Such agents are used to define the role of caspases in transmitting life and death signals. in imaging caspases in situ and in vivo. and in deconvoluting the networks that govern cell behavior.

To examine this issue. we have characterized the protective effects of an ancestral. baculoviral IAP (Op-IAP) in mammalian cells. We show that although Op-IAP potently inhibited Bax-mediated apoptosis in human cells. Op-IAP failed to directly inhibit mammalian caspases. However.

A Wiley Company,The basic mechanisms that underlie neurodegenerative diseases are unknown. Loss of function of specific regions of the brain is due to incapacitation of cells that constitute those regions. Cells can simply stop functioning normally (neurons may cease to transmit signals). or they may die. There is now evidence that the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases is due to inappropriate apoptosis. This being the case. an understanding of the mediators of apoptosis. their identities. and their role in orchestrating death would be a vital step toward remedying the diseases. The central components of apoptotic pathways. proteases of the caspase family. are present in latent forms in all nucleated cells. Their activity is balanced by specific activation and inactivation events. and the molecular and biochemical controls have been well established in vitro and in model transformed cell lines.

The extent to which down-regulation of serpin activity occurs in vivo is debated. since little is known of the rates at which the process occurs. To address this debate. we have measured the rates of inactivation of three serpins. alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI). alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1ACT). and antithrombin III (ATIII). by three human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs-1. -2. and -3) thought to be involved in tissue destruction and repair.

Activation relies on adaptor-induced dimerization of monomeric caspase-8 and is followed by specific limited autoproteolysis of the linker which separates the two subunits of the catalytic domain. However. the role of this autoproteolysis. which directly activates executioner caspases-3 and -7. is unknown for the apical caspase-8. We have generated linker mutants of caspase-8 that can be proteolyzed in a controlled manner by thrombin or tobacco etch mosaic virus protease. and we use these to define the role of proteolysis in the activation and stability of the enzyme.

Specifically. these reagents were used to dissect the kinetics of caspase activation upon stimulation of apoptosis in cell-free extracts and intact cells. These studies identified a full-length caspase-7 intermediate that becomes catalytically activated early in the pathway and whose further processing is mediated by mature executioner caspases rather than initiator caspases.

This bewildering switch is now known to be driven by activation of a pathway dependent on protein kinases of the RIP family. which engage a pathway known as necroptosis. If caspase-8 does not control this pathway. necrotic death results. The pro-apoptotic and pro-survival functions of caspase-8 are regulated by a specific interaction with the pseudo-caspase cFLIP. and it is thought that the heterocomplex between these two partners alters the …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC,116,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532314000463,3656146717600716462,/scholar?cites=3656146717600716462,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099255/,0

Here we report a novel strategy for the identification of the signature of proteolytic cleavage events based on quantitative proteomics. Lysine residues in proteins are blocked by guanidination so that free N-terminals can be labeled with amine-specific iTRAQ reagents. The quantitative nature of iTRAQ reagents allows us to distinguish N-terminals newly formed by proteolytic treatment (neoepitopes) from original N-terminals in proteins. Proteins are digested with trypsin and analyzed using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry.

It has become increasingly clear that the heterodimer of caspase-8 with the long isoform of cellular FLIP (FLIPL) fulfills these pro-survival functions of caspase-8. FLIPL. a catalytically defective caspase-8 paralog. can interact with caspase-8 to activate its catalytic function. The caspase-8/FLIPL heterodimer has a restricted substrate repertoire and does not induce apoptosis. In essence. caspase-8 heterodimerized with FLIPL prevents the receptor interacting kinases RIPK1 and -3 from executing the form of cell death known as necroptosis.

The metzincins are active players in such proteolytic events. and their mode of regulation is therefore of particular interest and importance. The TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) are established endogenous inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). and some have intriguing abilities to associate with the pericellular environment. It has been shown that TIMP-2 can bind to cell surface MT1-MMP (membrane-type 1 MMP) to act as a 'receptor' for proMMP-2 (progelatinase A). such that the latter can be activated efficiently in a localized fashion.

These exopeptidases are potential targets for the development of a new class of anti-malaria drugs.   Methodology/Principal Findings To define the substrate specificity of recombinant forms of these two malaria aminopeptidases we used a new library consisting of 61 fluorogenic substrates derived both from natural and unnatural amino acids. We obtained a detailed substrate fingerprint for recombinant forms of the enzymes revealing that PfM1AAP exhibits a very broad substrate tolerance. capable of efficiently hydrolyzing neutral and basic amino acids. while PfM17LAP has narrower substrate specificity and preferentially cleaves bulky. hydrophobic amino acids. The substrate library was also exploited to profile the activity of the native aminopeptidases in soluble cell lysates of P. falciparum malaria.

In addition to the inhibition of the metalloproteinase thermolysin. the protein inhibited the serine proteinases human neutrophil elastase. pig pancreatic elastase. bovine chymotrypsin. bovine trypsin and the cysteine proteinase papain. A fraction of the proteinase-inhibitor complex resisted dissociation after denaturation indicating that some of the proteinase molecules became covalently bound.

Determining all relevant protein substrates of caspases remains a challenging task.

To aid the discovery process we developed a caspase cleavage prediction method using the recently published curated MerCASBA database of experimentally determined caspase substrates and a Random Forest classification method. On both internal and external test sets. the ranking of predicted cleavage positions is superior to all previously developed prediction methods. The in silico predicted caspase cleavage positions in human proteins are available from a relational database: CaspDB. Our database provides information about potential cleavage sites in a verified set of all human proteins collected in Uniprot and their orthologs. allowing for tracing of cleavage motif conservation. It also provides information about the positions of disease-annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms. and posttranslational modifications that may modulate the caspase cleaving efficiency.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:RXiHnyRawswC,46,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110539,9095914049706358662,/scholar?cites=9095914049706358662,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110539,0
39446,Metacaspases are not caspases–always doubt,2010,M Enoksson and GS Salvesen,17,Cell Death & Differentiation,8,1221-1221,Nature Publishing Group,We read with great interest a recent editorial in CDD by Carmona-Gutierrez et al. with the provocative title of ‘Metacaspases are caspases. Doubt no more’. 1 We agree with the authors that there has been some confusion over the years since the unfortunate naming of the distant caspase orthologs known as ‘metacaspases’ and ‘paracaspases’. 2 and that this confusion has led to misinterpretations in the field of cell death mechanisms. The great philosopher Karl Popper is famous for his attempt to reject the classical observationalist/inductivist approach to science and to advance empirical falsification in its place: scientists can never prove anything. they can only disprove a thing. Clearly there is always doubt–it would be antiscientific to suggest otherwise–and we suggest that metacaspases have in fact been proven not to be caspases.Yeast and plants have programmed cell death pathways. but not apoptosis. which …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC,46,https://www.nature.com/articles/cdd201045,15921662430334610306,/scholar?cites=15921662430334610306,,https://www.nature.com/articles/cdd201045,0

Identifying endogenous substrates for caspase-8 by using integrated bioinformatics and biological approaches is required to delineate the diverse roles of this caspase. We describe a number of novel putative caspase-8 substrates using the Prediction of Protease Specificity (PoPS) program. one of which is histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7). HDAC7 is cleaved faster than any other caspase-8 substrate described to date. It is also cleaved in primary CD4+CD8+ thymocytes undergoing extrinsic apoptosis. By using naturally occurring caspase inhibitors that have evolved exquisite specificity at concentrations found within the cell. we could unequivocally assign the cleavage activity to caspase-8. Importantly. cleavage of HDAC7 alters its subcellular localization and abrogates its Nur77 repressor function …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,46,https://www.jbc.org/content/283/28/19499.short,6904548847954289975,/scholar?cites=6904548847954289975,,https://www.jbc.org/content/283/28/19499.full.pdf,0

The goal of the present study was to determine the basis for the increased kinase activity that is associated with caspase processing of PKC ζ. Atypical PKC ι is largely identical with PKC ζ. except for a 60-amino-acid segment that lacks the caspase-processing sites of the ζ isoform. Replacement of this segment of PKC ζ with the corresponding segment of PKC ι prevented caspase processing and activation of the kinase function. Processing of purified recombinant PKC ζ by caspase 3 in vitro markedly increased its kinase activity. Caspase processing activated PKC ζ in vitro or intracellularly without increasing the phosphorylation of Thr410 of PKC ζ. which is required for …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:zwpXiJ37cpgC,46,https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-abstract/375/3/663/40849,5316553301921641619,/scholar?cites=5316553301921641619,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1223714/pdf/12887331.pdf,0

The cowpox serpin crmA suppresses host apoptosis and inflammation by inhibiting endogenous caspases. We report on the mechanism crmA uses to inhibit caspases 1. 6. and 8. Native PAGE showed formation of tight crmA-caspase complexes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry provided evidence for a covalent crmA-p20 thioester linkage. SDS-PAGE of isolated complexes showed near complete loss of the p10 subunit from initiator caspases 1 and 8 but not from the executioner caspase-6.

Yersinia pestis. injects an exceptionally active tyrosine phosphatase called YopH into host cells using a type III secretion system. We recently reported that YopH acutely inhibits T cell antigen receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the Lck tyrosine kinase. Here. we show that prolonged presence of YopH in primary T cells or Jurkat T leukemia cells causes apoptosis. detected by annexin V binding. mitochondrial breakdown. caspase activation. and internucleosomal fragmentation. YopH also causes cell death when expressed in HeLa cells. and this cell death was inhibited by YopH-specific small molecule inhibitors. Cell death induced by YopH was also prevented by caspase inhibition or co-expression of Bcl-xL.

The executioners of apoptosis are caspase family proteases. We report that vaccinia virus-encoded F1L protein. previously recognized as anti-apoptotic viral Bcl-2 family protein. is a caspase-9 inhibitor. F1L binds to and specifically inhibits caspase-9. the apical protease in the mitochondrial cell death pathway while failing to inhibit other caspases. In cells. F1L inhibits apoptosis and proteolytic processing of caspases induced by overexpression of caspase-9 but not caspase-8. An N-terminal region of F1L preceding the Bcl-2-like fold accounts for caspase-9 inhibition and significantly contributes to the anti-apoptotic activity of F1L. Viral F1L thus provides the first example of caspase inhibition by a Bcl-2 family member; it functions both as a suppressor of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and as an inhibitor of caspase-9 …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC,44,https://www.jbc.org/content/285/8/5569.short,8249873698850989102,/scholar?cites=8249873698850989102,,https://www.jbc.org/content/285/8/5569.full.pdf,0

One of the most prominent death domain complexes first described in the initiation of apoptosis is formed by the transmembrane receptor Fas. the cytosolic adaptor protein FADD. and caspase-8 and is referred to as the Fas/FADD/caspase-8 death inducing signaling complex (DISC). The recent structure of the Fas/FADD death domain complex reveals how formation of this signaling platform can be stringently regulated utilizing only Fas receptor clustering to form a death domain network. This work reveals that an opening mechanism of Fas is needed to expose binding sites for the FADD death domain and sets the stage for a conditional interaction. which is characterized by weak interactions adapted for a regulatory function.
