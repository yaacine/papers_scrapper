To date. ten homologs of human origin have been published (Figure 1). The frenetic pace of identification of new homologs has led to inconsistent and multiple names for many of these enzymes. As a consequence. the general scientific community is finding it increasingly difficult to follow this provocative and rapidly moving field. In an effort to remedy this situation. several of us who have been involved in the identification and characterization of these enzymes have formed a committee. with the objective of proposing a nomenclature for the human members of this protease family that is sensible and easy to use.

Distinct members of the  family are involved in both the initiation and execution phases of cell  death. with the initiator caspases being recruited to multicomponent  signaling complexes. Initiation of apoptotic events depends on  the ability of the signaling complexes to generate an active protease.  The mechanism of activation of the caspases that constitute the  different apoptosis-signaling complexes can be explained by an  unusual property of the caspase zymogens to autoprocess to an active  form. This autoprocessing depends on intrinsic activity that resides in  the zymogens of the initiator caspases. We review evidence for a  hypothesis—the induced-proximity model—that describes how the first  proteolytic signal is produced after adapter-mediated clustering of  initiator caspase zymogens.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1186,https://www.pnas.org/content/96/20/10964.short,13583829103680727596,/scholar?cites=13583829103680727596,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/96/20/10964.full.pdf,0,0,0
39227,Viral inhibition of inflammation: cowpox virus encodes an inhibitor of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme,1992,Caroline A Ray and Roy A Black and Shirley R Kronheim and Teresa A Greenstreet and Paul R Sleath and Guy S Salvesen and David J Pickup,69.0,Cell,4,597-604,Cell Press,Cowpox virus effectively inhibits inflammatory responses against viral infection in the chick embryo. This study demonstrates that one of the viral genes necessary for this inhibition. the crmA gene (a cytokine response modifier gene). encodes a serpin that is a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme. This serpin can prevent the proteolytic activation of interleukin-1β. thereby suppressing an interleukin-1β response to infection. However. the modification of this single cytokine response is not sufficient to inhibit inflammatory responses. This suggests that cowpox virus encodes several cytokine response modifiers that act together to inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection. These viral countermeasures to host defenses against infection may contribute significantly to the pathology associated with poxvirus infections.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1173,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009286749290223Y,16841104351222793030,/scholar?cites=16841104351222793030,,,0,0,0

The Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in and promotes anoikis. This activation requires caspase activity. We presently report that a DEVD motif–specific caspase that cleaves MEKK-1 specifically is activated when cells lose matrix contact. This cleavage is required for the activation of the kinase activity. When overexpressed. the MEKK-1 cleavage product stimulates apoptosis; the wild-type. full-length MEKK-1 sensitizes cells to anoikis; and a cleavage-resistant mutant of MEKK-1 partially protects cells against anoikis. The cleavage-resistant or kinase-inactive mutants also prevent caspase-7 from being activated completely. Thus. caspases can induce apoptosis by activating MEKK-1. which in turn activates more caspase activity. comprising a positive feedback loop.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,605,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400803396,4771231415140841273,/scholar?cites=4771231415140841273,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867400803396,0,0,0

BID contains eight α helices where two central hydrophobic helices are surrounded by six amphipathic ones. The fold resembles pore-forming bacterial toxins and shows similarity to BCL-XL although sequence homology to BCL-XL is limited to the 16-residue BH3 domain. Furthermore. we modeled a complex of BCL-XL and BID by aligning the BID and BAK BH3 motifs in the known BCL-XL–BAK BH3 complex. Additionally. we show that the overall structure of BID is preserved after cleavage by Caspase 8.

We used site‐directed mutagenesis of BIR2 and its linker to determine the mechanism of executioner caspase inhibition by XIAP. We show that the BIR2 domain contributes substantially to inhibition of executioner caspases. A surface groove on BIR2. which also binds to Smac/DIABLO. interacts with a neoepitope generated at the N‐terminus of the caspase small subunit following activation. Therefore. BIR2 uses a two‐site interaction mechanism to achieve high specificity and potency for inhibition.

Physiologic. and sometimes pathologic. cell death – apoptosis – is driven by activation of a family of proteases known as the caspases. present in almost all nucleated animal cells. The enzymatic properties of these proteases are governed by a dominant specificity for substrates containing Asp. and by the use of a Cys side chain for catalyzing peptide bond cleavage. The primary specificity for Asp turns out to be very rare among proteases. and currently the only other known mammalian proteases with the same primary specificity is the physiological caspase activator granzyme B. Like most other proteases. the caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens whose activation requires limited proteolysis or binding to co-factors.

Dordrecht,The main effectors of apoptosis encompass proteases from the caspase family. which reside as latent precursors in most nucleated animal cells. The apoptotic caspases constitute a minimal two-step signaling pathway. The apical (initiator) caspases are activated within oligomeric signaling complexes in response to apoptotic stimuli. Their mechanism of activation probably results from proximity-induced clustering to the dimeric active forms. Once activated. the apical caspases directly activate the executioner (effector) caspases by limited proteolytic cleavage. The distinct activation mechanisms explain how an apoptotic stimulus is converted to proteolytic activity. and how this activity is amplified to allow for limited proteolysis of the dozens of protein substrates whose cleavage is required for efficient apoptosis.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,279,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6554-5_2,16545497029838955970,/scholar?cites=16545497029838955970,,,0,0,0

For the initiator caspases. this occurs through dimerization of monomeric zymogens at an activating complex. Recent studies have suggested that FLIPL [FLICE-like inhibitory protein. long form; FLICE is FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein)-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme]. previously thought to act solely as an inhibitor of caspase-8 activation. can under certain circumstances function to enhance caspase activation. Using an in vitro induced-proximity assay. we demonstrate that activation of caspases-8 and -10 occurs independently of cleavage of either the caspase or FLIPL. FLIPL activates caspase-8 by forming heterodimeric enzyme molecules with substrate specificity and catalytic activity indistinguishable from those of caspase-8 homodimers.

The use of a Cys side chain as a nucleophile during peptide bond hydrolysis is common to several protease families. However. the primary specificity for Asp turns out to be very rare among protease families throughout biotic kingdoms. Of all known mammalian proteases only the caspase activator granzyme B. a serine protease. has the same primary specificity.

39307,Regulated cell death: signaling and mechanisms,2014,Avi Ashkenazi and Guy Salvesen,30.0,,,337-356,Annual Reviews,Cell turnover is a fundamental feature in metazoans. Cells can die passively. as a consequence of severe damage to their structural integrity. or actively. owing to a more confined biological disruption such as DNA damage. Passive cell death is uncontrolled and often harmful to the organism. In contrast. active cell death is tightly regulated and serves to support the organism's life. Apoptosis—the primary form of regulated cell death—is relatively well defined. Necroptosis—an alternative. distinct kind of regulated cell death discovered more recently—is less well understood. Apoptosis and necroptosis can be triggered either from within the cell or by extracellular stimuli. Certain signaling components. including several death ligands and receptors. can regulate both processes. Whereas apoptosis is triggered and executed via intracellular proteases called caspases. necroptosis is suppressed by caspase activity.

A Wiley Company,The basic mechanisms that underlie neurodegenerative diseases are unknown. Loss of function of specific regions of the brain is due to incapacitation of cells that constitute those regions. Cells can simply stop functioning normally (neurons may cease to transmit signals). or they may die. There is now evidence that the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases is due to inappropriate apoptosis. This being the case. an understanding of the mediators of apoptosis. their identities. and their role in orchestrating death would be a vital step toward remedying the diseases. The central components of apoptotic pathways. proteases of the caspase family. are present in latent forms in all nucleated cells.

Activation relies on adaptor-induced dimerization of monomeric caspase-8 and is followed by specific limited autoproteolysis of the linker which separates the two subunits of the catalytic domain. However. the role of this autoproteolysis. which directly activates executioner caspases-3 and -7. is unknown for the apical caspase-8. We have generated linker mutants of caspase-8 that can be proteolyzed in a controlled manner by thrombin or tobacco etch mosaic virus protease. and we use these to define the role of proteolysis in the activation and stability of the enzyme.

The treatment of proMMP-1 (M (r)= 52.000) with proteinases or APMA converted the zymogen to M (r)= 43.000. but it exhibited only 14-25% of the maximal activity. Incubation of a partially active MMP-1 with MMP-3 resulted in rapid. full activation by generating the 41.000-M (r) MMP-1 with Phe81 as the NH2-terminus. MMP-3 directly activated proMMP-1 by cleaving the Gln80-Phe81 bond. but this reaction was extremely slow. indicating that the Gln80-Phe81 bond is not readily available to MMP-3 in the native proMMP-1 molecule. ProMMP-2 (M (r)= 72.000) was activated only by APMA. but not by proteinases. The activation by APMA was rapid and generated an active MMP-2 of M (r) 68.000. but the enzymic activity declined rapidly after activation by autolysis.

It is required to allow mouse embryo survival. and the survival of hematopoietic cells during their development and activation. Classic models in which caspase-8 is depleted or inhibited frequently result in inhibition of apoptosis. and conversion to death through a necrotic pathway. This bewildering switch is now known to be driven by activation of a pathway dependent on protein kinases of the RIP family. which engage a pathway known as necroptosis. If caspase-8 does not control this pathway. necrotic death results. The pro-apoptotic and pro-survival functions of caspase-8 are regulated by a specific interaction with the pseudo-caspase cFLIP. and it is thought that the heterocomplex between these two partners alters the …,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC,116,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532314000463,3656146717600716462,/scholar?cites=3656146717600716462,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099255/,0,0,0

Although the importance of granzyme B has been established by gene ablation experiments. biochemical events initiated by the granzyme remain enigmatic. We show here that exposure of Jurkat cells to granzyme B and perforin results in cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to an apoptotic 89 kDa fragment and to lesser amounts of a 64 kDa fragment.

Synthesized as inactive zymogens. it is essential that the caspases remain inactive until the death signal is received. It is known for the downstream executioner caspases-3 and-7 that the activation event is proteolytic cleavage. and this had been assumed to apply to the initiator caspases as well. However. recent studies conducted on caspases-2.-8 and-9 have challenged this tenet of caspase activation.

Here we report a novel strategy for the identification of the signature of proteolytic cleavage events based on quantitative proteomics. Lysine residues in proteins are blocked by guanidination so that free N-terminals can be labeled with amine-specific iTRAQ reagents. The quantitative nature of iTRAQ reagents allows us to distinguish N-terminals newly formed by proteolytic treatment (neoepitopes) from original N-terminals in proteins. Proteins are digested with trypsin and analyzed using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Peptides labeled with iTRAQ reagents are distinguished from other peptides by exhibiting intense signature ions in tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

It has become increasingly clear that the heterodimer of caspase-8 with the long isoform of cellular FLIP (FLIPL) fulfills these pro-survival functions of caspase-8. FLIPL. a catalytically defective caspase-8 paralog. can interact with caspase-8 to activate its catalytic function. The caspase-8/FLIPL heterodimer has a restricted substrate repertoire and does not induce apoptosis. In essence. caspase-8 heterodimerized with FLIPL prevents the receptor interacting kinases RIPK1 and -3 from executing the form of cell death known as necroptosis.

Using an unbiased caspase-trapping technique in vivo. we isolated active caspase-9 from ischemic rat brain within 1 h of reperfusion. Pathogenic relevance of active caspase-9 was shown by intranasal delivery of a novel cell membrane-penetrating highly specific inhibitor for active caspase-9 at 4 h postreperfusion (hpr).

We obtained a detailed substrate fingerprint for recombinant forms of the enzymes revealing that PfM1AAP exhibits a very broad substrate tolerance. capable of efficiently hydrolyzing neutral and basic amino acids. while PfM17LAP has narrower substrate specificity and preferentially cleaves bulky. hydrophobic amino acids. The substrate library was also exploited to profile the activity of the native aminopeptidases in soluble cell lysates of P. falciparum malaria.   Conclusions/Significance This data showed that PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP are responsible for majority of the aminopeptidase activity in these extracts. These studies provide specific substrate and mechanistic information important for understanding the function of these aminopeptidases and could be exploited in the design of new inhibitors to specifically target these for anti-malaria treatment.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC,64,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031938,4712076932830810801,/scholar?cites=4712076932830810801,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031938,0,0,0

N-acetylglutamate (NAG) is an essential allosteric activator of carbamylphosphate synthetase I (CPSI). the first enzyme in the urea cycle. NAG synthase (NAGS; EC 2.3.1.1) catalyses the formation of NAG from glutamate and acetyl-CoA in liver and intestinal mitochondria. This enzyme is supposed to regulate ureagenesis by producing variable amounts of NAG. thus modulating CPSI activity. Moreover. inherited deficiencies in NAGS have been associated with hyperammonaemia. probably due to the loss of CPSI activity. Although the existence of the NAGS protein in mammals has been known for decades. the gene has remained elusive.

Dissecting the roles of individual NSPs in humans is problematic because neutrophils are end-stage cells with a short half-life and minimal ongoing protein synthesis. To gain insight into the regulation of NSP activity we have generated a small-molecule chemical toolbox consisting of activity-based probes with different fluorophore-detecting groups with minimal wavelength overlap and highly selective natural and unnatural amino acid recognition sequences. The key feature of these activity-based probes is the ability to use them for simultaneous observation and detection of all four individual NSPs by fluorescence microscopy. a feature never achieved in previous studies.

Increasing knowledge about the physiological and pathological roles of cysteine proteases is bringing them into the focus of drug discovery research. These proteases have rather short active-site clefts. comprising three well defined substrate-binding subsites (S2. S1 and S1') and additional broad binding areas (S4. S3. S2' and S3'). The geometry of the active site distinguishes cysteine proteases from other protease classes. such as serine and aspartic proteases. which have six and eight substrate-binding sites respectively. Exopeptidases (cathepsins B. C. H and X). in contrast with endopeptidases (such as cathepsins L. S.

Determining all relevant protein substrates of caspases remains a challenging task. Over 1500 caspase substrates have been discovered in the human proteome according to published data and new substrates are discovered on a daily basis. To aid the discovery process we developed a caspase cleavage prediction method using the recently published curated MerCASBA database of experimentally determined caspase substrates and a Random Forest classification method. On both internal and external test sets. the ranking of predicted cleavage positions is superior to all previously developed prediction methods. The in silico predicted caspase cleavage positions in human proteins are available from a relational database: CaspDB. Our database provides information about potential cleavage sites in a verified set of all human proteins collected in Uniprot and their orthologs. allowing for tracing of cleavage motif conservation. It also provides information about the positions of disease-annotated single nucleotide polymorphisms. and posttranslational modifications that may modulate the caspase cleaving efficiency.,True,xke6pR0AAAAJ:RXiHnyRawswC,46,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110539,9095914049706358662,/scholar?cites=9095914049706358662,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110539,0,0,0

The great philosopher Karl Popper is famous for his attempt to reject the classical observationalist/inductivist approach to science and to advance empirical falsification in its place: scientists can never prove anything. they can only disprove a thing.

Identifying endogenous substrates for caspase-8 by using integrated bioinformatics and biological approaches is required to delineate the diverse roles of this caspase. We describe a number of novel putative caspase-8 substrates using the Prediction of Protease Specificity (PoPS) program. one of which is histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7). HDAC7 is cleaved faster than any other caspase-8 substrate described to date. It is also cleaved in primary CD4+CD8+ thymocytes undergoing extrinsic apoptosis. By using naturally occurring caspase inhibitors that have evolved exquisite specificity at concentrations found within the cell. we could unequivocally assign the cleavage activity to caspase-8.
