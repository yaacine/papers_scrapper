To determine the antibiotic prescribing habits for pulpal and periapical pathology among dentists in Hyderabad city. India. Methodology. A total of 246 questionnaires were distributed to all the dentists registered with the local dental branch. Demographic details and questions regarding type and dosage of antibiotics prescribed for allergic and nonallergic patients were recorded. Inferential statistics were performed. and                  was considered statistically significant. Results. The response rate for the study was 87.8%. Around 148 (68.5%) of respondents regularly prescribed antibiotics for endodontic management. The first antibiotic of choice for patients with no history of medical allergies was a combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. followed by amoxicillin alone (29.1%). The first antibiotic of choice in case of allergy to penicillin was erythromycin. Necrotic pulp with acute apical periodontitis with swelling and moderate/severe preoperative symptom was the condition most commonly identified for antibiotic therapy (92.1%). Conclusion. The present study reveals that the overall antibiotic prescribing practices among this group of dentists were quite high. and there is a need for more educational initiatives to rationalize the use of antibiotics in dentistry.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:FepLwMwnKBMC,35,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aps/2013/537385/abs/,7399939161304821256,/scholar?cites=7399939161304821256,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/aps/2013/537385/abs/,0,0,0

Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The ""Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis"" (Weka). an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs.

Various theories have been put forward toward the development of Eagle syndrome. Depending on the underlying pathogenetic mechanism and the anatomical structures compressed or irritated by the elongated styloid process. symptoms vary greatly. ranging from cervicofacial pain to cerebral ischemia. Because the symptoms are variable and nonspecific. patients land up in different clinics for treatment. In the present case. the victim had previous episode of unconsciousness along with frequent headache for which she visited various clinics on numerous occasions.

The spike used had a sharp tip. spherically blunt tip. and a flat aerospike tip. It is observed that use of a sharp spike leads to the reduction in drag by about 30%. whereas blunt or aerospike having the same length leads to about 45% reduction. Increasing the length of sharp spike reduces the drag. In general. the agreement between the computed and experimental result is found to be good. Flow unsteadiness has been captured through experiment and computation. An increase in unsteadiness is observed to be of the order of 20 dB due to the adoption of a spike. and the influence is mainly in the region close to spike and the main body.

Flow phenomena such as dynamic stall. flutter. and gust response all require appropriate experimental modeling in order to fully investigate the flow details. Many unsteady testing situations involve the dynamic movement of a model in the wind-tunnel test section. These methods provide suitable simulation of moving bodies in a fluid; however. the effects due to varying flow conditions are not adequately modeled by model movement alone due to viscous and compressibility effects.

The issue is addressed in a passive way by designing the fuel cell with low thermal conductivity materials. Use of low thermal conductivity materials for cell fabrication led to higher cell temperatures. The liquid water formation was delayed to high current densities due to increase in saturation pressure and higher buoyancy induced flow. Peak power density was increased by 36% and the limiting current density was increased by 37.5% when the cell was redesigned with low thermal conductivity materials.

Steel braces of SCBFs are expected to undergo large inelastic axial deformations in order to provide an adequate level of structural ductility and hysteretic energy dissipation under cyclic loading. The energy dissipation capacity and ductility of SCBFs largely depend on the slenderness ratio and width-to-thickness ratio of braces. The main objective of this study is to find an optimum range of these parameters for braces of hollow circular steel (HCS) sections in order to achieve the enhanced seismic performance of SCBFs. A finite element (FE) study has been conducted on a wide range of values of these parameters using a software package ABAQUS.

84167,Competitive small and medium enterprises: A diagnostic to help design smart SME policy,2013,Parth S Tewari and David Skilling and Pranav Kumar and Zack Wu,,,,,World Bank. Washington. DC,Small and medium-sized enterprises             (SMEs) account for a lion's share of the enterprises in             most economies and are also thought to be an engine of new             growth and innovation. The focus of this paper is to take             the insights on SME mix and segments to practical             implications for developing countries around the world. The             paper attempts to do this by providing a diagnostic approach             that client countries and regions can use to assess their             SME sectors and tease out firms' contribution to the             local economy. Guidelines and specific examples of policies             based on the insights in the paper have been provided.             Lastly. the paper includes some areas of future research             that are required on the subject. This paper proceeds in             three steps. The first is to better understand the economic             contribution of SMEs. This analysis complements the existing             policy focus and takes it further to direct attention to a             more specific set of growth drivers to enable the firms that             matter disproportionately. the competitive SMEs. while             remaining inclusive and avoiding market distortion. The             second step is to develop a perspective on how best to             complement the policy focus on competitive SMEs with that on             larger firms. Policy-makers need to structure policy             appropriately to develop a healthy eco-system of firms. The             third step is to make this analysis actionable by             policy-makers. This paper provides an initial SME policy             diagnostic. A better understanding of how to encourage SME             growth has the potential to make a …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:tfFR5hCbSrAC,23,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/16636,17748905040800861063,/scholar?cites=17748905040800861063,,https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/16636/825160WP0P148100Box379861B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
84168,Structural behavior of bubble deck slab,2012,P Prabhu Teja and P Vijay Kumar and S Anusha and CH Mounika and Purnachandra Saha,,,,383-388,IEEE,Bubble deck slab is a method of virtually eliminating all concrete from the middle of a floor slab. which is not performing any structural function. thereby dramatically reducing structural dead weight. High density polyethylene hollow spheres replace the in-effective concrete in the centre of the slab. thus decreasing the dead weight and increasing the efficiency of the floor. By introducing the gaps leads to a 30 To 50% lighter slab which reduces the loads on the columns. walls and foundations. and of course of the entire building. The advantages are less energy consumption - both in production. transport and carrying out. less emission - exhaust gases from production and transport. especially CO 2 .

84184,Permeability effects on winter-time natural convection in gravel embankments,1999,Douglas J Goering and Pankaj Kumar,,,,455-464,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Winter-time natural convection in open-graded gravel embankments has been suggested as a technique which can be used to provide passive cooling and thereby avoid thaw- settlement of roadways located in permafrost areas (Goering and Kumar [1]). The present paper examines the ability of these embankments to maintain the structural integrity of thaw-unstable permafrost which often underlies roadway or airport embankments in northern climates. As a result of low ambient temperatures acting on the embankment surface during winter months. an unstable density stratification develops in the embankment. Buoyancy-driven convection of the pore air occurs in reaction to the density gradient. The convection enhances the upward transport of heat out of the embankment during winter months. thus cooling the lower portions of the embankment and underlying foundation soil. During summer months the …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:aNch6Af-aFkC,22,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0104203,2856110456596773244,/scholar?cites=2856110456596773244,,,0,0,0

The efficacy of the dressing technique was proven by a study of 39 cases. including 12 cases with exposed bone and tendon (July 2004 to March 2005) where wounds were prepared by LAD II and split-thickness skin grafting with LAD II. Efficacy of LAD was assessed by observing the time to development of healthy granulation tissue and by the quantity of graft take under LAD by day 10. For the wounds studied. an average of 1.51 LAD (range 1-3) was required to develop granulation tissue fit for skin grafting. The average number of days required to prepare the wound under LAD was 17.05 days. An average of 1.03 LAD was required for covering the wound with skin graft (range 1 to 2; median 1) and overall graft take under LAD was 99.87%. In 24 of 39 wounds. an average of 33.83 days of treatment with conventional dressing (range 7 to 120 days; median 22.5 days) could not achieve healthy granulation. When these wounds were switched to LAD. wound preparation took an average of 13.2 days (range 3 to 32 days; median 12 days).

In V2V communication or we can also called VANET ie vehicular ad-hoc network; a vehicle can communicate to its neighboring vehicles even in the absence of a central Base Station. The concept of this direct communication is to send vehicle safety messages one-to-one or oneto-many vehicles via wireless connection. Such messages are usually short in length and have very short lifetime in which they must reach at the destination. The Inter-vehicle communication system is an adhoc network with high mobility and changing number of nodes. where mobile nodes dynamically create temporary networks and transferring messages from one node to others by using multiple hops due to limitation of short range. The routing in vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) has attracted many attentions during the last few years. So in this paper we are focusing on the routing concept for the VANET ie principles for routing. decomposition of the routing function and requirement. The data delivery through Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks is challenging since it must efficiently handle rapid topology changes and a fragmented network.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:w2Aknop99M4C,20,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yugal_Kumar/publication/50199329_A_Survey_on_Routing_Mechanism_and_Techniques_in_Vehicle_to_Vehicle_Communication_VANET/links/02e7e517dfdefe8ade000000/A-Survey-on-Routing-Mechanism-and-Techniques-in-Vehicle-to-Vehicle-Communication-VANET.pdf,5405807860470458533,/scholar?cites=5405807860470458533,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yugal_Kumar/publication/50199329_A_Survey_on_Routing_Mechanism_and_Techniques_in_Vehicle_to_Vehicle_Communication_VANET/links/02e7e517dfdefe8ade000000/A-Survey-on-Routing-Mechanism-and-Techniques-in-Vehicle-to-Vehicle-Communication-VANET.pdf,0,0,0

This material shares a similar layered tetragonal structure with iron-based superconductors. with Fe square planar sheets forming from the edge-sharing iron antimony tetrahedral network. CuFeSb differs remarkably from Fe-based superconductors in the height of anion Z anion from the Fe plane; Z Sb for CuFeSb is∼ 1.84 Å. much larger than Z As (1.31–1.51 Å) in FeAs compounds and Z Te (∼ 1.77 Å) in Fe 1+ y Te. In contrast with the metallic antiferromagnetic (AFM) or superconducting state of iron pnictides and chalcogenides under current studies. CuFeSb exhibits a metallic. ferromagnetic (FM) state with T c= 375 K.

84225,Optimal design of reversible parity preserving new full adder/full subtractor,2017,P Kiran Kumar and P Prasad Rao and Kakarla Hari Kishore,,,,368-373,IEEE,The widely using CMOS technology implementing with irreversible logic will hit a scaling limit beyond 2020 and the major limiting factor is increased power dissipation. The irreversible logic is replaced by reversible logic to decrease the power dissipation. The devices implemented with reversible logic gates will have demand for the upcoming future computing technologies as they consumes less power. Reversible logic has applications in Low Power VLSI. Quantum Computing. Nanotechnology and Optical computing. This paper proposes the design of a optimal fault tolerant Full adder / Full subtractor. For this logic circuit input parity and output parity is same hence it is called parity preserving circuit. The proposed method require less complexity. less hardware. minimum number of gates. minimum number of garbage inputs and minimum number of constant inputs than existing methods.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:8p8iYwVyaVcC,18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7856019/,7016622546191785488,/scholar?cites=7016622546191785488,,http://www.msrprojectshyd.com/upload/academicprojects/b55d6046644e5eec25939bf387ac83d320.pdf,0,0,0

A systematic study of three confinement ratios. four Bond numbers and two Morton numbers has been conducted. A GPU implemented VOF numerical algorithm on a Cartesian collocated grid with an improved method to handle the surface tension force has been developed. A three-dimensional geometry construction method with a piecewise linear interpolation scheme for approximating the interface segments is used to compute the interface shape and liquid volume flux from the cell faces. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved with a space–time second-order accurate fractional step numerical scheme. The surface tension force is treated as a pressure gradient and an additional Poisson equation is solved.

The tunnel is classified as anterior or posterior. depending upon its course in relation to the ascending aorta. An origin above the sinotubular ridge differentiates the tunnel from an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva. and the absence of myocardial branches differentiates it from a coronary–cameral fistula. Clinical presentation ranges from an asymptomatic precordial murmur to congestive heart failure. The embryologic background and pathogenesis of this lesion are attributable either to an aneurysmal dilation of the sinus nodal artery or to a congenital weakness of the aortic media. In either circumstance. progressive enlargement of the tunnel and ultimate rupture into the low-pressure right atrium could occur under the influence of the systemic pressure.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:b15ltGHXyxQC,18,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2929865/,46148379497449031,/scholar?cites=46148379497449031,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2929865/,0,0,0

Acute urinary retention in a child is rare. Haematocolpos can cause a mechanical obstruction. resulting in acute urinary retention. Case Report. A 12-year-old girl presented to the surgical department with a one-day history of acute urinary retention and suprapubic tenderness. She had not started menses but had described period-like pains every month for the past six months. On examination. she had a palpable bladder with over 500 mls of residual urine and a bluish-grey bulge posterior to her urethral meatus. An US scan showed a large mass posterior to her bladder resembling a haematocolpos. and this was confirmed with an MRI scan. She was catheterised and eventually underwent a hymenectomy using a cruciate incision. She made a good recovery postoperatively. Conclusion. In the case of a peripubertal female presenting with acute urinary retention. haematocolpos should be considered as a diagnosis.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:7XCffrwrS2sC,17,https://www.hindawi.com/crim/urology/2013/731019/,17516899371253525233,/scholar?cites=17516899371253525233,,https://www.hindawi.com/crim/urology/2013/731019/,0,0,0

Biological control is an ecofriendly approach in the effective management of crop diseases. Trichoderma viride is an important soil-borne fungus. which play an important role in antagonism by secretion of different hydrolytic enzymes. Black gram is an important pulse crop world-wide and its yield is severely affected by Macrophomina root rot. Abiotic stresses greatly influence the performance of biocontrol agents. T. viride was evaluated for its in vitro abiotic stress tolerance ability and its field bioefficacy against root rot disease in blackgram. Growth of T. viride decreased with increasing in salinity. temperature and drought. T. viride effectively inhibited the growth of R. solani (45%) and M. phaseolina (40%) under in vitro conditions. T. viride was compatible with 0.25% mancozeb. 1.0% copper oxy chloride and metalaxyl.

It is not fortuitous; it is systematic’(Bonacich and Cheng 1984). 1 Migration from India has taken place from the very dawn of civilization. The result of such a tendency among mankind is there for everyone to see. There is hardly any part of the earth where Indians are not found today. Earlier. migration used to be limited to merchants and sailors. But over the past two centuries. it has acquired a very different magnitude and pattern. Present-day migration is largely a continuation of the pattern which began about two centuries ago. The presence of the British and the demand for cheap labour in other parts of the empire lay at the root of the phenomenon of migration in those days. a phenomenon which has continued till date. When we think of the beginning of the new era of migration from India. we think back to the abolition of slavery in 1834. an incident which marked the beginning of the export of indentured labour from India as a replacement for the slaves thus liberated. who had been working in capitalist farms.

84269,New methodology for estimating PCU on multi lane urban roads under mixed traffic scenario based on area occupancy,2017,Pallav Kumar and Shriniwas S Arkatkar and Gaurang J Joshi and Ashish Dhamaniya,,,17-03248,,,This research presents a new methodology of PCU estimation using area occupancy as measure. particularly for heterogeneous and non-lane based traffic prevailing on multilane urban roads. especially under Asian specific conditions. The methodology presented here can also be applied to lane based traffic using time occupancy as measure of PCU estimation. In view of studying PCU values for non-lane based heterogeneous traffic scenario. two mid-block study sections on multi-lane urban roads in Indian city: Delhi (eight-lane divided carriageway) and Mumbai (ten-lane divided carriageway) were identified. A novel approach of matrix-solution to area-occupancy based simultaneous equations provides simplified but yet unique/optimized PCU values for different vehicle classes considering prevailing roadway and traffic conditions. It is found that increase in number of lanes or carriageway width has significant increasing effect on PCU values of vehicle categories. Further. the mixed-traffic flow expressed in PCU/hour/direction is validated with base-traffic flow under varying traffic-flow conditions. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) after comparison was found to be 8% and 9% for Delhi and Mumbai road sections. respectively. thereby indicating the robustness of the developed concept. For examining the accuracy of the proposed method at. speed-flow relationships are developed and compared on same set of axes using:(i) proposed unique (or optimized) PCU;(ii) dynamic PCU values (using most accepted speed-area ratio concept) and;(iii) PCU values from IRC-106. at 5-minute interval aggregation level.

Automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy. Filling is a task carried out by a machine that packages liquid products such as cold drinks or water. In past. humans were the main method for controlling a system. More recently. electricity has been used for control and electrical control is based on microcontrollers for various purposes like medicines. pharmaceutical plants. chemical plants etc. There microcontrollers control the complete working of the system. It is common to use microcontrollers to make simple logical control decision. The automation in bottle filling industry comes with increased electrical components. Essential requirements of each component in the system is important to be studied in ordered to understand how each part works in coordination with other parts in the system.

In this paper we have introduced a novel visual cryptographic technique. This method is applicable for both Bitmap Color and Grayscale images. This method uses the concept of Residual Number System (RNS) based on Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for share creation and share stacking of a given image. First. Secret image is hidden in cover image to get stego-image; a pixel (8 bit) of a Stego-image is taken and added with an eight bit key to get a cipher pixel. The algorithm used is additive mod 255. The key is generated using a pseudo random number generator and Mixed Key Generation technique. After encryption the cipher pixel is mapped into a Residue Number System of ‘n’Shares. These ‘n’Shares are stored or transmitted to the destination. The proposed approach like any other visual cryptographic approach is very secure. efficient. reliable. fast and easy to implement.

Sci,2,338-46,,Stem cuttings of Populus robusta Schneid. were treated with 0. 10 and 100 mg/1 each of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). indole-butyric acid (IBA). triiodo-benzoic acid (TIBA) and carbolic acid (CA) at the apical and basal ends after 0. 7 or 14 days. Observations on rooting. callus formation and callus differentiation were recorded. Auxins increased rooting. the effect being more marked with IBA than IAA. and when applied on day 0 rather than after 7 or 14 days. Callus was formed at the apical end of the cuttings by treatment of that end on day 0 with water or any other regulatory substance. This also occurred when the basal end was treated with TIBA or CA. The amount of callus decreased with a delay in time of treatment. Callus developed on almost the whole length above the soil when cuttings were treated with 100 mg/1 IBA at the apical end. and below soil level when cuttings were treated at the basal ends. In contrast to this. callus formed by IAA remained confined to a small part of the end to which it was applied. While callus formed at the apical end by IBA differentiated into roots. that produced by TIBA or CA differentiated into shoots. The number of differentiating cells increased when the treatment was repeated. It is considered that callus is produced at a time when differentiation of cambial derivatives is not able to keep pace with cell-divisional activity and that a proper balance between the supply of auxin and assimilates is needed for organogenesis. A high sucrose to auxin ratio leads to the production of phloem. and a low sucrose to auxin ratio to xylem. which is necessary for vascularization of root primordia.

An emphasis is placed on understanding the transient deformation history. We study the effect of the Reynolds number. capillary number. and droplet to carrier fluid viscosity ratio on deformation. In the low Reynolds number limit. we expect the droplet deformation to be independent of Reynolds number. We examine moderate Reynolds numbers in the range of 10–100 and show that inertia plays a significant role in droplet deformation both in the magnitude of steady-state as well as transient deformations. For Reynolds numbers greater than 25. we observe non-monotonic deformation histories. At higher Reynolds numbers we also observe cavity regions forming at the trailing edge of the droplets. These cavity regions appear to be unstable due to their relatively high interfacial curvature …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:JXi_AgyUMBAC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301932214001396,6697506423431964511,/scholar?cites=6697506423431964511,,,0,0,0

METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhaled nitric oxide was utilized for the management of residual pulmonary hypertension in 24 children following surgical correction of their underlying heart defects. Their ages ranged from 15 days to 14 months (median 5 months). Pulmonary artery hypertension was diagnosed either by direct pulmonary artery pressure monitoring or by echocardiography. Inhaled nitric oxide was used electively in 22 patients when the ratio of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and mean systemic arterial pressure exceeded 0.5. In the remaining 2 patients. nitric oxide was used only to manage a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Inhaled nitric oxide was also used a second time in 2 patients who developed delayed pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Twenty-two patients showed an initial response to therapy and the pulmonary artery pressures dropped significantly. Of the patients on direct pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. a pulmonary artery to systemic artery pressure ratio below 0.3 on prolonged therapy was associated with a survival ratio of 4/6 (including 1 neurological death and one reoperation); that between 0.3 and 0.5 with a survival ratio of 3/4.

This paper presents an automated unsupervised cytoplasm segmentation approach which can effectively find the cytoplasm boundaries in overlapping cells. The proposed approach first segments the cell clumps from the cervical smear image and detects the nuclei in each cell clump. A modified Otsu method with prior class probability is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the cell clumps.

The results revealed that. to maintain existing customers is becoming more and more important. The reason for this development is based on the knowledge that long term related customers compare various offers against each other and choose the best one. Many reasons are identified as most important reasons for customer defection in a given service industry like banking. but the prominence of each factor depends upon the situation prevailing in each banking organization. The study suggests that. as consumer remains satisfied with a bank. they spread a positive word of mouth. which is very effective in case of services for attracting new customers. Longer the customer stays with a bank. the bank knows more about him. which enables it to offer customized services which make it difficult for the customer to defect. This may even provide opportunities to the bank to charge price premium by offering individualized services which may be difficult for the competitors to offer. Customer retention should be implemented in every organization/company. There exists a broad pallet of various instruments which can have a lasting effect.

World-wide. flood damages to agriculture. houses and public utilities amount to billions of dollars each year in addition to the loss of precious human and cattle lives. In majority of cases.‘flooding’is caused by a river over-spilling its banks. This can be due to excessive precipitation. combined with inadequate channel capacity. Over-spilling can also occur due to obstruction in or aggradation of the river bed. Flooding can also result from inadequate water way at rail and road crossings. or when there are encroachments in the flood plain. Flooding can also occur at confluences of streams when the main river is in high stage and backs up into the tributaries and areas there about. India is no exception as far as floods are concerned. Severe floods occur almost every year in one part of the country or the other causing tremendous loss of life. large scale damage to property and untold misery to millions of people.

The flow is induced by an infinite elastic sheet which is stretched along its own plane. The stretching/shrinking of the sheet is assumed to be proportional to the distance from the slit. The governing equations are reduced to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation by means of similarity transformation. The consequential nonlinear equation is solved analytically. Consequences show that the flow field can be divided into a near-field region and a far-field region. Suction on the surface plays an important role in the flow development in the near-field whereas the far-field is responsible mainly by stretching. The electromagnetic effect plays exactly the same role as the MHD. which is to reduce the …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:Lr5Uwm59ZTwC,12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-3588-0,9828332902477102604,/scholar?cites=9828332902477102604,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-3588-0,0,0,0

The application is challenging in part because of the lack of distinctive features to differentiate between denominations as well as the variability in the features for a given denomination. Although there are coin recognition algorithms documented in the literature. the applications are typically tested off-line with static images of the coins. In this paper. a MV-based system for on-line recognition and counting of Indian coins moving on a conveyor is evaluated.

The Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter is 20000. k-ω (SST) is used to model the turbulence. End tip effects are seen on free end finite cylinder. By studying the velocity defect flux (Q). tip effects are found to be independent of AR. They are however limited to 2D~ 3D for circular cantilever cylinder and 3D~ 4D for rectangular flat plate. Velocity defect is stronger for rectangular flat plate than that of circular cantilever (the range differs from 6.81% to 206.41%) suggesting a stronger vortical activities are present in the wake of rectangular flat plate.

London,This chapter reviews key theories relevant to the other Handbook chapters and also relevant to potential chapters not included here. Smith’s basic contention is that most voluntaristics scholars (Smith 2013) view relevant theory far too narrowly. seriously limited by (a) academic discipline blinders and also (b) avoidance of topics reflecting social deviance and/or social conflict.

84429,Relation between periodontal status and pre-cancerous condition (oral lichen planus): a pilot study,2016,Narendra Parkash Rai and Prafful Kumar and Shabil M Mustafa and Darshan D Divakar and Abdulaziz AL Kheraif and Ravikumar Ramakrishnaiah and Sajith Vellapally and MHN Dalati and Narashimha Reddy Parine and Sukumaran Anil,25,Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine,4,763-766,Wroclaw Medical University,Background. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic mucocutaneous disease mostly seen in middle aged and elderly females. Oral lichen planus can occur in different oral sites such as gingiva. labial. buccal mucosa and on the tongue. And can have an indirect effect on initiating periodontitis.Objectives. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the periodontal status of OLP patients and compare it with that of healthy controls. The presence of erosive lesions among gingival tissues makes oral hygiene procedures difficult to perform for obvious reasons. Plaque control and rigorous oral hygiene are primary requisites for the treatment of any oro-mucosal disease.Material and Methods. Thirty patients with the erosive and reticular form of OLP as a study group and 30 healthy subjects as a control group were selected. The periodontal status of all subjects including gingival index (GI). Russell’s periodontal index (PI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were evaluated in both groups. Finally. the data was analyzed by a paired t-test using SPSS software v. 22.Results. The mean values of GI. PI and BOP were observed to be higher in the study group compared to the control group. and this was statistically significant (p< 0.05). The results shown are suggestive that periodontal status was poor in the study group as compared to the control group.Conclusion. Further studies need to investigate periodontal status in oral lichen planus patients with larger sample size. and careful follow-up of these will assure an increase in the quality of life of these patients. The patient should be informed regarding the risk of periodontal problems in OLP and should be …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:hefNtdE4IMkC,10,http://www.advances.umed.wroc.pl/pl/article/2016/25/4/763/,6814257497938846705,/scholar?cites=6814257497938846705,,http://www.advances.umed.wroc.pl/pl/article/2016/25/4/763/,0,0,0

The earlier studies by the authors include conceiving the airfoil profile through genetic algorithm optimization followed by experimental aerodynamic characterization in terms of lift and drag coefficients. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the performance of Darrieus rotor with NTU-20-V airfoil in terms of power coefficient and torque coefficient for different Reynolds number and compare it with standard NACA0018 airfoil from which the new airfoil was derived. The computational exploration is anticipated to shed light on the flow characteristics with respect to NACA 0018 airfoil.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:ZXPVDZvx_usC,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8038559/,10923182857032922455,/scholar?cites=10923182857032922455,,,0,0,0

The main reasons for low yield are conventional blanket recommendation of fertilizers. lower nutrient-use efficiency and imbalance in the use of fertilizers. Recommendation of major nutrients. nitrogen. phosphorus. and potassium (NPK). based on quantitative approaches will augment sweet potato production per unit area by increasing the nutrient-use efficiency. The present study calibrated the Quantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS) model for the estimation of NPK requirements and fertilizers recommendations for different target yields of sweet potato.

Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is an extremely rare malignant adnexal tumor. which arises from syringocystadenoma papilliferum. To date. less than 30 cases of malignant SCACP have been reported. of which locoregional metastases were found in only four cases. Case Report. A 57-year-old female patient who presented to our Oncology Department with a recurrent malignant SCACP of the left labia along with right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of malignant SCACP with right inguinal lymph node metastases. Due to the fixity of the right inguinal nodes. neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered with Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil for four cycles. following which the primary tumor and the contralateral inguinal nodes regressed completely. Then definitive chemoradiation was delivered with five cycles of weekly Cisplatin and external beam pelvic irradiation up to a dose of 59.4 Gy. Patient is disease-free 11 months after treatment. Discussion. We here report the fifth case of malignant SCACP with locoregional metastases. This is the first case of malignant SCACP which has been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation. Although surgery has been used most commonly. chemoradiation may also have a role in the treatment of malignant SCACP. especially in cases of locoregional metastases.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:q2HS4OCVtYIC,9,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crionm/2015/638294/abs/,14629286127168692733,/scholar?cites=14629286127168692733,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crionm/2015/638294/abs/,0,0,0

84472,Visualization of clustered directed acyclic graphs with node interleaving,2009,Pushpa Kumar and Kang Zhang,,,,1800-1805,,Graph drawing and visualization represent structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. An important subset of graphs is directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). E-Spring algorithm. extended from the popular spring embedder model. eliminates node overlaps in clustered DAGs by modeling nodes as charged particles whose repulsion is controlled by edges modeled as springs. The drawing process needs to reach a stable state when the average distances of separation between nodes are near optimal. This paper presents an enhancement to E-Spring to introduce a stopping condition. which reduces equilibrium distances between nodes and therefore results in a significantly reduced area for DAG visualization. It imposes an upper bound on the repulsive forces between nodes based on graph geometry. The algorithm employs node interleaving to eliminate any residual node overlaps.

84474,Design. Implementation. and Evaluation of new MAC Protocols for Long Distance 802.11 Networks,2006,Pavan Kumar,,with Bhaskaran Raman,,,,802.11 MAC is based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and was designed to be used in an indoor environment where a small number of wireless nodes share a common channel. It has been shown in Digital Gangetic Plains project that 802.11 hardware can be used beyond its intended use of WLANs by connecting long distance wireless links spread over tens of kilometers. These links have been used to operate voice (telephone through Voice over IP) and video (telemedicine through Video over IP) applications. But the existing MAC protocols like CSMA/CA that operate on 802.11 hardware do not work well in these outdoor wireless networks because of hidden node problem. huge Round Trip Time (RTT) and unnecessary contention. In this thesis. we therefore motivate the need for design and development of new MAC protocols to operate on point-to-point and point-to-mulitpoint long distance links to obtain better performance and flexibility compared to CSMA/CA. This report describes the implementation of two new MAC protocols 2P and SRAWAN that are suited for these long distance 802.11 networks. SRAWAN is designed from scratch. Even though the design of 2P exists. a significant challenge here is the implementation of these protocols on the off-the-shelf 802.11 Atheros hardware to preserve cost benefits. We have implemented 2P and SRAWAN by exploiting the flexibilities in the HAL code and Madwifi driver of Atheros AR5212 chipsets. The report then presents experimental evaluation of 2P and SRAWAN. The outdoor experimental results on a network of two links show that 2P achieves …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:DtORCzn_ASQC,9,https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/braman/students/2006/pavan-report.pdf,11725418178342316575,/scholar?cites=11725418178342316575,,https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/braman/students/2006/pavan-report.pdf,0,0,0
84475,Spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates from conjunctival swabs.,2005,S Malhotra and DK Mehta and P Kumar,48,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,4,538-541,,Conjunctivitis is the most common disease of conjunctiva which occurs by exogenous or endogenous source. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the most common type of this infection for which emperical treatment is started without knowing the etiological agents because prior cultures are generally not taken. We conducted this survey to study the etiological agents of conjunctivitis in a total of 6763 swabs obtained over a period of four years (2001 to 2004). The prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was found to be 20.4% with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus (87.2%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.7%) and gram negative rods (E. coli+ Klebsiella spp.+ Pseudomonas spp.) in 8.1% swabs. For S. aureus. amikacin showed maximum sensitivity (73.2%) while for S. pneumoniae. cefotaxime (90.6%) and cefazolin (89%) were found to be highly sensitive drugs. For gram negative rods. ceftazidime (74.1%) and cefotaxime (67%) were found to be preferred options. Thus it is concluded that bacterial conjunctivitis in our hospital is predominated by S. aureus. The bacterial isolates obtained from conjunctiva have not yet attained a high level of antibiotic resistance and hence averts the need to unnecessarily start new/latest generations of antibiotic eyedrops or antibiotic combination which may lead to acquisition of resistance by these bacteria.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:rpSJNIKeXWsC,9,https://europepmc.org/article/med/16366121,1466506821118144425,/scholar?cites=1466506821118144425,,,0,0,0

As a result. the TAD system performs less in detecting anomalies. This paper introduces a novelty in the form of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Lossy-Count-based Topic Extraction (ANFIS-LCTE) for classification of anomalies in source and target traffic scenes.

Accordingly. a multiinstitutional initiative called'Map the Neighbourhood in Uttarakhand'(MANU) was conceptualised with the main objective of collecting primary data on damage through participation of local people (mainly students) using state-of-art tools and technologies of data collection and a mechanism to integrate the same with Bhuvan geo-portal (www. bhuvan. nrsc. gov. in) in near real-time. Geospatial analysis of crowd-sourced points with different themes has been carried out subsequently for providing inputs to restoration planning and for future developmental activities.

To date. 20 radio-tagged gharials have been tracked successfully throughout the annual seasonal cycle. monsoon and dry periods. for an average of 2+ years per animal. since June 2008 through May 2013. Individual gharials show different patterns of seasonal movement and residency. primarily dependent on size/age. Adult females move as far as 80-120 km each seasonal cycle to join dry season basking-breeding aggregations (> 60 adults). and to locate suitable nesting areas. In contrast. sub-adult gharials exhibit restricted movements. typically 10-30 km seasonally. and occupy seasonal residencies only 5-15 km in extent. Some sedentary sub-adults showed virtually no movements. either upstream or downstream.Gharial feed primarily during the monsoonal months of June through September. and bask daily for long periods during the winter months of November through February.

84520,Investigation of Improvement in Boiler Efficiency through Incorporation of Additional Bank of Tubes in the Economiser for Supercritical Steam Power Cycles,2012,P Ravindra Kumar and VR Raju and N Ravi Kumar and Ch V Krishna,4,International Journal of Engineering Research and Development,8,,,The major efficiency loss of a boiler is caused by the hot stack gases discharging to the atmosphere which is polluting the atmosphere and on other side Pollution Control Board is forcing the norms of Pollution levels in atmosphere. One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. Typically. on a high pressure water tube boiler. the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4%. depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler. the improvement is 2 to 3.5%. depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. A feedwater line. which serves the boiler. is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are some bank of tubes in economizer. There was a proposal from management to add another bank of tubes in the economizer so that there will be control of pollutants coming out from boiler. and to find how much feed water temperature raises both from subcritical and Supercritical operating conditions. An investigation is conducted on the effect of performance of the boiler by incorporating the additional bank of tubes in the space below the lower bank of tubes. The main idea is to extract maximum amount of heat from the flue gases and increase the heat pick up rate of the feed water outlet into the boiler. By assuming the additional bank of tubes. various heat transfer calculations are done and the reduction in the flue gas outlet temperature and increase in the feedwater outlet temperature …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:p9YawgimX9oC,8,https://www.academia.edu/download/30265639/O040894100.pdf,12987476456484811262,/scholar?cites=12987476456484811262,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30265639/O040894100.pdf,0,0,0

84528,Study of jets from rectangular nozzles with square grooves,2011,P Arun Kumar and SB Verma and S Elangovan,115,The Aeronautical Journal,1165,187-196,Cambridge University Press,An experimental study has been carried out to understand jet flow development from plain and grooved rectangular nozzles of aspect ratio 2: 1 using two-component hotwire anemometry. Grooves of square configuration (side 4mm) and length 5mm were introduced in the (i) minor-axis.(ii) major-axis and.(iii) in both minor-and majoraxes directions. The equivalent diameter of the plain rectangular nozzle is 37· 5mm. Studies were carried out for a nominal jet exit velocity of 20ms–1 and for Reynolds number based on equivalent diameter of 54.000. The introduction of grooves in either plane does not show any influence on the potential-core length but results in faster jet-decay thereafter. It is observed that the grooves when introduced in minor-axis direction inhibit the jet growth in that plane while promoting the jet growth along major-axis plane and hence. delays the phenomena of axis-switching. However when introduced in major-axis direction. the grooves promote jet growth along majoraxis plane while inhibiting jet-growth in minor-axis plane. Crosssectional contours of mean-velocity suggest that the grooves modify the process of overall jet development significantly in the plane in which they are introduced relative to the plain jet and hence. significantly affect the axis-switching location in each case.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:UWSlATeI89AC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Verma3/publication/264205011_Study_of_Jets_from_Rectangular_Nozzles_with_Square_Grooves/links/5652991608aeafc2aabac0e6/Study-of-Jets-from-Rectangular-Nozzles-with-Square-Grooves.pdf,17384272076028586919,/scholar?cites=17384272076028586919,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Verma3/publication/264205011_Study_of_Jets_from_Rectangular_Nozzles_with_Square_Grooves/links/5652991608aeafc2aabac0e6/Study-of-Jets-from-Rectangular-Nozzles-with-Square-Grooves.pdf,0,0,0
84529,An adaptive power efficient packet scheduling algorithm for WiMAX networks,2010,R Murali Prasad and P Satish Kumar,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1005.4268,,,,Admission control schemes and scheduling algorithms are designed to offer QoS services in 802.16/802.16 e networks and a number of studies have investigated these issues. But the channel condition and priority of traffic classes are very rarely considered in the existing scheduling algorithms. Although a number of energy saving mechanisms have been proposed for the IEEE 802.16 e. to minimize the power consumption of IEEE 802.16 e mobile stations with multiple real-time connections has not yet been investigated. Moreover. they mainly consider non real-time connections in IEEE 802.16 e networks. In this paper. we propose to design an adaptive power efficient packet scheduling algorithm that provides a minimum fair allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally minimizes the power consumption. In the adaptive scheduling algorithm. packets are transmitted as per allotted slots from different priority of traffic classes adaptively. depending on the channel condition. Suppose if the buffer size of the high priority traffic queues with bad channel condition exceeds a threshold. then the priority of those flows will be increased by adjusting the sleep duty cycle of existing low priority traffic. to prevent the starvation. By simulation results. we show that our proposed scheduler achieves better channel utilization while minimizing the delay and power consumption.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:rjBKtydo3wgC,8,https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4268,7099136893379434184,/scholar?cites=7099136893379434184,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.4268,0,0,0

Concrete elements exposed to fire experience temperature gradients and. as a result. undergo physical changes or spalling. thereby exposing steel reinforcement. The structural property of concrete that has been most widely studied as a function of temperature exposure is compressive strength. Relatively few studies have been undertaken on flexural strength of reinforced cement concrete (RCC) beams and their repair. Therefore. this study was carried out to generate experimental data on residual flexural strength of heated RCC beams and their strengthening using various repair techniques. A total of 25 RCC beams were cast with similar crosssectional details. length and grade of concrete and clear cover.

84538,Convective effects in air layers bound by cellular honeycomb arrays,2005,Pawan Kumar and ND Kaushika,,,,,CSIR,Rayleigh-Benard convection in a fluid (air) layer in presence of transparent cellular structure (honeycomb) is reviewed for application to the engineering design of transparent insulation materials devices. The explicit numerical computations of Rayleigh numbers of the characteristic equation at higher wave numbers corresponding to the onset of instability are carried out. Results highlight a new facet of theory that it can indeed be used to estimate the critical Rayleigh number. which corresponds to the layer bound by vertical walls of cellular structure. A relationship between wave number and aspect ratio of honeycomb structure is evolved. Subsequently the stability of inclined fluid layer is considered and base flow existence and the need for its consideration in terms of Nusselt number is discussed. An outline of governing equations of the square celled air temperature. vorticity. stream functions and velocity are presented and it is found that the Nusselt number has a value in the range 1-1.5 for a wide range of Rayleigh numbers in near critical Rayleigh regime. This range may be considered as a trade off region for the engineering design of honeycomb devices. Convection can be suppressed by varying the aspect ratio of honeycomb cell. Honeycomb structure of aspect ratio 10-15 seems suitable for suppression of convection in air layer of depth 5-20 cm for temperature difference (T)of 20 to 120°.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:-Z8x4v2cOtkC,8,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/5153,14811142872152601239,/scholar?cites=14811142872152601239,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/5153/1/JSIR%2064(8)%20602-612.pdf?utm_source=The_Journal_Database&trk=right_banner&id=1412020601&ref=43948d5a7035abf1a8b562d7c59c906d,0,0,0

Of that. Multimodal biometric authentication systems are gaining much popularity. In this paper. we propose a system that can be used in place of ATM cards. This ensures a sense of security as well as privacy to the user. Here. partial palmprint and partial palmvein are combined for identification of an individual. Partial palmprint matching is accomplished by recursive adjoint minutiae matching method where a coarse to fine matching technique is used. Maximum curvature method is used for extracting the vein pattern. The binarised patterns thus formed are used as templates. Palmvein matching is done using Hamming distance. Even after making the system multimodal. it is prone to spoof attacks. So in order to make the system more robust. image quality measures are used to classify the input image as real or fake.

Sci,2,290-292,,The interrelationship between the environments and plant diseases has been survived from last over two thousand years but the close relationship between the environment and disease suggested that climate change will cause modifications in the current phytosanitary scenario in each region (Chakraborty and Pangga 2004). Tomato is one of the most popular and widely grown vegetable in the world (Ara et al. 2009. Zdravkovic et al. 2011) and suffering from both biotic and abiotic stresses. Among the biotic stresses. tomato leaf curl virus disease (ToLCV) is transmitted by a vector whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). which has been first ranked among tomato diseases (Singh et al. 2010. Singh et al. 2013). Symptom of ToLCV has been encountered in many tomato fields in India and caused most devastating problem for its cultivation in all over the world. eg 23% in Nigeria. 50% in Sudan. 55-90% in Spain. 63% in Lebanon. 90% in India. 100% in Mediterranean (Maruthi et al. 2003). Epidemiological studies indicated that maximum incidence of ToLCV in the semi-tropical climatic zone of Egypt recorded beginning of spring and early summer (February-April). when tomato plants have just established (Maruthi et al. 2003). However. in Tanzania. both ToLCV symptoms and whitefly vector were reported during November to February (Nono-Womdim et al. 1996). The incidence of tomato leaf curl virus disease was recorded high in rainy season rather than winter season crop in all tomato growing states of India (Banerjee and Kalloo 1989).

84564,Age Classification Based On Integrated Approach,2014,Pullela SVVSR Kumar and Dr V Vijaya Kumar and Rampay Venkatarao,7,"IJ Image, Graphics and Signal Processing",,50-57,,The present paper presents a new age classification method by integrating the features derived from Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with a new structural approach derived from four distinct LBP’s (4-DLBP) on a 3 x 3 image. The present paper derived four distinct patterns called Left Diagonal (LD). Right diagonal (RD). vertical centre (VC) and horizontal centre (HC) LBP’s. For all the LBP’s the central pixel value of the 3 x 3 neighbourhood is significant. That is the reason in the present research LBP values are evaluated by comparing all 9 pixels of the 3 x 3 neighbourhood with the average value of the neighbourhood. The four distinct LBP’s are grouped into two distinct LBP’s. Based on these two distinct LBP’s GLCM is computed and features are evaluated to classify the human age into four age groups ie: Child (0-15). Young adult (16-30). Middle aged adult (31-50) and senior adult (> 50). The cooccurrence features extracted from the 4-DLBP provides complete texture information about an image which is useful for classification. The proposed 4-DLBP reduces the size of the LBP from 6561 to 79 in the case of original texture spectrum and 2020 to 79 in the case of Fuzzy Texture approach.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:ExNiBuTMO9IC,7,http://j.mecs-press.net/ijigsp/ijigsp-v6-n6/IJIGSP-V6-N6-7.pdf,16122461770657935491,/scholar?cites=16122461770657935491,,http://j.mecs-press.net/ijigsp/ijigsp-v6-n6/IJIGSP-V6-N6-7.pdf,0,0,0

The routing and scheduling problem for WiMAX networks is different from 802.11 based mesh networks and can be designed and operated separately. Standard problems in wireless systems include Bandwidth allocation and Connection Admission Control (CAC). In this paper we design a joint routing. scheduling and admission control protocol for WiMax networks. In the adaptive scheduling. packets are transmitted as per allotted slots from different priority of traffic classes adaptively. depending on the channel condition. A bandwidth estimation technique is combined with route discovery and route setup in order to find a best route. The admission control technique is based on the estimation of bandwidth utilization of each traffic class. with the constraint that the delay requirement of real-time flows should be satisfied. The current available bandwidth is estimated for all the nodes and for the new incoming flows. it estimates the requested bandwidth and decides to admit this new flow or not.

Flow phenomena such as dynamic stall. flutter. and gust response all require appropriate experimental modeling in order to fully investigate the flow details. Many unsteady testing situations involve the dynamic movement of a model in the wind tunnel test section. These methods provide suitable simulation of moving bodies in a fluid; however. the effects of varying flow conditions are not adequately modeled by model movement alone due to viscous and compressibility effects. Flow situations such as gust response or a rotor blade in forward flight require a wind tunnel where the test section velocity can be oscillated at an appropriate physical frequency. There are very few wind tunnels in existence that can achieve oscillatory flow. The Klebanoff-Saric Unsteady Wind Tunnel. recently …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:0SnApaDgcCoC,7,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2011-670,13969637980157962283,/scholar?cites=13969637980157962283,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Di_Peng5/publication/268565576_Unsteady_Compressible_Flow_on_a_NACA_0021_Airfoil/links/56fe044408aea6b77466f86b/Unsteady-Compressible-Flow-on-a-NACA-0021-Airfoil.pdf,0,0,0

SensAble’s PHANToM Omni and Desktop models have gained wide popularity among the researchers in Haptics community. Recent haptics application such as medical simulations. stroke rehabilitation. dental restorations. and others require attachments of additional equipments to the stylus of the Phantom in order to make it appear as realistic virtual environment. In any virtual reality application. the inertial and gravitational properties characterizing the haptic manipulator may represent a disturbance which can strongly affect the simulation realisms. In the scope of this research. we focus on the problem of compensating the apparent gravity acting on the end-effector. due to the gravitational contributions acting on the whole kinematic chain of the haptic device. In this paper. we present a kinematic and dynamic study of the PHANToM Omni Haptic interface and its implementation in gravity compensation technique. The kinematic analysis is carried out for the system and the dynamic analysis is carried out using the DeNOC methodology. The equations of motion and the expressions for the necessary torque at respective joints are established using the symbolic toolbox included in Matlab. The expression along with the necessary logic is implemented in the SensAble’s Open Haptics Toolkit (HDAPI) software interface where the gravity compensation technique is carried out. The gravity compensation worked well. eliminating the effects of gravity even at the edges of the device workspace.

Pusa ruby) crop namely. Early Vegetative Phase (EVP). 30 days old plants; Late Vegetative Phase (LVP). 45 days old plants; and Fruiting Phase (FP). 60 days old plants were exposed to ozone concentrations (75 ppb and 150 ppb) in closed top dynamic chambers for 12 days period. Ozone exposed tomato plants of all the three growth stages exhibited visible injury symptoms as chlorotic spots in variable intensity. Effect of ozone exposure on tomato crop plants was examined with respect to isoprene emission. growth and yield parameters. Enhancement in isoprene emission was observed from ozone exposed tomato plants as compared to unexposed plants. In exposed plants of early vegetative phase isoprene emission was 127% and 187% higher immediately after (within 1 hr) 75 ppb and 150 ppb ozone exposure respectively as compared to unexposed plants. Significant (p≤0.001) reduction in ozone exposed plants shoot length (2 to 10.5%). chlorophyll content (7 to 39%). carotenoids contents (5 to 42%). shoot biomass (upto 44%) and root biomass (8 to 65%) were observed as compared to unexposed plant. It was found that ozone exposure was more detrimental to LVP in comparison to FP and EVP.

84579,Use of Fuzzy Set and Neural Network to Extract Fingerprint Minutiae Points and Location,2009,Pravesh Kumar and Karun Guide Verma,,,,,,In biometric identification. fingerprint recognition is most popular and widely used method Fingerprints were used as a means of positively identifying a person as an author of the document and are used in law enforcement. Fingerprint recognition has a lot of advantages. a fingerprint is compact. unique for every person. and stable over the lifetime. A predominate approach to fingerprint technique is the uses of minutiae. This thesis presents an investigation and comparative study to extract minutiae points in a particular fingerprint image. In most cases. fingerprint images available are not of good quality; they may be corrupted and degraded due to variation in skin and effective condition. So first a fuzzy logic based image enhancement method has been applied to obtain a more reliable estimation of minutiae points and their location and then a different algorithm used to extract them. Neural network is used to give the training to the location of these minutiae point and to improve the performance of the system. All the implementation work has been done in MATLAB 7.0 Image Processing Toolbox. Experimental result shows that proposed algorithm gives the better result compare to others.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:kcGNQN_anIUC,7,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/handle/10266/842,11736183544686880736,/scholar?cites=11736183544686880736,,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/bitstream/10266/842/3/842%20Pravesh%20Kumar%20%2880731019%29.pdf,0,0,0
84580,A framework for multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making for design of electrical drives,2008,Praveen Kumar,,,,,,All the products that we use and see in our daily lives are the results of one or the other engineering disciplines. The optimal design of these products is a multidisciplinary task and usually it is an iterative task performed by a team of skilled and experienced engineers. Therefore design is widely considered to be the central or distinguishing activity of engineering [1]. The engineering design is a constantly evolving discipline and design engineers are constantly trying to identify means of producing a better product in a shorter period of time. Design of a product classified as a complex system poses substantial challenges to both analysis and design [2]. Broadly speaking. in engineering design one attempts to improve or optimise several objectives. frequently competing and conflicting with each other. subject to satisfying a set of design and physical constraints. The problem solution involves two primary elements: formulation of the problem as a mathematical model that is suitable for optimisation and then defining a procedure for finding optimal solution of the problem once it has been formulated. To combine the mathematical model of the system to be designed with the optimisation algorithm for concrete engineering problems. it is necessary to clearly demarcate the boundaries of the engineering system to be designed and optimised. The development of the appropriate model of the system is a very challenging task because the models of the system to be designed have to represent the reality as closely as possible and also should not be computationally intensive. Invariably a detailed model of the system tends to give more accurate results but is …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:cTLm0pkq19gC,7,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:2cb6b4e3-46b3-4845-bb21-8c8c1a950695,4138865295781102753,/scholar?cites=4138865295781102753,,,0,0,0

Seedling height. number of nodules per seedling and seedling biomass exhibited strong seed source dependent variation. While collar diameter and nodule diameter showed statistically non-significant differences among seed sources. Significant positive correlations were observed between growth characters (seedling height. collar diameter and root length). Highly significant positive correlation was observed between total number of nodules/seedling with root length and seedling dry matter indicating the influence of root length on nodulation and in turn the effect of nodulation on seedling biomass production.

Mathematically predicting the performance of Darrieus type lift based turbines are challenging due to the inconsistent angle of attack. blade wake interaction and local induced velocities giving rise to complex flow physics. A reliable and validated mathematical model is therefore essential to optimize the various design parameters prior to manufacture. The objective of the current study is to evaluate widely employed aerodynamic models based on their prediction accuracy. limitations. and computational requirements. Double multiple stream tube models have been discussed in detail and the predictions are experimentally validated through the wind tunnel test of three-bladed H-Darrieus rotor in terms of torque and power coefficient.

An increase in brace slenderness ratio results in a reduction in its energy dissipation capacity along with a simultaneous increase in the ductility nearing its fracture. Since both energy dissipation capacity and ductility of braces are essential parameters in quantifying the seismic performance of special concentric braced frames. there is a need of establishing the optimum range of brace slenderness ratio and width-to-thickness ratio. Hence. an extensive finite element parametric study has been conducted on a wide range of values of these parameters on braces of hollow steel square section using a commercial software ABAQUS.

The C ions of 80 keV with the fluencies of 1.2 to 2 × 1016 ions per cm2 were implanted under the high vacuum directly onto the 200 nm thick Ni film deposited on SiO2/Si substrates. The growth proceeds via the dissolution of C atoms into bulk Ni film that diffuse out towards both sides of Ni surface and pushing the C atoms to precipitate out by rapid annealing and cooling. As a result. the graphene growth takes place both on the top of the Ni film and at the interface of Ni/SiO2 film. This direct synthesis of the graphene on SiO2 is achieved by etching out the top Ni film. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy investigations provide an evidence of strong resilience of the graphene to ion implantation.

India has witnessed a drastic change in food consumption pattern. There has been a fall in cereal intake particularly in coarse cereals whereas consumption of other food items (vegetables. fruits. oil and milk products) has not increased significantly especially in the diet of rural population. This change in food consumption has led to a drop in average per capita calorie and protein intakes which are one of the widely used indicators of nutrition. Besides. India’s performance on child anthropometric measures such as height for age. weight for height and weight for age is even worse than the sub Saharan countries of Africa. Thus. poor nutrition level in India remains an issue of wide public concern and debate. Most of the studies deal with nutrition at macro level and there are dearth of them which examine regional pattern of food and nutrient intake. This study which is based on National Sample Survey (NSS) 66th Consumer Expenditure Schedule (2009-10) attempts to exhibit food consumption and nutrition (in terms of energy. protein. carbohydrates. minerals. fat. vitamin C. iron and calcium) distribution across 85 NSS regions. Findings of the study show that Indian diet is monotonous based on cereals and milk products which are major source of all nutrients. Regions with higher intake of cereals and milk appear to consume most of the nutrients. It is also evidenced that there are large regional gaps found between northern. southern and north-eastern NSS regions on nutrition parameters in rural India.

The S. aureus causes a wide variety of infections ranging from mild skin infections. to life–threatening diseases such as bacteremia. The pathogenesis of S. aureus is attributed to the combined effect of extracellular factors and toxins. together with the invasive properties of the strain such as adherence. biofilm formation. and resistance to phagocytosis. There is general agreement that biofilms are the basis for persistent or chronic bacterial infections (Costerton et al.. 1999). The implication of biofilms in chronic infections has triggered an increasing interest in the organization of genes involved in biofilm formation (Caizza and O’Toole. 2005; Tormo et al.. 2005). The icaADBC cluster. an operon present in S. aureus and S. epidermidis. participates in biofilm formation by encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of a biofilm matrix polysaccharide (Cucarella et al.. 2004). The ica operon was first identified and studied most extensively in S. epidermidis and was later shown to be present in S. aureus (Gotz. 2002). Most S. aureus strains appear to contain the entire ica operon. although there are reports to the contrary. IcaA and icaD genes have been reported to play a significant role in biofilm formation in S. aureus and S. epidermidis (Gotz. 2002). The ica locus has been detected in majority of the mastitic S. aureus isolates indicating its potential role as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of mastitis in ruminants (Ciftci et al.. 2009. Milanov et al.. 2010).

By changing the arrangement of High-Temperature and Intermediate-Temperature zone components of the HRSG. its effect on the Steam Turbine performance and HRSG characteristics is examined in this paper. It is shown that there could be a significant difference in HRSG sizes even though thermal performance is not in great deviation. From steam turbine performance point of view. it should be carefully reviewed whether the optimum design point could exist or not. Off-design performance could be one of the main factors in arranging components of the HRSG because power plants operate at various off-design conditions such as ambient temperature and gas turbine load. etc. It is shown that different Heat Exchanger configurations lead to different performances with ambient temperature. even though they have almost the same performances at design points.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:fGgrif5g-LMC,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pasupuleti_Ravindra_Kumar2/publication/305136653_Off_Design_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Triple_Pressure_Reheat_Heat_Recovery_Steam_Generator/links/59d5bf660f7e9b7a7e48a6e5/Off-Design-Performance-Analysis-of-a-Triple-Pressure-Reheat-Heat-Recovery-Steam-Generator.pdf,2963359131565498473,/scholar?cites=2963359131565498473,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pasupuleti_Ravindra_Kumar2/publication/305136653_Off_Design_Performance_Analysis_of_a_Triple_Pressure_Reheat_Heat_Recovery_Steam_Generator/links/59d5bf660f7e9b7a7e48a6e5/Off-Design-Performance-Analysis-of-a-Triple-Pressure-Reheat-Heat-Recovery-Steam-Generator.pdf,0,0,0

Temperature of the exhaust plays an important role by giving an idea of the functioning of various engine parts and engine as a whole. With increase in the load the exhaust temperature increases and hence coolant temperature. Here the ratio of the exhaust temperature to the coolant temperature gives idea of the ability of coolant to take away heat from the cylinder wall at increases load. Higher the ratio means less effective cooling of the cylinder wall and hence decreased life of engine.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:0izwh0c-50kC,6,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.4182&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1280948964143620544,/scholar?cites=1280948964143620544,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.148.4182&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

It is consumed in fresh form as salad and in various processed forms like soup. sauce. ketchup. paste. puree. powder and canned whole fruit etc. and tops the list of processed vegetables. Polyethylene glycol (PEG). a series of polymers that vary from viscous liquids to waxy solids has been used to induce water stress artificially (Larher et al.. 1993). PEG induced osmotic stress is found to reduce cell water potential (Govindaraj et al.. 2010). An increase in concentration of PEG-6000. resulted a decrease in germination rate. root length. shoot length and seed vigour in certain crop plants (Khodarahmpour. 2011). Tomato has been selected for better growth under PEG simulated water stress (Bressan et al.. 2003). In vitro selection techniques involving the use of PEG. is one of the reliable methods for screening desirable genotypes and to study further the effects of water scarcity on plant germination indices (Sakthivelu et al.. 2008). Tomato genotypes tend to exhibit limited and inadequate genetic variability for drought tolerance. Hence the best way to mitigate the effects of drought stress involves the crossing of cultivated tomato with drought tolerant lines (Pena and Hughes. 2007).

First. PCU values of vehicle categories were determined according to the Transport and Road Research Laboratory definition and replaced the commonly considered measure of performance speed with area occupancy using simulation. The PCU values obtained were found to be significantly different for different volume-to-capacity ratios; this result shows that the PCU value is dynamic in nature. While the dynamic nature of PCU values is well appreciated. practitioners may prefer a single set of optimized PCU values (unique for each vehicle category).

Multimedia data such as image. audio and video is larger in volume than scalar data such as temperature. pressure and humidity. Thus to transmit multimedia information. more energy is required which reduces the lifetime of the network. Limitation of battery energy is a crucial problem in WMSN that needs to be addressed to prolong the lifetime of the network. In this paper we present a clustering approach based on Spectral Graph Partitioning (SGP) for WMSN that increases the lifetime of the network. The efficient strategies for cluster head selection and rotation are also proposed as part of clustering approach.

84690,Comparative Analysis of Performance and Emission of Diesel Engine by Varying Compression Ratio Using Different Fuels‖,2013,Pavanendra Kumar and Niraj Kumar and Vineet Tirth,3,MIT International Journal of Mechanical Engineering,2,86-90,,Presently lots of researches are being performed to evaluate biodiesel as alternative fuel for diesel engine due to associated problems with use of conventional diesel such as environmental degradation. petroleum depletion etc. However. the combustion behavior of biodiesel is different from diesel. To compensate the effects of utilization of biodiesel and maximize the performance. input parameters of the engine should be adjusted. This work investigates the influence of compression ratio (CR) on the performance and emissions of a DI diesel engine using biodiesel (50%) blended-diesel fuel. known as B50. Tests were carried out using three different CRs (14. 16 and 18: 1) at 1500 rpm with varying load from 0 to 100%. The results showed that increasing compression ratio improves the burning characteristics of biodiesel. At higher compression ratio. brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased while brake thermal efficiency decreased. However. slight increase in brake power is found especially at higher load. Steep decrease is recorded in smoke opacity (OP). carbon monoxide (CO). oxygen (O2) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. while increase in CO2 is also observed. Finally. it can be concluded that utilization of biodiesel as fuel in diesel engine required modifications in the input parameters.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:84dCbUURXyIC,5,http://mitpublications.org/yellow_images/1378375322_logo_Comparative%20analysis%20of%20Performance%20and%20Emission%20of%20Diesel%20Engine%20by%20Varying%20Compression%20Ratio%20Using%20different%20fuels.pdf,15983474726991192012,/scholar?cites=15983474726991192012,,http://mitpublications.org/yellow_images/1378375322_logo_Comparative%20analysis%20of%20Performance%20and%20Emission%20of%20Diesel%20Engine%20by%20Varying%20Compression%20Ratio%20Using%20different%20fuels.pdf,0,0,0

Twenty-eight percent (28%) of tumors were located in the upper limbs and 72% in the lower extremities. The goal of treatment was limb salvage if feasible. The treatment consisted of amputation in 17 (30%) and local wide excision ie limb salvage surgery (LSS) in 40 (70%) patients. The most common histology was pleomorphic sarcoma (21%). Sixty-four percent (64%) of the patients were treated with surgery alone. 32% with surgery plus radiation and 4% with surgery plus systemic chemotherapy. Inadequate margins were present in 12% of the patients. All the patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Recurrence in the form of local and distant occurred in 39% of the patients. Local recurrence occurred in 18% of the patients who underwent LSS and in 35% of those who underwent amputation. Pulmonary metastasis was detected in 16% of patients. The 2 year mortality was 10.5% with the most common etiology being lung metastasis and the most common histology being leiomyosarcoma.

Factors having significant impact on outcome were assigned risk score of 1 to 3 on the basis of their degree of impact on outcome. Neonates with total risk score upto 2 (low risk category) had survival rate of 82.1%. which dropped to 7.1% in neonates with total risk score of 5 and above (very high risk category). Survival rate of 44.4% was observed in category with score of 3-4 (high risk category). We found this scoring system more accurate in pre-operative identification of neonates at poor risk for survival in our context than traditional Waterston's classification. which appears to have lost its usefulness.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:H8Dy_DhitWcC,5,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/20300/is02007.html,17508305560836702968,/scholar?cites=17508305560836702968,,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/html/1807/20300/is02007.html,0,0,0

Systems Analysis of Personal Transportation Needs in Emerging Market Countries. It reviews the current literature on the health impact of ambient air pollution in India. with special emphasis on Delhi and provides recommendations for areas where future research could be directed. High levels of total suspended particulate matter (TSP) in ambient air of Delhi-three times the annual national standard of 140µg/m3-are a serious cause for concern. There is evidence of elevated rates of respiratory morbidity amongst those dwelling in highly polluted areas of Delhi. after adjusting for several confounders. Daily counts of emergency room visits for acute asthma. acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD) and acute coronary events are related to daily levels of pollutants. particularly TSP recorded a day earlier using time series approach. It is estimated that almost one fifth of the emergency room visits for these ailments in Delhi are attributable to particulate levels exceeding the national standards. Daily mortality from non-traumatic causes has been shown to be related to TSP levels in a time series analysis. however. the increase in mortality per 100 microgram/per cubic meter increase in Delhi is less as compared to similar effect noted from other parts of the world. Further. the excess mortality is noted in relatively younger age groups as well. More studies are needed to confirm these observations and provide a concrete basis for policy decisions to improve air quality and public health in Delhi. Further studies are required on the adverse health effects of ozone. benzene …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:SPgoriM2DtkC,5,https://www.seas.harvard.edu/TransportAsia/workshop_papers/ChhabraetalFinal2.pdf,11903470563946432235,/scholar?cites=11903470563946432235,,https://www.seas.harvard.edu/TransportAsia/workshop_papers/ChhabraetalFinal2.pdf,0,0,0

Thirty-four patients were found influenza virus positive in acute asthma cases. Influenza virus was isolated by conventional culture method on MDCK cell-line and by enzyme immunoassay test (EIA). The EIA negative specimens were retested after virus amplification on MDCK cell-line. Virus shedding and virus surface receptors assay was carried out to determine influenza virus titre. Airway functions were measured by spirometry. A good relationship was observed between the degree of airflow limitation and presence of influenza virus infection (p< 0.001; r= 0.85). A comparable difference in% FEV1 was observed in relation to the symptoms. The patients with greater viral antigen load had lower% FEV1. Two specimens. which were EIA negative. turned out to be positive after amplification on MDCK cell-line. The sensitivity was 98% and specificity was 100%.

After a long association with the Sertoli cell. spermatids have to finally ‘let go’ of the support from Sertoli cells in order to be transported to the epididymis. Spermiation is a multistep process characterised by removal of excess spermatid cytoplasm. recycling of junctional adhesion molecules by endocytosis. extensive cytoskeletal remodelling and final spermatid disengagement. Successful execution of all these events requires coordinated regulation by endocrine and paracrine factors. This review focuses on the endocrine regulation of spermiation. With the aim of delineating how hormones control the various aspects of spermiation. this review provides an analysis of recent advances in research on the hormonal control of molecules associated with the spermiation machinery.

Contact angle of the saliva substitute on denture base can be taken as an indicator of wettability. Good wetting of heat-polymerized acrylic resin is critical for optimum retention of complete dentures.Methods: Two hundred & forty samples of heat-polymerized acrylic resin were fabricated using conventional method. 240 samples divided into 6 groups with 40 samples in each group. Advancing & Receding contact angles were measured using Contact Angle Goniometer & DSA4 software analysis.Results: Anova test was carried out to test the significance in difference of contact angle values in the six groups. The mean of advancing angle values & mean of receding angle values of all the six groups has shown statistically significant difference between the groups. The mean of angle of hysteresis values of all the six groups are statistically not significant between the groups. A multiple comparison using Bonferroni’s test was carried out to verify the significance of difference between the contact angles in a pair of groups. Statistically significant difference was seen when Aqwet (Group II) was compared to Distilled water (Group I). Wet Mouth (Group III). E-Saliva (Group IV).

A356 alloy is used as the aluminium based matrix material with varying the reinforcement of SiC p from 0 to 9 wt.% in steps of 3 wt.% and fixed quantity of 3 wt.% of graphite. The specimens were fabricated by stir-cast method. The prepared specimens were examined using optical microscope to know the particle distribution in the matrix. Hardness. tensile and wear tests were carried out for specimen. The wear test was carried out using pin-on disc wear testing machine with varying applied load. From the results. it was observed that the composite showed higher hardness and tensile strength as compared to the base alloy. The presence of reinforcements (SiC p and Gr) significantly affects the solid state transition kinetics that improves the properties of composites. The significant improvement in strength and wear resistance was obtained for composite when compared to the base alloy specimen. The worn out surfaces and wear debris of specimen were analyzed using (scanning electron microscope) SEM and electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:dBzKUGQurMsC,4,https://www.ejers.org/index.php/ejers/article/view/120,12571155394043046065,/scholar?cites=12571155394043046065,,https://www.ejers.org/index.php/ejers/article/download/120/59,0,0,0

An experimental study has been carried out to find the effect of a mesh placed normal to the flow and at different wall-normal locations in the late stages of two transitional flows induced by free-stream turbulence (FST) and an isolated roughness element. The mesh causes an approximately 30% reduction in the free-stream velocity. and mild acceleration. irrespective of its wall-normal location. Interestingly. when located near the wall. the mesh suppresses several transitional events leading to transition delay over a large downstream distance. The transition delay is found to be mainly caused by suppression of the lift-up of the high-shear layer and its distortion. along with modification of the spanwise streaky structure to an orderly one.

Due to the fusion of data items sourced at different nodes into a single one during in-network processing. the sanctity of the aggregated data needs to be ensured. Especially. the data integrity of the aggregated result is critical as any malicious update to it can jeopardize not one. but many sensor readings. In this paper. we analyse three different approaches to providing integrity support for SDA in WSNs. The first one is traditional MAC. in which each leaf node and intermediate node share a key with parent (symmetric key). The second is aggregate MAC (AMAC). in which a base station shares a unique key with all the other sensor nodes. The third is homomorphic MAC (Homo MAC) that is purely symmetric key-based approach. These approaches exhibit diverse trade-off in resource consumption and security assumptions. Adding together to that. we also propose a probabilistic and improved variant of homomorphic MAC that improves the security strength for secure data aggregation in WSNs. We carry out simulations in TinyOS environment to experimentally evaluate the impact of each of these on the resource consumption in WSNs.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:tWiuw1KVSQEC,4,https://www.scirp.org/html/1-7800188_41815.htm,15446982926557775723,/scholar?cites=15446982926557775723,,https://www.scirp.org/html/1-7800188_41815.htm,0,0,0

84786,A new method for generating key for cryptography using Deterministic random number generator,2013,P Pavan Kumar and J Madan Kumar and M Neelima,4,International Journal of Engineering Trends and Technology (IJETT)–Volume,,,,Now a day’s communication has played a key role in each and every aspect of life. In communication the main problem is security and privacy of sensitive data. The data should be transmitted from sender to receiver without any loss of original information. There are many ways of secure communication. One of those techniques is Cryptography. In cryptography there are mainly two mechanisms. They are Encryption and Decryption. In Encryption the sender will convert the original message called plain text into cipher text which is unreadable. Encryption needs encryption key. This cipher text will be send through communication channel to receiver. The receiver needs to decrypt the cipher text into plain text by using decryption key. Here key plays main role. The security of the encrypted message depends on key (encryption and decryption keys. in symmetric encryption both keys are same). The key should be unpredictable. random. and nonlinear and hardware cost for generating key should be less. There are many ways to generate random keys. In this paper we are proposing a technique called Reseeding mixing Pseudo Random number generator simply RM-PRNG. Advantages of this RM-PRNG are low hardware cost. non linearity. and high throughput.

In this paper a six-wheeled rover with rocker-bogie structure has been analyzed for planar case. The detailed kinematic model of the rover was built and the dynamic model was derived based on bond graph. The simulation studies were performed for obstacle climbing capability of the rover. It was observed from the study that rover can pass through plane surface. inclined surface. and inclined ditch without any control on the actuators of the rover. However. it fails to cross a vertical ditch so a velocity controller was designed. It consists of a proportional integral (PI) controller and reduced model of the rover. It is found from simulation and animation studies that with the proposed velocity controller the rover is able to cross the vertical ditch.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:S9ByAo1SvpUC,4,https://www.igi-global.com/article/dynamic-modeling-simulation-velocity-control/54456,7893017551094691145,/scholar?cites=7893017551094691145,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pushparaj_Pathak2/publication/278711993_Geometric_Modelling_of_Multisection_Bionic_Manipulator_Experimental_Validation_on_RobotinoXT/links/544e2f4e0cf2bca5ce8efe2b/Geometric-Modelling-of-Multisection-Bionic-Manipulator-Experimental-Validation-on-RobotinoXT.pdf,0,0,0

84808,M.: A Spurious-Power Suppression Technique For Multimedia/DSP Applications,2011,Praveen Kumar and M TECH,11,International Journal of Advanced Engineering Scinces and Technologies,1,035-051,,This paper presents the design exploration and applications of a spurious-power suppression technique (SPST) which can dramatically reduce the power dissipation of combinational VLSI designs for multimedia/DSP purposes. The proposed SPST separates the target designs into two parts. ie. the most significant part and least significant part (MSP and LSP). and turns off the MSP when it does not affect the computation results to save power. Furthermore. this paper proposes an original glitch-diminishing technique to filter out useless switching power by asserting the data signals after the data transient period.There are different entities that one would like to optimize when designing a VLSI circuit. These entities can often not be optimized simultaneously. only improve one entity at the expense of one or more others The design of an efficient integrated circuit in terms of power. area. and speed simultaneously. has become a very challenging problem. Power dissipation is recognized as a critical parameter in modern the objective of a good multiplier is to provide a physically compact. good speed and low power consuming chip. To save significant power consumption of a VLSI design. it is a good direction to reduce its dynamic power that is the major part of total power dissipation. In this paper. we propose a high speed low-power multiplier adopting the new SPST implementing approach. This multiplier is designed by equipping the Spurious Power Suppression Technique (SPST) on a modified Booth encoder which is controlled by a detection unit using an AND gate. The modified booth encoder will reduce the number of partial products generated …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:kOdZbmsmKqcC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kuan_Hung_Chen/publication/224317087_A_Spurious-Power_Suppression_Technique_for_MultimediaDSP_Applications/links/54ed2ac70cf27fbfd772341e/A-Spurious-Power-Suppression-Technique-for-Multimedia-DSP-Applications.pdf,17575589885747796775,/scholar?cites=17575589885747796775,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kuan_Hung_Chen/publication/224317087_A_Spurious-Power_Suppression_Technique_for_MultimediaDSP_Applications/links/54ed2ac70cf27fbfd772341e/A-Spurious-Power-Suppression-Technique-for-Multimedia-DSP-Applications.pdf,0,0,0
84809,Measurements of cloud condensation nuclei activity and droplet activation kinetics of fresh unprocessed regional dust samples and minerals.,2010,P Kumar and IN Sokolik and A Nenes,10,Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics Discussions,12,,,This study reports laboratory measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and droplet activation kinetics of aerosols dry-generated from clays. calcite. quartz. and desert soil samples from Northern Africa. East Asia/China. and Northern America. Based on the observed dependence of critical supersaturation. sc. with particle dry di-5 ameter. Ddry. we find that FHH adsorption activation theory is a far more suitable framework for describing fresh dust CCN activity than Köhler theory. One set of FHH parameters (AFHH∼ 2. 25±0. 75. BFHH∼ 1. 20±0. 10) can adequately reproduce the measured CCN activity for all species considered. and also explains the large range of hygroscopicities reported in the literature. Based on threshold droplet growth analysis. mineral 10 dust aerosols were found to display retarded activation kinetics compared to ammonium sulfate. Comprehensive simulations of mineral dust activation and growth in the CCN instrument suggest that this retardation is equivalent to a reduction of the water vapor uptake coefficient (relative to that for calibration ammonium sulfate aerosol) by 30–80%.

The initial condition is given by the steady attachment-line boundary layer forming over the leading-edge of an infinite swept wing or a yawed cylinder. The contamination is shown as due to either a convecting or a stationary vortex far outside the attachment-line boundary layer at the leading edge. This mechanism is proposed to account for the sub-critical instability onset observed for attachment-line boundary layer. (The criticality is for Reynolds number (based on momentum thickness) exceeding 100––an empirically suggested value based on earlier experiments.)

Vegetable Demand and Production in India: Long-term Perspective,2002,Praduman Kumar and Pramod Kumar and Surabhi Mittal,,Impact of Vegetable Research in India,,161,,The changes in consumption pattern of vegetables at different levels of rural and urban by income groups and geographical regions of India have been examined. The elasticities of vegetables demand in rural and urban areas across income groups and regions have been computed. Long-term perspectives of vegetable demand and production have been presented. The study is based on the National Sample Survey (NSS) data of 38th. 43rd. 50th and 55th rounds pertaining to the periods 1983-84. 1988. 1993-94. and 1999-00. respectively.The per capita annual consumption of vegetables has increased from 47 kg in 1983-84 to 76 kg in 1999-00 with 2.9 per cent annual growth rate. A widespread increase in consumption of vegetables has been observed across income groups. regions and areas (both rural and urban). The vegetable consumption has been found to accelerate at a higher rate among the poor. Potato has been reported to be the dominant vegetable contributing maximum in total consumption (24 per cent) followed by onion (12.4 per cent). and cauliflower (3.6 per cent). The gap in vegetable prices between rural and urban has shown a declining trend. It may be inferred that market integration has taken place in vegetable. The income elasticity of demand for vegetables (0.3) is reported to be not as high as it is in other noncereals. The demand elasticity has been found to be high among poor (0.4-0.5) as compared to non-poor (0.1-0.2) households. Its implications on future demand for vegetables in the country have been discussed. The demand for vegetables has been projected for 2006. 2011 and 2016.

In many practical situations. the illumination of a scene is changing with space and time. It is not unusual to have images having brightly lit and shadowed portions in the same scene demanding information extraction from the entire image. For example in the instance of space images over mountainous terrain you find brightly lit portions facing the sun while the other portion remain in the dark. Techniques based on homomorphic filtering are useful in these cases. However. these are based on spatial frequency filtering and tend to perform poorly in low SNR portion of the image.Up to now. image processing and image analysis have borrowed their basic tools from functional analysis …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:Ko-bl4t9PAIC,4,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03772063.2000.11416170,10686125903995779693,/scholar?cites=10686125903995779693,,,0,0,0

84837,The effect of hematocrit on the efficiency of hemodialysis in cases of chronic renal failure.,1996,N Nand and S Arya and SK Mahajan and M Sharma and HK Aggarwal and P Kumar,50,Indian journal of medical sciences,2,29-33,,Twenty patients of chronic renal failure were evaluated to study the effect of increase in hematocrit (Hct) on the efficiency of hemodialysis. All the patients were subjected to two hemodialysis of identical duration with an interdialytic interval of 48 hours. All were anemic with a mean hemoglobin of 6.73 gm% and a hematocrit of 22.2%. Hematocrit was raised to a mean of 32.02% following transfusion of 2 units (600-700 ml) of whole blood (p< 0.001) in the interdialytic interval. Blood clearances (Kb). Dialysate clearance (Kd). fractional decrement and Kt/V ratio of solutes (urea. creatinine and phosphates) were calculated during both the dialysis and compared with each other. Kt/V of urea decreased from 1.0589+/-0.24 to 0.89+/-0.15 (p< 0.001). and that of creatinine 1.003+/-0.19 to 0.832+/-0.009 (p< 0.001) and phosphates 0.992+/-0.16 to 0.826+/-0.006 (p< 0.001) and it showed a negative correlation with rise in hematocrit. It was significant for creatinine and phosphates and insignificant for urea. suggesting thereby that the efficiency of dialysis decreased with increase in hematocrit. This is important in view of under dialysis in patients of normal or near normal hematocrit and suggests the need for modification of dialysis prescription in such situations.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:TKVID9p7UpsC,4,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8979630,1316158615530600182,/scholar?cites=1316158615530600182,,,0,0,0

Much attention and research efforts have been dedicated in the past to develop as an efficient standalone Darrieus turbine. Despite these efforts. these vertical axis turbines are still low in efficiency compared to the horizontal axis counterparts. The current architecture of the turbine and their inherent characteristics limit their application in low wind speed areas as confirmed experimentally and computationally by past research. To enable and extend their operation for weak wind flows. a novel design of Adaptive Darrieus Wind Turbine (ADWT) is proposed. The hybrid Darrieus Savonius rotor with dynamically varying Savonius rotor diameter based on the wind speed enables the turbine to start. efficiently operate and stop the turbine at high winds. As the wake of Savonius rotor has a profound impact on the power performance of the combined rotor. the wake of two buckets Savonius rotor in open and closed configuration is reviewed. The current study aims to develop an analytical model to predict the power coefficient and the influence of other design parameters on the proposed design. The formulated analytical model is coded in python. and the results are obtained for the 10 kW rotor. Parametric analysis on the chord length and the diameter of the closed Savonius rotor is performed in search of an optimized diameter to maximize the annual energy output.

84893,Design and analysis of center jack for cars,2015,Pandra Uday Kumar and G Ramanjulu,2,"International Journal & Magazine of Engineering, Technology, Management and Research",,1476-9,,With the increasing levels of technology. the efforts being put to produce any kind of work has been continuously decreasing. The efforts required in achieving the desired output can be effectively and economically be decreased by the implementation of better designs. Power screws are used to convert rotary motion into translator motion. A screw jack is an example of a power screw in which a small force applied in a horizontal plane is used to raise or lower a large load. The principle on which it works is similar to that of an inclined plane. The mechanical advantage of a screw jack is the ratio of the load applied to the effort applied. The screw jack is operated by turning a lead screw. The height of the jack is adjusted by turning a lead screw and this adjustment can be done either manually or by integrating an electric motor. Pneumatics is a branch of technology that deals with the study and application of pressurized gas in affecting mechanical motion. In this project “Mechanical Project Report on Center Jack for Cars” is designed to make a pneumatic jack that can lift a complete car or an automobile when placed at the car’s bottom. These systems are mainly used in industries. factories and are generally plumbed with compressed air. The preference for pneumatic systems is because a centrally and electrically powered compressor is used to power cylinders through solenoid valves and provides motion in a cheaper and flexible mode. The best point of the project is that it can drive a complete system with the aid of Compressed air without any part of the automobile touching the ground.

It does not use ionizing radiations and it is comparatively low-cost. In time. the main disadvantage of medical ultrasonography is the poor quality of images. which are mainly originated by multiplicative speckle noise. For efficient speckle suppression of images of the kidney a comparison of some noise reduction method is introduced in this paper. The main intention of this paper is to analyse and to provide most significant content descriptive parameters to identify and classify the kidney stones with ultrasound scan. The intentions of the present study were to compare quantitative and qualitative ultrasound highly improved images by reducing speckle noise while improving anatomical features. so that the images may be acceptable for the diagnosis. For efficient image improvement we adopt a multi-resolution approach. For speckle reduction. many algorithms and procedures are used. Some filtering technique enhances edges and speckle indiscriminately. while others manages to remove considerable amounts of speckle but also tends to over smooth the boundaries of important image features. For 2-dimensional B-mode ultrasound images. we use an image enhancement algorithm based on filtering and noise reduction procedures from the pinguid to fine resolution images that are obtained from the wavelet-transformed data.

Knee-joint is a complex structure of the human body having a complex shape femoral condyle which moves over the complex shaped meniscus of the tibial bone and acquires various critical loads at various walking. moving and sitting activities. From a biomechanical point of view. clinicians need relevant knowledge in order to properly implant a knee-prosthesis. The purpose of this paper is to give people and clinicians a better understanding about the kneejoint mechanism and the loads & forces acting on it at different conditions. In this context. a three-dimensional model of femoral and tibial bones of kneejoint is made in Pro/E Wildfire 4.0 and finite element analysis of loads at different conditions and at different weights is done in ANSYS 15.0 software in order to evaluate the results in form of von-mises stress which can be used to make implant for knee prosthesis.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:OVe_t5h5bhEC,3,http://www.ripublication.com/ijame-spl/ijamev4n7spl_02.pdf,15964368589840251291,/scholar?cites=15964368589840251291,,http://www.ripublication.com/ijame-spl/ijamev4n7spl_02.pdf,0,0,0

Information hiding is a technique that inserts secret messages into a cover file. Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one. apart from the sender and intended recipient. suspects the existence of the message. a form of security through obscurity. A lossless or reversible steganography is defined as an original image can be completely recovered from the stego-image after the embedded data has been extracted. This technique has been focused on spatial uncompressed domain recently. and is considered more challenging to carry out in the compressed domain. In this paper. we propose a lossless. compressed domain steganography technique for AMBTC-compressed images based on the interchange of two quantization levels. The location map. which is often used in lossless steganography. is not required in our scheme. Therefore. the hiding capacity is independent of the compressed codes. Moreover. the stego-image preserves the same image quality as the original compressed images.

Troponin T activity was separately estimated for plasma. Isoproterenol significantly increased the activities of CK. LDH and the transaminases in plasma with a concomitant decrease in these enzymes in tissue.

84930,Role of equilibrium plasma flow on damping of slow MHD waves,2011,N Kumar and P Kumar and A Kumar and R Chauhan,85,Indian Journal of Physics,12,1879-1886,Springer-Verlag,In the solar corona waves and oscillatory activities are observed with modern imaging and spectral instruments. These oscillations are interpreted as slow magneto-acoustic waves excited impulsively in coronal loops. This study explores the effect of steady plasma flow on the dissipation of slow magneto-acoustic waves in the solar coronal loops permeated by uniform magnetic field. We have investigated the damping of slow waves in the coronal plasma taking into account viscosity and thermal conductivity as dissipative processes. On solving the dispersion relation it is found that the presence of plasma flow influences the characteristics of wave propagation and dissipation. We have shown that the time damping of slow waves exhibits varying behavior depending upon the physical parameters of the loop. The wave energy flux associated with slow magnetoacoustic waves turns out to be of the order of 106 …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:9xDRhSErrBIC,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12648-011-0191-7,1652390800005326658,/scholar?cites=1652390800005326658,,,0,0,0

These may constitute high obstetric risk because of reduced fertility. risk of seizures during pregnancy. perinatal death. fetal malformation. miscarriage and increased seizure frequency. Preconception counselling and coordination of care is what can help to reduce these risks. A careful reappraisal of each case should ascertain the diagnosis. the need for continued Anti-epileptic drugs (AED) therapy. selection of appropriate AEDs. optimization of the dosage form and folic acid supplementation. Pregnancy has been found to influence the natural history of epilepsy and seizures and is often found likely to worsen seizure frequency in about one-third of them. The bioavailability of AEDs may change considerably owing to alterations in its pharmacodynamics and kinetics. Most of the AEDs are potentially teratogenic.

84944,An adaptive physical channel regulator for high performance and low power network-on-chip routers,2010,Lei Wang and Poornachandran Kumar and Ki Hwan Yum and Eun Jung Kim,,,,,Technical Report. 2010. 9,Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) architectures have become mainstream for designing processors. With a large number of cores. Network-On-Chip (NOC) provides a scalable communication method for CMP architectures. where wires become abundant resources available inside the chip. NOC must be carefully designed to meet constraints of power and area. and provide ultra low latencies. In this paper. we propose an Adaptive Physical Channel Regulator (APCR) for NOC routers to exploit the huge wiring resources for high performance and low power. The flit size in an APCR router is no longer equivalent to the physical channel width (phit size) providing finer granularity flow control. An APCR router allows flits from different packets or flows to share the same physical channel in a single cycle. The three regulation schemes (Monopolizing. Fair-sharing and Channel-stealing) intelligently allocate the output channel resources considering not only the availability of physical channels but the occupancy of input buffers. In an APCR router. each Virtual Channel can forward dynamic number of flits every cycle depending on the run-time network status. We also introduce Generalized NOC Router Design (GNRD)–a frame-work for exploring the design space of NOC routers. Our simulation results using a detailed cycle-accurate simulator show that an APCR router improves the network throughput by over 100%. compared with a baseline router design with the same buffer size. An APCR can outperform the baseline router even if the buffer size is halved. Furthermore. an APCR router enjoys over 33% total power savings with a little area overhead.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:ZJ-noXUx9mkC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eun-Jung-Kim/publication/228598752_An_Adaptive_Physical_Channel_Regulator_for_High_Performance_and_Low_Power_Network-On-Chip_Routers/links/55f1bd8008ae0af8ee1f81fd/An-Adaptive-Physical-Channel-Regulator-for-High-Performance-and-Low-Power-Network-On-Chip-Routers.pdf,1705474147675056322,/scholar?cites=1705474147675056322,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eun-Jung-Kim/publication/228598752_An_Adaptive_Physical_Channel_Regulator_for_High_Performance_and_Low_Power_Network-On-Chip_Routers/links/55f1bd8008ae0af8ee1f81fd/An-Adaptive-Physical-Channel-Regulator-for-High-Performance-and-Low-Power-Network-On-Chip-Routers.pdf,0,0,0

This disease belongs to the plantborne trematode zoonoses. Distribution of both species overlaps in many areas of Asia and Africa (Mas-Coma et al.. 2005). The definite host is very broad and includes many herbivorous mammals. including humans. The freshwater snails are an intermediate host of the parasite (Torgerson and Claxton. 1999). Fascioliasis is now recognized as an emerging human disease: WHO has estimated that 2.4 million people are infected with Fasciola and a further 180 million at risk for infection (Anonymous. 1995). In northern India. Lymnaea acuminata and Indoplanorbis exustus are the intermediate host of the Fasciola species (Agarwal and Singh. 1988). Singh and Agarwal (1981) reported that 94% of buffaloes slaughtered in local slaughter houses in Gorakhpur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh (India) carried heavy infestation of F. gigantica. One of the possible approaches to eradicate or control this problem is to interrupt the life cycle of the parasitic trematodes by eliminating the snail. which is essential to life cycle.

Most studies to date focus on the soluble fraction of such particles. and ignore interactions of the insoluble fraction with water vapor (even if known to be hydrophilic). To address this gap. we develop a new parameter-5 ization framework that considers cloud droplet formation within an ascending air parcel containing insoluble (but wettable) particles mixed with aerosol containing an appreciable soluble fraction. Activation of particles with a soluble fraction is described through well-established Köhler Theory. while the activation of hydrophilic insoluble particles is treated by “adsorption-activation” theory. In the latter. water vapor is adsorbed onto 10 insoluble particles. the activity of which is described by a multilayer Frankel-Halsey-Hill (FHH) adsorption isotherm modified to account for particle curvature. We further develop FHH activation theory. and i) find combinations of the adsorption parameters AFHH. BFHH for which activation into cloud droplets is not possible. and. ii) express activation properties (critical supersaturation) that follow a simple power law with respect 15 to dry particle diameter.Parameterization formulations are developed for sectional and lognormal aerosol size distribution functions.

Management of discrete stenoses of distal coronary arteries in the presence of mild proximal disease is a challenging task. Percutaneous intervention or grafting beyond the diseased segment may be limited by size of the target vessel. whereas endarterectomy followed by graft placement may result in graft occlusion due to competitive native flow. Patch angioplasty with or without endarterectomy is an effective option in this setting. which can be performed without cardiopulmonary bypass in the appropriate group of patients.

Declaring Sanctuaries. National Parks and Biosphere Reserves is one of the most important ways of conserving natural resources and enhancing. bio-diversity. In India the wild life protection act in 1972 and the wild life protection amendment act 1991 have been instrumental in providing legal provisions for the constitution and control of sanctuaries and National Parks. The act in strict interpretation ignores the historically evolved symbiotic relation between forest and forest people and drastically curtails their traditional rights to use forest resources. It accords priority to enforcement approaches for conserving natural resources. However. of late. it has been realized that enforcement approaches can not achieve the desired results and the cooperation and support of local people is crucial for the success of programs aimed at natural resources and conserving bio-diversity.

A new method incorporating signal-processing method such as wavelets and the Fourier transform is proposed for failure identification. It is now possible to distinguish failure during lightning tests as well as chopped lightning impulse tests. The method is experimentally validated on a transformer winding. The wavelet transforms enables the detection of the time of occurrence of switching or failure events. After establishing the time of occurrence. the original waveform is split into two or more sections. A Fourier transform of the individual section is performed. The frequency content of the waveform is analyzed in the various sections.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:VHymtrwLyIYC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/893583/,5815286927837931211,/scholar?cites=5815286927837931211,,,0,0,0

Most of the chemical research with these potential reagents has been focussed on the structure and bonding of their metal complexes in the solid state. Very little is known on the mechanistic aspects of their reactions in solution. A great deal of work on these aspects has to be done before one can rationalise the role of these species in various fields of science. Recently some work has been initiated in our laboratories [5—9] in the direction of providing insight into the mechanism of their activity in solution.

Dholes have unique adaptations as compared to other wolf-like canids for large litter size (larger number of mammae) and hypercarnivory making it evolutionarily notable. Over evolutionary time. dhole and the subsequent divergent wild canids have lost coat patterns found in African wild dog. Here we report the first high coverage genome survey of Asiatic wild dog and mapped it with African wild dog. dingo and domestic dog to assess the structural variants. We generated a total of 124.8 Gb data from 416140921 raw read pairs and retained 398659457 reads with 52X coverage and mapped 99.16% of the clean reads to the three reference genomes. We identified ~13553269 SNV’s. ~2858184 InDels. ~41000 SVs. ~1854109 SSRs and about 1000 CNVs. We compared the annotated genome of dingo and domestic dog with dhole genome sequence to understand the role of genes responsible in pelage pattern. dentition and mammary glands. Positively selected genes for these phenotypes were looked for SNP variants and top ranked genes for coat pattern. dentition and mammary glands were found to play a role in signalling and developmental pathways.

Gujarat to evaluate the impact of integrated approach of weed management on rain fed cowpea. It was found that selection of appropriate herbicides and its application in combination with cultural practices at critical period of weed growth was key factor to get elevated yield in rain fed cowpea. Till date most accepted practices among cowpea growers is single application of herbicides or go for cultural practices one hand weeding (HW)+ one inter cultural (IC) at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS). This was not found sufficient to manage weeds and negatively distress the growth parameters and ultimately resulted in loss of one fourth crop yield compared to that weed free treatment. Application of (pendimethalin+ 1 HW+ 1 IC).(imazethapyr+ 1 HW+ 1 IC) and (quizalofop-ethyl+ 1 HW+ 1 IC) very effective in weed control and had positive impact on plant height. plant spread. number of branch per plant. number of pods per plant and number of seeds per pods.

In solids. the atoms are oscillators. and hence. the scattering cross section can be directly related to the thermal energy (3/2 kT for 3 degrees of freedom). Liquid atoms have oscillations. as well as longer-range random movement. but the oscillation frequency is slower. Therefore. the overall kinetic energy may be similar to that in solids. but the scattering crosssection is likely to be quite different.

App. Sci,11,1037-1049,,Salinity is one of the most severe abiotic factors. limiting agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions. Excessive salinity reduces the productivity of many agricultural crops. Salt stress affects major processes like germination. speed of germination. root/shoot dry weight and Na+/K+ ratio in root and shoot (Parida and Das. 2005). Excess salt in soil solution adversely affect plant growth. either through osmotic inhibition of root water uptake or by specific ion effect. Seed germination and early seedling growth are the most sensitive stages to environmental stresses such as salinity (Sivritepe et al.. 2003). Salinity may cause significant reductions in the rate and final percentage of germination. which in turn may lead to uneven stand establishment and reduced crop yields (Foolad et al.. 1999). The problem of soil salinity is now increasing at a rate of 10% annually (Flowers. 2004; Foolad. 2007).

In this study. a comparison has been done between lubricant coated and uncoated (unlubricated) aluminium AA6061-T6 alloy sheet using Erichsen Cupping Test. For uncoated sheets. test was done under dry and heated conditions whereas for lubricant coated sheets. effectiveness of three lubricants (boric acid. graphite and Teflon or PTFE) was examined. The performance of lubricants was based on two parameters ie Draw Force and Draw Depth. The results of lubricant coated and uncoated AA606-T6 sheets were compared to determine the optimum performance of lubricants used. It was found that sheet under uncoated heated condition required minimum draw force whereas maximum was found in uncoated dry condition. The draw force for lubricant coated sheets was between dry uncoated and heated conditions. Also. the application of lubricants showed more draw depth when compared with uncoated conditions.

The early identification of insulin resistance decreases the risk of cardiometabolic complications. The correlation between the increase in visceral fat. central obesity and with insulin resistance is a important indicator. Present study was conducted to find the correlation between various anthropometric measurements and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and to find out the anthropometric marker. which correlates most significantly with insulin resistance.Material and methods: This is a population based cross-sectional study. Total 100 apparently healthy subjects (n= 55 male and n= 45 female) aged between 18-25 years were recruited with prior ethical approval and with written informed consent. All the anthropometrical measurements were done as per the standard methods. Fasting glucose and insulin were estimated by using commercially available kit.

85074,Improvement of simulated monsoon precipitation over South-Asia with a regionally coupled model ROM,2014,Pankaj Kumar and Dmitry Sein and William Cabos and Daniela Jacob,,,,32-33,International Baltic Earth Secretariat,A regional coupled atmosphere–ocean model is developed to study the monsoon climate over South Asia. Most of the climate models (both GCM and RCM) underestimate precipitation over South Asia. but overestimate precipitation over the Bay of Bengal and the equatorial Indian Ocean. These systematic differences between the models may be related to a fundamental problem of atmospheric models: the inability to simulate intraseasonal variability. The intraseasonal oscillations of the South Asian monsoon play a major role in influencing the seasonal mean monsoon characteristics and their interannual variability (Goswami and Mohan. 2001). Several GCM studies with focus on the South Asian monsoonal region have concluded that GCMs have difficulties in simulatingthe mean monsoon climate (Turner and Annamalai. 2012). RCMs do simulate better orographic induced precipitation. but also show limited ability to simulate the land precipitation (Lucas-Picher et al.. 2011; Kumar et al.. 2013).

Mater. Environ. Sci.,3,873-886,,Corrosion inhibition of welded maraging steel in 1.0 M sulphuric acid was studied in the presence of different concentrations of 2. 5-bis (3. 4. 5-trimethoxy phenyl)-1. 3. 4-oxadiazole (BTPO) by electrochemical techniques. The results confided that BTPO was a good inhibitor. and the inhibition efficiencies obtained from potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance methods were in good agreement. The inhibitor. BTPO. acted essentially as a mixed-type inhibitor with its inhibition action through its surface adsorption. The inhibition effciency was found to increase with the increase in BTPO concentration but decreased with the increase in temperature. The activation parameters for the corrosion of the alloy and thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of BTPO on the alloy surface were calculated and discussed. The adsorption of BTPO on welded maraging steel surface was predominantly through physisorption and obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) study confirmed the formation of an anticorrosion protective film of BTPO on the metal surface.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:j2GxDk2JBlYC,2,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.6072&rep=rep1&type=pdf,3348653832675027247,/scholar?cites=3348653832675027247,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.6072&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

As occupational stress affects the physical and psychological well being of the teachers. it definitely influences teaching effectiveness and performance of the teacher. Teachers are very important in the actualization of the school goals and national development. In order to teach effectively. teachers must not only feel psychologically and emotionally comfortable. but they must also have some sense of belief that they can make a difference to the lives of children they are teaching. The present research paper aims at study the teacher efficacy in relation to occupational stress of teachers working at primary level with respect to their gender and locale. 200 primary teachers were taken by using random and purposive sampling methods.

Res.(IJR),6,705-708,,The Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes and each of these nodes can be considered as an individual portable devices. Current unipath routing protocols result in performance degradation in mobile networks due to the unreliability of wireless infrastructure and mobility of nodes. Multipath routing protocol is an attractive alternative that distributes the traffic among several good paths instead of routing all the traffic along a single best path for highly error prone and resource depleted network environments. Frequent link failures are common in MANET due to node’s mobility and use of unreliable wireless channels for data transmission. Due to this. multipath routing protocol becomes an important research issue. Among the reactive protocols. AODV is a reactive routing protocol. Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector Routing (AOMDV) protocol is an enhancement part of the AODV protocol for computing multiple loop-free and link disjoint paths.

85084,Quantification of effect of convergence in porous media flow,2014,Srinivas Pasupuleti and Pradeep Kumar and K Jayachandra,,,,,,An attempt is made in this study to quantify the effect of convergence on macroscopic scale in the case of flow through porous media. Experiments are conducted separately on specially conceived parallel flow permeameter and converging flow permeameter keeping identical inlet and outlet conditions. using eight sizes of coarse granular media and water as the fluid medium. The media is sieved through sieves of different sizes to separate the crushed rock into sizes of 3.25 mm. 4.73 mm. 10.00 mm. 11.64 mm. 13.10 mm. 20.10 mm. 28.90 mm and 39.50 mm and glass spheres of 15.41 mm. 18.03 mm and 28.37 mm. As the effect of convergence is predominant in non-Darcian zones of flow. such as flow near the well. flow through rock fills. filters etc... the scope of the present work is restricted to flow regime with Re> 10.(After Kovacs) Forchheimer’s equation (i= aV+ bV2) is applied to analyze the experimental data. Equations are derived for Darcy parameter (a) and Non-Darcy parameter (b) of the Forchheimer’s equation for the crushed rock and glass spheres by relating to size of the media (d) in both parallel flow condition and converging flow condition. From the results it is inferred that for a given rate of flow through a known size of aquifer having predetermined grain size. the resistance to flow is higher in the parallel flow compared to similar media conditions in converging flow configurations. A comparison is then made between the coefficients of the equation. computed for parallel and converging configurations of flow.

The reliability of microbumps during a drop event is of great concern because of their large proportion of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) which are of brittle nature. In this paper. the growth kinetics of IMCs in solder joints were analyzed. Compact mixed mode (CMM) samples with an adhesive solder joint between Cu substrates were used to simulate microbumps for evaluation of the fracture properties. The effect of IMC proportion. strain rate. and mode mixity on fracture toughness were investigated. It was found that with increasing aging. the IMC proportion increased. leading to lower fracture toughness and more brittle fracture.

Because of the distinct prominence of buffalo as a dairy animal. the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize GDF9 cDNA using orthologous primers based on the bovine GDF9 sequence. GDF9 transcripts were found to be expressed in oocytes irrespective of their follicular origin. and shared a single transcription start site (TSS) at–57 base pairs (bp) upstream of ATG. Assignment of the TSS is consistent with the presence of a TATA element at–23 of the TSS mapped in this study. Localization of a buffalo-specific minimal promoter within 320 bp upstream of ATG was consolidated by identification of an E-box element at–113bp. Presence of putative transcription factor binding sites and other cis regulatory elements were analyzed at∼ 5 kb upstream of TSS. Various germ cell-specific cis-acting regulatory elements (BNCF.

85099,Biogeographic Response of Rhododendrons to Climate Change in the Sikkim Himalaya,2013,Pradeep Kumar,,"Climate Change in Sikkim: Patterns, Impacts and Initiatives, Government of Sikkim",,179-92,,The paper models the biogeography of genera Rhododendron. mainly tree varieties. in response to climate change. The modelling algorithm used in the paper estimates the target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy. For assessing the impact of climate change on Rhododendrons in Sikkim Himalayas. occurrence localities of Rhododendrons were determined with the help of handheld GPS. The occurrence location data was partitioned in to training and test data. A set of species occurrence records that was not previously used in the modelling was used as independent test data. For doing the niche modelling the relevant climatic data was taken from Worldclim. The relevant environmental variables of bioclimatic layers in GIS format were projected and the boundaries were extracted by masking the Sikkim area in ArcGIS. These modelled bioclimatic layers were used in Maxent for getting the current distribution (niche) and this was finally projected for future climate scenario. The future climate change scenario adopted here is the scenario SRES-A1B (Special Report on Emission Scenario corresponding to A1: Maximum energy requirements-emissions differentiated dependent on fuel sources. B: Balance across sources). Maxent model produced reasonable potential distribution of Rhododendrons. It is found that the suitable bioclimatic envelope for Rhododendron has shrunk considerably under the envisaged climate change scenario. The statistical criteria used to estimate accuracy of the model is Area under ROC (Receiver Operating Curve).,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:vct99db0rDQC,2,http://www.sikenvis.nic.in/writereaddata/11-Chapter_Biogeographic_Response_of_Rhododendrons_to_Climate_Change_in_Sikkim_Himalaya.pdf,8690702546536331924,/scholar?cites=8690702546536331924,,http://www.sikenvis.nic.in/writereaddata/11-Chapter_Biogeographic_Response_of_Rhododendrons_to_Climate_Change_in_Sikkim_Himalaya.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Most aerosol-cloud-climate assessment studies assume that aerosol with a substantial fraction of soluble material are the sole source of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN). However. insoluble species can also act as good CCN. even if they lack appreciable amounts of soluble material. The source of hygroscopicity in these particles is the adsorption of water vapor onto the surface of the particle. Moreover. during atmospheric transport. fresh dust undergoes aging which results in a coating of soluble material on its surface that augments its CCN activity. Given that dust may affect precipitation in climate-sensitive areas. the ability to capture the complex impact of mineral dust on cloud droplet formation is an important issue for global and regional models. The “unified dust activation framework” of Kumar et al. (2011) can be used to calculate the CCN activity of both fresh and aged dust.

The amorphous state is critical in determining the solid state. physical and chemical properties of many pharmaceutical dosage forms. The main reason of the growing interest toward amorphous materials is the need to improve the bioavailability of drugs with poor aqueous solubility. Many drugs exist in crystalline solid form due to reasons of stability and ease of handling during the various stages of drug development. Conversion of the crystalline to amorphous form may occur during various pharmaceutical processes. This could change the dissolution rate and transport characteristics of the drug. The current focus of research in this area is to understand the origins of amorphous forms. The various thermodynamic phenomena such as glass transition. fragility. molecular mobility. devitrification kinetics. molecular level chemical interactions. solubility and stability are critically discussed. The aim of this review is to understand the recent development in the area of amorphous state and to address the current challenges faced by pharmaceutical formulation and process development scientists and thus is mandatory to anticipate future developments.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:JjBZBFkNMTQC,2,http://indonesianjpharm.farmasi.ugm.ac.id/index.php/3/article/view/665,15709483846016668677,/scholar?cites=15709483846016668677,,http://indonesianjpharm.farmasi.ugm.ac.id/index.php/3/article/view/665/531,0,0,0

Power System Stabilizers (PSS) are commonly used to damp these low frequency oscillations. The parameters of the PSS (gain. phase lead time constant) are tuned by considering the single machine connected to infinite bus system (SMIB). Tuning of these parameters for the system considered can be done using various design techniques.

The QoS provisioning algorithms developed in mobile ad hoc networks might not be applied directly in wireless mesh networks. since. WiMax based backhaul mesh networks have different characteristics. In this paper. to solve the routing and resource allocation issues. we propose to design a joint routing and bandwidth allocation protocol for WiMAX networks. In this protocol. a bandwidth estimation technique is combined with route discovery and setup in order to find a best route. While estimating the bandwidth. both local bandwidth and the bandwidth of all nodes within the interference range. are considered. The bandwidth estimation technique is applied on the standard on-demand routing protocol by modifying the route request and route reply packets. By simulation results. we show that the proposed protocol achieves more throughput and bandwidth utilization when compared with the existing protocol.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:MKvDIwB-zewC,2,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/224b/84749f9e470bdc38bc66abd84d72398a984a.pdf,3208397652751886400,/scholar?cites=3208397652751886400,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/224b/84749f9e470bdc38bc66abd84d72398a984a.pdf,0,0,0

85135,A note on demand draft charges levied by banks in India,2010,Ashish Das and Rajeev Kumar and Prasanna Kumar,,,,,,In this paper we study the service charges levied by banks on demand drafts in India. Though RBI advocated reasonability of service charges for demand drafts as early as February 2007. it did not prescribe any explicit thresholds or measures of reasonability. We try to propose a rationalization of such charges by looking into the demand draft charges of 37 select banks comprising 89% of the network of bank branches in India. It is observed that among the select banks the highest service charge for issue of demand draft (having value upto Rs. 10.000) is Rs. 550 while the same is Rs. 1000 for cancellation. Similarly. for issue of demand drafts. having value more than Rs. 10.000. such charges range from 0% to 0.45% of the draft amount. After more than 36 months of RBI’s advice to banks on reasonability of service charges for demand draft issue. we find that more than 10% of the banks have not prescribed a ceiling for demand draft charges. Also. among those who have set a cap. the maximum demand draft charge has been set as high as Rs. 30.000. The analysis carried out here has an underlying premise that competitive market pricing is required to safeguard consumer interest. and if market fails to have a pricing structure which is competitive. it becomes imperative to take recourse to public policy to protect consumer interest. Focusing at the reasonability of service charges levied by banks for issuing demand drafts. the study provides benchmarks and concludes that there is a need to rationalize and bring in uniformity in the amount of service charges for demand drafts.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:kuq-04jA658C,2,http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/10054/1728,3016493506693134527,/scholar?cites=3016493506693134527,,http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/1728/demand_draft_2010.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

85142,Experimental Study on Lightweight Aggregate Concrete,2010,P Sundar Kumar and MJ Ratna Kanth Babu and K Sundara Kumar and K Satish Kumar,1,Int. J. Civ. Eng. Res.,1,65-74,,Lightweight concrete (LWC) has been successfully used since the ancient Roman times and it has gained its popularity due to its lower density and superior thermal insulation properties. Compared with normal weight concrete (NWC). LWC can significantly reduce the dead load of structural elements. which makes it especially attractive in multi-storey buildings. However. most studies on LWC concern “semi-lightweight “concretes. ie concrete made with lightweight coarse aggregate and natural sand to manufacture the “totallightweight” concrete. more environmental and economical benefits can be achieved if waste materials can be used to replace the fine lightweight aggregate. With increasing concern over the excessive exploitation of natural aggregates. synthetic lightweight aggregate produced from environmental waste is a viable new source of structural aggregate material. The uses of structural grade lightweight concrete reduced considerably the self-load of a structure and permit larger pre-cast units to be handled. The mechanical properties of a structural grade lightweight aggregate made with fly ash and clay will be presented.It is well know that in general fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF) increases the compressive strength. splitting tensile strength and flexural strength of concrete.

85143,Mobility Management for Seamless Flow of Real Time Information in Heterogeneous Networks,2009,Adiline Macriga and P Anandha Kumar,,,,524-527,IEEE,Today's Industrial growth mainly depends on the real time and on line information rather than stored data. It is a challenging one for the communication industry to provide the required information continuously without delay. As the communication industry is considered the major factor is the interconnection between the different networks and the cooperation between the service providers in the form of QoS. The major issue is the mobility management (MM) to provide and maintain connectivity between the different networks. Here in this paper an approach is proposed for MM based on the session management. location management which are common to any type of network. By considering and having the control over the common control management techniques the flow of information is maintained without/ with delay based on the services offered i.e... either online service or offline service.

E-Spring Algorithm. derived from the popular spring embedder model. was proposed to eliminate node overlaps in the drawings of clustered directed acyclic graphs Gc. In this paper. we apply the E-Spring algorithm to general graphs by minimizing edge-node intersections. Initially. a tree structure is extracted from the original graph using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The extracted tree is then visualized without node overlaps using the E-Spring algorithm. and the remaining non-tree edges are appended to this visualization. A post-processing step that implements edge routing is performed on the obtained visualization to eliminate residual edge-node intersections.

Orthogonal codes are integral part of any broadband cellular systems. In this paper. we studied the performance of DS-CDMA signals with Walsh-Hadamard orthogonal codes. orthogonal gold codes and quadratic-residue (QR) orthogonal codes in a quasi-synchronous transmission. The synchronization error considered is smaller than the chip duration. We evaluate the maximum synchronization error that can be tolerated so that complete error-free despreading is guaranteed for all the three orthogonal codes in the absence of additive white Gaussian noise.

Plastics play a key role. in the manufacture of materials pertaining to clothing. shelter. transportation. communication. entertainment. health care etc. Plastics possess many attractive properties. such as lightweight. high strength and ease of processing and hence they meet a large share of the material needs of man. The ever-growing need and consumption of average plastic is more than 150 million tones per year and we are truly living in a plastic age.The highly durable property of the plastics. their presence in the environment are regarded as environmental hazard. due to their biologically inert character. The rapid increase in production and consumption of plastics has led to the serious plastic waste problem so-called ‘white pollution’. and landfill depletion due to their high volume to weight ratio and resistance to degradation (Ren. 2003).

Retrieving the partial similar images generally requires a huge amount of storage space for indexes due to the large number of portions of images. The proposed method constructs the ternary tree. which greatly reduces the storage space for database images and fast retrieval. The computation of tree structure is not a computationally intensive task and tree comparison won’t take much time to find the best match image. The system is capable of accepting any size of query image decided by user and retrieves the whole images from the database. The retrieval time is of the order of seconds ranging from 42 milliseconds to 10 seconds and translation independent.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:2VmNxfDIOWgC,2,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.496.5759&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5577454172805653989,/scholar?cites=5577454172805653989,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.496.5759&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Petiole length; length of the first. second and third leaflets; total leaflet length; total leaflet length+ petiole length; width of the first. second and third leaflet; and the total calculated were identified as the independent variables. and the total graphical area as the dependent variable. All the independent variables had high significant positive correlation (94.4-341.1 cm 2). contributing significantly to the variation recorded in the independent variable. Based on the coefficient of determination. 61.38% of the variation in the total leaf area was attributed to petiole length. while the calculated leaf area accounted for 99.4% of the variation. The comparative efficiency of the correction factor and regression coefficients (RE) indicated that the lowest deviation between the actual area and the estimated area was from-5.46 to 6.13% for the total calculated area (X 10). while the highest (from-30.48 to 13.12%) was observed for the third leaflet length (X 3).

Group A patients were subjected to standard haemodialysis (HD) for 4 hours using holofibre dialyser and group B patients received 36 hours of peritoneal dialysis (PD) where Verapamil was added intraperitonealy in the dose of 10 mg/L/cycle in the clearance periods III. V. VII. IX and XI (Total dose 150 mg). The 36 hours of PD consisted of 36 cycles of one hour duration each and these were divided into 12 clearance periods (CP) of 3 cycles each. Following both the forms of dialytic treatments. there was significant improvement in the signs of uraemia with fall in the blood urea and serum creatinine levels. The peritoneal clearances. percentage fall of urea and creatinine. and protein loss were similar in the two groups (p> 0.5). However. ultrafiltration was significantly higher in the group B. No untoward effects were noticed in group B however group A patients had episodes of hypotension (5)] disequilibrium (6) and cardiac arrhythmias (1). It can be concluded that both clinically and biochemically. 36 hours of Verapamil added PD and 4 hours of hemodialysis are comparable and therefore. peritoneal dialysis may be used more frequently in acute renal failure specially in situations where trained dialysis staff is not available and patients are not haemodynamically stable.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:ItgTnG0mAXQC,2,https://europepmc.org/article/med/9355712,4722640794313031455,/scholar?cites=4722640794313031455,,,0,0,0

Subsequent reflected waves in the crystal were minimized by use of a longitudinal momentum trap and a specially designed flyer plate shape. A laser displacement interferometer was employed to monitor the transmitted wave profile so that the stress wave loading of the crystal could be determined. An etch pit technique was used to examine changes in dislocation structure. Dislocation density was observed to increase by factors of 22 to 425. The number of dislocations generated is very strongly stress dependent. with a marked increase in dislocation generation for resolved shear stress above. 08 GPa.

It provides high levels of vitamins. minerals. and antioxidants and just a small number of calories. Water melons have become synonymous with summer and picnics. and for good reason. Their refreshing quality and sweet taste help to combat the heat and provide a guilt-free. low maintenance dessert. Along with cantaloupe and honeydew. watermelons are a member of the botanical family Cucurbitaceae. There are five common types of watermelon: seeded. seedless. mini (also known as personal). yellow. and orange. The objective of the present research work was to evaluate in vivo anti diabetic activity of ethanolic extract of water melon (EE-WMN). The present experimental data displayed the blood glucose level 283.5±0.4238–284.2±0.02217 mg/dL mg/dL in STZ induced diabetic rats. which was considered as severe diabetes in the glibenclamide (5 mg/kg) and EE-WMN (100. 200 and 300 mg/kg) treated groups. the peak values of blood sugar and cholesterol and triglycerides significantly reduced on the 21st day. respectively. Hence. this experimental data displayed that the EE-WMN significantly decrease the blood glucose level in diabetic rats but values did not return to those of normal controls. Therefore. the EE-WMN executed anti diabetic activity. when compared with diabetic control.

85223,Role of water absorbing materials in vegetable production,2018,Panda Arun Kumar and Galipothula Anil Kumar and K Vennela,7,Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry,2,3639-3644,,The water scarcity is expected to be aggravated further as fast decline of irrigation water potential in most of the countries especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. As per the global survey. the worst affected areas would be the semi-arid regions of Asia (India). the Middle-East and Sub-Saharan Africa. The technique has a great water absorption capacity by its own weight which helps in improving soil moisture capacity and hence reduces water stress on the plant during prolonged drought stress condition and during irrigation intervals. Quantity of total water required for the irrigation is also reduced by 15 to 50% when the soil conditioning by SAP in different proportion is adopted. Considering the high cost and increasing prices of crude oil. the necessity of preparing natural based SAPs seems more obvious. This paves the way for further developments in this area in the mid and far future ahead. Todays research has proved the ability of natural materials. eg Polysaccharides and Proteins. to perform super absorbent properties in pure Water and saline solution (0.9% wt.) within the same range as synthetic polyacrylates do in current applications. The agricultural sector (irrigation). which currently consumes over 80 percent of the available water in India. continues to be the major water-consuming sector due to the intensification of agriculture (Saleth. 1996).

The primary focus of the available theories is to investigate the effect of nonlinearities associated with the distributed self-weight of the cable and its finite elastic displacements. The main point of departure of this paper is to study the effect of the configurational nonlinearity of the weightless linear elastic suspension cables undergoing small elastic displacements. Based upon authors’ theory of weightless elasto-flexible planar sagging cables. a new Beam with Elasto-Flexible Support (BEFS) model of the cable-deck interaction is proposed here. Rate-type constitutive equations and third order differential equations of motion are derived for a simple four-node cable-suspended beam structure undergoing small elastic vertical displacements. Static and dynamic analysis of the cable-suspended structures is carried out to reveal their characteristic configurational response. The proposed theory is critically evaluated in the context of existing theories of suspension bridges.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:oFKsPyNwwpYC,1,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-78252017000300544&script=sci_arttext,8456934720393781170,/scholar?cites=8456934720393781170,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-78252017000300544&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Geography Series,1,58-66,,River is important for every human being as well as flora and fauna. Over the last century. riverine ecosystems have suffered from intense human intervention resulting in habitat loss and degradation and as a consequence. many biotic species have become highly endangered. particular in rivers where heavy demand is placed on freshwaters. This study was aimed to estimate the pollution status and their variation across the stretch of river Gomti flowing through the city of Jaunpur. The sampling is concerned from upstream to downstream regions of the river through the city. Four sampling sites namely. Gokul Ghat (upstream). Gular Ghat. Shastri Bridge and Gomti Barrage (downstream) were selected for sampling. The water samples were collected and analyzed for a period of one year during March 2016 to February 2017. For the study total 6 parameters such as Temperature. pH. Dissolved Oxygen (DO). Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). Nitrate (NO 3-) and Phosphate (PO 4 3-) were detected with reference to the monsoonal variation (summer. monsoon and winter).

The diverging section on multilane urban roads or national highways in India. is mostly supplemented with a flyover at its downstream. The purpose of providing flyover is that there is provision for vehicles to make U-turn and merge to traffic flowing in different direction. Therefore. for merging maneuver. flyover is on upstream side. This study is targeted on studying microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics at diverging section. For that purpose. videographic survey of traffic flow was done using two cameras on urban multilane road in Delhi. Spot speed data were also collected at upstream and downstream of diverging section using speed radar gun. simultaneously. From the extracted traffic video. flow. headway and speed data were analyzed. It was found that shoulder side lanes have significant proportion of vehicles from all categories because of diverging operation. Speed data was found to be normally distributed across all lanes. Moreover. spot-speed study was conducted at the upstream of diverging (100 m upstream) as well as at the location of diverging section. It showed significant reduction in speeds of different vehicle categories over the section due to presence of diverging operation. Based on fitting of various distribution patterns on headway. it was also found that headway data is either following log-normal or Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. But. log-normal distribution could not fit for observed headway data for all four lanes in one direction (for eight-lane divided carriageway).

Local texture facets are considered to be one of the useful approaches for texture analysis. Local texture facets comprise data about the texture behavior. The present approach extracts the texture primitive units (TPU) and texture primitive spectrum (TPS) for classification of the textures. The present paper derives a feature extraction algorithm based on TPS using wavelet decomposed images. The TPU describe the local-texture information for a given pixel and its 3×3 neighborhood. The occurrence spreading of TPUs is called as TPS. The present paper proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on TPS using wavelet decomposed images.

Currently. literature suggests to adopt a linear clearance limit of 6tp. where tp is the thickness of the gusset plate but the experimental and analytical data supporting this notion is found lacking. So an attempt was made here using a continuum based software to understand the implications of adopting different varied linear clearances for mid span gusset plates. Two single storied frame models with two different brace slenderness (90 and 175). with four different linear clearances (6tp. 8tp. 12tp and 30tp) were developed and cyclic loads were applied to understand their response. It was found that if the middle gusset plate is properly designed then there is not much difference in the energy dissipation capacity of the frame and also the level of damage in the frame with lower slenderness ratio was found severe than the ones with higher slenderness ratio.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:d2hLqSNro9AC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashwin_P_C/publication/283894575_Study_on_the_in-elastic_performance_of_mid-span_gusset_plate_used_in_concentrically_braced_frames/links/564c30b908ae020ae9f875bf/Study-on-the-in-elastic-performance-of-mid-span-gusset-plate-used-in-concentrically-braced-frames.pdf,7842194804892052740,/scholar?cites=7842194804892052740,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashwin_P_C/publication/283894575_Study_on_the_in-elastic_performance_of_mid-span_gusset_plate_used_in_concentrically_braced_frames/links/564c30b908ae020ae9f875bf/Study-on-the-in-elastic-performance-of-mid-span-gusset-plate-used-in-concentrically-braced-frames.pdf,0,0,0
85279,Development of Ultra High Performance Concrete Using Mineral Admixtures and Steel Fibers,2015,Piyush Kumar and Maneek Guide Kumar,,,,,,Ultra-High Performance Fibre-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) is a relatively new construction material. which is a combination of high performance concrete and fibre reinforcement. The compressive strength reaches beyond 150 MPa. which allows the construction of sustainable and economic buildings with an extraordinarily slim design. In general the aim is to achieve such high strength keeping the cement content under permissible limits. The aim herein is to develop a concrete mix incorporating silica fume. nano silica and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) with the addition of different percentages of steel fibers. which provides for high performance. durability and better serviceability in addition to overall economy in the long run. In this study. the compressive strength of UHPFRC is studied closely for different percentages of steel fibers with three w/b ratios (0.22. 0.20. and 0.18). The purpose is to have such proportions of materials. including cement replacement materials like silica fume. nana-silica. GGBS etc.. which on mixing would be able to provide compressive strengths in the range of 125 to 150 MPa at 28 days. The studies were carried at an early age of 7 days as well. The workability of the different mixtures was constantly maintained by optimum usage of superplasticizers. The results showed that with the increase in the amount of steel fibers the compressive strength of the matrix increased. The maximum strength of UHPFRC. which was achieved under laboratory conditions. was 158 MPa. after 28 days of curing. This strength was achieved for the mix wherein the overall binder content included 8% silica fume. 2% nano …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:CREiCvMVTUAC,1,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/handle/10266/3845,15039416291733220740,/scholar?cites=15039416291733220740,,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/bitstream/10266/3845/4/3845.pdf,0,0,0

85299,LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES OF THE RURAL YOUTH–CRITICAL ANALYSIS,2015,Pushpendra Kumar,,,,,,The distinction between “work time”. “committed time” and “leisure time” is some time difficult to make and some activities are not easy to separate. For example. cooking for a family every day may be seen as a real work chore. by a housewife but it might be seen as an enjoyable leisure pastime by those. who are not compelled to do it every day. The same activity may be work for one person and yet not work for another. (Dumazedier. 1960). Uttar Pradesh state was selected purposively as the investigator belongs to this state and well acquainted with the respondent’s culture and the population of the youth also higher as compared to other states (Census 2011). Out of 75 districts. only one districts i.e.. Hardoi was selected purposively for the present study because of convenience and time factor. The district of Hardoi is administratively divided in 19 CD Blocks. Since the proposed study in depth and comprehensive one block namely Behandar were selected randomly. The selected C.D. Block Behandar and their 5 villages’ respondents/ youth were randomly selected. These selected villagers have been presented further. The respondents are main source of data.

The purpose of this work is to investigate a new kind of automata which is inspired by an extension of 2DPDAs. Mogensen enhanced these with what he called a WORM (write once. read many) track and showed that Cook’s Lineartime simulation result still holds. Here we trade the pushdown store for non determinism or a pebble and show that the languages of these new types of finite automata are still regular. The conjunction of alternation or of non determinism and a pebble permits the recognition of non-regular languages. We have given examples of languages that are easy to recognize and of operations that are easy to perform using these WORM tracks under non determinism.

The construction of Petri-Nets was used for both semantic description and event detection within traffic videos. The major novelties of this paper are extensions to both the modeling and the recognition capacities of Object Petri-Nets (PN). The detection of object level features are done with the help of state of art techniques like Gaussian Mixture of Models (GMM). and a series of Petri-Nets composed of various objects is proposed to describe the video content. The expected outcome of the proposed framework is that we can easily build semantic detectors based on PNs to search within traffic videos and identify interesting events.

The two critical. low-level computer vision tasks that have been undertaken in this work are: Foreground-Background Segmentation and Object Tracking. We expand the basic philosophy of Background Subtraction used widely for foreground-background segmentation. This involves the subtraction of the current image from a reference or estimated background image. The error image is then threshold to detect the foreground pixels. We use a stochastic model of the background and also adapt the representation through time. This adaptive nature is essential for long-term surveillance applications. mainly when the background composition or intensity distribution changes with time.

Production of concrete needs usage of large quantities of cement. Production of cement involves release of Carbon dioxide into the environment. Hence. to reduce these emissions the most effective way is to replace cement with other materials. Fly ash is a promising replacement material for cement because of improvement in durability over long term.The penetrability of concrete is not desired and affects the durability of concrete so in this paper a detailed presentation of experimental investigations carried out is made. These investigations are carried out to evaluate the penetrability properties by Rapid Chloride Permeability Test of concrete specimens in which cement was partially replaced with Class F fly ash are presented. 30%. 40%. 50% and 60% percentages of Class F fly ash by weight and volume fractions are used to replace cement. Tests were performed for which chloride penetration was determined after 28 days and 90 days of curing. Test results indicate that the chloride penetration in concrete containing fly ash is reduced.

However. there are risks associated with eating cultured fish owing to the infection by helminthic parasites. Parasitic fish diseases are posing a problem for breeders in India cultivating fish for food. Despite several attempts to control these parasites. infestation continues to grow and until effective measures of control are devised and implemented. a serious decline in fish population is expected.

UPLC is a better technique than HPLC in terms of performance and speed. so it was selected. The method was developed using Waters Aquity BEH shield RP C18 (2.1 x 100mm. 1.7 μm) column with mobile phase containing a mixture of Acetonitrile and 0.05 MPhosphate buffer (pH 4.5) in the ratio of 35: 65 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The eluted compounds were monitored at 245 nm. Results: The retention time of Hydrochlorothiazide and Eprosartan was found to be 0.902 min and 2.075 min respectively. The developed method was validated as per international conference on harmonization (ICH) guidelines with respect to linearity. limit of detection. limit of quantification. accuracy. precision and robustness. The precision was found to be within the limits. The linearity studies indicated the drug obeys Beer’s law and revealed the specified range of linearity for Hydrochlorothiazide was between 1.25-6.25 µg/ml and for Eprosartan 25-125µg/ml. The robustness was observed from the insignificant variation in the analysis by changes in flow rate. mobile phase ratio.Conclusion: The rapid gradient UPLC method developed for quantitative analysis of Eprosartan and Hydrochlorothiazide in pharmaceutical dosage forms is precise. accurate. linear. robust and specific.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:f2PrUAIjnKUC,1,https://japer.in/storage/models/article/XBP37EEczsL0vSKqM18RDV1L0ShBYfS4eFZzH4TVHyC8SR68VVvNmAQug6iH/development-and-validation-uplc-method-for-simultaneous-determination-of-hydrochlorothiazide-and-e.pdf,12663616990154788203,/scholar?cites=12663616990154788203,,https://japer.in/storage/models/article/XBP37EEczsL0vSKqM18RDV1L0ShBYfS4eFZzH4TVHyC8SR68VVvNmAQug6iH/development-and-validation-uplc-method-for-simultaneous-determination-of-hydrochlorothiazide-and-e.pdf,0,0,0

Mobile agent is a program segment which is self-controlling. The mobile agents have no security mechanism and authentication scheme is used to permit mobile agents to perform computations. Due to lacks of security aspects when applied to MANET where nodes cannot be classified as they are malicious or not. hence for the cases where the security of data or reliability of agent became must we need some method to insure the things. Thus. In this paper. we propose a Admission Control Mechanism on hierarchical model architecture of MANET maintained by Mobile agent using secure and priority based routing algorithm with effective security authentication technique. Our technique has three phases. In Initial phase. Admission Control method-where we provide admission of mobile nodes in hierarchical model.

85374,Liquid jet interaction with a moving surface,2011,Purushotam Kumar,,,,,,Description An experimental study was conducted to study the splash-deposition characteristics of a liquid jet impinging on a moving surface. The main focus of this study was to determine the effects of fluid. flow and surface properties on the outcome of the jet impingement. Several parameters such as fluid viscosity. elasticity and surface tension. jet and surface velocity. jet diameter surface wettability and surface roughness were changed and their effects on splash-deposition characteristics were analyzed during this research work. For non-Newtonian fluids increase in the yield stress and consistency constant of the fluids helps in inhibition of the splash. At high Weber number the effects of surface tension and jet impingement angle were negligible compared to effects of Reynolds and Oldroyd numbers. But at smaller Weber number effects of surface tension were comparable to that of Reynolds number. It was also observed that the both normal (jet velocity) and tangential (surface speed) speeds play roles in splash-deposition dynamics. Newtonian liquid jet with smaller diameter illustrated that effect of surface tension becomes prominent only for liquids with low viscosities and for these liquids and 200 micron nozzle jets deposit up to 40 m/s. For high viscosity liquid same trend of deposition was observed and jets deposit up to 35 m/s. It was also observed that the jets of smaller viscosities spread on the surface very easily. making few micron sized lamella. Although higher viscosities liquid jets still spread very easily on the surface. the lamella thickness was much larger than that of low viscosity liquids.

85383,Hailstorm with very low vertical wind shear and tilt over Trivandrum,2010,P Kumar,,,,,American Meteorological Society,Strong vertical wind shear of the order of 70-100 kt between 850 to 200hPa and tilted angle of≈ 25 0 (Cheng 1989) is commonly considered helpful for the formation of hailstones in cumulonimbus clouds due to taking away of detrained air from the top of the cloud which in turn helps in removing the heat of fusion caused due to the hail formation. Moreover. tilt in vertical prevents the high concentration of precipitation that might overload the updraft and cause it to decay by limiting the time of residence in the region of growth. But the hailstorm on 17 May 1984 reported at Trivandrum (8 29'N. 76 59 E) located on coastal Kerala in south India was different. T-Ф gram of Trivandrum indicated very weak vertical wind shear of 22 kt between 850 to 200 hPa. Equilibrium level could be marked close to 15 Km amsl Hailstones of size≈ 1.0 Cm were reported over a wide area with hailpath of 10-15 Km. Small vertical tilt of≤ 10 0 only persisted. Formation of hailstones despite poor ventilation provided by the weak top level wind could be attributed to very high top of the cumulonimbus. This provided quite large internal volume of the cloud for the dispersal of latent heat of fusion. released during hail formation. preventing any heating effect to reverse freezing process. However. low vertical tilt did not support the re-entry of the particles grown in the first ascent to re-grow. Hence only small size hailstones (≈ 1.0 Cm) could form.It is concluded that though vertical wind shear is helpful condition for the growth of hailstones in cumulonimbus but they could still form in cumulonimbus with very weak wind shear (≈ 20-25 kt between 850 to 200 hPa) provided the top of the …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:PD-wXv1Sh1EC,1,https://ams.confex.com/ams/25SLS/techprogram/paper_175387.htm,7757082271003974377,/scholar?cites=7757082271003974377,,,0,0,0
85384,Current practices for pavement condition monitoring of road infrastructure in India,2010,Pradeep Kumar and BM Sharma and K Sitaramanjaneyulu,,,,,,Development. maintenance. operation and management of roads in India. particularly the National Highways and State Highways (which are arterial roads). is currently under going big transformation. A large proportion of existing road network still requires reconstruction and rehabilitation so as to sustain and keep up the momentum of high economic growth in the country. Pavement condition evaluation and its monitoring is of paramount importance for Highways Departments since good quality of pavement surface not only offers efficient and economical transportation but is also judged by the road users with regard to the level of service in terms of smoothness (skid resistance) and riding comfort (roughness). Significant advances have been made in the recent past in respect of condition monitoring of road networks through the use of automated and high output road surveys which can be done at normal traffic flow speed. This paper discusses the current practices used in India for measurement of pavement surface roughness and describes various equipments which are deployed for the collection of such data. Results/data obtained from extensive road surveys. conducted by the institute in the past many years for a large road network. are also presented in the paper and have subsequently been applied for assessing the construction quality of State and National Highways in India. New/recent technologies. now available worldwide. for measurement of pavement surface roughness and which can have potential applications in India too are also described in the paper.(a) For the covering record of this conference. please refer to ITRD abstract no …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:9kBY04P_Y_YC,1,https://trid.trb.org/view/1096983,10420620970867806284,/scholar?cites=10420620970867806284,,,0,0,0

This results in evolution of joint properties over time. and thereby influences the long-term reliability of microelectronic packages. Accurate prediction of this aging behavior is therefore critical for joint reliability predictions. Here. we study the coarsening behavior of ball grid array (BGA) joints of Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu (SAC387) solder attached to ENIG bond-pads with four different thermo-mechanical histories. Both Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5  precipitates underwent rapid coarsening due to the combined effects of the temperature and superimposed inelastic strain. However. following aging. the Cu 6 Sn 5  particles were much coarser than the Ag 3 Sn precipitates. and numbered about ~100 times less.

Number of anti-inflammatory phthalimide analogues have been synthesized as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors. TNF-α plays a critical role in certain physiological immune systems and its over-production causes severe damage to the host. It promotes the inflammatory response leading to many of the clinical problems associated with auto-immune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Crohn's disease. ankylosing spondylitis. psoriasis and refractory asthma. One of the phthalimide derivatives. LASSBio-468. was recently demonstrated to inhibit TNF-α production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). in vivo. Its potential against chronic inflammatory diseases was also witnessed. Another derivative. DIMP. showed good anti-androgenic activity. These analogues have also been employed for the synthesis of several kinds of important therapeutic synthones.

Presently blockhouse telemetry front-end helical antenna is manually steered at the blockhouse top. This is a concern of safety and does not give any guarantee of acquiring data due to the poor visibility when the airborne vehicle goes far off.

Models that use the minimization constraint on energy expenditure have been successful in reproducing the branching tree patterns but the mechanism that enables the systems to find these extremal states remains elusive. We postulate that inherent random perturbation in the system environment is a sufficient condition for the generation of tree patterns. We demonstrate this. using a numerical river network evolution model driven by erosion-deposition processes under a gravitation gradient. and show that the minimization of energy expenditure is a consequent signature.

The vast road networks exceed 3.3 million kilometers. including about 65.569 km of National Highways. 1. 31.899 km of State Highways and 4. 70.000 km Major District Roads and other roads. indicative of the diversity and sizes. The country is experiencing rapid growth in motorized vehicles that is impacting transportation infrastructure. The total vehicle fleet has grown from 0.3 to 67 million between 1951 and 20035. Goods vehicle fleet registrations have increased 42 folds. from 82.000 in 1951 to 3.5 million in 20036. The road sector's share of freight traffic has increased from 11 percent in 1950 to over 70 percent in 20037. The national and state highways of India are major corridors of movement. Traffic on these major arteries of India is growing at a rate of 5 to 10% per annum. Most of the national highways are twolane. single or intermediate lane. About 10 percent of national highways are four-lane. Of the total primary network (NH and SH) 2-3% are 4 laned and 15% are single laned8. Approximately 80-90 percent of the national and state highways are suitable for a standard axle load of 8.16 tonnes and are not structurally adequate for permissible axle loads of 10.2 tonnes9. However over 50 percent of the national and state highways. and a higher percentage of other roads. are in a bad condition10. About 25 percent of national and state highways are congested.

The lack of both high-Al and high-Mg spinels in the Digboi-Margherita sequence suggests strongly that the detrital spinels of the Assam basin did not originate in a mid-ocean-ridge source.

85432,Graphical interface for rural road accessibility planning,2003,P Kumar and S Chandra and Varun Singh,64,Journal of the Indian Roads Congress,1,,,Majority of residents (over 70 per cent) of developing countries live in rural areas and they are devoid of basic social and economic facilities like health. water. and education due to poor access to these facilities. Number of trips made within and outside the village by rural community depends on its accessibility to the vital services and facilities. so by offering proper mobility and access to rural residents to their basic social-economic needs. transportation functions as an indispensable cornerstone of overall rural development.. In this Paper development of user-friendly computerized graphical interface for Rural Road Accessibility Planning (RRAP) using the concepts of Facility Based Rural Network Planning (FBRNP) Model has been carried out. After developing the graphical interface for RRAP using the concepts of FBRNP Model. the main advantages offered by interface are (i) Graphical representation of the optimized network with interactive querying about link and villages is possible.(ii) Effective handling of database generated through road and household surveys.(iii) Flexibility to take on-line decision.(iv) Different social-economic facilities can be considered together for optimization. and (v) Interface gives detailed results of the optimization.(A),True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:JZsVLox4iN8C,1,https://trid.trb.org/view/701813,12342374573813474760,/scholar?cites=12342374573813474760,,,0,0,0

The rate-[H+] plots show nearly bell-shaped profiles in the presence of added chloride. The rate-dependence in [CAT] changes from second order to first order as [H+] and [Cl-] are varied. The reactions generally show fractional order kinetics in [AA] and inverse dependence in [H+] except in the acid range 0.05-0.20 mol dm(-3). Mechanisms consistent with the observed results are discussed. The rate-limiting steps have been identified and constants of these steps calculated.

In Physarum. chromosomal DNA synthesis is confined approximately to the first one-third of the cell cycle which comprises the S phase. and rDNA and mitochondrial DNA are synthesized throughout the cycle except during mitosis and early S phase. Taking advantage of these facts. DNA of the plasmodia was substituted with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine at a concentration where it had no effect on DNA synthesis per se during different phases of the cell cycle before exposure to UV during late G2.

85460,GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM: A TECHNOLOGY FOR TRANSPORT ENGINEERS,1996,SK Soni and BK Durai and P Kumar and AVSR MURTY,24,Indian Highways,2,,,This article discusses the definition. concepts and capabilities of geographical information systems (GIS). with special reference to its use in India. and outlines its potential applications to highway and transport engineering. GIS technology uses a topological approach whereby it can extract information from one layer of topology. in relation to other layers. and integrate information from different layers. It is the most sophisticated member of a family of computer graphics systems. with various capabilities for database management and spatial functions; uniquely among these systems. it can handle both topology and attributes. It is essential for the effective use of large amounts of remotely sensed data. The Survey of India is using two sophisticated GIS systems. and satellite data. to create a digital topographic database of India at the basic scales of 1: 250.000 and 1: 500.000. Potential applications of GIS to highway infrastructure management include:(1) executive information system;(2) pavement management system;(3) bridge management;(4) maintenance management;(5) safety management;(6) transport system management;(7) travel demand forecasting;(8) corridor preservation;(9) construction management;(10) accident analysis; and (11) environmental impact assessment.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:gM-ZYMRJdBUC,1,https://trid.trb.org/view/468985,17769397544885493556,/scholar?cites=17769397544885493556,,,0,0,0

Aqueous solutions of both block copolymers were micellar at very low concentrations. Several methods were used to study the micellar solutions: dynamic light scattering and pulsed field-gradient spin–echo (PGSE) NMR for the hydrodynamic properties of the micelles. static light scattering for micellar molar mass and association number. and surface tension and light scattering for critical micellisation concentration (c.m.c.).

All the catheters were inserted percutaneously by internal jugular approach and the placement of catheters was confirmed by chest roentgenography while injecting Conray 420. The safety of the technique was evaluated in terms of success and complication rates. Failure rate was only 0.8 per cent. while overall complication rate was 17.6 per cent. Arterial puncture and hematoma were the commonest complications encountered in 8 and 4 per cent of the patients respectively. Pneumothorax occurred in two patients (1.6%). while misplacement of catheter tip and thrombophlebitis was encountered in 0.8 per cent of all cannulations. No microorganisms were isolated from catheters inserted for less than 5 days. Positive catheter-tip cultures. by quantitative method. were obtained in 41 cases (P< 0.001) of which infected intravenous insert growing> 10 (3) colony forming units. was encountered in 36 (P< 0.001) and colonization of the catheter (< 10 (3) colony forming units) was seen in 5 cases. Catheter related bacteremia (recovery of the same organism from the catheter tip and peripheral blood cultures) occurred in 31 of these 41 patients (P< 0.01). The study reveals that internal jugular approach is a safe technique for central vein catheterization with very high success rate and fewer complications.

The space requirement of FQT depends on the type of regions contained in the image. In some cases. the FQT structure is as costly as QT structure in terms of storage. In this article we compute the probability of FQT structure reducing to QT structure with the assumption that each pixel in the binary image has equal probability to be black or white.

85502,Limiting slenderness ratio for hollow square braces in special concentrically braced frames,,PC Ashwin Kumar and Dipti Ranjan Sahoo and Nitin Kumar,,,,,,Special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) are commonly used to resist lateral forces in structures located in high-seismic regions. Steel braces undergo inelastic axial deformations and thus provides an adequate level of structural ductility and hysteretic energy dissipation capability to the frame under cyclic loading. Past studies have shown that the slenderness ratio and the width-to-thickness ratio of braces are primarily responsible for achieving enhanced seismic response in SCBFs. An increase in the brace slenderness ratio results in a reduction in its energy dissipation capacity along with a simultaneous increase in the ductility nearing its fracture. Since both energy dissipation capacity and ductility of braces are essential parameters in quantifying the seismic performance of SCBFs. there is a need of establishing the optimum range of brace slenderness ratio and width-to-thickness ratio. The main objective of this study is to find an optimum range as well as the lower limits of these parameters for braces of hollow square steel (HSS) sections. An extensive finite element (FE) parametric study has been conducted on a wide range of values of these parameters using a commercial software package ABAQUS. The FE models accounts for the inelastic hysteretic characteristics and the fracture behavior of braces. The results of simulation models matched very well with the past experimental results with respect to the performance points. namely. global buckling. local buckling. fracture initiation. complete fracture and ductility. Finally. the relationship between the lower limit of slenderness ratio and the width-to-thickness of square braces has been …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:Lbh3VFZM3akC,1,https://m.dgtghg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Paper_55.pdf,12732123045191752101,/scholar?cites=12732123045191752101,,https://m.dgtghg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Paper_55.pdf,0,0,0

These power electronic systems offer highly nonlinear characteristics. To overcome those non linearities active power filters are preferred. This paper presents and compares the performance of two controllers namely Fuzzy Logic and Proportional Integral (PI) applied to a voltage source inverter/converter which operates as an active power filter. The active power filter is operated to compensate harmonics generated by the non-linear load. This work is done to make an accurate comparison of the performance of fuzzy logic controller and classical control technique such as PI controller in compensating harmonics in the ac mains current. Fuzzy control rule design is based on the general dynamic behavior of the process. A novel control method is implemented for suppressing the harmonics. The compensation process is instantaneous. which is achieved without employing any complicated control logic. The control scheme is based on sensing line currents only; an approach different from convention ones. which are based on sensing harmonics of the nonlinear load. In the control scheme a hysteresis controller based on current control is employed to generate switching signals to the PWM converter.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:yptliwwhi3IC,1,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25953574.pdf,7003657650460303618,/scholar?cites=7003657650460303618,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25953574.pdf,0,0,0

85523,A Novel Approach for Implementing the Bit Inversion Technique to Increase the PSNR of Stego Images and to Remove its Issues,2018,Waseem Akram and Puneet Kumar,13,International Journal of Applied Engineering Research,6,3852-3860,,Bit Inversion Technique is applied to remove the modifications in the stego images that occur during the steganographic process. Its application results in the highquality stego images with a lesser number of modifications. In this paper. the problems with the application of the Bit Inversion Technique are discussed and a potential solution is proposed to improve the implementation or the applicability of the bit inversion technique and also to increase the quality (PSNR) of the stego images. The proposed solution improves the implementation process of the bit inversion technique by introducing a preprocessing step that is applied to the stego images before the application of Bit Inversion Technique. In this preprocessing step. stego images are partitioned into a number of parts and then the Bit Inversion Technique is applied to each part. The introduction of this step not only increases the applicability of the bit inversion technique but also produces the high-quality stego images than the regular bit inversion application and this can be easily seen in the results provided in this paper. The results provided in this paper also confirm with our hypothesis which states that the quality (or PSNR) of the stego images is directly proportional to the partitions done to the stego images before applying the Bit Inversion Technique.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:rIeyUKJ4rSMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Waseem_Akram26/publication/323998197_A_Novel_Approach_for_Implementing_the_Bit_Inversion_Technique_to_Increase_the_PSNR_of_Stego_Images_and_to_Remove_its_Issues/links/5ab7cebb45851515f59f4265/A-Novel-Approach-for-Implementing-the-Bit-Inversion-Technique-to-Increase-the-PSNR-of-Stego-Images-and-to-Remove-its-Issues.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Waseem_Akram26/publication/323998197_A_Novel_Approach_for_Implementing_the_Bit_Inversion_Technique_to_Increase_the_PSNR_of_Stego_Images_and_to_Remove_its_Issues/links/5ab7cebb45851515f59f4265/A-Novel-Approach-for-Implementing-the-Bit-Inversion-Technique-to-Increase-the-PSNR-of-Stego-Images-and-to-Remove-its-Issues.pdf,0,0,0

Crime in an area can generate demand for gambling services as criminals and gamblers may share similar preferences: risk loving and instant gratification. To isolate the effect. we develop an empirical model to study the firm-side incentives driving the opening of betting shops. We estimate a panel model employing an instrumental variable approach using data from London boroughs for 2006 to 2015. The instrumental variable is built upon the differences in traveling patterns between gamblers and criminals. Our result shows that a 1% increase in the local crime rate causes a 0.3% to 1.3% increase in the number of betting shops per capita.

Historically hernia causative was attributed to a mechanical disparity between visceral pressure and the resistance of the musculature.Methods: 100 cases of inguinal hernia admitted in Medical College Teaching Hospitals were selected on the basis of the nonprobability (purposive) sampling method. All patients with uncomplicated direct and indirect hernias treated by open approach surgeries were included. The age/sex incidence. mode of presentation. precipitating factors. surgical treatment. postoperative complications were all evaluated and compared with standard published literature. A predesigned proforma was used to collect this information for individual case.Results: The incidence of hernia was common in younger. 18-40-year age group (33%). people engaged in agriculture (42%). labourers (33%). 52% patients presented with swelling and 48% with pain and swelling. Right indirect hernia was the most common (41%). right direct hernia (23%). pantaloon (7%) and bilateral in 8%. 32% patients had strenuous work as a precipitating factor. 35% had smoking as associated factors. Abdominal tone was poor in 8% cases.Conclusions: Strenuous work is often responsible for development of hernia. Heavy work. especially lifting weights. puts a great strain on the abdominal muscles.

85562,Validating Remaining Oil Saturation from History Matched Simulation Model with Infill Wells in a Mature Oil Field,2016,S Sarkar and A Dhanasetty and S Sulaxna and P Singh and P Kumar and R Singh,,,,cp-504-00031,European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers,Remaining oil saturation prediction from the history matched simulation model is one of the main controls on production forecast. Validation of the remaining oil saturation from independent source would hence enhance confidence on the accuracy of the forecast. It would also provide valuable feedback on the robustness of the integrated reservoir modeling workflow. However. field-wide saturation measurements are uncommon. Infill wells and cased hole pulsed neutron logs can provide spot checks for the model but are local in nature. This paper presents a case study where field-wide remaining oil saturation estimates were available from extensive infill drilling during downsizing of an inverted 9 spot waterflood pattern to 5 spot polymer injection development. Comparison of well vs. model remaining oil saturation for two braided fluvial channel reservoirs are discussed. one with homogeneous sheet sand and …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:JO-RqYbuJvsC,0,https://www.earthdoc.org/content/papers/10.3997/2214-4609.201602422,,,,,0,0,0

85587,Predictive Analytics for Turbulence Avoidance and Aircraft Fatigue Diagnostics,2016,Ajay Rao and Vivek Karan and Pradeep Kumar,9,SAE International Journal of Aerospace,2016-01-2022,74-81,,Turbulence is by far the number one concern of anxious passengers and a cause for airline injuries. Apart from causing discomfort to passengers. it also results in unplanned downtime of aircrafts. Currently the Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the meteorological weather charts aid the pilot in devising flight paths that avoid turbulent regions. Even with such tailored flight paths. pilots report constant encounters with turbulence. The probability of turbulence avoidance can be increased by the use of predictive models on historical and transactional data. This paper proposes the use of predictive analytics on meteorological data over the geographical area where the aircraft is intended to fly. The weather predictions are then relayed to the cloud server which can be accessed by the aircraft planned to fly in the same region. Predictive algorithms that use Time series forecasting models are discussed and their comparative …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:8k3R5ScbChQC,0,https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2016-01-2022/,,,,,0,0,0

Samples of topsoil from the area of a limestone quarry in Gombe (North-eastern Nigeria) were collected to analyse levels of hazardous substances such as of Hg. Fe. Zn. Ni. Mn. Cu. Cr. Cd and Pb. A total of 24 topsoil samples were collected around the radius of 0.5 km from the blasting arena. Additionally. six background samples were also collected from an unexploited reserved area that was~ 6 km far from the main sampling location. Two rocks of limestone samples from blasting area were also collected and analysed for heavy metals as a reference. All the samples were processed and extracted with nitrate acid solution and analysed using smart spectrophotometer methods. The results suggested varying organic contents in soil. sand. silt. clay and pH. All these parameters are correlated with those of unexploited samples. Limestone rocks samples displayed a high concentration of Fe and Mn improvement. Toxic metals concentrations (mg/kg) in top-soil with background levels were discovered in Hg. Fe. Mn. Ni. Zn. Cd. Cu. Cr and Pb. Residual phases exhibited the lowest enrichment for most metals possibly. because of high loamy sand content. The situated enrichment advocates influence from mining activities.

Experimental determination of either the dissipation rate or the Taylor microscale. even in isotropic turbulence. which may occur in a portion of the turbulent boundary layer. is known to be a difficult task. For constant pressure boundary layers. a model for the turbulent dissipation rate is proposed here in terms of the local mean flow quantities. Comparable agreement between the estimated Taylor microscale and Kolmogorov length scale with other data in the logarithmic region suggests usefulness of this model in obtaining these quantities experimentally. ,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:NKlx0PmyA3cC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12046-016-0480-0,,,,https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Volumes/sadh/041/04/0435-0439.pdf,0,0,0

Underwater channel is frequency selective. and there exist regions in the spectrum which completely attenuate the OFDM carriers and this results in loss of data/symbols carried by them. This degrades the bit-error-rate (BER) performance and results in loss of bandwidth due to the necessity of retransmission of erroneous bits. Retransmission is not acceptable for long delay channels like the UWA channel. An attractive approach to this problem is to spread the group of information symbols over the entire available bandwidth. The resulting variant of OFDM system is termed as spread OFDM (SOFDM). The receiver of such a system separates the spread symbols by performing simple linear matrix operations.

Sumangala Devi. Professor. Department of Anatomy. SVS Medical College. Mahaboobnagar. Telangana. India. Mob. No.:+ 919154729399 E-Mail: drsushmaprasad03@ gmail. comIntroduction: Lungs are divided into lobes by the oblique and the transverse (horizontal) fissures. The fissures may be complete or incomplete and they may be absent. The fissures facilitate the movement of the lobes in relation to one another. which accommodates the greater distension and movement of the lower lobes during respiration. Knowledge of their position is necessary for the appreciation of lobar anatomy and thus for locating the bronchopulmonary segments which is significant both anatomically and clinically. Hence. the awareness of their variations is essential in performing lobectomy and in segmental resection. It could also be of significance in interpreting radiological images.Materials and Methods: Study on abnormal lobar pattern and position of fissures in human lungs was carried out in the department of anatomy SVS Medical College.

It is concerned with minimization of the total inventory cost and maximization of the service level with minimum inventory. In the real world. the demand is always variable; and also the lead time of supply of an item cannot be always fixed due to some unavoidable circumstances. This chapter is focused on an inventory model with shortages where demand quantity and lead time are considered as variable and represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. An expression for optimum order size. reorder point. safety stock and fuzzy total safety stock cost is developed for a fixed customer service level.

85619,Separation and purification of uranium from liquid waste generated at Fuel Fabrication Plant,2016,Pradeep Kumar and Abhishek Chavan and Papu Samanta and AC Bagchi,,,,,,[en] Uranium powder is produced by calciothermic reduction of uranium dioxide powder. The UO_2 powder is obtained via ammonium diuranate (ADU) route. Cleaning operation of process vessels with nitric acid results in the generation of uranium nitrate solution (UNS) containing significant quantity of uranium. 1-20 gram per litre (gpl) along with impurities such as Ca. Na. Fe. Ni. Al. Cr etc. The total dissolved solids (TDS) are very high∼ 100-400 gram per litre. The uranium needs to be recovered/purified from UNS and reused in fuel fabrication. At such low level of uranium concentration many processes such as ion-exchange. membrane etc are reported in literature. However. solvent extraction process is well established rugged and simple. In view of this we have carried out study with solvent extraction employing TBP as extractant and n-dodecane as diluent. The uranium content in stock solution was determined by biamperometry and found to be (21.07±0.04) mg/ml. Solvent extraction was carried out by stirring organic and aqueous phases in 1: 1 volume ratio (10 ml each) for 10 minutes and subsequent phase separation by separating funnel. The uranium from organic phase was stripped three times with 0.1 M HNO_3. Unextracted uranium amount in aqueous phase and uranium amount stripped (recovered) was determined spectrophotometrically using Arsenazo-III as the metal indicator and measuring the absorbance at 655 nm. Maximum uranium extraction was obtained with 10% TBP. The impurities present in UNS before and after solvent extraction are shown.

In this paper. we offer to use spatial information. a physical property associated with each node. hard to fake. and not reliant on cryptography. as the basis for (1) detecting parody attacks;(2) determining the number of assailants when numerous adversaries masquerading as a same node identity; and (3) localizing large adversaries. We suggest to use the longitudinal relationship of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. We then prepare the problem of regulating the number of attackers as a multi-class detection problem. Cluster-based mechanisms are created to determine the number of attackers.

Hence erosion wear shorten the life of the concerned components and an extra expenditure for the maintenance and repair. In thermal power plants large amount of fly ash and bottom ash is produced from the pulverized coal –fired in boiler. The fly ash is collected in ESP while the bottom ash transported to ash-pond in the slurry form through pipe-line system leads to erosion wear in the pipe line. Many authors and researchers have reported that erosion rate is affected by various parameters like solid concentration. velocity. impact angle. particle size. target material etc.  In the present study. the erosion wear in the pipe-bend for the flow of solid-liquid is evaluated in the CFD code FLUENT. Also the effects of velocity. solid concentration and particles size have been studied numerically by varying these parameters from ranges of 0.5m/s to 2.5 m/s. 2.5% to 10% and 162(micron) & 300(micron) respectively. The k-ɛ turbulence model for fluid flow and discrete phase to track the solid particles in the flow field are used in simulation.

Some of the mobile applications might be having a direct purchasing cost or be free but having an ad-support for revenue and in return these apps provide users’ private data to ad provider without users consent. Worryingly. some of ad libraries ask for permissions beyond the requirement and additional ones listed in their documentation. Some apps also track users by a network sniffer across ad providers and its applications. Though from security point of view. users have right to know if someone is taking their private data. It is often ineffective at conveying meaningful. useful information on how a user’s privacy might be impacted by using an application.    In this research work. the effect on user privacy of some grossing Android apps was examined that includes apps which provide private data of user without their permission. Android device is firstly rooted for this work and then made some useful changes to collect the required traffic from different applications. On basis of certain parameters. traffic is analyzed and effective results concluded. Using third party connections that an app makes. a threshold is defined to know about legitimacy of application. Some other parameters were also added to check whether an app is stealing users’ private information.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:kFSvnP10ePEC,0,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/handle/10266/3382,,,,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/bitstream/10266/3382/4/3382.pdf,0,0,0
85663,Combining Participatory Rural Appraisal and Group Model Building Techniques for NREGA Evaluation at Village Level,2015,Praveen Kumar,,Available at SSRN 2640742,,,,Monitoring and Evaluation of the NREGS is a critical attribute mandated by the act itself and is done as a third party social audit (mandatory as per the ministry of rural development) or an M&E for every village (where the scheme is implemented) in accordance with the rules obligated by the ministry of rural development. India. The existing evaluation process through PRA for NREGS though assesses the thematic issues of the scheme. however has limitation in terms of increasing the cognizance of the beneficiaries regarding the vision of this policy or the rationale for this scheme. The PRA process conducted is more likely to assess the quality of implementation in the village; however. it has limitations in enhancing the understanding of the system and rationale of implementation of the scheme. Group Model Building (GMB) processes can be applied in dynamically complex situations including the multifactorial and daedal policies as NREGA. This process too. invokes the participation of multiple stakeholders involved in the problem or the situation (required to be analyzed) and eventually creates a more shared understanding of the dynamics and impending actions to improve the situation.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:OP2qWFMeUpEC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2640742,,,,,0,0,0

In this work. we have investigated the effect of disorder due to chemical substitution on the dynamics and transport properties of correlated Fermi liquids. A low frequency analysis in the concentrated and dilute limits shows that the dynamical local potentials arising through disorder averaging generate a linear (in frequency) term in the scattering rate. Such non-Fermi liquid behavior (nFL) is investigated in detail for Kondo hole substitution in heavy fermions within dynamical mean field theory. Analytical expressions in limiting cases and numerical solutions of the dynamical mean field theory equations reveal that the nFL term will show up significantly only in certain regimes. although it is present for any non-zero disorder concentration in principle. Remarkably. we find that the nFL behavior due to dynamical effects of impurity scattering has …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:haVc-jTD6xgC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015APS..MARF22006N/abstract,,,,,0,0,0

INC,Friction Stir Processing (FSP) is a solid state technique used for material processing. Tool wear and the agglomeration of ceramic particles have been serious issues in FSP of metal matrix composites. In the present study. FSP has been employed to disperse the nanoscale particles of a polymer-derived silicon carbonitride (SiCN) ceramic phase into copper by an in-situ process. SiCN cross linked polymer particles were incorporated using multi-pass FSP into pure copper to form bulk particulate metal matrix composites. The polymer was then converted into ceramic through an in-situ pyrolysis process and dispersed by FSP. Multi-pass processing was carried out to remove porosity from the samples and also for the uniform dispersion of polymer derived ceramic particles.

Aluminum-silicon-nickel (silumin) alloy is employed as inert matrix owing to its high thermal conductivity. high castability. high corrosion resistance. All these properties depend on the chemical composition and the structure of silumin. Silicon is stringent specification in silumin. A spectrophotometric method has been developed for the determination of silicon content in silumin matrix. Silumin matrix was fused with LiOH and subsequent dissolution in water along with few drops of conc. sulphuric acid. The molybodo-silicic formed by the addition of ammonium molybdate is reduced to molybdenum blue by ascorbic acid in the presence of antimony. The absorbance was measured at 810 nm.

New Delhi,Special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) are used as lateral force-resisting systems in steel structures located in the high seismic areas to resist lateral loads through the vertical concentric truss system. Through yielding in tension and buckling in compression. conventional braces allow the system as a whole to have ample drift capacity to resist the lateral forces without any failure of gravity load-resisting members with maximum damages to brace itself. AISC 341-2010 allows the selection of a proper brace configuration for SCBFs. but does not distinguish their individual performance. The code categorizes all configurations under the same label and provides similar values of response reduction factor. over strength factor and deflection amplification factor.

85697,Match beam inversion of geoacoustic parameters from towed hydrophone streamer array data,2015,Sanjeev Naithani and PV Kumar and N Suresh Kumar,,,,,NISCAIR-CSIR. India,The study estimates geoacoustic parameters of the sediment by inversion of acoustic data acquired from seismic hydrophone streamer array.  Inversion is performed by beamforming technique as the data is pertaining to shallow water and there is no prior information on the sediment type and the profiles of subbottom sediment layers. Initially. the estimates of sediment speed are obtained from critical angle derived from beamformer output by conventional beamforming. The sediment speed is used to set the parameter search bounds for further inversion by beamforming technique. The search bounds for density and compressional attenuation coefficient is set accordingly. The feasibility of inversion is understood by undertaking synthetic runs followed by inversion of field data. The beam cutoff angles are determined from the beampattern and the arrivals pertaining to the sea bottom.  The geoacoustic model comprises of a water column. two sediment layers and a sediment half space.  The inversion results of field data sets are compared with results obtained by modal inversion. The results show negligible variation in estimated sound speed indicating similar sediment type. The sediment density and compressional attenuation coefficient exhibits lesser sensitivity toward inversion process.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:COU-sansr_wC,0,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/34631,,,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/34631/1/IJMS%2044(2)%20183-194.pdf,0,0,0

85731,Opening New Avenues for Nickel-catalyzed Cycloadditions,2014,Puneet Kumar,,,,,,New catalytic approaches to carbocycles and heterocycles are disclosed. The long standing challenge of using ketenes in transition-metal catalyzed cycloaddition is successfully addressed by using Ni-phosphine complexes. These complexes catalyzed the cycloaddition of various ketenes and diynes. In general. 2. 4-cyclohexadienones were formed instead of products arising from decarbonylation of the ketenes. Efforts to develop the asymmetric version of this cycloaddition chemistry are also discussed. The inability of Ni-phosphine complexes to promote the oxidative coupling of alkyne and nitrile was successfully addressed using the catalytic combination of Ni (cod) 2 and Xantphos. This catalyst system was used to couple a variety of diynes and unactivated nitriles to form pyridines. The reaction proceeds under ambient conditions to provide excellent yields of the products. Comparison of this catalyst with the other state-of-the-art catalysts is also provided.An easy and expeditious route to substituted piperidines is also described. A Niphosphine complex was used as catalyst for [4+ 2] cycloaddition of 3-azetidinone and alkynes. This unique reaction has broad substrate scope and affords piperidines in excellent yields and excellent regioselectivity. In the reaction of an enantiopure azetidinone. complete retention of stereochemistry was observed. 3-Azetidinone and a variety of diynes also undergo a cycloaddition reaction catalyzed by Ni/IPr to give [5-8] fused dihydroazocine compounds.

Cham,In this paper. our focus is on the investigation for further improvement (with its variants already existing) upon the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The security of ECDSA is based on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem. Though. ECDSA uses the same number to generate two separate signatures as per the original protocol. it is possible for an adversary to forge the signature. There have been number of improvements proposed to circumvent the issue. However. we propose here a probabilistic and improved bloom filter based variant of ECDSA that while being optimal enhances the security strength of ECDSA. With the theoretical analysis supplemented with our experimentation on the TinyOS platform. we show that it is appropriate to employ in the resource-constrained environment of Wireless Senor Networks (WSNs).,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:85sL7E1SSRcC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-03692-2_10,,,,,0,0,0

It is associated with multiple fractures because of high velocity trauma of RT A. Although the close reduction is ideal. the OR+ IF with plating is treatment of choice in certain indications. The DCP plating has an advantage over the ASIF type of plates in securing rigid fixation and early mobilisation with out any external splintage. Full attention to the training and familiarity with the proposed procedure will yield good operative results. Poor technique of fixation often results in poor results. The complication of infection can be prevented with aseptic precautions. pre-op preparation. pre-per and post-op antibiotics and above all meticulous dissection and minimum soft tissue damage. Early mobility of the limb is responsible for excellent results and is good for fracture and joints and for the patient. Early return to the jobs thus saves the patients from economic setbacks is possible by stable fixation which result in early healing. Exploration of radial nerve in cases with radial N. palsy. for relieving compression and neurolysis has certainly helped in early recovery.

Merchant Banking originated in the 13th century in the European countries. As far as the origin of this term is concerned. it is told that earlier Merchants used to attend to extending of loans and arranging finance for trade but as the time passed the subject of banking assumed more importance and the Merchants switched over to banking activities. hence the term Merchant Banking. Rapid industrialization in India has led to the setting up of new industrial units and Expansion. Diversification. and Modernization of existing units. The need for having expert advice and the guidance of Specialists in the field has therefore become Imperative. Only Merchant Banking can offer these services. In India. Investment Bankers are often called Merchant Bankers. Merchant Banking is a Non-Banking Financial activity similar to banking. Merchant Banks are neither Merchants nor are they necessarily Banks. These are Financial Institutions providing valuable services like acceptance of bills of exchange. corporate finance. Portfolio Management and Banking services. According to JAP Herbert king.” Merchant “Banking is what Merchant do.” MJ Rosenberg has defined Merchant Bank. as “an organization that underwrites securities for corporations. advices such clients on Mergers. and is involved in the ownership of commercial ventures”.

India,Marine and Coastal Surveys Division of Geological Survey of India. initiated preliminary. integrated geological. geotechnical and geophysical surveys off Betul for making an appraisal of the developmental possibilities of setting up a minor port in this sector. Detailed surveys helped generate a bathymetric map of the area indicating a smooth and gently sloping seafloor without any hazards. ideal for port development. Sediment cores were studied to evaluate the sub-seabed sediment package and visualize the seabed sediment distribution. Mean size of the seabed surface sediments broadly signifies a sediment milieu encompassing variants from silt to clay. broadly classified as silty clay. Geotechnical analysis of the sediments helped to evaluate the engineering properties of the seabed and sub-seabed sediments quintessential for development of a port in this sector. Clayey sediments have a high degree of plasticity with a very high swelling potential. Shear resistance is almost unregistered at almost all levels of the sediment package. Geotechnical characteristics  of the sediments are generally conducive for offshore structures. Side scan sonar surveys brought out a clear seafloor. generally monotonous and thus well suited for a navigational channel access. Current Observations carried out in the nearshore sector indicate low velocity currents and are not influenced by tidal variations. Environmental parameters including Temperature. pH. Salinity.

NY,Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is a soft-wooded herbaceous dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the family Caricaceae. Papaya ranks first among fruits consumed and also ranks first in nutritional profile. Besides its nutritional and medicinal properties. papaya has a number of characteristics that contribute to its being used as an experimental model for tree crops. Papaya is among the limited number of plant species that are trioecious with three sex forms—female. male. and hermaphrodite—making it an excellent model for basic studies on sex determination. In recent times. papaya has tremendously benefited from genomics and especially transgenic technology.

85764,DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF A MISSILE CONTROL COMPONENT USED IN A GUIDED MISSILE,2014,Vuyyuru Murali Krishna and PV Anil Kumar,,,,,,This paper presents a finite element model for strength analysis of a missile’s missile control component under different conditions like pitch. roll and Yaw. Characteristics of stress distribution and high stress locations are determined according to the model. The high random vibration loads imparted on Missile control component by the other hardware during launch create an adverse design requirement that all hardware have a natural frequency greater than that of the Missile control component. in order to avoid damage and failure due to dynamic coupling. Maximizing natural frequency is generally accomplished by creating as stiff and lightweight a design as possible. However. designing for the resultant high loads also requires a high stiffened structure. These two opposing design requirements drive an optimization between a lightweight and high strength structure. This paper also presents a finite element analysis for strength analysis of a missile’s Missile control component under random loading conditions. Static. Modal RSA and Power spectrum density (PSD) analysis will be carried out to plot graph of the PSD value versus frequency. where the PSD may be a displacement PSD. velocity PSD. acceleration PSD. or force PSD.

This might lead to menstrual disturbances. anovulation and infertility in women. Methods: This two-treatment parallel-design study included a triple blind. randomized controlled trial with low dose (2mg) Rosiglitazone. which was conducted over two years at an infertility clinic of a reputed private hospital in India. Forty patients with PCOS. who failed to ovulate with Clomiphene citrate 100mg. were randomly selected and treated with two different doses of Rosiglitazone for two cycles. The Intervention Group received 2mg while the Control Group received 4mg of Rosiglitazone. Comparisons were done by non-parametric Mc Nemar’s test and p< 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: In this study. 12 (42.9%) participants receiving 2mg of Rosiglitazone ovulated at the end of second cycle as compared to 16 (57.1%) in the group receiving 4mg. The cumulative ovulation rate for both the groups was high (70.0%) after the second cycle. It was seen that 3 (60.0%) participants receiving 2mg of Rosiglitazone became pregnant at the end of second cycle as compared to 2 (40.0%) in the group receiving 4mg. The cumulative pregnancy rate was 12.5%. The insulin resistance got corrected in 10 (40.0%) participants receiving 2mg of Rosiglitazone at the end of second cycle as compared to 15 (60.0%) by the group receiving 4mg. This suggested that insulin resistance correction was dose dependent.

We have studied the effects of capillary number. Reynolds number. and viscosity ratio on the droplet deformation characteristics. Unlike in the Stokes' limit where deformation is governed by a competition between viscous shear and interfacial tension. at higher Reynolds numbers. inertial effects play an increasingly important role. We observe that the deformation history is non-monotonic and contains an overshoot before relaxing to a steady deformed state. In contrast. the capillary number is seen to affect the magnitude of the deformation history and the time at which the peak deformation occurs. The viscosity ratio has a relatively modest effect on the magnitude of the deformation compared with the effects of Reynolds and capillary numbers …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:zBs93F57jOAC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013APS..DFD.D3002H/abstract,,,,,0,0,0

85787,Cytodiagnosis Of Bancroftian Microfilariae At Various Sites In An Endemic Area,2013,Hemali Jayantilal and Vasudha Mahendra and Peeyush Kumar and Varsha Mahesh,2,Medical Science,9,,,Introduction: Microfilaria has been a major public health problem since ancient times mainly in tropical countries like India. Conventional methods along with aspiration cytology are important tool for diagnosis. Most cases of cytologically diagnosed microfilaria are unanticipated. Our aim is to evaluate the utility and importance of fine needle aspiration in diagnosis of filariasis in clinically unsuspected cases. Material and Methods: Total 2114 fine needle aspirations both free hand and USG guided were performed in a tertiary care centre from 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2012. 22-23 gauge needle attached to 10ml disposable syringe was used and Haematoxylin and Eosin. Giemsa and Papanicolou stains were used for staining smears.Results: Out of 2114 aspirations. total 6 cases of microfilaria were detected at sites like thyroid. cervical lymph node. inguinal lymph node. axillary swelling and peritoneal fluid.Conclusion: Careful screening of aspiration smears is mandatory for identification of microfilaria in asymptomatic patients so that early treatment can be started.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:oYVvnHz_XzQC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.683.7421&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.683.7421&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we determine the seismic structure of the oceanic plate near the MORs. using the P-to-s conversions isolated from good quality data recorded at 5 broadband seismological stations situated on the ocean Is-5 lands in their vicinity. Estimates of the crustal and lithospheric thickness values from waveform modeling of the P receiver function stacks reveal that the crustal thickness varies between 6 and 8 km with the corresponding depths to the lithosphere asthenosphere boundary (LAB) varying between 43 and 68 km. However. the depth to the LAB at Macquire Island is intriguing in view of the observation of a thick (∼ 87km) litho-10 sphere beneath a relatively young crust. At three other stations ie.

Research and Welfare,A squash is a fleshy vegetable protected by a rind. All squashes belong to one of four species of the Cucurbits family of vegetables. In the United States. squash is typically categorized as summer or winter squashes. Basically there are two types of squash harvest: squash and Winter squash varieties. on the Both summer and winter varieties are full of nutrients. containing trace amounts of B vitamins and providing healthy doses of iron. calcium. magnesium and potassium [1]. The purpose of the research was to determine the changes taking place in squash fruit during the maturation and ripening so as to pinpoint the best time to give the best quality at the market place. The original objectives were to determine which pre-harvest variables contribute to good tasting squash after different periods of storage time. This is determined by whether a measure of acceptability found by categorizing each squash as …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:5qu0sgD3nvwC,0,https://search.proquest.com/openview/085419971938cf050ca0dae3b97a6eb7/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2032130,,,,,0,0,0

85814,Wireless Multichannel Multipoint Broadcast Service for Mobile Stations,2013,B Homer Benny and K Chaitanya Deepti and P Ratna Kumar,1,Journal of Telematics and Informatics,1,26-35,,In wireless Multicast Broadcast Service (MBS). the common channel is used to multicast the MBS content to the Mobile Stations (MSs) on the MBS calls within the coverage area of a Base Station (BS). which causes interference to the dedicated channels serving the traditional calls. and degrades the system capacity. The MBS zone technology is proposed in Mobile Communications Network (MCN) standards to improve system capacity and reduce the handoff delay for the wireless MBS calls. In the MBS zone technology. a group of BSs form an MBS zone. where the macro diversity is applied in the MS. the BSs synchronize to transmit the MBS content on the same common channel. interference caused by the common channel is reduced. and the MBS MSs need not perform handoff while moving between the BSs in the same MBS zone. However. when there is no MBS MS in a BS with the MBS zone technology. the transmission on the common channel wastes the bandwidth of the BS. It is an important issue to determine the condition for the MBS Controller (MBSC) to enable the MBS zone technology by considering the Quality of Services (QoS) for traditional calls and MBS calls are used to reduce the dependency over the common channel and also it is going to reduce the delay over the network.

85815,Significance of pavement surface friction and case studies in India,2013,Sudesh Kumar and SP Pokhriyal and BM Sharma and Pradeep Kumar,6,Highway Research Journal,1,,,Heavy capital investments are being made in the country towards upgrades. improvement and rehabilitation of the existing road network. The primary aim of such large investments. which are expected to be of the order of US $100-200 billion in the next five years or so. is to provide safe. efficient. faster. economical and comfortable transportation systems to the travelling public. However. the extent and severity of road accidents. occurring due to a variety of influencing factors. including inadequate surface friction under wet pavement surface conditions. higher vehicle speed. and improved surface roughness. etc. is causing serious concerns to the profession in the country. Providing and maintaining pavement surfaces which enable adequate skid resistance has to become an integral component of road development and management policy. Very little work has been carried out in India in the past on aspects of pavement surface friction. since it did not at that time have much bearing. However. with the changing scenario. it has become absolutely essential to recognize these aspects. The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) has undertaken certain studies related to pavement surface friction on different types of surfacings. This paper highlights various studies undertaken by CRRI in this direction and also presents the methodology adopted for field studies. equipment used for data collection and major findings and conclusions drawn therefrom.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:Zk83zdSX4-UC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1265887,,,,,0,0,0

The fragmentation of calculi can be painful and various analgesic regimens have been described. A small minority of our patients are unable to tolerate ESWL with enteral analgesia. We offered a repeat ESWL treatment with remifentanil Patient Controlled Analgesia (R-PCA) to this group.Methods: Patients were given oral paracetamol 1g and 100mg rectal diclofenac before ESWL. Remifentanil PCA was prepared to provide a 0.5 mcg/kg bolus with 2 minute lockout with dose increase as necessary. The primary outcome measure was ESWL energy level tolerated and was compared between groups with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Secondary outcomes included pain score. sedation score and adverse effects.Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with adjuvant R-PCA for one (n= 21). two (n= 7) or three (n= 1) ESWL sessions. All patient were able to tolerate a significantly higher ESWL power level with R-PCA compared to enteral analgesia (p< 0.01). Sedation was minimal (all sedation scores≥ 3) with a low incidence of side effects.Conclusion: Patients treated with R-PCA tolerated a significantly higher ESWL power level and all patients completed the treatment.

CONVECTIVE RAIN OVER THE SOUTH/SOUTHEAST ASIA,2012,DEVENDRAA SIINGH and P RAMESH KUMAR and RN GHODPAGE,,IASTA BULLETIN,,370,,Firstly. Fritz (1878) correlated thunderstorm frequencies with the relative sunspot numbers using data collected at different stations in Europe and North America between 1755 and 1875 and showed a positive correlation at some stations. Later on. Brooks (1934) considering worldwide data reported a low correlation at mid–latitude and enhanced correlation towards the pole and the equator. Additionally. it was also reported that the correlation coefficient changed significantly over relatively short distances. The dependence of climate on various factors associated with lightning and precipitation has enhanced interest in the study of lightning and precipitation. Satellite data have provided global picture of lightning flash rate and precipitation (rainfall). The regional distributions for thunderstorm activity are ranked from the most active to the least active as:(1) Africa (2) South America (3) Southeast Asia. The ranking based on rainfall is (1) Southeast Asia.(2) South America.(3) Africa (Price. 2009; Siingh et al.. 2008). Thus. the long term data display the opposite relationship between global lightning activity and rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall production and lightning activity have quite different dependencies on updraft speed.

Yet. only in the last two decades has a systematic effort been made to estimate the magnitude of violence. its determinants and reasons. the forms in which it is manifested. and its health. social. legal and economic consequences. This paper uses data from the NFHS-3 (2005-06) to document women’s empowerment as a some selected state. In general. it finds that the average woman in India is disempowered absolutely as well as relative to men. and there has been little change in her empowerment over time. This result is obvious no matter how empowerment is measured. be it in terms of the indicators of the evidence. sources or setting for empowerment. However. there is great variation in the level of women’s empowerment across the different states and across indicators.

In this paper we have assessed the ensemble for these catchments. comparing the simulations with observations. to give credence that the simulations provide a realistic representation of atmospheric processes and therefore future climate. We have illustrated how these simulations could be used to provide information on potential future climate impacts and therefore aid decision-making using climatology and threshold analysis. The ensemble analysis shows an increase in temperature between the baseline (1970-2000) and the 2050s (2040-2070) of between 2 and 4 C and an increase in the number of days with maximum temperatures above 28 C and 35 C. There is less certainty for precipitation and runoff which show considerable variability. even in this relatively small ensemble. spanning zero. The HighNoon ensemble is the most complete data for the region providing useful information on a wide range of variables for the regional climate of the Brahmaputra–Ganges region. however there are processes not yet included in the models that could have an impact …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:2TuIPqOg0e0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3698551415751994317&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
85867,Runoff Prediction: Use of Muskingum Model for a Small Watershed,2012,Pravendra Kumar and JK Singh,49,INDIAN SOCIETY OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERS,,38,,An effort was made to develop a mathematical model using unit-step and transfer functions approach for Karkara watershed of Tilaiya dam catchment in Upper Damodar Valley of Jharkhand State of India for estimating direct runoff hydrographs on storm basis. The model used rainfall data in blocks of finite duration represented by unit step function. The outflow hydrograph ordinates were obtained by taking inverse Laplace transform of product of Laplace transforms of the transfer function (Laplace transform of Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph) and the input (effective rainfall). The direct runoff hydrograph ordinates were computed by lagging outflow hydrograph ordinates. Model parameter was estimated by Sabol method using rainfall and runoff data of the study watershed. The model was calibrated for nine storm events. and validated for three events. Quantitative performance of the model was tested using some of the widely used statistical indices as integral squared error. relative squared error and coefficient of efficiency. The estimated direct runoff hydrographs using the model were in close agreement with the observed direct runoff hydrographs. The developed model can be satisfactorily applied for prediction of storm direct runoff hydrographs from small watersheds in the study region.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:tltQ_bo2KloC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jagvir_Dixit/publication/263280676_Anthropometry_of_Farm_Workers_of_Kashmir_Region_of_India_for_Equipment_Design/links/546b377e0cf2397f7831b70d/Anthropometry-of-Farm-Workers-of-Kashmir-Region-of-India-for-Equipment-Design.pdf#page=40,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jagvir_Dixit/publication/263280676_Anthropometry_of_Farm_Workers_of_Kashmir_Region_of_India_for_Equipment_Design/links/546b377e0cf2397f7831b70d/Anthropometry-of-Farm-Workers-of-Kashmir-Region-of-India-for-Equipment-Design.pdf#page=40,0,0,0

85896,Study of Improvement in Boiler Efficiency through Incorporation of Additional Bank of Tubes in the Economiser,2012,P Ravindra Kumar and B Sridhar Reddy,,,,,,The major efficiency loss of a boiler is caused by the hot stack gases discharging to the atmosphere which is polluting the atmosphere and on other side Pollution Control Board is forcing the norms of Pollution levels in atmosphere. One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. An economizer is a heat exchanger. which transfers heat from the stack gases to the incoming feedwater. Typically. on a high pressure water tube boiler. the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4%. depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler. the improvement is 2 to 3.5%. depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. They may be supported from overhead or from the floor. A feedwater line. which serves the boiler. is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are banks of tubes in economizer. There was a proposal from management to add another bank of tubes in the economizer so that there will be control of pollutants coming out from boiler. We took that proposal as a task and made a detailed investigation of it. An investigation is conducted on the effect of performance of the boiler by incorporating the additional bank of tubes in the space below the lower bank of tubes. The main idea is to extract maximum amount of heat from the flue gases and increase the heat pick up rate of the feed water outlet into the boiler. By assuming the additional bank of tubes. various heat transfer …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:yCEqH1SBpFUC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e40c/6ecd9d537bf34b52d5deed8aadcf2b3eb83d.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e40c/6ecd9d537bf34b52d5deed8aadcf2b3eb83d.pdf,0,0,0

It is responsible for several life threatening diseases. food spoilage and reduction in yield of desired products. Detecting the contaminating bacteria is important to give proper and effective treatment. The efficiency of the detection techniques available today can be improved manifold by separating the target bacteria from the sample matrix. Most of the separation techniques available today cannot separate target bacteria from other bacterial strains which have similar morphological features and may lead to false positive results in detection test.The interaction of bacterial cells with surrounding environment depends on its surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity. hydrophilicity balance and net charge. Aqueous twophase system (ATPS) is widely used to separate biomaterials based on their surface properties. In ATPS. biomaterials are partitioned based on their affinity for fluid streams formed by aqueous polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex). Separation of bacteria using ATPS technique in microfluidics has not been studied before.

Around Tibet we observed the LAB in the Tarim and Sichuan Basins and in India near 100km depth. The Indian LAB is subducting down to about 250km depth below southern-central Tibet and the Asian LAB shows a flat subduction at 200km depth underneath the Tibetan LAB in north-east Tibet. That means we see in northern Tibet the Tibetan LAB overriding the Asian LAB. The Tibetan LAB is thickening at the contact with the Tarim Basin. but thinning at the contact with the Sichuan Basin.

Computers have become an indispensable part of our lives. Since the first general-purpose electronic computer was created. rapid strides have been made in various aspects like die size. clock speed. performance. storage. compactness. etc. Today a laptop can compute more instructions per second than the ENIACs and big machines of earlier days. Today. we have got external hard disks that store humongous amounts of data in the order of tera-bytes compared to the slow magnetic tapes (almost obsolete now) and much smaller hard disks used before. Moore’s law states that the number of transistors that can be placed in an integrated circuit approximately doubles in a space of two years. Microprocessors came into the scene in 1970s and have become an integral part of the computer business because of their ability to ride the big changes and improvements in the computer arena and their cost effectiveness. The performance of microprocessors (nowadays just called processors) have also improved over the years as predicted by the Moore’s law. The exponential performance growth can be attributed only partially to technology advancement. The other important factor that contributed was the introduction of new architectures for processors. During the age of assembly language programming. introducing a new architecture demanded significant effort to ramp up to the new architecture from the old one.

85939,Banking on tissue banks for translational research: the first step,2011,BIMLESH KUMAR and PRAVEEN KUMAR,100,Current Science,7,962,,Translational research in health sciences depends on the detailed study of human tissue samples. Biomarker discoveries. gene polymorphism studies. target identification and validation are some of the platforms that require a large number of human specimens. Only then these bench results statistically qualify to be translated to be used at the bedside1. India. as a country. has moved from being ‘affected by the population’to ‘driven by the masses’. Setting up and flourishing of the clinical research organizations in the country is a standing testimonial to this fact. The principle of having a high recruitment aiding a successful clinical trial should be taken as a clue for tissue procurement and easing translational research. A national tissue bank bound by ethical. legal and medical guidelines is necessary to coordinate tissue collection and clinical data storage for use in biomedical research. Tissue samples like serum. urine. ascitic fluid. saliva and skin scrapings can be procured by non-invasive methods. whereas solid tissue samples can be obtained during therapeutic/diagnostic interventions at the surgical and pathological departments. Standard workflows and operating procedures for the collection of fresh frozen tissue samples can be worked out2. This will help to procure reliable samples for research. Such a source will soon turn out to be a goldmine in terms of population studies in translational research.The initiative to set up such tissue banks vests with the government and the research organizations of developed countries carrying out clinical trials in India.

85940,Integrated approach towards understanding interactions of mineral dust aerosol with warm clouds,2011,Prashant Kumar,,,,,,Mineral dust is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and represents a dominant type of particulate matter by mass. Despite its well-recognized importance. assessments of dust impacts on clouds and climate remain highly uncertain. This thesis addresses the role of dust as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and giant CCN (GCCN) with the goal of improving our understanding of dust-warm cloud interactions and their representation in climate models.  We investigate the CCN-relevant properties of mineral dust samples representative of major regional dust sources experimentally in the laboratory conditions to determine their respective affinity to water. Based on the experimental exponent derived from the dependence of critical supersaturation with particle dry diameter. we determine the dominant physics of activation (i.e.. adsorption activation theory (AT) or traditional Köhler theory (KT)) for dust particles from different global regions. Results from experimental measurements are used to support the development of a new parameterization of cloud droplet formation from dust CCN for climate models based on adsorption activation mechanism. The potential role of dust GCCN activating by AT within warm stratocumulus and convective clouds is also evaluated.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:WHBERAHVdrEC,0,https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/39596,,,,https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/39596/kumar_prashant_201105_phd.pdf,0,0,0

The data is delivered from the network to each destination. thereby creating a point-to-multipoint connection between the origin and the destination. To achieve such data delivery. both the origin and each delivery site execute site connection-manager software that allows the origin and the intended destinations to create the needed connections to facilitate data delivery and the network switches execute a network connection manager.

85943,Corporate Social Responsibility in Indian Steel Industry,2011,Pulidindi Venugopal and P Vijay Kumar and R Gangadhar,98510,Changing Perspectives of Management,,137,,Corporate companies adopted the culture of ‘doing the right thing’with which they build the brand image basing on distinctive ethical values in getting loyalty of the customers. Before independence. corporate sector was dominated by British firms and they had hardly any social relevance. Even after independence social activities are done by only Government organizations at large and then by NGOs. From the economic reform of 1990-91 there is enormous competition among the corporate companies. which caused a change in the objective of the firms from ‘to sale goods or product’to ‘satisfy the customers’. Today most of the companies are looking for social activities. and spending lot of money for the society. But the contribution is very nominal when compared with their profits and sales volumes. The term corporate social responsibility reflects the impact of corporation’s activities on society. as it is the duty of the corporate to carry some social activities. The vital social performances are community development. human resources. physical resources and Environmental contributions and product or service contributions. The iron and steel industry presents one of the most energy intensive sectors within the Indian economy. Historical examination of productivity growth in India’s Iron and steel industries reveal that we can identify exponential growth in its sales and profits. but their contribution to corporate social responsibility is more under scrutiny because the natural resources are consumed in a large scale and are granted many national and regional subsidies apart from the services and resources of people.

It has been demonstrated that 28 kDa outer membrane protein (OMP28) of Brucella induced Th2 type of immune response with predominant IgG1 and suppressed IL-2 production. However. coadministration of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide caused a shift in the immune response of antigen towards Th1 type with predominant IgG2a and upregulated IL-2 production.

In Code-PIC scheme. multiple-access interference (MAI) for the desired user is estimated based on the projection of subcarrier and subsequent removal of interference from the received signal depending on specific high or low data rate users. Carrier interferometry (CI) codes are used to minimize the cross-correlation between users. which significantly reduces the multiple-access interference (MAI) for the desired user. The effect of MAI in CI/MC-CDMA is reduced by giving proper phase shift to different set of users.

ZnO is being considered as technological material. Simple and green production techniques for ZnO and other nanostructured material can enhance the detection of its unusual properties. In this context water-based wet chemical synthesis process for nanostructured ZnO and Ag admixed ZnO nanocrystals has explored in present work. A high yield of the ZnO and Ag admixed ZnO nanocrystals with different Ag contents is successfully synthesized through a simple wet chemical method at the low temperatures in the absence of any surfactants/template. The as synthesized products has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform IR (FTIR). UV-VIS spectroscopy. and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The size of the nanoparticles is found to increase with the increase in Ag content. Large blue-shifts relative to the bulk exciton absorption are observed in the absorption and PL spectra in the pure and Ag admixed ZnO. The emission intensity of PL of Ag admixed ZnO has been found to decrease considerably with respect to that of pure ZnO.

New Zealand.,2010,Tatiana Garcia and Cathy Kilroy and Scott Larned and Aaron Ian Packman and Praveen Kumar,2010,AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts,,H41G-1165,,ConclusionsThe data used in this study was limited (short time-series of D. geminata) and a mismatch in the monitoring periodicities existed between D. geminata and the physical and chemical monitoring. Nonetheless. it was possible to extract valuable information about D. geminata behavior. The lagged cross correlation indicated a group of variables highly correlated with% cover and matt thickness. Additionally. other variables were identified that affect% cover and matt thickness because of history or antecedent conditions. Without considering the seasonal trend. the Fourier spectrum analysis identified a dominant periodicity of 3 months for% cover and 4 months for matt thickness. Together. the principle component analysis and the cross lagged correlation proved that D. geminata is governed by a combination of physical and chemical variables rather than by a single one. The reconstruction of the data by using the first two and three principal components captured the main futures and trends of the time series of% cover and matt thickness. Future work includes a varimax rotation of principal components. a Singular spectrum analysis and a transfer entropy analysis.

Studies have shown some chemical and physical techniques (coagulation. ultra filtration. and reverse osmosis) in effectively removing certain dyes from wastewater however. these systems merely transfer the dye from one form of waste to another (e.g. liquid to solid). and therefore cannot be considered as a complete treatment of the waste. An alternative mode of pollutant treatment is photocatalytic oxidation. This advanced oxidation process entails illuminating a photocatalyst (typically titanium dioxide. TiO2) with a particular wavelength of light to generate radicals; these radicals will subsequently oxidize the organic pollutants to CO2 and H2O. These processes frequently include the addition of oxidizing agents in the presence of a Catalyst or UV light. These types of processes are collectively called as advanced oxidation processes (AOP’s). The principal mechanism of AOP’s function is the generation of highly reactive free radicals. TiO2 has been demonstrated to be excellent catalyst and its behavior is well documented in theliterature.

85992,FPGA Implementation of Booth Wallace Multiplier,2010,Prabhat Kumar,,,,,,A fast and energy-efficient multiplier is always needed in electronics industry especially DSP. image processing and arithmetic units in microprocessors. Multiplier is such an important element which contributes substantially to the total power consumption of the system. On VLSI level. the area also becomes quite important as more area means more system cost. Speed is another key parameter while designing a multiplier for a specific application. These three parameters i.e. power. area and speed are always traded off. Speaking of DSP processors. area and speed are the most important factors. But sometimes. increasing speed also increases the power consumption. so there is an upper bound of speed for a given power criteria.

Inflow angle and RMW in Tropical Storm,2010,P Kumar,,29th Conference on Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology,,,,Value of Constant in Fletcher’s equation for maximum wind has been analytically re-examined with the help of gradient wind equation. Suitable approximations lead us to the mathematical result that maximum angular velocity is inversely proportional to square root of the peripheral radius. provided central an ambient pressure and the ring of maximum wind (RMW) are same for any two different tropical storms. Mathematical consistency demands that the value of RMW must be larger than the value of radius of maximum pressure gradient (rpmax). Predominance of radial component of velocity over the angular component. at places. is also possible. close to RMW. Observations of Mukherjee et al (1981) over Bay of Bengal are the cumulative effects of asymmetry causing factors eg gradient in earth’s vorticity. vertical shear. cold water tongue which induces overlying boundary layer modification. landfall and β-gyres. These could be responsible for large inflow angle of 60 0 to 70 0. at times. in preferred sectors.

A methodological framework for computation of TFP and its growth is also presented. Crop-specific TFP growth for India is presented using more recent micro farm level data for the past three decades. This paper provides useful information to those interested in doing research on these issues. Some of the concerns raised in this paper on productivity provide direction for future research in this area.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:12nnf2f32iYC,0,http://www.sidalc.net/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/?IsisScript=CIMMYT.xis&method=post&formato=2&cantidad=1&expresion=mfn=045927,,,,,0,0,0

A common difficulty encountered is a delay in diagnosis. The clinical features of a laryngeal foreign body may simulate asthma in an adult. The differentiation is necessary in the initial stages as the laryngeal foreign body can lead to sudden death due to airway obstruction. Sudden onset of wheeze in a non-asthmatic patient should arouse its suspicion. A case is reported where patient was transferred to respiratory intensive care unit for respiratory distress with wheeze which was later diagnosed as foreign body larynx.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:gubd_9ZgCi8C,0,https://europepmc.org/article/med/21388083,,,,,0,0,0

86022,Prevalence of Awkward Working Posture and Consequent Discomforts in Body Parts Among Workers of Cashew Nut Processing Factories in Coastal Regions of Eastern India,2010,Peddinti Naresh Kumar and J Sanjog and Sougata Karmakar,,,,,,India is the second largest producer of cashew nuts in the world. This large production is mostly contributed by coastal regions of eastern India. In Indian context. cashew nut factories employ lot of man power (female workers are predominant) in their production. Although ergonomic evaluation and subsequent interventions have been reported in various micro-small scale industries in India. investigation towards identification of physical ergonomic risk factors in cashew nut factories has rarely been studied. Hence. present paper aims to investigate occurrence of awkward working posture and consequent body part discomfort among workers of cashew nut processing factories.Direct observations. subjective assessment. interview with workers were used for determining regions of discomfort in various body parts and occurrence of awkward posture among workers/volunteers under study. Following the study. it was found that majority of the workers were suffering from lower and upper back pain. Moreover. awkward working posture was prevalent. This uncomfortable posture might be the reason for prevalence of body parts discomfort among workers of cashew nut factory. Awkward working posture in the long run might lead to musculoskeletal disorders. Immediate ergonomic interventions in terms of improvement of workstation design. avoiding awkward postures. change/modification in work schedule etc. are needed to be implemented in cashew nut shelling factories to ensure occupational well-being of the people involved in this sector.,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:5AT-p8ixKR4C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naresh_Kumar147/publication/281175178_Prevalence_of_Awkward_Working_Posture_and_Consequent_Discomforts_in_Body_Parts_Among_Workers_of_Cashew_Nut_Processing_Factories_in_Coastal_Regions_of_Eastern_India/links/55d97fd208aec156b9ac3856.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Naresh_Kumar147/publication/281175178_Prevalence_of_Awkward_Working_Posture_and_Consequent_Discomforts_in_Body_Parts_Among_Workers_of_Cashew_Nut_Processing_Factories_in_Coastal_Regions_of_Eastern_India/links/55d97fd208aec156b9ac3856.pdf,0,0,0

Aleutian and North-America covering diverse crustal ages. Recently. teleseismic S-to-p conversion technique proves to be a good method to map the uppermost mantle discontinuities such as Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB) in ocean as well as in continents. The chief advantages of using this method is that it is free from any shallow layer multiples as in case of P-to-s conversions in the time window of our interest and the large lateral sampling of S-wave owing to larger slowness. The latter property provides an opportunity to map the oceanic lithospheres from the data of the stations situated closer to …,True,MTRShRMAAAAJ:RzXy5zvoWjEC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFMDI13A1635K/abstract,,,,,0,0,0
