The X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the ZnO:Eu3+ consists of a single phase wurtzite structure.

Au phosphor degradation under electron excitation,1997,L Oosthuizen and HC Swart and PE Viljoen and PH Holloway and GLP Berning,120,Applied surface science,1-2,9-14,North-Holland,ZnS:Cu.Al.Au phosphor powder has been subjected to 2 keV electron bombardment at an oxygen pressure of 1×10−6 Torr. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and cathodoluminescence (CL). both excited by the same electron beam were used to monitor changes in the surface composition and luminous efficiency during electron bombardment. It was found that the phosphor surface degrades during prolonged electron bombardment. The chemical state of the surface before and after degradation was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A residual gas analyser was used to detect the volatile compounds coming from the surface during electron bombardment. It is shown that the electron beam stimulates the molecular oxygen into atomic species. which react with the ZnS to form ZnO and volatile SO2 with the consequent loss of CL intensity.

The highly crystalline zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the sol-gel route were used as host material for the dye. The efficiencies of the DSSCs formed using the BZO and AZB as window layers were obtained to be 1.56 and 1.84%. respectively. The enhanced efficiency in the case of an AZB window layer based DSSC is attributed to the increase in conductivity induced by co-doping of Al and B and an increase in the number of conducting pathways between the window layer and NPs provided by the nanorods. This facilitates a new approach in the window layer (doped ZnO) for DSSC application.,True,rIZN3aQAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C,79,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4824363,4536958240846145826,/scholar?cites=4536958240846145826,,,0,0,0

X-ray diffraction studies showed the formation of a single rutile SnO 2 phase with a tetragonal lattice structure. High resolution transmission electron microscopy studies revealed an increase in the average dot size from 2.2 to 3.6 nm with an increase of the combustion temperature from 350 to 550 C. A decrease in the band gap value from 3.37 to 2.76 eV was observed with the increase in dot size due to the quantum confinement effect. The photoluminescence emission was measured for excitation at 325 nm and it showed a broad blue emission band for all the combustion temperatures studied.

This phosphor was prepared via the solid state reaction process. The concentration of In3 + was varied from 0.05 to 0.3 mol% and it was found that the In3 + incorporation enhanced the intensity of the red emission and the afterglow decay time of the CaTiO3:Pr3 + phosphor considerably. It is most likely that the incorporated In3 + charge compensators enhanced the luminescence intensity of the phosphor by neutralizing the additional positive charge generated by the Pr3 + ions when substituting in the Ca2 + ions site. The orthorhombic CaTiO3 phase was identified by X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy images showed agglomerated particles with different shapes and sizes.

Unbiased grouping of these profiles independently clustered agents of known mechanism of action accurately and was successful at predicting the mechanism of action of several unknown agents. These predictions were validated biochemically for two agents of previously uncategorized mechanism. pyridoacridones and phenothiazines. Analysis of this data set further revealed 150 underlying clusters of coordinately regulated genes offering the first glimpse at the full metabolic potential of this organism. A signature subset of these gene clusters was sufficient to classify all known agents as to mechanism of action.

This study evaluated the dust mite fauna in Singaporean homes. METHODS: A total of 134 dust samples from 50 homes were evaluated. Dust mites were isolated. identified and quantified by standard techniques. RESULTS: Dust mites were isolated from 130/134 (97%) samples. with mites identified in all samples from sofas (n= 21) and carpets (n= 13). and 49/50 (98%) and 47/50 (94%) from mattresses and bedroom floors. respectively. All samples from sofas and carpets had more than 500 mites/g compared with 47/50 (94%) and 23/50 (46%) from mattresses and floors. respectively. Blomia tropicalis was the predominant mite (62% of total mites) followed by D. pteronyssinus (16% of total mites). Eight samples had a predominance of Sturnophagoides brasiliensis and Tarsonemus granarius. Other species that accounted approximately 1% of mites identified included D. farinae. Austroglycyphagus malaysiensis. Cheyletus malaccensis. Malayoglyphus intermedius. Suidasia pontifica and Tyrophagus putrescentiae.

1054781,The effect of ventilation strategies of child care centers on indoor air quality and respiratory health of children in Singapore,2007,MS Zuraimi and KW Tham and FT Chew and PL Ooi,17,Indoor air,4,317-327,Copenhagen: Danish Technical Press. c1991-,This paper reports the effects of ventilation strategies on indoor air quality (IAQ) and respiratory health of children within 104 child care centers (CCCs) in a hot and humid climate. The CCCs were categorized by ventilation strategies: natural (NV). air-conditioned and mechanically ventilated (ACMV). air-conditioned using split units (AC). and hybrid (NV and AC operated intermittently). The concentration levels of IAQ parameters in NV CCCs are characterized by the influence of the outdoors and good dilution of indoor pollutants. The lower ventilation rates in air-conditioned CCCs result in higher concentrations of occupant-related pollutants but lower outdoor pollutant ingress.

A QCM immunosensor was developed for the detection of both cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV) and odontoglossum ringspot tobamovirus (ORSV) by pre-coating the QCMs with virus-specific antibodies. Upon binding of virions in either purified form or crude sap of infected orchids with the immobilised virus antibodies. the increase in mass at the QCM surface resulted in a reduction in the frequency of resonance oscillation in a manner dependent upon the amount of virus bound. The QCM was able to detect as low as 1 ng each of the two orchid viruses. This detection sensitivity is comparable to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) but the assay is faster.

Thus. Sime Darby Plantation used 10 genomic microsatellite markers to genotype 8 sets of 5 ramets +1 ortet and 2 single ortets. The average genetic distance (D) among oil palms from the same set of ramets and ortet was 0.0000 with the exception of sets containing off-type ramets (D = [0.0834 - 0.1505]). The dendrogram showed that the ramets and their ortet of origin formed a sub-cluster. confirming their simi-larity. The 10 microsatellite markers were valuable to Sime Darby as tools for verification of ramet-to-ortet relation-ships and for the identification of off-types. Furthermore. the set of 10 markers revealed a high expected heterozygosity (He = 0.634) that is a high expected heterosis effect on which yield depends.,True,5gwyELYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,10,https://www.scirp.org/html/8239.html,10465065912708544681,/scholar?cites=10465065912708544681,,https://www.scirp.org/html/8239.html,0,0,0

Here. we report an extended version genome of E. guineensis that is 1.2 Gb in length. an improvement of the physical genome coverage to 79% from the previous 43%. The improvement was made by assigning an additional 1968 originally unplaced scaffolds that were available publicly into the physical genome. By integrating three ultra-dense linkage maps and using them to place genomic scaffolds. the 16 pseudomolecules were extended. As we show. the improved genome has enhanced the mapping resolution for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and permitted further identification of candidate genes/protein-coding regions (CDSs) and any non-coding RNA that may be associated with them for further studies. We then employed the new physical map in a comparative genomics study against two other agriculturally and economically important palm species—date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and coconut palm (Cocos nucifera L.)—confirming the high level of conserved synteny among these palm species. We also used the improved oil palm genome assembly version as a palm genome reference to extend the date palm physical map. The improved genome of oil palm will enable molecular breeding approaches to expedite crop improvement. especially in the largest subfamily of Arecoideae. which consists of 107 species belonging to Arecaceae.

1054833,Major qtls for trunk height and correlated agronomic traits provide insights into multiple trait integration in oil palm breeding,2020,Chee-Keng Teh and Ai-Ling Ong and Sean Mayes and Festo Massawe and David Ross Appleton,11,Genes,7,826,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Superior oil yield is always the top priority of the oil palm industry. Short trunk height (THT) and compactness traits have become increasingly important to improve harvesting efficiency since the industry started to suffer yield losses due to labor shortages. Breeding populations with low THT and short frond length (FL) are actually available. such as Dumpy AVROS pisifera (DAV) and Gunung Melayu dura (GM). However. multiple trait stacking still remains a challenge for oil palm breeding. which usually requires 12–20 years to complete a breeding cycle. In this study. yield and height increment in the GM× GM (GM-3341) and the GM× DAV (GM-DAV-3461) crossing programs were evaluated and palms with good yield and smaller height increment were identified. In the GM-3341 family. non-linear THT growth between THT_2008 (seven years old) and THT_2014 (13 years old) was revealed by a moderate correlation. suggesting that inter-palm competition becomes increasingly important. In total. 19 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for THT_2008 (8). oil per palm (O/P)(7) and FL (4) were localized on the GM-3341 linkage map. with an average mapping interval of 2.01 cM. Three major QTLs for THT_2008. O/P and FL are co-located on chromosome 11 and reflect the correlation of THT_2008 with O/P and FL. Multiple trait selection for high O/P and low THT (based on the cumulative effects of positive alleles per trait) identified one palm from 100 palms. but with a large starting population of 1000–1500 seedling per cross. this low frequency could be easily compensated for during breeding selection.

In oil palm. the presence of three fruit forms permits these assumptions to be tested. although only after field planting. The presence of incorrect fruit forms in a cross is a clear sign of illegitimacy. Given that tenera forms produce 30% more oil for the same weight of fruit as dura. the presence of low levels of dura contamination can have major effect during the economic lifespan of an oil palm. which is around 25 years. We evaluated two methods for legitimacy test 1) The use of SHELL markers to the gene that determines the shell-thickness trait 2) The use of SNP markers. to determine the legitimacy of the cross. Our results indicate that the SHELL markers can theoretically reduce the major losses due to dura contamination of tenera planting material. However. these markers cannot distinguish illegitimate tenera. which reduces the value of having bred elite tenera for commercial planting and in the breeding programme. where fruit form is of limited utility. and incorrect identity could lead to significant problems. We propose an optimised approach using SNPs for routine quality control. Both dura and tenera contamination can be identified and removed at or before the nursery stage. An optimised legitimacy assay using SNP markers coupled with a suitable sampling scheme is now ready to be deployed as a standard control for seed production and breeding in oil palm. The same approach will also be an effective solution for other perennial crops. such as coconut and date palm.,True,5gwyELYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-019-2062-x,3326533801201297729,/scholar?cites=3326533801201297729,,https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-019-2062-x,0,0,0

Cham,Oil palm yield has been stagnated for decades due to long selection cycle; therefore. marker-assisted selection was initiated. Many quantitative trait loci (QTL) for complex traits were dissected using conventional linkage analyses. but the results were inconsistent and unreproducible across families. The largest challenge is mainly limited recombination in small families leading to detection failure of QTLs. To enhance the detection power. genome-wide association studies (GWAS) access total recombination that accumulated in large multi-parental populations. However. false-positive signals must be monitored and controlled. The recent GWAS for mesocarp oil content revealed the major QTLs on Chromosome 5. This is where the researcher can start mining the candidate genes for further functional studies.

Three important photosynthetic genes were identified using differentially expressed gene analysis (DEGs) and were found to be significantly enriched through Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment: chlorophyll a-b binding protein (CAB-13). photosystem I (PSI). and Ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR). particularly for sampling points at non-peak light (11:00 and 19:00). ranging from 3.3-fold (PSI) and 5.6-fold (FNR) to 10.3-fold (CAB-13). Subsequent gas exchange measurements further supported increased carbon assimilation through higher level of internal CO2 concentration (Ci). stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) in high-oil content palms.

However. the biosynthetic regulation and drivers of palm mesocarp development are still not well understood. Multiplatform metabolomics technology was used to profile palm metabolites during six critical stages of fruit development in order to better understand lipid biosynthesis. Significantly higher amino acid levels were observed in palm mesocarp preceding lipid biosynthesis. Nucleosides were found to be in high concentration during lipid biosynthesis. whereas levels of metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were more concentrated during early fruit development.

Oil palm mesocarp and kernel tissues were extracted using a modified perchloric acid extraction and separated via HPLC to quantify the accumulation of these seven nucleotides in relation to lipid composition. Principal component analysis on palm mesocarp and kernel samples displayed clustering and indicated that palm mesocarp contained higher ATP and NAD+ than palm kernel. The higher levels of ATP and NADH may be attributable to the higher content of unsaturated and long chain fatty acids in found palm mesocarp.,True,kCYdqa8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13562-013-0234-6,,,,,0,0,0

Significantly higher amino acid levels preceding lipid biosynthesis and nucleosides during lipid biosynthesis were observed in a higher yielding commercial palm population. Levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis revealed interesting divergence of flux towards glycerol-3-phosphate. while carbon utilization differences in the TCA cycle were proven by an increase in malic acid/citric acid ratio.

Clavulanic acid prevents drug resistance by pathogens against these β-lactam antibiotics by preventing the degradation of the β-lactam ring. thus ensuring eradication of these harmful microorganisms from the host. This systematic review provides an overview on the fermentation conditions that affect the production of clavulanic acid in the firstly described producer. Streptomyces clavuligerus. A thorough search was conducted using predefined terms in several electronic databases (PubMed. Medline. ScienceDirect. EBSCO). from database inception to June 30th 2015. Studies must involve wild-type Streptomyces clavuligerus. and full texts needed to be available. A total of 29 eligible articles were identified.

The addition of glycerol or other vegetable oils (e.g. olive oil. corn oil) could potentially affect clavulanic acid production. Furthermore. some amino acids such as arginine and ornithine. could serve as potential precursors to increase clavulanic acid yield.

In normal rats. Epo caused a dose-dependent increase in both reticulocyte and platelet numbers. the reticulocyte response preceding that of platelets. Withdrawal of Epo resulted in reticulocytes and platelets returning to control levels. [75Se]-selenomethionine incorporation into platelets was also enhanced in response to Epo. Chronic daily administration of rHuEpo resulted in steady state erythrocyte levels after 12 to 14 days. which were elevated 20% above controls.

Nevertheless. mitochondrial gene knockout (ρ0) cells that are defective in mitochondrial respiration require oxygen for growth and consume oxygen at the cell surface via trans-plasma membrane electron transport (tPMET). This raises the possibility that cell surface oxygen consumption may support glycolytic energy metabolism by reoxidising cytosolic NADH to facilitate continued glycolysis. In this paper we determined the extent of cell surface oxygen consumption in a panel of 19 cancer cell lines. Non-mitochondrial (myxothiazol-resistant) oxygen consumption was demonstrated to consist of at least two components. cell surface oxygen consumption (inhibited by extracellular NADH) and basal oxygen consumption (insensitive to both myxothiazol and NADH).

This is supported by observations that erythropoietin (Epo). the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. can affect platelet production when injected into animals. In this study we provide experimental evidence for a direct effect of Epo on thrombopoiesis by demonstrating that 125I-labeled recombinant human Epo binds to rat and mouse bone marrow megakaryocytes. Thus. autoradiographic analysis using cold competition to measure specific binding has been used to demonstrate that Epo binding to megakaryocytes increases with megakaryocyte maturation. When corrected for cell size. Epo binding sites per unit surface area increase from Stage I megakaryoblasts to Stage II megakaryocytes. and then remain approximately constant throughout further megakaryocyte maturation. Receptor density on megakaryocytes is similar to that on pronormoblasts in the rat. and in mice is 60% that on pronormoblasts. No binding of Epo to platelets or to naked megakaryocyte nuclei was detected. Equilibrium binding studies with partially purified rat megakaryocytes (20%-40% pure). where megakaryocytes are the only significant Epo binding cell population. showed a single class of saturable. high-affinity binding sites present on average at 6500 binding sites per megakaryocyte with a KD of 287 pM.

To determine whether the transfer of mtDNA involves whole mitochondria. we injected B16ρ0 mouse melanoma cells into syngeneic C57BL/6Nsu9-DsRed2 mice that express red fluorescent protein in their mitochondria. We document that mtDNA is acquired by transfer of whole mitochondria from the host animal. leading to normalisation of mitochondrial respiration.

Any loss of this adaptive response has the potential to compromise cellular function and render the cell more susceptible to external stressors such as oxidative stress. radiation. chemotherapeutic drugs and hypoxia. Mitochondria play a vital role in bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways and can rapidly adjust to meet the metabolic needs of the cell. Increased demand is met by mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion of individual mitochondria into dynamic networks. whereas a decrease in demand results in the removal of superfluous mitochondria though fission and mitophagy Effective communication between nucleus and mitochondria (mito-nuclear crosstalk). involving the generation of different mitochondrial stress signals as well as the nuclear stress response pathways to deal with these stressors. maintains bioenergetic homeostasis under most conditions. However. when mtDNA mutations accumulate and mito-nuclear crosstalk falters. mitochondria fail to deliver critical functional outputs. Mutations in mtDNA have been implicated in neuromuscular and neurodegenerative mitochondriopathies and complex diseases like diabetes. cardiovascular diseases. gastrointestinal disorders. skin disorders ageing and cancer.

Judging by the number of conferences which have been assembled to deal with the topic. cellulose and its derivatives continue to arouse great scientific interest. Matching this interest has been the development in copolymer science and technology. In both instances the driving force has been the search for products having useful. new or interesting properties. It appeared inevitable that these two concepts would be brought together at some time in the research and development of cellulosic copolymers. That time has arrived. In assembling this text our aim was to present an informative account of the chemistry and technology of cellulosic copolymers. As such. we intended that the contents be of interest to all those concerned with the production and use of cellulosic products whether in academic or industrial circles. Sections of the text should be of value in undergraduate and post-graduate teaching. provided the student is given guidance in following the text. The volume is divided into eight chapters. each dealing with factors which are relevant to an under standing of cellulosic copolymers.

Employing multi-reference determinant computational methods results in significant modifications to the quantitative aspects of the response properties. compared to values computed using a single determinant ground state. and leads to computed hyperpolarizabilities even larger than previously estimated.

A palindromic sequence with two guanine bases that play the roles of hole donor and acceptor. separated by a bridge of two adenine bases. was analyzed using combined molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum-chemical methods. Surprisingly. electronic structure calculations on individual MD snapshots show significant frontier orbital electronic population on the bridge in ∼10% of the structures. Electron-density delocalization to the bridge is found to be gated by fluctuations of the covalent conjugated bond structure of the aromatic rings of the nucleic bases. It is concluded. therefore. that both thermal hopping and superexchange should contribute significantly to charge transfer even in short DNA/PNA fragments.

The interplay between the DA energy gap and DA coupling fluctuations is particularly noteworthy in biological ET. where flexible protein and mobile water bridges take center stage. Here. we discuss the critical timescales at play for ET reactions in fluctuating media. highlighting issues of the Condon approximation. average medium versus fluctuation-controlled electron tunneling. gated and solvent relaxation controlled electron transfer. and the influence of inelastic tunneling on electronic coupling pathway interferences.

Two mechanisms have been identified for ET in DNA. a single-step tunneling process and a multistep charge-hopping process. The dynamics of tunneling reactions depend on both the distance between the electron donor and acceptor and the nature of the molecular bridge separating the donor and acceptor. In the case of protein and alkane bridges. the distance dependence is not strongly dependent on the properties of the donor and acceptor. In contrast. we show here that the distance decay of DNA ET rates varies markedly with the energetics of the donor and acceptor relative to the bridge.

1055319,Strain-induced alignment in collagen gels,2009,David Vader and Alexandre Kabla and David Weitz and Lakshminarayana Mahadevan,4,PloS one,6,e5902,Public Library of Science,Collagen is the most abundant extracellular-network-forming protein in animal biology and is important in both natural and artificial tissues. where it serves as a material of great mechanical versatility. This versatility arises from its almost unique ability to remodel under applied loads into anisotropic and inhomogeneous structures. To explore the origins of this property. we develop a set of analysis tools and a novel experimental setup that probes the mechanical response of fibrous networks in a geometry that mimics a typical deformation profile imposed by cells in vivo. We observe strong fiber alignment and densification as a function of applied strain for both uncrosslinked and crosslinked collagenous networks. This alignment is found to be irreversibly imprinted in uncrosslinked collagen networks. suggesting a simple mechanism for tissue organization at the microscale. However. crosslinked networks display similar fiber alignment and the same geometrical properties as uncrosslinked gels. but with full reversibility. Plasticity is therefore not required to align fibers. On the contrary. our data show that this effect is part of the fundamental non-linear properties of fibrous biological networks.,True,iiyj5MsAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC,353,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005902,16199737310127373642,/scholar?cites=16199737310127373642,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005902,0,0,0

This enzyme utilizes a diiron center to catalyze the O2- and NADPH-dependent introduction of a cis double bond between carbons 9 and 10 of stearoyl-ACP. yielding oleoyl-ACP. In the present study. we have used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to provide the first metrical information for the diferric oxidation state. These studies reveal distinct diiron clusters that have Fe-Fe distances of either 3.12 or 3.41 Å. The species having the 3.12 Å Fe-Fe distance also exhibits a 1.8 Å Fe-O bond and is thus proposed to represent Δ9D molecules containing a (μ-oxo)bis(μ-carboxylato)diiron(III) cluster.

This transient degeneracy. or flickering electronic resonance among states. is found to support coherent (ballistic) charge transfer. Importantly.

Explicit electronic structure theory is applied routinely now to elucidate ET mechanisms. to capture pathway interferences. and to treat …,True,Aj2eWvIAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,127,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar500271d,15054350083359271595,/scholar?cites=15054350083359271595,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar500271d,0,0,0

However. these ET reactions may involve multiple redox cofactors in van der Waals contact with each other and with vibronic broadenings on the same scale as the energy gaps among the species. In this regime. fluctuations of the molecular structures and of the medium can produce transient energy level matching among multiple electronic states. This transient degeneracy. or flickering electronic resonance among states. is found to support coherent (ballistic) charge transfer. Importantly.

When the differences in monomer redox-potential induced by the environment are small (as compared with the monomer–monomer electronic interactions). delocalization persists. Here we show that guanine (G) runs in double-stranded DNA support delocalization over 4–5 guanine bases. The weak interaction between delocalized G blocks on opposite DNA strands is known to support partially coherent long-range charge transport. The molecular-resolution model developed here finds that the coherence among these G blocks follows an even–odd orbital-symmetry rule and predicts that weakening the interaction between G blocks exaggerates the resistance oscillations. These findings indicate how sequence can be exploited to change the balance between coherent and …,True,Aj2eWvIAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,47,https://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v8/n10/abs/nchem.2545.html,8696632322798367857,/scholar?cites=8696632322798367857,,,0,0,0

Here. we present an investigation of hole transport and trapping across a DNA-based three-way junction systems by a combination of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Hole transport across the junction is proposed to be gated by conformational fluctuations in the ground state which bring the transiently populated hole carrier nucleobases into better aligned geometries on the nanosecond time scale. thus modulating the π–π electronic coupling along the base pair sequence.,True,Aj2eWvIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,41,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b00931,15349362496033222056,/scholar?cites=15349362496033222056,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39275401/JACS-TWJ.pdf,0,0,0

The distance dependence of FR transport thus mimics the exponential decay that is usually associated with electron tunneling. although FR transport involves real carrier population on the bridge and is not a tunneling phenomenon. Likely candidates for FR transport are macromolecules with ET groups in van der Waals contact: DNA. bacterial nanowires. multi-heme proteins. strongly coupled porphyrin arrays. and proteins with closely packed redox-active residues.

The unique synergistic effect between MX and LB has been observed at an optimum mole ratio of 1:1. High turnover frequency (TOF. h−1) indicates that an increase in the reaction efficiency of up to 40 times is obtained by comparison with the reaction carried out using only MX. The activity of MX primarily falls in the order of alkali metal ion’s Lewis acidity.

Thiol-terminated chiral scaffold molecules containing a porphyrin chromophore were self-assembled on gold surfaces to form a monolayer. Incorporation of the SAM-coated gold into an electrochemical cell and illumination with visible light generated a cathodic photocurrent. When using circularly polarized light. the photocurrent displayed an asymmetry (different magnitude of photocurrent for right versus left polarization) that changed with the molecular chirality (left- or right-handedness of the scaffold). A symmetry constraint on the electronic coupling between the porphyrin and the organic scaffold is proposed as a possible mechanism for the photocurrent asymmetry. ,True,YB5PffsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,60,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp055145c,2401300289570948091,/scholar?cites=2401300289570948091,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41727708/Molecular_Chirality_and_Charge_Transfer_20160129-15222-uz8b06.pdf,0,0,0

1055610,Exploring non-linear distance metrics in the structure–activity space: QSAR models for human estrogen receptor,2018,Ilya A Balabin and Richard S Judson,10,Journal of cheminformatics,1,1-11,BioMed Central,Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are important tools used in discovering new drug candidates and identifying potentially harmful environmental chemicals. These models often face two fundamental challenges: limited amount of available biological activity data and noise or uncertainty in the activity data themselves. To address these challenges. we introduce and explore a QSAR model based on custom distance metrics in the structure-activity space. The model is built on top of the k-nearest neighbor model. incorporating non-linearity not only in the chemical structure space. but also in the biological activity space. The model is tuned and evaluated using activity data for human estrogen receptor from the US EPA ToxCast and Tox21 databases. The model closely trails the CERAPP consensus model (built on top of 48 individual human estrogen receptor activity models) in agonist activity predictions and consistently outperforms the CERAPP consensus model in antagonist activity predictions. We suggest that incorporating non-linear distance metrics may significantly improve QSAR model performance when the available biological activity data are limited.,True,58UKHh8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,2,https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-018-0300-0,9727090450533178796,/scholar?cites=9727090450533178796,,https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-018-0300-0,0,0,0

Here. single-molecule force spectroscopy was used to directly quantify and compare the forces associated with the ring opening of gem-dibromo and gem-dichlorocyclopropanes affixed along the backbone of cis-polynorbornene and cis-polybutadiene. The critical force for isomerization drops by about one-third in the polynorbornene scaffold relative to polybutadiene.

Thermodynamic analysis suggests that this chirality-dependent partition is determined by nanotube’s intrinsic hydrophobicity and reveals two distinct regimes in hydrophobicity-chirality relation: a small diameter (<1 nm) regime. where curvature effect makes larger diameter tubes more hydrophobic than small diameter ones. and …,True,P2hGlRMAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC,265,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja402762e,14756536807816062076,/scholar?cites=14756536807816062076,,http://pstorage-acs-6854636.s3.amazonaws.com/4058524/ja402762e_si_001.pdf,0,0,0

1055959,Absorbing state phase transitions with quenched disorder,2004,Jef Hooyberghs and Ferenc Iglói and Carlo Vanderzande,69,Physical Review E,6,066140,American Physical Society,Quenched disorder—in the sense of the Harris criterion—is generally a relevant perturbation at an absorbing state phase transition point. Here using a strong disorder renormalization group framework and effective numerical methods we study the properties of random fixed points for systems in the directed percolation universality class. For strong enough disorder the critical behavior is found to be controlled by a strong disorder fixed point. which is isomorph with the fixed point of random quantum Ising systems. In this fixed point dynamical correlations are logarithmically slow and the static critical exponents are conjecturedly exact for one-dimensional systems. The renormalization group scenario is confronted with numerical results on the random contact process in one and two dimensions and satisfactory agreement is found. For weaker disorder the numerical results indicate static critical exponents which vary …,True,4pO65HgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,103,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066140,3942347661601834194,/scholar?cites=3942347661601834194,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0402086,0,0,0

To this end. in Belgium as in many other countries. a fixed network of monitoring stations is operated. In order to estimate the ozone concentrations over the whole territory. a model is needed to spatially complement the sparse measurements. This paper describes the development of an interpolation scheme which is aimed at fast operational use. The model uses the population density as auxiliary data to remove a spatial trend due to titration by nitric oxide. The residuals are interpolated by kriging. As a benchmark the inverse distance weighting interpolation method is used with and without the detrending. The proposed model systematically improves the interpolation and makes a significant difference when estimating human exposure to ozone.

Interventions that delay or prevent lethal pathologies will extend lifespan. Here we identify life-limiting pathologies in Caenorhabditis elegans with a necropsy analysis of worms that have died of old age. Our results imply the presence of multiple causes of death. Specifically. we identify two classes of corpse: early deaths with a swollen pharynx (which we call ‘P deaths’). and later deaths with an atrophied pharynx (termed ‘p deaths’). The effects of interventions on lifespan can be broken down into changes in the frequency and/or timing of either form of death.

Currently. it is not possible to predict if an overexpressed MP will end up in the cytoplasmic membrane or in inclusion bodies. Overexpression of MPs in the cytoplasmic membrane is strongly favoured to overexpression in inclusion bodies. since it is relatively easy to isolate MPs from membranes and usually impossible to isolate them from inclusion bodies. Here we show that green fluorescent protein (GFP). when fused to an overexpressed MP. can be used as an indicator to monitor membrane insertion versus inclusion body formation of overexpressed MPs in E. coli. Furthermore. we show that an overexpressed MP can be recovered from a MP–GFP fusion using a site specific protease.

To address this challenge. a range of different therapeutic strategies is currently in development. Many of these are based on the concept of targeted therapies. where target proteins are drivers of cancer processes or synthetic vulnerabilities of cancer cells. In this project we have used the newly developed CETSA method to monitor levels of drug binding to specific target proteins in tumors and primary cells from breast cancer patients. CETSA is a generic method for evaluating drug binding to target proteins in cells and tissues. The technique is based on the physical phenomenon of ligand-induced thermal stabilization of target proteins. Using this technique. it is possible to look at interactions between a drug and protein of interest without having to label them.

A major challenge in the design and characterization of degraders acting as molecular glues is that binding of the molecule to the protein of interest (PoI) is not needed for efficient and selective protein degradation; instead. one needs to understand the interaction with the responsible ligase. Similarly. for proteasome targeting chimeras (PROTACs). understanding the binding characteristics of the PoI alone is not sufficient.

The neuroblastoma-primary retina hybrid cells (N18-RE105) are susceptible to glutamate-induced cytotoxicity.

Lowering cystine concentrations in the cell culture medium results in cytotoxicity similar to that induced by glutamate addition in its morphology. kinetics. and Ca2+ dependence.

The incorporation of a base and its analogue into DNA by wild-type. mutator and antimutator DNA polymerases,1974,Maurice J Bessman and Nicholas Muzyczka and Myron F Goodman and Ronald L Schnaar,88,Journal of molecular biology,2,409-421,Academic Press,The incorporation and turnover of adenine and its analogue 2-aminopurine into DNA by purified wild-type. mutator. and antimutator T4 DNA polymerase have been measured. Antimutators incorporate less 2-aminopurine into DNA than does wild type. and imitators incorporate more than wild type. Analysis of these data is consistent with the idea that the incorporation of 2-aminopurine is influenced primarily by the ratio of 3′-exonuclease to polymerase activities of the different enzymes. The experimental results conform to a model equation. which expresses the base incorporation frequency as a function of the polymerase insertion and removal activities.

NPs released as nanomaterial-containing wastes from household. industrial and medical products are emerging as a new threat to the environment. Plants. being fixed to the two major environmental sinks where NPs accumulate ¬— namely water and soil. cannot escape the impact of nanopollution. Recent studies have shown that plant growth. development and physiology are significantly affected by NPs. But. the effect of NPs on plant secondary metabolism is still obscure. The induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following interactions with NPs has been observed consistently across plant species. Taking into account the existing link between ROS and secondary signaling messengers that lead to transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolism. in this perspective we put forward the argument that ROS induced in plants upon their interaction with NPs will likely interfere with plant secondary metabolism. As plant secondary metabolites play vital roles in plant performance. communication and adaptation. a comprehensive understanding of plant secondary metabolism in response to NPs is an utmost priority.,True,ZES-L5YAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,100,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00832/full,8110708096393380636,/scholar?cites=8110708096393380636,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00832/full,0,0,0
1056390,Secondary Metabolites in the  Green Synthesis of Metallic Nanoparticles,2018,Gregory Franklin Gregory Marslin and Karthik Siram and Qaisar Maqbool,11,Materials,6,,MDPI,The ability of organisms and organic compounds to reduce metal ions and stabilize them into nanoparticles (NPs) forms the basis of green synthesis. To date. synthesis of NPs from various metal ions using a diverse array of plant extracts has been reported. However. a clear understanding of the mechanism of green synthesis of NPs is lacking. Although most studies have neglected to analyze the green-synthesized NPs (GNPs) for the presence of compounds derived from the extract. several studies have demonstrated the conjugation of sugars. secondary metabolites. and proteins in these biogenic NPs. Despite several reports on the bioactivities (antimicrobial. antioxidant. cytotoxic. catalytic. etc.) of GNPs. only a handful of studies have compared these activities with their chemically synthesized counterparts. These comparisons have demonstrated that GNPs possess better bioactivities than NPs synthesized by other methods. which might be attributed to the presence of plant-derived compounds in these NPs. The ability of NPs to bind with organic compounds to form a stable complex has huge potential in the harvesting of precious molecules and for drug discovery. if harnessed meticulously. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of green synthesis and high-throughput screening of stabilizing/capping agents on the physico-chemical properties of GNPs is warranted to realize the full potential of green nanotechnology.

In addition to this. there are reports on the anticancer activity of ABZ against a wide range of cancer types. However. its effect on glioma has not yet been reported. In the present study. cytotoxicity of ABZ and ABZ loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (ASLNs) was tested in human glioma/astrocytoma cell line (U-87 MG). Using glyceryl trimyristate as lipid carrier and tween 80 as surfactant spherical ASLNs with an average size of 218.4±5.1 nm were prepared by a combination of high shear homogenization and probe sonication methods. A biphasic in vitro release pattern of ABZ from ASLNs was observed. where 82% of ABZ was released in 24 h. In vitro cell line studies have shown that ABZ in the form of ASLNs was more cytotoxic (IC50= 4.90 µg/mL) to U-87 MG cells compared to ABZ in the free form (IC 50= 13.30 µg/mL) due to the efficient uptake of the former by these cells.

As per the current knowledge. diffusion and phagocytosis are the two mechanisms through which colloids reach the lymphatic system. Several parameters including particle size and charge have been shown to affect the direct uptake of colloids by the lymphatic system. Although many researchers attached ligands on the surface of colloids to promote phagocytosis-mediated lymphatic delivery. another school of thought suggests avoidance of phagocytosis by use of carriers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) ylated colloids to impart stealth attributes and evade phagocytosis.

To date. synthesis of NPs from various metal ions using a diverse array of plant extracts has been reported. However. a clear understanding of the mechanism of green synthesis of NPs is lacking. Although most studies have neglected to analyze the green-synthesized NPs (GNPs) for the presence of compounds derived from the extract. several studies have demonstrated the conjugation of sugars. secondary metabolites. and proteins in these biogenic NPs. Despite several reports on the bioactivities (antimicrobial. antioxidant. cytotoxic. catalytic. etc.) of GNPs. only a handful of studies have compared these activities with their chemically synthesized counterparts. These comparisons have demonstrated that GNPs possess better bioactivities than NPs synthesized by other methods. which might be attributed to the presence of plant-derived compounds in these NPs. The ability of NPs to bind with organic compounds to form a stable complex has huge potential in the harvesting of precious molecules and for drug discovery. if harnessed meticulously.

First carbon tube is synthesized by lijima in 1991. carbon tubes are cylindrical molecules formed by rolling single layer or multiple layer of graphene sheets into cylinder [1]. Carbon nano tubes can be synthesized by using following techniques via. electric discharge. laser ablation. thermal or plasma enhanced chemical vapor disposition (CVD)[2]. Based on their structure they can be classified into single walled (0.4-3nm). double walled (1-3nm) and multi walled (2-100nm) carbon nano tubes. Among these. single walled CNTs can readily penetrate into the cell and this property makes them a suitable carrier for drugs to be delivered in to the cells [3].Apart from these properties CNTs have high mechanical strength and high aspect ratio and more bio compatible. Due to its high surface area they are capable of conjugating and adsorbing with wide variety of therapeutics and bio molecules. CNTs help these molecules to penetrate into the target cells and to treat disease like cancer [4-6]. The main disadvantage of CNT in drug delivery is their poor soluble in nature.

Several parameters including particle size and charge have been shown to affect the direct uptake of colloids by the lymphatic system. Although many researchers attached ligands on the surface of colloids to promote phagocytosis-mediated lymphatic delivery. another school of thought suggests avoidance of phagocytosis by use of carriers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) ylated colloids to impart stealth attributes and evade phagocytosis.

Functional recovery (left ventricular developed pressure—LVDP. and rate of development of pressure). reperfusion arrhythmias. and infarct size (TTC staining) served as the endpoints. A transient increase in LVDP (32%–75%) occurred at all concentrations of HI. while coronary flow (CF) was significantly increased after HI 180 and 360. Only a moderate increase in LVDP (21% and 55%) and a tendency to increase CF was observed at HRS 180 and 360. HI and HRS at 180 and 360 significantly improved postischemic recovery of LVDP. Both the drugs dose-dependently reduced the numbers of ectopic beats and duration of ventricular tachycardia. The size of infarction was significantly decreased by HI 360. while HRS significantly reduced the infarct size at all concentrations in a dose-dependent manner.

Autophagosomes induced by Zol were visualized and quantified in both transient (pDendra2-hLC3) and stable MCF-7-GFP-LC3 cell lines. Acidic vesicular organelles were quantified using acridine orange. Zol induced a dose and time dependent autophagy. Treatment of Zol increased oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells. which was reversed by GGOH or anti-oxidants. On the other hand. treatment with GGOH or anti-oxidants resulted in decreased levels of LC3B-II. Further. the induced autophagy was irreversible. as the washout of Zol after 2 h or 24 h resulted in similar levels of autophagy. as induced by continuous treatment after 72 h. Thus. it can be summarized that Zol can induce a dose dependent but irreversible autophagy. by its effect on the mevalonate pathway and oxidative stress.

On the other hand. some stressful stimuli related to RF including reactive oxygen species. transient episodes of ischemia (hypoxia). high glucose and other may play a dual role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (IRI). Besides their deleterious effects. these factors may trigger adaptive processes in the heart resulting in greater resistance against IRI. which is also a characteristic feature of the female myocardium. However. sensitivity to ischemia is increasing with age in both genders. Current research indicates that comorbidity related to lifestyle may impair the cardiac response to acute ischemia not only by interference with pathophysiological mechanisms of IRI per se. but via suppression of intrinsic protective mechanisms in the heart and its ability to tolerate the ischemic challenges. although the role of RF has not been unequivocally proven. Moreover. even pathologically altered myocardium need not completely lose its adaptive potential. In addition. increased ischemic tolerance can be induced by the pleiotropic (independent of the primary) effects of some hypolipidemic and antidiabetic drugs. even in the diseased myocardium.

1056568,Evaluation of Ezenus in an experimental model of diet-induced alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver condition in rats,2016,VK Khandelwal and PRABHAKAR Singh and TATIANA Ravingerova and MANU Chaudhary,7,Int J Pharm Pharm Sci,,247-52,,Objective: Alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are found to affect more than 10% of the general population. Fatty liver condition in humans is directly correlated with psychosocial stress. Herbal formulations for the management of stress may present an alternative for the treatment of fatty liver disease. Ezenus is a polyherbal candy containing herbs that can ameliorate stress and consequent liver abnormality. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of Ezenus in experimentally induced alcoholic and non-acloholic fatty liver condition.Methods: Two models were studied simultaneously. prophylactic and therapeutic. Prophylactic groups received Ezenus along with fatty diet whereas the therapeutic groups received Ezenus only after induction of alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver condition. Biochemical parameters were estimated in the serum on Days 0. 45 and 90. Lipid biochemistry of liver and histopathology were performed after terminal necropsy.Results: Fatty liver condition was induced in rats within 45 days of fatty diet administration with or without alcohol. Results of the present study suggested that prophylactic administration of Ezenus prevented the development of fatty liver condition in rats to a certain extent. Therapeutic intervention with Ezenus after fatty diet intake for 45 days was able to prevent the deranging effects of fatty liver disease. This beneficial effect of Ezenus was attributed to the adaptogenic and antioxidant effects of the ingredients present in Ezenus.Conclusion: Based on the results of the study. it was concluded that long term treatment of Ezenus exhibits a preventive effect in fatty liver disease.

Although ischemic preconditioning (PC) is the most powerful form of intrinsic cardioprotection. its application in humans is limited to planned interventions. due to its short duration and technical requirements. However. many organs/tissues are capable of producing “remote” PC (RPC) when subjected to brief bouts of ischemia–reperfusion. RPC was first described in the heart where brief ischemia in one territory led to protection in other area. Later on. RPC started to be used in patients with acute myocardial infarction. albeit with ambiguous results. It is hypothesized that the connection between the signal triggered in remote organ and protection induced in the heart can be mediated by humoral and neural pathways. as well as via systemic response to short sublethal ischemia.

Rattan,SAGE Publications,Accumulation of molecular damage and increased molecular heterogeneity are hallmarks of cellular aging. Mild stress-induced hormesis can be an effective way for reducing the accumulation of molecular damage. and thus slowing down aging from within. We have shown that repeated mild heat stress (RMHS) has anti-aging effects on growth and various other cellular and biochemical characteristics of normal human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes undergoing aging in vitro. RMHS given to human cells increased the basal levels of various chaperones. reduced the accumulation of damaged proteins. stimulated proteasomal activities. increased the cellular resistance to other stresses. enhanced the levels of various antioxidant enzymes. enhanced the activity and amounts of sodium-potassium pump. and increased the phosphorylation-mediated activities of various stress kinases.

Usually. alterations of the lactoferrin gene in cells are associated with an increased incidence of cancer. Several studies suggest that exogenous treatment with lactoferrin and its derivatives can efficiently inhibit the growth of tumors and reduce susceptibility to cancer. None of these studies. however. reported a consistent outcome with regard to the mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of lactoferrin. In this review. the association of lactoferrin with cancer is thoroughly discussed. from lactoferrin gene expression to the potential use of lactoferrin in cancer therapy. Lactoferrin cytotoxicity against several cancers is reported to occur in distinct ways under different conditions. namely by cell membrane disruption. apoptosis induction. cell …,True,a-lGyRQAAAAJ:VBDT71xRUdcC,77,https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-abstract/72/12/763/1840536,10101889736028962666,/scholar?cites=10101889736028962666,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/31825/1/document_18059_1.pdf,0,0,0

A pharmacological evaluation was performed with the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 and revealed that the anticancer activity of flavonols was higher when compared with that of the respective chalcone precursors. The antiproliferative activity of halogenated derivatives increases as the substituent in the 3- or 4-positon of the B-ring goes from F to Cl and to Br. In addition. halogens in position 3 enhance anticancer activity in chalcones whereas for flavonol derivatives the best performance was registered for the 4-substituted derivatives. Flow cytometry analysis showed that compounds 3p and 4o induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as demonstrated by increased S. G2/M and sub-G1 phases.

The defensive compounds are either produced constitutively or in response to plant damage. and affect feeding. growth. and survival of herbivores. In addition. plants also release volatile organic compounds that attract the natural enemies of the herbivores. These strategies either act independently or in conjunction with each other.

The fluorescence of Auramine O increases immediately after mixing the dye solution with the suspension of clay due to its adsorption on the external surface of the clays. which restricts the torsional molecular motion of Auramine. At longer times. the dye molecules migrate into the interlamellar region of the clay particles. Aggregation of the dye molecules can occur in the interlayer region. leading to the decrease of the fluorescence emission.

When the dye concentration is increased. solid samples of Auramine O incorporated in SYn-1. SAz-1 and SWy-1 clays show an enhancement of the β-band in the UV–vis-DR spectra and the band at 450 nm shifts to the blue. This behavior can be attributed to the formation of H-type dye aggregates. For SYn-1 and SAz-1 clays. which show higher charge density. the formation of H-aggregates of the dye is favored. The fluorescence intensity and lifetime values of AuO decrease with the increasing of dye loading in these clays. since H aggregates do not exhibit fluorescence.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO) composites with SWy‐1 montmorillonite were prepared by mixing the polymer and the clay in aqueous colloidal solutions. Thin films of the composites were obtained by solvent evaporation and exposed to 254‐nm UV‐irradiation. The photodegradation was monitored by FTIR and the chain scission reaction was confirmed by measurement of average molecular weights using size exclusion chromatography. The rate of oxidation of pure PEO was much faster than that of the composites (SWy‐1/PEO). The SWy‐1 clay stabilizes the polymer against UV irradiation. This stabilization is due to two factors: on one side. the absorption of UV radiation by the clay. and on the other the scattering of the incident radiation by the particles; both contributing to minimize the degradation rate of the PEO present in the composites. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals.

However. the main barrier for those applications are their low solubility and stability in aqueous solution. The effects of two different clay minerals. the montmorillonite (SWy-2) and the Laponite RD (Lap) nanoclay. on the stabilization of Curcumin were investigated. Their effects were compared with two well-established environments (acidic and neutral aqueous media). CUR/clay hybrids were prepared using a simple and fast method. where CUR solution was added into clay suspensions. to obtain well dispersed hybrids in water. The degradation process of CUR and CUR/clays hybrids was investigated using UV–Vis spectroscopic. For both studied hybrids. the CUR degradation process was suppressed by the presence of the clay particles.

1056734,Preparation. characterization and photostability of nanocomposite films based on poly (acrylic acid) and montmorillonite,2018,Virgínia de Alencar Muniz Gonzaga and Bruno Alvim Chrisostomo and Alessandra Lima Poli and Carla Cristina Schmitt,21,Materials Research,4,,Materials Research,Polyacrylic acid (PAA)/clay mineral (SWy-1) nanocomposites were prepared by intercalation in solution and their photostability was evaluated. For the nanocomposite films containing 5. 10 and 20 wt% in SWy-1 mass occurred intercalation along with some clay exfoliation. while for PAA/30% SWy-1. the intercalation of PAA chains into the clay interlayers was observed. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the films suggested that nanocomposite films are homogeneous. indicating efficient dispersion of the polymer matrix into the SWy-1 clay. The thermal degradation temperatures of depolymerisation for the nanocomposite films were higher (362-370 C) than pure PAA (361 C). which means that the presence of SWy-1 clay promotes thermal stabilization. The photooxidative degradation of pure PAA and nanocomposite films was followed using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). The degradation rate constant for pure PAA was higher than nanocomposite films; therefore. the increase of SWy-1concentration detained the degradation of PAA. The presence of SWy-1 clay contributes for the photostabilization of the material. SWy-1 has ability to disperse the incident light as well as also to absorb part of the UV light instead of PAA. hence minimizing the degradation rate.,True,vSr3dWYAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,4,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-14392018005027102&script=sci_arttext,11897671314216911259,/scholar?cites=11897671314216911259,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-14392018005027102&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

A barrier which eliminated visual contact was found to facilitate the discovery of mutually advantageous alternatives for subjects instructed to disregard their opponent's needs (an individualistic orientation). It had no effect on subjects instructed to consider their opponent's position (a problem-solving orientation). The barrier led to a reduction in the occurrence of dysfunctional verbal process (threats and persuasive arguments) in the individualistic orientation condition.

RSV hospitalization outcomes were also described. The Palivizumab (Synagis. MedImmune. Inc.. 25 West Watkins Mill Road. Gaithersburg. MD 20878) Outcomes Registry was a prospective multicenter survey conducted at 63 sites. Demographics. injection history. and RSV hospitalization outcomes were collected on 2.116 infants receiving palivizumab. Infants were enrolled in the Registry between September 1. 2000-March 1. 2001. at the time of their first injection. Infants born at less than 32 weeks of gestation accounted for 47% of infants enrolled. and those between 32-35 weeks accounted for 45%; approximately 8% were greater than 35 weeks of gestation. Lower RSV hospitalization rates were observed in infants who had greater adherence to regularly scheduled injections. Nearly one-half of all hospitalizations occurred within the first and second injection intervals. suggesting the importance of early RSV protection.

Traditionally. these samples are drawn either probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet. the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to “small” regions of the state space. due to e.g. differential constraints or collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process. it is thus desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in those regions where an optimal solution might lie.

The isotherms show two distinct adsorption steps before the saturated vapor pressure is reached. The heat of adsorption is found to be 33.7 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 for the first layer and 32.9 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 for the second layer. Evolution of the two-dimensional compressibility. as a function of temperature. suggests that a phase transition occurs at 185.5 ± 1 K in the second layer. Neutron diffraction is used to establish that the melting of the pentane monolayer takes place between 101 K and 105 K.

We have investigated a range of simple binary mixtures which are indicative of a rich phase behavior with examples of complete mixing. partial mixing. and phase separation. On graphite surfaces. the mixing behavior is strongly influenced by the structure of the pure components; the odd–even effect seen in the pure structures. which favors either a “herringbone” or a “parallel” structure. influences the miscibility of alkanes within the monolayer. On h-BN. a more complex phase behavior is observed with partial mixing or phase separation depending upon the exact composition of the monolayer.

Using the high-capacity hydrogen storage candidate LiAlH4 as an exemplar. we demonstrate a new approach to thermodynamic stabilization of metastable metal hydrides by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of N-doped CMK-3 carbon (NCMK-3). The resulting LiAlH4@ NCMK-3 material releases H2 at temperatures as low as 126 C with full decomposition below 240 C. bypassing the usual Li3AlH6 intermediate. Moreover.> 80% of LiAlH4 can be regenerated under 100 MPa H2. a feat previously thought to be impossible. The nitrogen sites lower the energy barrier for regenerating the hydride by changing the density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. effectively acting as solvation sites for lithium ions.

Magnesium borohydride. Mg(BH4)2. has one of the highest hydrogen capacities of all known metal hydrides (14.9 wt % H) but suffers from high operating temperatures. slow kinetics for (de)hydrogenation. and the loss of capacity upon cycling. Strategies to address these challenges include nanoencapsulation and the use of chemical additives. This work is the first to utilize these two strategies simultaneously by using atomic layer deposition (ALD).

As a result. adsorption phenomena are extensively studied in chemistry. physics. and biology each for uniquely different reasons. The homologous series of normal alkanes represent a class of organic molecules that are important in the fuel industry. From a fundamental perspective. the series of normal alkanes provide a route whereby physical and chemical properties relevant to adsorption can be examined with only subtle changes in molecular size and length.

The characteristic cluster size grew markedly in the supercooled fluid as the glass transition was approached. in agreement with computer simulations; at the glass transition. however. there was a sudden drop in their size.

With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations. and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently. RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing.

Therefore. the reinforcement mechanism was probed using synchrotron wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation and analyzed in terms of tube model theory. A synergistic effect in reinforcement between NC and CB was proved by the marked enhancement in tensile strength from 11.4 MPa for neat NR to 28.2 MPa for NR nanocomposite with 5 wt% NC and 20 wt% CB. From a study of crystallization under deformation it was found that crystallization plays a less important role in the reinforcement of NR/NC/CB.

The results showed that both relative tan δ area and tan δmax of filled SSBR with TESPT were detected to present maximum value at 2.5 wt% TESPT(with respect to silica loading). Larger tan δ area and tan δmax meant more chains participating in the glass transition in the present system. which is reflected by the variation of effective filler volume with TESPT content. The interaction between filler and rubber can be improved remarkably when a little amount of TESPT up to 2.5 wt% was incorporated. whereas as the TESPT content exceeds 2.5 wt% the filler–rubber interaction was weakened. which was also proven by TEM images and Payne effect.

The structure evolution was probed by in-situ synchrotron wide-angle X-ray diffraction. while the thermodynamics of the onset of crystallization was analyzed by the tube model. The entropy change required for the onset of the strain-induced crystallization of the clay filled rubber is composed of the entropy reduction due to the rubber–filler interactions and also the stretching. The summation of the two kinds of the entropy reduction is nearly equal to that of the neat rubber. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that the orientation of clay layers along the direction of stretching reduces the chain conformational entropy and changes the crystallization mechanism.

The tan δ curves of blend without striking peak split from the dynamic mechanical spectra and inward shift of glass transition of linear PR suggests that cured CIIR and linear PR is miscible to a certain extent. thus. the phase separation in the blends can be described as slight phase separation.

The results indicate that the storage modulus changes steadily. and the loss modulus peak and the tanδ peak are broader for strong glass-forming polymers. Three variables. the steepness index (S). the transition wideness (W) of storage modulus and the integration area (A) of tanδ. were defined to illustrate the potential correlation between the dynamic fragility index (m) and the dynamic mechanical properties. It is found that W and A can be correlated with m by power law equations. while an exponential relationship between S and m is observed.

A Wiley Company,A series of poly(dimethylsiloxane‐co‐diphenylsiloxane)s with different molar content of diphenylsiloxane unit (from 0.91 to 9.07 mol %) were synthesized and characterized by use of 1H NMR. gel permeation chromatography (GPC). the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X‐ray diffraction (WAXD). The presence of diphenylsiloxane unit results in a decrease in the “orderness” of the crystal phase and aggrandizement in degree of lattice distortion. By calculating the sequence length of dimethylsiloxane unit of the random copolymer. it can be concluded that the maximum average sequence length of dimethylsiloxane units required for the copolymer to be amorphous is 11. and increasing the dimethylsiloxane sequence length will favour crystallization. The reduction in sequence length of dimethylsiloxane unit leads to that the three‐dimensional crystal shape is destroyed and crystal shape …,True,BXsxwhYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,20,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/polb.21343,496293104039311027,/scholar?cites=496293104039311027,,,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The peroxide‐cured natural rubber (NR) was reinforced by in situ polymerization of zinc dimethacrylate (ZDMA). The experimental results showed NR could be greatly reinforced by ZDMA. The tensile strength and the hardness of NR/ZDMA composites increased with the content of ZDMA. The reinforcement mechanism was studied further. Both high crosslinking density provided by ionic crosslinking and strain‐induced crystallization improved the mechanical properties. The crosslinking density was determined by an equilibrium swelling method and the crystallization index was measured by Wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction (WXRD). When the amount of ZDMA was high. the ability of strain‐induced crystallization decreased. due to the strong interactions between the rubber phase and the hard poly‐ZDMA (PZDMA) nanodispersions.

Although cavitation-induced calcium responses are believed to be important for modulating downstream bioeffects such as cell injury and mechanotransduction in ultrasound therapy. the fundamental mechanisms of these responses have not been elucidated. In this study. we investigated mechanistically the ICWs elicited in single HeLa cells by the tandem bubble-induced jetting flow in a microfluidic system. We identified two distinct (fast and slow) types of ICWs at varying degrees of flow shear stress-induced membrane deformation. as determined by different bubble standoff distances.

NIM are often realized by arraying sub-wavelength nanostructures (meta-atoms) exhibiting spectrally overlapped magnetic and electric resonances. Most designs so far use scaling down of the resonant elements and employ materials with the right optical constants to obtain NIM in the visible range. However. large losses due to absorption in most metals and semiconductors as well as reduced coupling with light due to scaling pose a challenge to achieving low-loss NIM.

The physics of this noise generation in nanowires needs to be understood for improving the device performance. In this paper. the low-frequency noise in InAs nanowire transistors was studied at different gate voltages before and after passivation by a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer. Noise levels in nanowire devices can be separated into contributions from the channel and from the contacts by analyzing the noise behavior under different bias conditions for devices with varying channel lengths. It is shown that a noise component. which is independent of channel length. can be attributed to the contacts. and a length-dependent component is attributed to the channel.

The total hemispherical reflectance spectra from 200 to 1600 nm wavelength are first measured. All three samples exhibit reflectance about 15% to 20% within the ultraviolet band. As the wavelength becomes longer. the reflectance will first increase to around 50% and then decrease to below 20%.

However. the significance of the physical properties of cells remains underappreciated because of a lack of evidence of how they affect cellular functionalities. Here. we show that volumetric compression regulates the growth of intestinal organoids by modifying intracellular crowding and elevating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Intracellular crowding varies upon stimulation by different types of extracellular physical/mechanical cues and leads to significant enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by stabilizing the LRP6 signalosome. By enhancing intracellular crowding using osmotic and mechanical compression. we show that expansion of intestinal organoids was facilitated through elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling and greater intestinal stem cell (ISC) self-renewal.

The polymer consists of a polymethacrylate backbone (Mn = 0. 34 × 106.

It is found that gold nanoparticles are more photothermal efficient in comparison with silver nanoparticles and silver nanowires at 450nm and 532 nm. Gold nanoparticles are more heated by 532 nm laser than 450 nm laser. In contrast. silver nanoparticles show slightly less temperature rise at 532 nm than 450 nm laser. For silver nanowires. no significant photothermal effect has been observed.

Hydrophobic micro- or nano-materials with ferromagnetism have been explored for oil removal. yet the separation efficiency of an oil emulsion was compromised due to the limited dispersion of hydrophobic materials in water. A surfactant coating on microparticles prevented particle aggregation. but reduced oil absorption and emulsion cleaning ability. Recently. polystyrene microbeads covered with nanospikes have been reported to display anomalous dispersion in phobic media without surfactants. Inspired by this phenomenon. here magnetic microparticles attached with nanospikes were fabricated for enhanced separation of oil emulsions from water.

Both the degree of hydrolysis and molecular weight of PVA were investigated in terms of their influence on growth behavior and pH stability.

On the basis of the in-depth study of physicochemical properties of the microcapsules on fragrance leakage. we demonstrate that enhanced retention of fragrance can be achieved by using a polar polymeric shell and forming a hydrogel network within the microcapsule.

By measuring the binding of NAbs to pig peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow cells. we demonstrated that αGal6 was more effective than αGal2 in removing NAbs. and the combination of αGal6+ αGal2 did not further increase removal of NAbs. The specificity of the removal of NAbs (IgM and IgG) reactive with the αGal epitope by αGal6 matrix was shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The Dictyostelium genome encodes 285 predicted protein kinases. similar to the count of the much more advanced Drosophila. It contains members of most kinase classes shared by fungi and metazoans. as well as many previously thought to be metazoan specific. indicating that they have been secondarily lost from the fungal lineage. This includes the entire tyrosine kinase–like (TKL) group. which is expanded in Dictyostelium and includes several novel receptor kinases. Dictyostelium lacks tyrosine kinase group kinases. and most tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be mediated by TKL kinases. About half of Dictyostelium kinases occur in subfamilies not present in yeast or metazoa. suggesting that protein kinases have played key roles in the adaptation of Dictyostelium to its habitat.

Aqueous droplets comprising of alginate and calcium as a cross-linking agent were formed as an immiscible continuous phase. and then the alginate and calcium in the droplet came into contact and were rapidly mixed.

In this work. we investigate the role of viscoelastic displacing fluids in recovering trapped nonwetting fluids. We perform the lattice Boltzmann (LB) modeling of wetting viscoelastic fluids described by a Maxwell model that displace nonwetting. trapped droplets in three different pore geometries. Results show the oscillation of the trapped nonwetting droplets and subsequent release induced by the viscoelasticity of the displacing fluid.

We make use of microfluidic experiments to investigate the impacts of fracture connectivity and matrix wettability on injected water sweep efficiency and viscous fingering flow patterns. Experiments are designed to mimic media with primary (hydraulic) and secondary (natural) fractures. Different oils and flow rates are used to quantify the effect of varying wettability and capillary number. We find that a secondary (natural) fracture connecting two primary (hydraulic) fractures inhibits the occurrence of viscous/capillary fingering dendrites under both water- and oil-wet conditions at low to moderate capillary numbers.

Clear description. correct modeling and precise prediction of flow in porous media are of great significance. Although many single-phase and multiphase systems can be characterized using macroscopic models such as Darcy’s law (or the multiphase form of it). other complex flow systems. such as emulsion flow. nanoparticle suspension flow. etc.. require a more detailed description. For those complex cases. revealing the pore-scale physics is necessary for larger-scale modeling and predictions. Microfluidics provide a simple way to visualize micron-scale flow behavior with excellent controllability. thus helping to clarify the fundamental pore-scale flow mechanisms and is. therefore. useful for studying flow and transport in porous media.  In this work. several special micromodel designs from the single-pore level to pore-network level on microchips were made in order to capture realistic pore-scale flow mechanisms while keeping the system simplified enough for easy quantification. At the single-pore level. the trapping and mobilization of a non-wetting oil droplet at a pore-throat structure are investigated on an ideal pore-throat microfluidic geometry. A simple physical model is derived and the effects of bare nanoparticle aqueous suspension in mobilizing oil is further studied.

The microscopic fluid-fluid displacement has been extensively studied at high IFT (> 10 mN/m). However. the microscopic displacement dynamics can be significantly different when the IFT is ultralow because the dynamic contact angle increases with the increase of the capillary number. In this study. surfactant flooding was performed and visualized in micromodels to investigate the dynamics of multiphase displacement at ultralow IFT. Although the micromodels used were strongly water-wet. the displacements of oil by surfactant solutions at ultralow IFT appeared as drainage.

1057654,A Microfluidic Platform for Rapid Isolation of Cells Based on Secretion of Antigen Specific Antibodies,2017,Ruihua Ding,,,,,,Droplet microfluidics provides compartmentalization of cells into picoliter-sized droplets. enabling economical. sensitive and massively parallel biological assays. Droplets can be actively manipulated for different applications. In particular. droplet sorting allows rapid isolation of individual desired droplets from a large excess of undesired droplets. Droplet sorting is particularly powerful when combined with in-droplet assays to identify cells that secrete molecules of interest. However. the accuracy of droplet sorting is limited due to droplet coalescence.  In this dissertation I present a droplet filter design that effectively separates droplets by size. The droplet filter has a sharp size cut-off and can distinguish droplets differing in volume by as little as 20%. A simple model explains the behaviour of the droplets as they pass through the filter. We apply the filter upstream of a droplet sorter and show it improves sorting efficiency. We also develop a droplet-based system to accurately identify and isolate individual cells that secrete antigen-specific antibodies.  This system eliminates the inefficient and time-consuming steps of cell fusion and clonal expansion required in standard monoclonal antibody generation methods. I present use of this system. coupled with filter-improved droplet sorting. to isolate cells that secrete antigen-specific antibodies. The platform is capable of screening a million droplets within one day and is able to isolate rare antigen-specific cells that consist of 0.1% of the total population.  We apply this system to frozen primary rat cells. After sorting. we perform single-cell RT-PCR to identify the IgG-encoding sequences from each isolated cell …,True,xEx2HtoAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/42061470,,,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42061470/DING-DISSERTATION-2017.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1057656,The chemistry and technology of cellulosic copolymers,2012,Ali Hebeish and TJ Guthrie,4,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Many excellent volumes have been written on the chemistry of cellulose and its derivatives. Judging by the number of conferences which have been assembled to deal with the topic. cellulose and its derivatives continue to arouse great scientific interest. Matching this interest has been the development in copolymer science and technology. In both instances the driving force has been the search for products having useful. new or interesting properties. It appeared inevitable that these two concepts would be brought together at some time in the research and development of cellulosic copolymers. That time has arrived. In assembling this text our aim was to present an informative account of the chemistry and technology of cellulosic copolymers. As such. we intended that the contents be of interest to all those concerned with the production and use of cellulosic products whether in academic or industrial circles. Sections of the text should be of value in undergraduate and post-graduate teaching. provided the student is given guidance in following the text. The volume is divided into eight chapters. each dealing with factors which are relevant to an under standing of cellulosic copolymers.

While CMC acted as stabilizing for AgNPs. trisodium citrate was added to the reaction medium to assist CMC in establishing reduction of Ag+ to AgNPs. The second strategy entailed preparation of CMC hydrogel which assists the in situ preparation of AgNPs under the same conditions. In both strategies. factors affecting the characterization of AgNPs-loaded CMC hydrogels were studied. Analysis and characterization of the so obtained hydrogels were performed through monitoring swelling behavior. FTIR spectroscopy. SEM. EDX. UV–vis spectrophotometer and TEM.

Thus obtained CMC products were. in turn. used for preparation of silver nanoparticles using silver nitrate under different conditions. UV–vis spectra of the silver colloidal solution reveal that increasing the pH of the latter causes appreciable changes in the absorption spectra and reaches its maximum at pH 12.5 indicating full reduction of silver ions. Prolonging the reaction time from 30 to 60 min brings about outstanding enhancement in the plasmon intensity indicating reduction of larger amounts of silver ions. Complete transformation of silver ions into silver nanoparticles occurs at 70 °C. Dispersion of silver nanoparticles improved upon increasing the DS of CMC from 1.22 to 2.2.
