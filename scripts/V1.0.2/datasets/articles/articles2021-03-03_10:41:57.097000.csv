Archit. Plan,,,,Window design has a significant impact on heating and cooling energy demand due to the fact that it causes a large part of heat loss or heat gain that enters through the building envelope. The critical issue is how to design windows that minimize heat gain in summer and heat loss in winter. The study aims to examine the impact of orientation. size. and thermal properties of the glass material of windows on heating and cooling energy demand. A parametrical study is carried out using “IES virtual environment” and “ECOTECT” software to estimate the effect of these three parameters on a typical residential building and room models in the climatic conditions of the Gaza Strip. It has been concluded that the appropriate window design of the Gaza Strip buildings in accordance with the environmental conditions can effectively lead to reduce the energy demand and to meet the requirements of thermal comfort. It is also found that the optimal window size for all facades is the minimum percentage of (10%) from the total wall area. The direct impact of south window is considered the worst. as it causes the large energy consumption.

1122351,Effect of wall thermal properties on the energy consumption of buildings in the Gaza strip,2015,Ahmed S Muhaisen,,"2nd International Sustainable Buildings Symposium (ISBS 2015), Gazi University, Turkey",,,,Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is proposed worldwide to be considered as part of the overall solution to the problems associated with the use of conventional energy in buildings. The tendency of producing more energy efficient buildings has. additionally. special importance in the Gaza strip. considering the severe energy deficit that has been suffering from in recent years. It is evident that buildings sector consumes the main bulk of electricity supplied to the Gaza strip. Accordingly. this research aims to find out the potential of reducing the energy consumption of buildings through the proper selection of wall construction materials. For this purpose. the research examines the effect of the thermal properties of various wall combinations on the annual required energy for heating and cooling. Computer programs were used to simulate the various cases and to calculate the amount of energy required. This includes. a simple calculator developed by the author based on the steady state method of Cooling Load Temperature Difference (CLTD). In addition. Ecotect program was used also to carry out the simulation and validate the results. The outcome of the research reveals clearly that the thermal properties of wall building materials have a significant effect on the amount of energy consumed by buildings. It was concluded that applying the U-value of walls (1.8 W/m2. k) recommended by the local Energy Code results in a reduction of 22% in the required heating and cooling energy of residential buildings in the Gaza strip.,True,gnTTWTAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,10,https://195.189.210.17/handle/20.500.12358/24598,16265035210395046565,/scholar?cites=16265035210395046565,,https://195.189.210.17/bitstream/handle/20.500.12358/24598/Muhaisen%2C%20Ahmed%20S._6.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1122359,Investigation of the Thermal Performance of Building Form in the Mediterranean Climate of the Gaza Strip,2015,Ahmed S Muhaisen and Huda M Abed,21,IUG Journal of Natural Studies,1,,,This paper examines the thermal performance of different forms of the housing units located in the Mediterranean climate of the Gaza Strip. The study is carried out using computer programs ECOTECT and IES. The results indicate significant thermal effects due to form’s proportions. The study concluded that the surface to volume ratio is considered the main responsible for the thermal response in different geometric shapes. Energy consumption increases at the same rate of increasing in the surface to volume ratio (S/V) in the Mediterranean climate of the Gaza Strip. Convex shapes such as court. L and U shape can be used as more preferable options for building’s arrangements than the rectangular shape of the same (S/V) ratio. Increasing the depth ratio in convex shapes has the ability to increase the percentage of the shaded facades which help to reduce heating and cooling energy. The roof to walls ratio seemed to have a considerable influence on the thermal response which reach to about by 45.7%. 40.9%. 48.1% and 38.6% for the rectangular. L shape. U shape and court shape respectively. Horizontal arrangements of residential apartments are better thermally than the vertical arrangements of the same (S/V) ratio. Therefore. the study recommends applying passive solar design strategies. especially with regard to geometric shape and orientation in the first stage of design process.

1122361,THE EFFECT OF ASPECT RATIO ON THE THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE OF THE GAZA STRIP,2015,Ahmed S Muhaisen and Nidal Abu Mustafa,20,Emirates Journal for Engineering Research,2,,,Street canyons play an important role in creating the urban climate and determining the thermal performance of buildings [1]. Street configurations with various canyons and axis orientations have an impact both on outdoor and on indoor conditions. ie the potential for passive solar gains inside and outside the buildings [2]. Swaid et al.(1993) conducted one of the first investigations on outdoor thermal comfort directly associated with street design. The study indicated that the main factors that affect the solar insolation level on building facades are Height to Width (H/W) ratio and the street orientation [3]. It was found also by Krüger. et al.(2010) that the aspect ratio (H/W). which is the relationship between the building’s height and the street’s width. affects considerably the shaded areas of the street during the daytime [4]. Toudert & Mayer.(2007) analyzed the dependence of outdoor thermal comfort on upon street design under typical summer conditions in Ghardaia. Algeria. The results of the simulations related to PET (Physiologically Equivalent Temperature) showed that the thermal comfort in urban street canyons varies with changing the street orientation [5]. Pearlmutter et al.(1999) carried out an investigation to estimate the amount of solar radiation within urban canyons and consequently to find out its impact on the human body. Measurements were carried out in the arid Negev region.

1122367,Effect of Galleries on the Thermal Performance of Buildings in the Gaza Strip,2016,Ahmed S Muhaisen and Nidal Abu Mustafa,2,Journal of Engineering Research and Technology,3,,,This study examines the effect of galleries design in a symmetrical street canyons on the thermal performance of buildings located in the Mediterranean climate of the Gaza Strip. It was carried out using two computer simulation tools. namely ECOTECT and IDA ICE. The gallery design parameters and street orientation were investigated to find out the extent to which they affect the external and internal thermal comfort. The study concluded that the thermal stress can affectively be mitigated if galleries are appropriately configured with relation to the solar orientation. The galleries on (EW) oriented street are more protected from the sun than that on (NS) oriented streets. About 39.4% of reduction in the incident solar radiation falling on (EW) street occurs with increasing the gallery width to street width ratio (w/W) from 0.2 to 1.4. And about 22.8% of reduction occurs with increasing the gallery height to building height ratio (h/H) from 0.2 to 0.9. On the other hand. higher galleries effectively reduce the total requirement in the covered spaces. especially the upper floors. Therefore. more attention must be paid to the gallery dimensions in order to reduce energy consumption of buildings.,True,gnTTWTAAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://journal.iugaza.edu.ps/index.php/JERT/article/view/1657,,,,https://journal.iugaza.edu.ps/index.php/JERT/article/viewFile/1657/1589,0,0,0
1122368,Effect of Building Proportions on the Thermal Performance in the Mediterranean Climate of the Gaza Strip,2016,Ahmed S Muhaisen and Huda M Abed,2,Journal of Engineering Research and Technology,2,,,This paper examines the effect of building proportions and orientations on the thermal performance of housing units located in the Mediterranean climate of the Gaza Strip. The study is carried out using computer programs. namely. ECOTECT and IES. The study concluded that the surface to volume ratio of buildings is considered the main geometrical parameter affecting the thermal performance of different geometric shapes. About 39% of energy consumption can be reduced through choosing the optimum building width to length ratio (W/L). which is 0.8. The roof to walls ratio has a considerable influence on the thermal response of buildings. Using the (roof/walls) ratios. which range between 0.4 to 0.6 is preferable for both cooling and heating requirements. The horizontal arrangements of residential apartments are thermally better than the vertical arrangements of the same (S/V) ratio. Therefore. the study recommends to apply passive solar design strategies. especially with regard to geometric shape and orientation of buildings in the first stage of the design process.,True,gnTTWTAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://journal.iugaza.edu.ps/index.php/JERT/article/view/1645,,,,https://journal.iugaza.edu.ps/index.php/JERT/article/download/1645/1578,0,0,0
1122369,The Influence of Canyon Asymmetry on Heating and Cooling Energy Demand of Buildings in the Mediterranean Climate of the Gaza Strip,2016,Ahmed S Muhaisen and Nidal Abu Mustafa,,,,,,This paper shows the effect of canyon asymmetry on the energy consumption of buildings in the Mediterranean climate of the Gaza strip. The study was conducted using threedimensional computer models. namely. ECOTECT and IDA ICE. The ratio of the opposite buildings heights ranging from 0.2 to 3.2 were examined in the study at two different orientations. which are (EW) and (NS). The results showed that the asymmetrical profiles seemed to have a significant influence on the thermal response of buildings. The ratio which ranges between 1.2 to 2.0 is more preferable for both cooling and heating requirements. The received solar radiation is reduced by 14.02% and 55.02% in summer with increasing the buildings heights ratio at (NS) and (EW) streets respectively from 1.0 to 3.2. Asymmetrical canyon with the highest ratio provides the maximum energy savings throughout the year especially in the upper floors. About 29.53% of energy consumption can be reduced by choosing the opposite building height equal to the examined building height+ 5floor. Therefore. the study recommends to utilize the advantages of the different heights of buildings in achieving shading on the roof and building’s façades for the purpose of energy saving.,True,gnTTWTAAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://195.189.210.17/handle/20.500.12358/24811,,,,https://195.189.210.17/bitstream/handle/20.500.12358/24811/AhmedMuhaisenPaper_2.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Both the energy access and the low carbon challenge require more decentralized energy solutions and a change in the energy infrastructure paradigm. Yet. physical energy infrastructure co-evolves with socio-economic institutions. actors and social norms. This may produce inertia against change. The energy challenge also requires solutions at multiple scales and may entail elements of common pool resource problems. Therefore. the governance of energy infrastructure needs to be polycentric. This allows for contextualization. experimentation and innovation.

1122372,The uniqueness of the energy security. justice. and governance problem,2012,Andreas Goldthau and Benjamin K Sovacool,41,Energy Policy,,232-240,Elsevier,This article argues that among all policy fields exhibiting externalities of a global scale. energy stands out on four dimensions: vertical complexity. horizontal complexity. higher entailed costs. and stronger path dependency. These structural attributes are at odds with contemporary key challenges of energy security. energy justice. and low carbon energy transition. With regard to the latter. energy governance challenges occur related to unclear levels of authority and weak resilience. This has implications for energy scholarship. specifically relating to the political economy of energy transitions. discussions about common pool resources. systems analysis. and other neighboring disciplines.,True,_-L64skAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,259,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511008263,7446265192254693544,/scholar?cites=7446265192254693544,,https://www.academia.edu/download/60463383/Goldthau_Sovacool-EP-Governance20190902-27023-14q6io7.pdf,0,0,0

1122374,Global energy governance: The new rules of the game,2010,A Goldthau and JM Witte,,,,,Brookings Institution Press,A Brookings Institution Press and Global Public Policy Institute publication The global market for oil and gas resources is rapidly changing. Three major trends—the rise of new consumers. the increasing influence of state players. and concerns about climate change—are combining to challenge existing regulatory structures. many of which have been in place for a half-century. Global Energy Governance analyzes the energy market from an institutionalist perspective and offers practical policy recommendations to deal with these new challenges. Much of the existing discourse on energy governance deals with hard security issues but neglects the challenges to global governance. Global Energy Governance fills this gap with perspectives on how regulatory institutions can ensure reliable sources of energy. evaluate financial risk. and provide emergency response mechanisms to deal with interruptions in supply. The authors bring together decisionmakers from industry. government. and civil society in order to address two central questions:• What are the current practices of existing institutions governing global oil and gas on financial markets?• How do these institutions need to adapt in order to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century? The resulting governance-oriented analysis of the three interlocking trends also provides the basis for policy recommendations to improve global regulation. Contributors include Thorsten Benner.

1122375,Governing global energy: systems. transitions. complexity,2011,Aleh Cherp and Jessica Jewell and Andreas Goldthau,2,Global Policy,1,75-88,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Global energy systems face multiple interconnected challenges which need to be addressed urgently and simultaneously. thus requiring unprecedented energy transitions. This article addresses the implications of such transitions for global energy governance. It departs from the reductionist approach where governance institutions and mechanisms are analysed in isolation from each other. Instead. the authors consider governance systems as complex and historically rooted ‘arenas’ coevolving with the energy issues they address. We argue that effective global energy governance requires striking a tenuous balance between the determination and efficiency needed to drive energy transitions with the flexibility and innovation necessary to deal with complexity and uncertainty.

Strengthening markets and rules for effective global energy governance,2009,Andreas Goldthau and Jan Witte,85,International Affairs,2,373-390,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Current public policy debates on energy security are characterized by a singular focus on questions regarding access to resources. This lopsided attention to the geopolitical dimension of energy security is based on the myopic and erroneous presumption that global energy politics is necessarily a zero-sum game in which one country's energy security is another's lack thereof. In fact. debates deflect attention from the real issues that policy-makers should consider in their attempts to foster effective global energy governance—the central role increasingly international energy markets play in balancing demand and supply—and. even more importantly. the significance of the ‘rules of the game’ that structure these markets. This article makes a first attempt to apply a broader analytical lens by pointing out and analyzing the important role rules play in determining outcomes in international oil and gas markets; by …,True,_-L64skAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,144,https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/85/2/373/2326043,14595732062438355927,/scholar?cites=14595732062438355927,,,0,0,0
1122377,Rhetoric versus reality: Russian threats to European energy supply,2008,Andreas Goldthau,36,Energy Policy,2,686-692,Elsevier,European gas demand will rise from presently 540 billion cubic meters (bcm) to around 800 bcm in 2030. As more than 50 percent of overall European imports originate from Russia. fears have been expressed that the Kremlin could use energy resources as a foreign policy tool. A thorough assessment of domestic consumption. production and investment volumes however reveals that Russian supply will have difficulties in matching growing domestic and European demand. Hence. as the author argues. the threat to European gas supply does not lie in geopolitics. but rather in a lack of investment in the Russian upstream sector. Higher domestic Russian gas prices. enhanced energy efficiency and increases in non-Gazprom production would however make it possible for Russia to meet domestic demand and its export commitments for natural gas.,True,_-L64skAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,134,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421507004430,8104955076324899963,/scholar?cites=8104955076324899963,,,0,0,0

This article investigates whether what might be labelled ‘soft power with a hard edge’ instead amounts to a consistent policy strategy for the EU. The central argument is that the EU has turned a weakness into strength. and developed a set of tools that sharpen the way soft power is exercised in the energy sector. The article explores how soft power affects companies that ‘come and play’ on the EU market: the rules of the Single European Market (SEM) and how they affect external firms. It also assesses the long reach of the SEM: both the gravitational ‘pull’ the SEM exerts in the ‘near aboard’. and the EU's ‘push’ to facilitate the development of midstream infrastructure and upstream investment.

The Commission and the external dimension of the single market for energy,2014,Andreas Goldthau and Nick Sitter,21,Journal of European Public Policy,10,1452-1472,Routledge,This article investigates the European Commission's external energy policy through the lens of the regulatory state. It argues that because of the nature of its institutions. policy tools and resources. the Commission remains a liberal actor even as the world leaves the benign pro-market environment of the 1990s and becomes more mercantilist – or ‘realist’. The article tests seven hypotheses related to two key challenges as perceived by the Commission: building energy markets. and making them work. It finds that the Commission seeks to project the single market beyond its jurisdiction to deal with transit infrastructure problems; extend international regimes to cover energy trade; deal with monopolists such as Gazprom through classical competition policy; and fix global energy market failures with clear regulatory state tools. Importantly. however. some actions by the Commission can be seen as an attempt to …,True,_-L64skAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,91,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13501763.2014.912251,2264828615475755329,/scholar?cites=2264828615475755329,,https://biopen.bi.no/bi-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/279564/Sitter_JEPP_2014.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1122382,A Liberal Actor in a Realist World: The European Union Regulatory State and the Global Political Economy of Energy,2015,Andreas Goldthau and Nick Sitter,,,,,Oxford University Press,Since 1992. the European Union has put liberalisation at the core of its energy policy agenda. This aspiration was very much in line with an international political economy driven by the neo-liberal (Washington) consensus. The central challenge for the EU is that the energy world has changed. while the EU has not. The rise of Asian energy consumers (China and India). more assertive energy producers (Russia). and the threat of climate change have securitized the IPE of energy. and turned it more'realist'. The main research question is therefore:'What does a liberal actor do in a realist world?'The overall answer as far as the EU is concerned is that it approaches energy challenges as a problem of market failure: imperfect competition on the supply side; inadequate supply of public goods on the demand side and in terms of infrastructure; and large externalities that arise both from non-energy events and from large-scale consumption of fossil fuels. A Liberal Actor in a Realist World assesses the changing nature of the global political economy of energy and the European Union's response. and the external dimension of the regulatory state. The book concludes that the EU's soft power has a hard edge. which is derived primarily from its regulatory power. This works best when it targets companies rather than governments. and it is more effective in the'Near Abroad'than at the global level. This makes the EU emerge an actor in its own right in the global political economy of energy-a'Regulatory Power Europe'.,True,_-L64skAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,89,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7UL9CQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:JMlwjWe8bysJ:scholar.google.com&ots=6Ey-OqSfNl&sig=LAKHMvb-aCU6Azk0eIw3I-z4sFI,3129927418986416420,/scholar?cites=3129927418986416420,,,0,0,0
1122383,From the State to the Market and Back: Policy implications of changing energy paradigms,2012,Andreas Goldthau,3,Global Policy,2,198-210,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Like almost no other sector. energy reflects changing paradigms. Following a statist approach in which energy services were subject to public provision and administered by state companies. the free market paradigm took over in the 1980s and 1990s. making energy subject to private provision instead. More recently. the world has witnessed a new era of interventionism. Assessing these different phases. this article advances three arguments. First. paradigms matter in energy as they provide for crucial policy prescriptions. Second. agendas have become more complex. adding sustainability and energy poverty to traditional supply security. Third. paradigms are inextricably linked to rule‐setting power. putting the non‐OECD world in charge of defining the next paradigm.

1122386,A public policy perspective on global energy security,2012,Andreas Goldthau,13,International Studies Perspectives,1,65-84,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Despite an emerging literature on global energy governance. there so far is no extensive intellectual rationale for it. This article seeks to fill this gap by putting forward a public policy framework to analyze global energy. With that lens. energy security relates to problems of market failure at a transnational scale. These may occur due to imperfect competition; negative externalities; lack of information; or the presence of public goods. It is argued that major global energy risks such as oil price volatility. lack of transport infrastructure. and insufficient upstream investments can be convincingly conceptionalized as markets failing to provide for a crucial good—energy security.

In addition. it discusses key trends that are likely to determine OPEC’s effectiveness in the years ahead. particularly climate change policies. We find that OPEC’s ability to control the oil market singlehandedly has historically been limited. as a result of both internal collective action problems and external factors such as the rise of new producers. Furthermore. we find that climate change policies may negatively impact long‐term planning security for investment and hence OPEC’s ability to target price bands and smooth the oil market. We argue that OPEC will need to become more proactive in low‐carbon policies to remain part of the decision making on future energy demand patterns that affects its main export product.

Institutions of all kinds. including rules and norms within political and energy systems. tend to have path-dependent qualities that make them difficult to change. whereas we also know that profound change has occurred in the past. Current decisions to pursue climate change mitigation by dramatically changing how energy is produced and used depend to some extent on finding the right enabling conditions for such change.

INTRODUCTION2016 was the warmest year yet recorded on Earth. It was also the year that brought to power an outspoken climate sceptic in the United States. The Trump administration is seeking to roll back restrictions on extracting and burning fossil fuels in the country. while Exxon Mobil’s CEO. Rex Tillerson. has taken up a senior cabinet post. At the same time.

1122410,Theorising governance and innovation in sustainable energy transitions,2013,Matthew Lockwood and Carolina Kuzemko and Catherine Mitchell and Richard Hoggett,,University of Exeter,,,,Understanding why and how it is that some countries are able to implement policies which lead to deeper and faster change in sustainable practices and outcomes is an important step in enabling an acceleration in the transition to a sustainable energy future. This paper presents a tentative. provisional framework for analysing energy system transition. differential outcomes and the reasons for them. It suggests that energy system rules (in enabling or blocking change) and incentives (in making change economic or not) play an important role in shaping change. A provisional hypothesis is that the UK’s ability to make the transition to a sustainable energy system is constrained by the nature of its institutional system and policy paradigm; and because of this. a critical precondition for more innovation in the UK is the implementation of an appropriate governance system. A key insight is a need to understand ‘how and why’policies are implemented. of ‘how and why’changes in practices and outcomes are driven. and the links between the two. A provisional Theory of Managed Energy Transition is put forward that seeks to: firstly identify the linkages of politics. actors and agency to the ‘how’and ‘why’of energy policy implementation and delivery; and secondly. relate these to changes in practice and outcomes.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,22,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP4-IGov-theroy-of-change.pdf,6145186767639017521,/scholar?cites=6145186767639017521,,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP4-IGov-theroy-of-change.pdf,0,0,0
1122411,Climate change benchmarking: Constructing a sustainable future?,2015,Caroline Kuzemko,,Review of International Studies,,969-992,Cambridge University Press,This article analyses discourses on climate change and mitigation through the deconstruction of European Union (EU) rhetoric and practices on climate benchmarking. It critically examines the motivations behind climate benchmarking. the methods used to construct international benchmarks. and the reasons for variety in domestic compliance. Germany and the United Kingdom are analysed as cases where domestic politics drive very different reactions to the practice of climate mitigation. differences that have been largely hidden by the type of quantification that EU benchmarking involves. Through an exploration of the methods used to formulate climate benchmarks. the article demonstrates that these commitments have privileged certain responses over others. and thus helped to paint a picture of EU benchmarks as 'reformist' but not 'radical'.

London,What is EU energy policy — and how successful is the EU in projecting it? Of course. posing questions about the nature of EU energy policy presumes that the EU has a collective energy policy. This has been a slowly emerging and contested area of EU competence — certainly in comparison with other sectors. The question of what EU energy policy is can be answered by pointing to the three ‘pillars’ that have historically constituted the objectives of EU energy policy: climate-change mitigation. energy supply security and establishing competitive. integrated markets (EC 2013a). EU energy policy might in this way be explained as the application of various strategies and instruments. and the establishment of institutions. in pursuit of these three objectives.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137502766_2,10275817646145721790,/scholar?cites=10275817646145721790,,,0,0,0
1122414,Understanding the politics of low carbon Transition: context. paradigms and power,2013,Caroline Kuzemko,1301,,,,EPG Working Paper: 1301. University of Exeter,Given the scale of challenge that climate change presents to society and the urgency implied by limited time frames a growing body of academic work is attempting to conceptualise complex socio-technical transitions. such as in energy systems. and how they take place. Much can be learnt from this literature about processes of transition. not least that they are underpinned by multiple interconnections that take place in a range of different areas. This literature also suggests that although radical changes in complex energy systems have historically taken place this low carbon transition is different–not least in that it is in part politically instigated. As part of governing successfully for transition. therefore. much of this literature concludes that political institutions need to become more directly involved in supporting the niche technology markets that have historically been fundamental to innovation and change. The socio-technical transitions literature has. however. tended not to explore or conceptualise the politics of transition in any great depth. Politics is often taken to be neutral or is reified and policies are assessed and recommended without analysis of whether these will work in specific contexts. Using new institutionalist concepts. such as policy paradigm theory and depoliticisation. this paper is one contribution towards filling this gap. It will explain why certain political institutions persist within given contexts–even in the face of climate change objectives-whilst also conceptualising possibilities for the type of political change envisaged by so many in this area of research.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,12,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DOWNLOAD-WP1-Understanding-the-Politics-of-Low-Carbon-Transition.pdf,11426553438014395722,/scholar?cites=11426553438014395722,,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DOWNLOAD-WP1-Understanding-the-Politics-of-Low-Carbon-Transition.pdf,0,0,0

We lay out the nature of codes and why they are important for achieving policy change. We then describe the way in which codes are governed. including reforms in the late 2000s and two more recent reviews. Three challenges for the codes system are then discussed in detail: complexity and fragmentation. and how these act as a barrier to new entrants; the gap between code objectives and high level policy aims; and the self-governance approach in a period of rapid transformation. These challenges point to the need for reform. We argue that the two official review processes currently underway are too narrow in nature and a more thorough-going approach is needed. An alternative agenda is then developed. We propose that code modification be undertaken by a dedicated code management body. This would not be located in the regulator (Ofgem) but in an independent system operator. We also suggest various ways of mitigating risk in such an arrangement. The ultimate aim is to make the process of writing industry codes to support policy innovation simple. transparent and technical.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,7,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ML-Innovation-energy-industry-codes-in-GB1.pdf,13039740307992138109,/scholar?cites=13039740307992138109,,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ML-Innovation-energy-industry-codes-in-GB1.pdf,0,0,0

1122421,Energy governance. suppliers and demand side management,2015,Caroline Kuzemko,,"IGov Wesbite, University of Exeter",,,,This paper examines the policies. regulations. rules and incentives governing gas and electricity suppliers in Great Britain (GB) from the perspective of how far these have served to facilitate or prevent a shift towards a more sustainable energy system. The precise context is the desirability of a fundamental shift in the underlying design of the energy system from the supply to the demand side. This paper focuses just on the governance of gas and electricity suppliers. defined as incumbents or independents. in order to explore in detail how their practices enable or constrain greater demand management and how these outcomes relate to energy governance. Energy governance is. in turn. defined broadly as including policies. regulations and rules aimed at incentivising greater demand management as well as those aimed at delivering other public objectives (such as supply security). Indeed as a complex whole energy governance must in effect balance the desire for climate mitigation (and energy transition) with supply security and also with affordability. Examining energy governance as a whole. rather than focusing just on demand policies. has revealed the variety of corporate practices that it allows and rewards: vertical integration; incumbent business models driven by volume and scale; barriers to entry and expansion for independents; innovations in trading and cost cutting that outweigh those in demand management; poor customer service and higher prices per unit charged to vulnerable (often legacy) customers.

The QDSSC on based CuS/PbS counter electrode exhibits power conversion efficiency (η) of 2.2%. which is higher than that of CuS counter electrode. 1.17%. The improvement in η is probably attributed to the reduction of electron back into CuS/PbS counter electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry results confirm that higher value of η in CuS/PbS counter electrode is because of this novel counter electrode which shows superior photo-electrochemical performance and electro-catalytic properties. Another reason for this higher η might be the reduction in the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interfaces.,True,js7VwtwAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468614022324,3540071709633233254,/scholar?cites=3540071709633233254,,,0,0,0

To ameliorate channel fading caused by the atmospheric turbulence. we propose a subcarrier time delay diversity (STDD) scheme in which the delayed versions of the original data are re-transmitted on different subcarriers. In short range links. a single re-transmission scheme results in an estimated gain of up to 4.5 dB in received irradiance. With sufficient link margins. short range FSO links might be able to cope without the use of any diversity techniques but for links spanning over 1 km. turbulence induced fading effect must be compensated for.

Subcarrier modulation is employed to eliminate the need for adaptive threshold detector. Direct detection is employed at the receiver and each subcarrier is subsequently demodulated coherently.

Although solution processed CsSnI3 has been demonstrated as a lead-free halide perovskite which can function as a light absorber with high photocurrent densities. the power conversion efficiencies were bottlenecked by low open circuit voltages. In this work. the open circuit voltages are modulated by chemical doping of CsSnI3 with Br leading to formation of CsSnI3-xBrx (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) perovskites. The beneficial effect of Br incorporation for Voc improvement is evident for CsSnI3 system even without the addition of SnF2.

It is therefore imperative to improve open-circuit voltages (VOC) in order to go beyond the current 100 mV loss-in-potential. Identifying and suppressing recombination bottlenecks in the device stack will ultimately drive the voltages up. In this work. we investigate in depth the recombination at the different interfaces in a PSC. including the charge selective contacts and the effect of grain boundaries.

K+ and Cl– show similar ion mobilities in a bulk aqueous solution. whereas they exhibit a remarkable difference when transporting through an angstrom-scale channel. Our molecular dynamics simulations uncover that such discrepancy originates from the subtle differences in their hydration structures and preferable locations across the channel. Opposite charge causes different water dipolar orientations around ions. mediating the distance and tribological interactions between hydrated ions and channel’s walls.

It is revealed that the LHE increases in the long wavelength region with the addition of large size TiO2 particles to the transparent film. In the meantime. the balance between the light scattering and surface area also needs to be controlled. which can significantly restrain the dark current of the device.

To further enhance photovoltage and cell efficiency accordingly. ZnTe/CdSe type-II core/shell QDs with much larger conduction band (CB) offset in comparison with that of CdTe/CdSe (1.22 eV vs 0.27 eV) are adopted as sensitizers in the construction of quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). The augment of band offset produces an increase of the charge accumulation across the QD/TiO2 interface under illumination and induces stronger dipole effects. therefore bringing forward an upward shift of the TiO2 CB edge after sensitization and resulting in enhancement of the …,True,UIlJCYsAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC,210,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn506638n,14409173418580246861,/scholar?cites=14409173418580246861,,http://www.inam.uji.es/sites/default/files/paper/paper258.pdf,0,0,0

We first analyze this propagation pattern described by Darcy equations by focusing on its geometrical features.

Herrmann,101,Physical review E,,032116,,We study the sandpile model on three-dimensional spanning Ising clusters with the temperature T treated as the control parameter. By analyzing the three-dimensional avalanches and their two-dimensional projections (which show scale-invariant behavior for all temperatures). we uncover two universality classes with different exponents (an ordinary BTW class. and SOC T=∞). along with a tricritical point (at T c. the critical temperature of the host) between them. The transition between these two criticalities is induced by the transition in the support. The SOC T=∞ universality class is characterized by the exponent of the avalanche size distribution τ T=∞= 1.27±0.03. consistent with the exponent of the size distribution of the Barkhausen avalanches in amorphous ferromagnets Durin and Zapperi [Phys.

1123147,Percolation transition in two dimensional electron gas: A cellular automaton model,2018,MN Najafi,284,Solid State Communications,,84-87,Pergamon,Using the notion of phase coherence length ζϕ. a quantum cellular automaton model for two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is designed leading to a new type of disorder-driven electronic percolation transition. This transition is shown to be accompanied by a metal-insulator transition. as well as a singularity in the electronic compressibility. The cellular automaton model for transporting the electrons is developed in terms of the temperature (T) and the disorder strength (Δ). At the transition line some power-law behaviors emerge with critical exponents consistent with the Gaussian free field (GFF) and partly the percolation theory. Our model yields the important features of the experimental observations. e.g. the singularity in the conductivity in a critical density and also the universality (non-universality) of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) for the small (large) disorders in 2DEG.

In this paper. a sandpile model is defined on the three-dimensional small-world network with real dissipative boundaries and the energy propagation is studied in three dimensions as well as the two-dimensional cross-sections. Two types of cross-sections are defined in the system. one in the bulk and another in the system boundary. The motivation of this is to make clear how the statistics of the avalanches in the bulk cross-section tend to the statistics of the dissipative avalanches. defined in the boundaries as the concentration of long-range links (α) increases.

In particular. the effects of different etching chemistries (CH 4/H 2/Ar and Cl 2/CH 4/Ar) were investigated. The results discussed deal with modifications of the luminescence line shapes (which differ with etching process) and with the intensity variation of the emissions associated with the quantum wells across the stripes. The possible origins of these effects are investigated in terms of carrier recombination on the vertical sidewalls of the stripes and lateral diffusion of species from the plasma during etching. Cathodoluminescence measurements on samples under DC-bias also show the quantum confined Stark effect which is correlated to the material modifications induced by the etching.,True,B20ARgMAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/09702.0043ecst/meta,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03029990/document,0,0,0

TiO2 nanorod/TiO2 nanoparticle and TiO2 nanorod/ZnO nanoparticle composite structures were integrated as photoanodes in backside illuminated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into the bare nanorods increased the dye loading and improved the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 2.22 mA/cm2 to 3.57 mA/cm2. ZnO nanoparticles electrochemically grown into the TiO2 nanorod layer could increase the surface area. Nevertheless. this considerably reduced the Jsc to 0.57 mA/cm2 and consequently cell efficiency.

The back-reflection of the films is directly related to the scattering efficiency of the individual particles. Inspired by the idea of multilayer optical thin films. here it is demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that putting a SiO2 shell around spherical rutile-TiO2 particles leads to improved light scattering by the particles. These dielectric core–shells not only enhance the overall diffuse reflection of the films. but they also cause a relative improvement in the red and near infrared regions. Back-reflector films of these core–shell particles employed in DSCs result in an enhanced device efficiency of up to 9.52%. Contrary to the general notion. the conventional DSC back-reflector films are far from ideal. i.e. they show less than a 50% reflection in real device conditions. This is due to the limited thickness of …,True,tMu-3sUAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,20,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/ra/c3ra44079f,15583726107535998277,/scholar?cites=15583726107535998277,,,0,0,0

There are different methods for evaluation of optical properties of nanoparticles. In this field of study. the interferometry method has not been applied yet. Because of the accuracy and high sensitivity. this method has attracted the attentions [4]. In this paper we used the Michelson interferometry to find the nonlinear refractive index for the first time. This method has been depicted in many literatures and was invented by Michelson [5]. A Michelson interferometer is a tool to produce interference between two beams of light. In addition. the Michelson interferometers are relatively simple in terms of operation. and possess the largest field of view for a specified wavelength and other applications [6–8].

Different CE materials have different performance in the two types of QDSSCs employed due to the different type of sensitizers and composition of polysulfide electrolytes used. The poor performance of QDSSCs with some CE materials is largely due to the lower photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage.

A solvent consisting of ethanol and water in the ratio of 8 : 2 by volume has been found as the optimum solvent for preparing the liquid electrolytes. This solvent ratio appears to give higher cell efficiency compared to pure ethanol or water as a solvent. Na2S and S give rise to a good redox couple in the electrolyte for QDSSC operation. and the optimum concentrations required are 0.5 M and 0.1 M. respectively. Addition of guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) to the electrolyte further enhances the performance.

The proposed topology increases the output voltage levels by reducing the power electronic devices such as switches. power diodes. dc voltage sources and driver circuits that help to reduce the inverter cost and installation space. This topology not only reduces the number of power electronic devices but also reduces the amount of voltage blocked by the switches. This advantage is due to the developed H-Bridge. Normally. a single conventional H-bridge can generate 3 levels at the output. which utilizes 4 power electronics switches and 2 dc voltage sources. When three conventional H-bridge are connected in series. it can generate 7 levels in the output. This conventional circuit utilizes 12 switches and 3 dc voltage sources. In order to reduce power electronics devices. conventional H-bridge is modified with 6 switches and 2 DC voltages. This developed H-bridge can generate 7 levels atthe output. In this case. utilization of switches and the dc voltage source get reduced.

This study investigated the effects of M. speciosa alkaloid extract (MSE) on human recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities using a modified Crespi method. As compared with the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. this method has shown to be a fast and cost-effective way to perform CYP inhibition studies. The results indicated that MSE has the most potent inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. with apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 0.78 µg/mL and 0.636 µg/mL. respectively. In addition. moderate inhibition was observed for CYP1A2. with an IC 50 of 39 µg/mL. and weak inhibition was detected for CYP2C19. The IC 50 of CYP2C19 could not be determined. however. because inhibition was< 50%. Competitive inhibition was found for the MSE-treated CYP2D6 inhibition assay. whereas non-competitive inhibition was shown in inhibition assays using CYP3A4. CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.

It is inefficient in extracting maximum power as the tracking of Maximum power point is carried out for entire PV arrays connected together instead of independent MPPT of each PV array. With a conventional PV inverter. the utilization factor is also very less. since the system will be in idle state during night times or when the irradiation is weak.

In general. a μgrid is defined as a cluster of different types of electrical loads and renewable energy sources (distributed generations) under a unified controller within a certain local area. It is considered a perfect solution to integrate renewable energy sources with loads as well as with a traditional grid. In addition. it can operate with a conventional grid. for example. by energy sourcing or a controllable load. or it can operate alone as an islanding mode to feed required electric energy to a grid. Hence. one of the important issues regarding the μgrid is the constant power load that results from the tightly designed control when it is applied to power electronic converters. The effect of CPL is incremental negative resistance that impacts the power quality of a power system and makes it at negative damping. Also. in this paper. a comprehensive study on major control and compensation techniques for μgrid has been included to face the instability effects of constant power loads.

Series compensation of terminal voltage during fault conditions using DVR is carried out by injecting voltage at the point of common coupling to the grid voltage to maintain constant DFIG stator voltage. However. the control of the DVR is crucial in order to improve the FRT capability in the DFIG-based wind turbines. The combined feed-forward and feedback (CFFFB)-based voltage control of the DVR verifies good transient and steady-state responses. The improvement in performance of the DVR using CFFFB control compared with the conventional feed-forward control is observed in terms of voltage sag mitigation capability. active and reactive power support without tripping. dc-link voltage balancing. and fault current control.

The report here is focused on the decolorization treatment of water soluble azo dye methyl orange (MO) by chemically synthesized nanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) particles. Experimental variables such as initial dye concentration. iron dosage. solution pH and temperature were studied systematically. Batch experiments suggest that the decolorization efficiency was enhanced with the increase of NZVI dosage and reaction temperature. but decreased with increasing initial dye concentration and initial solution pH. Further studies indicated that existence of inorganic salt (Na2SO4) could inhibit the decolorization of MO.

The primary source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for energy. As society’s demand for energy increases and more CO2 is produced. it becomes imperative to decrease the amount emitted to the atmosphere. One promising approach to do this is to capture CO2 at the effluent of the combustion site. namely. power plants. in a process called postcombustion CO2 capture. Technologies to achieve this are heavily researched due in large part to the intuitive nature of removing CO2 from the stack gas and the ease in retrofitting existing CO2 sources with these technologies.

Currently available information on this subject needs to be updated. however. and focused on specific coals and end products. For example. carbon capture and sequestration. previously given little attention. now has a prominent role in coal conversion processes. This book approaches coal gasification and related technologies from a process engineering point of view. with topics chosen to aid the process engineer who is interested in a complete. coal-to-products system. It provides a perspective for engineers and scientists who analyze and improve components of coal conversion processes. The first topic describes the nature and availability of coal. Next. the fundamentals of gasification are described. followed by a description of gasification technologies and gas cleaning processes. The conversion of syngas to electricity. fuels and chemicals is then discussed. Finally. process economics are covered. Emphasis is given to the selection of gasification technology based on the type of coal fed to the gasifier and desired end product: Eg. lower temperature gasifiers produce substantial quantities of methane. which is undesirable in an ammonia synthesis feed.

In order to steer the conversion of CH4 toward partial oxidation (POM) for synthesis gas (H2 + CO) production rather than total oxidation for producing CO2 and H2O. the appropriate selection of OC becomes a critical issue. Moreover. instead of the commonly used air to re-oxidize the oxygen-depleted OC after reaction with CH4. steam and CO2 have been proposed as two alternatives. opening up the opportunities to produce extra H2 and CO.

Thus. delivering such drugs directly to the nucleus would bypass the drug‐resistance barriers. The cationic polymer poly(L‐lysine) (PLL) is capable of nuclear localization and may be used as a drug carrier for nuclear drug delivery. but its cationic charges make it toxic and cause problems in in‐vivo applications.

An inert gas. usually helium at atmospheric pressure. flows over the catalyst. Following pretreatment to obtain a reduced catalyst. a gas is adsorbed on the surface. usually by pulse injections of the adsorbate into the carrier gas upstream from the reactor.

At high H2S concentrations. a sulfur surface layer did not allow H2 to even penetrate to the Pd–Cu surface. Sulfidation of Pd and Cu formed micron size pores and caused the membrane to fail. Failure depended on H2S concentration. not time of exposure; the H2S concentration that completely inhibited H2 permeation was approximately 300 ppm for Pd–Cu alloys and 100 ppm for Pd surfaces. At lower H2S concentrations. steady state permeation was obtained. Hydrogen sulfide exposure and H2 post-treatment caused Cu segregation to the membrane feed side due to stress relaxation.

This trend does not follow the size order of the kinetic diameters. and therefore the kinetic diameter is not the determining factor for the permeation. Activation energies for the aromatics varied from 13 to 57 kJ/mol.

Membranes with the largest permeation through non-zeolite pores have the lowest CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity.

Transients in UV−visible intensity in the near-edge region were analyzed using a mechanistic model of ODH reactions. Rate constants per site for the kinetically relevant reduction step (C−H bond activation) measured using this analysis are slightly larger than those obtained from steady-state ODH rates normalized by surface V. The ratio of these values provides a measure of the fraction of the V surface sites that are active for ODH (0.6−0.7. for V surface densities of 2.3−34 V nm-2). This suggests that some of the V atoms are either inaccessible or inactive.

In the absence of impurities. cyclic voltammetry showed that the super oxide ion is stable in these solvents. Similar superoxide ion chemistry has previously been demonstrated in volatile and environmentally suspect aprotic solvents such as dimethyl formamide and acetonitrile. However. ionic liquids are nonvolatile and should minimize the problems of secondary solvent waste. It is proposed that the resultant superoxide ion can be used to perform low-temperature oxidation of wastes. Low-temperature oxidation of waste solvents can provide a much needed alternative to high-temperature waste incinerators. whose use is greatly complicated by regulatory requirements and locating suitable sites.© 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

1123583,Production of hydrogen from chemical hydrides via hydrolysis with steam,1999,R Aiello and JH Sharp and Michael A Matthews,24,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,12,1123-1130,Pergamon,The objective of this work is to develop a method of producing H2 for use in hand-portable fuel cells eliminating the bulkiness and high pressures associated with storage tanks. Water. either as liquid or vapor. will react with solid hydrides such as NaBH4 to produce pure hydrogen. However. a number of limitations are inherent in the liquid–solid reaction. The insoluble hydrolysis products are extremely basic and high pH inhibits the reaction. A large excess of acid must be added to the mixture in order to force the reaction to completion. but is detrimental to the equipment. Furthermore. the liquid–solid reaction is inefficient on a weight basis because a large excess of the water-acid mixture must be used to obtain acceptable yields of hydrogen. Exploiting the vapor–solid reaction overcomes some of these limitations.An isothermal semi-batch reactor was constructed to test the concept. In each experiment the reactor …,True,yBuXexwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,174,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319999000026,5358359811693522315,/scholar?cites=5358359811693522315,,,0,0,0

These hydrides have high native hydrogen content. and hydrogen can be released via several chemical pathways. This review summarizes the extensive literature on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the various reactions of chemical hydrides. with an emphasis on hydrolysis. These properties are significant because they affect all aspects of system design. as well as the recovery and recycle of the byproducts. Hydrolysis of chemical hydrides takes place at relatively low temperatures and gives promising theoretical hydrogen storage efficiencies.

The gravimetric and volumetric energy densities attainable from hydrolysis of chemical hydrides depend in large measure on the amount of water required for the process. The steam hydrolysis of sodium borohydride produces hydrated metaborate byproducts in which the degree of hydration of the metaborate is closely tied to the amount of water in the reaction. Experimental characterization of these sodium metaborate byproducts indicates that the primary byproduct of steam hydrolysis is NaBO 2· 2 H 2 O under a variety of reaction conditions. A group contribution method is used to estimate the heats and free energies of formation of a variety of hydrated metaborates.

Its main objective would be to determine the properties relevant to the elastic design of machines and structures. Investigation of the engineering and true Stress-strain relationships of three specimens in conformance with ASTM E 8–04 is the aim of this paper. For the purpose of achieving this aim. evaluation of values such as ultimate tensile strength. yield strength. percentage of elongation and area reduction. fracture strain and Young's Modulus was done once the specimens were subjected to uniaxial tensile loading. The results indicate that the properties of steel materials are independent from their thickness and they generally yield and fail at the same stress and strain values.

Earthquake effects can cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometers; cause damage to structures or infrastructures facilities. result in loss of life and injury to hundreds of thousands of people. and disrupt the social and economic functioning of the affected area. Usually the effects will rise significantly as results of increasing in population and structures or infrastructure facilities. Although it is impossible to prevent earthquake from occurring. it is possible to mitigate the effects and to reduce loss of life. injuries and damage. The worst earthquake disaster in the modern years occurred in North Sumatra at Banda Aceh. The great Sumatran earthquake occurred on the 26th December 2004. measuring at 9.3 on the Richter Scale. had created tsunami that killed 283.100 people from surrounding countries. including Malaysia with 68 people died. With this incidence. Malaysia need to be prepared to confront with such disasters. which not only originate from our country but also from countries near by. Beside tsunami. earthquakes can create many more disasters such as liquefaction. landslides. earth ruptures and most prominently ground vibration. The ground vibration can cause structural collapse. loss of lives and property damages. Research in the field of earthquake engineering is still required even in the country with low to moderate seismic activity level such as Malaysia.

This paper presents the results of a survey of water utility professionals that documented damage to the underground infrastructure in six cities after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck southern Louisiana in the fall of 2005. The results of this survey shed light on some of the long-term effects of the storms in these areas and identify lessons learned by utility personnel.

It shows that the emission mitigation of the commercial building sector during 2000–2016 is 1221.50 (±486.89) million tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2). and the scenario simulation demonstrates that the commercial building sector will achieve its carbon emission peak in year 2039 (±8) with a peak value of 1154.88 (±191.05) MtCO2. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the impacts of emission factor and GDP per capita are the most significant for the uncertainty of emission peaks. A strict energy demand benchmark of the commercial building sector suggests a control at 465.99 million tons of standard coal equivalent (Mtce). and its peaking year is estimated for 2035. which is 13 years ahead of the business-as-usual scenario. with energy savings of 112.90 Mtce. For the earliest peaking time. if the commercial building sector aims to achieve its emission peak before 2030. the emission peak should be controlled at 958.03 MtCO2.

A central question surrounds the use of meetings: traditional review practice views them as essential. while more recent findings question their utility.We conducted a controlled experimental study to assess several measures of cost and effectiveness for a meeting and non-meeting-based review method. The experiment used CSRS. a computer mediated collaborative software review environment. and 24 three person groups.

LEAP contains tools to simplify the collection of size and effort data. The collected data serves as input to a set of estimation tools. These tools can produce over a dozen analytical estimates of the effort required for a new project given an estimate of its size. To do this. they use various estimation methods such as linear. logarithmic. or exponential regressions. During project planning. the developer can review these estimates and select one of them or substitute a guesstimate based on his or her experience.

Efficiency. and Generality in Blackboard Architectures.,1987,Daniel D Corkill and Kevin Q Gallagher and Philip M Johnson,,,,18-23,,Achieving flexibility and efficiency in blackboardbased AI applications are often conflicting goals. Flexibility. the ability to easily change the blackboard representation and retrieval machinery. can be achieved by using a general purpose blackboard database implementation. at the cost of efficient performance for a particular application. Conversely. a customized blackboard database implementation. while efficient. leads to strong interdependencies between the application code (knowledge sources) and the blackboard database implementation. Both flexibility and efficiency can be achieved by maintaining a sufficient level of data abstraction between the application code and the blackboard implementation. The abstraction techniques we present are a crucial aspect of the generic blackboard development system GBB.

Unfortunately. barriers surrounding the cost. quality. and utility of empirical project data hamper effective collection and application in many software development organizations. This paper describes Hackystat. an approach to enabling ubiquitous collection and analysis of empirical software project data. The approach rests on three design criteria: data collection and analysis must be developer-centric rather than management-centric; it must be in-process rather than between-process. and it must be non-disruptive—it must not require developers to interrupt their activities to collect and/or analyze data. Hackystat is being implemented via an open source. sensor and web service based architecture. After a developer instruments their commercial development environment tools (such as their compiler. editor. version control system. and so forth) with Hackystat sensors. data is silently and unobtrusively collected and sent to a centralized web service. The web service runs analysis mechanisms over the data and sends email notifications back to a developer when “interesting” changes in their process or product occur.Our research so far has yielded an initial operational release in daily use with a small set of sensors and analysis mechanisms. and a research agenda for expansion in the tools. the sensor data types. and the analyses.

1123761,Philip Johnson,1962,John M Jacobus and Philip Johnson,,,,,G. Braziller,"In the evolution of 20th-century architecture. Philip Johnson has played a unique dual role. He began as a critic and historian of architecture and in this capacity he was associated with the original formulation of the concept “International Style” as applied to the new architecture of the 1920's."" The intelligence and taste which first contributed to this funda-mental statement concerning modern design are likewise determining factors in Johnson's more recent creative activity. As an artist. he has displayed in his own buildings the same incisive analytical traits that first found expression in his architectural writings thirty years ago. Indeed. this literary relationship between his personal manner of design. which was established about 1950. and the geometric simplicity of the radical architecture of a generation ago. not only reveals the sources of his style but also explains the scholarly nature of his preoccupation with these archetypal modern constructions. Furthermore. Johnson is a traditionalist by necessity as well as by choice and temperament. Born in 1906. he is a full generation younger than the leading creative architects of the 1920's. most of whom were born in the mid-1880's. This simple matter of chronology helps to explain the in-herently retrospective character of his creative work-retro-spective in spite of his forthright adoption of a radical design vocabulary. one which was originally drawn from the style of Mies van der Rohe. Johnson's place in contemporary history is dramatized by the fact that he was still an under-graduate in Harvard College at a time when a major landmark of the new style.

Modifying DHTs directly to support meta-data is difficult. and meta-data search systems such as flooding tend to scale poorly. However. a number of more scalable distributed meta-data search systems have recently been developed that could be deployed in tandem with DHTs. and several are discussed here along with some novel simulation results that concern the scalability and resource limitations of a meta-data search layer that employs semantic routing. Semantic routing is a method of pruning a flooding search such that queries are preferentially forwarded to nodes that can answer those queries.

Our data sources include video recordings of in-world class interactions; artifacts and documents such as students’ blog. and asynchronous discussion postings. For data analysis. we use the constant comparative method as a tool for inductive analysis. and discourse analysis as a tool to discover patterns in discursive practices. The constant comparative method was originally developed for the use in grounded theory methodology. but is now more widely applied as a method of analysis in qualitative research. It requires the researcher to take one piece of data and compare it to all other pieces of data that are either similar or different. gradually identifying the salient differences. In contrast. discourse analysis examines the way in which sentences are combined in larger linguistic units. such as conversational exchanges or written texts. The critical analysis of discourse helps us extend and specify themes generated during constant comparative analysis.,True,SslTbocAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,22,https://jvwr-ojs-utexas-stage.tdl.org/jvwr/index.php/jvwr/article/view/815,5667144779455463068,/scholar?cites=5667144779455463068,,https://jvwr-ojs-utexas-stage.tdl.org/jvwr/index.php/jvwr/article/view/815/880,0,0,0

1123793,Regulating multinationals in developing countries: a conceptual and legal framework for corporate social responsibility,2016,Edwin Mujih,,,,,Routledge,Edwin Mujih explores the difficulties associated with regulating multinational companies operating in developing countries. with a particular focus on extractive industries. The author highlights the need to establish an international legally binding framework to ensure that multinationals operate in a socially responsible manner to protect local communities and the environment. Edwin Mujih’s analysis reveals that the existing mechanisms for controlling the behaviour of huge multinational entities are of normative force only. that these are particularly inadequate. and that the notion of corporate social responsibility is only meaningful where behaviour can be legally regulated. Regulating Multinationals in Developing Countries features a study of the Chad and Cameroon Oil and pipeline project. which highlights the problems arising in countries that have neither the capacity nor the will to effectively regulate those operating within their borders. The author has evaluated compliance by the parties with their social and environmental obligations.

1123794,Synergies between social media features and user engagement to enhance online brand visibility-A conceptual model,2013,Anuradha Goswami and Vijayakumar Bharathi and Ramakrishnan Raman and Apoorva Kulkarni and Shaji Joseph and Bhooshan Kelkar,5,International Journal of Engineering and Technology,3,2705-2718,,Organizations today are fast realizing the impact of social media as a significant business driver for capitalizing the advantages on certain key strategic issues like user engagement and brand visibility. Integrating social media characteristics is one of the key differentiators for enhancing online brand visibility. Though a lot of research has been made on the social media usability and user engagement. the uniqueness of this research paper is the identification of synergies between the features of social media and user engagement to enhance online brand visibility. In this paper a conceptual model is explained by developing a social media-user engagement matrix to explain the synergies. The matrix integrates four parameters of User Engagement namely Involvement. Interaction. Intimacy and Influence with four Social Media characteristics namely Content. Relationship. Value and Structure to bring out the essence of interoperability. This paper has identified and listed certain metrics for measuring the online brand visibility. We believe that the outcome of this paper will make significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge by uniquely identifying and explaining the ‘social media-user engagement synergy’and also listing appropriate metrics for measuring online brand visibility.,True,SslTbocAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC,13,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2294323,246083609135354575,/scholar?cites=246083609135354575,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.411.4982&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1123795,Theories of adaptive neural growth,1998,Samuel Russell Hampden Joseph,,,,,,When interpreting the results of experiments that investigate biological development. one is faced with a wealth of data. Producing a model of such development must always involve some degree of abstraction. The appropriate level of abstraction and the importance of particular experimental evidence is determined by one’s modelling objective. Models may potentially be motivated by one of two complementary aims: 1. To understand how biological neurons achieve their mature interconnectivity. 2. To improve the learning ability of artificial neural nets (ANNs) by taking inspiration from the growth of biological nervous systems. These aims are exemplified in the thesis by two simulated neural models. The first is a model of neuromuscular development that places an emphasis on achieving biological plausibility. The second is a platform for modifying the connectivity of artificial neural networks. This feature generation mechanism (FGM) platform supports a variety of growth procedures that are inspired by evidence from biological development. The model of development at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ) focusses on the achievement of single innervation. and is an extension of the existing dual constraint model (DCM). The identities of the molecules involved in the DCM are proposed and the framework is adjusted accordingly. This extension allows a variety of developmental phenomena to be replicated. including the presence of both activity-dependent & independent competition between terminals. A further framework is established that provides a potential explanation for the paradoxical results of synaptic interaction under focal …,True,SslTbocAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,13,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.1125&rep=rep1&type=pdf,10871562290675678986,/scholar?cites=10871562290675678986,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.1125&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

As we will see in this essay. such a simple statement conceals considerable complexity. The interplay of learning with technology turns out to be quite intricate. The inclusion of collaboration. computer mediation and distance education has problematized the very notion of learning and called into question prevailing assumptions about how to study it.Like many active fields of scientific research. CSCL has a complex relationship to established disciplines. evolves in ways that are hard to pinpoint and includes important contributions that seem incompatible. The field of CSCL has a long history of controversy about its theory. methods and definition. Furthermore. it is important to view CSCL as a vision of what may be possible with computers and of what kinds of research should be conducted. rather than as an established body of broadly accepted laboratory and classroom practices.

Pairs of participants worked with one of three representations while investigating complex science and public health problems. Dependent variables included quantity of discourse about evidential relations (“for” and “against”) and two learning outcome measures. Significant effects of tools on learning processes were found. although there appears to have been insufficient time for these process differences to influence learning outcomes.,True,8rEj1jIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,148,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/22910/Suthers-Hundhausen-Euro-CSCL-2001.pdf,14645485564965454772,/scholar?cites=14645485564965454772,,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/22910/Suthers-Hundhausen-Euro-CSCL-2001.pdf,0,0,0

However. existing software tools provide only primitive support for online knowledge-building discourse. Further work is needed in supporting coordinated use of disciplinary representations. discourse representations. and knowledge representations. The paper introduces the concept of representational guidance for discourse along with results of an initial study of this phenomenon in face to face situations. The paper then considers the requirements for supporting asynchronous online knowledge-building discourse. finding existing computer mediated communication tools to be particularly deficient in supporting artifact-centered discourse.

The learning domain is entity-relationship modeling. a domain in which collaborative problem solving is regularly practiced. and for which there exist formally interpretable representations of problem solutions known as entity-relationship diagrams. The design of the coach was based on socio-cognitive conflict theory. which states that collaborative learning is effective to the extent that learners identify and discuss conflicts in their beliefs. Students begin by constructing individual entity-relationship diagrams expressing their solution to a database modeling problem. and then work in small groups to agree upon a group solution.

1123840,Representational and advisory guidance for students learning scientific inquiry.,2001,Daniel D Suthers and John Connelly and Alan M Lesgold and Massimo Paolucci and Eva Erdosne Toth and Joe Toth and Arlene Weiner,,,,,,Scientific knowledge is dynamic in two senses: it changes and increases extremely rapidly. and it is thrust from the lab into the wider world and public forum almost as rapidly. This implies increasing demands on secondary school science education. Besides knowing key facts. concepts. and procedures. it is important for today’s students to understand the process by which the claims of science are generated. evaluated. and revised–an interplay between theoretical and empirical work (Dunbar & Klahr. 1989). The educational goals behind the work reported in this chapter are to improve students’ understanding of this process and to facilitate students’ acquisition of critical inquiry skills. while also meeting conventional subject matter learning objectives. In addition to the need to change what is taught. there are grounds to change how it is taught. Research shows that students learn better when they actively pursue understanding rather than passively receiving knowledge (Brown & Campione 1994; Chi et al.. 1989; Craik & Lockhart. 1972; Greeno et al.. 1996; Resnick & Chi. 1988; Perkins et al.. 1985; Webb & Palincsar. 1996). Accordingly. the classroom teacher is now being urged to become a “guide on the side” rather than the “sage on the stage.” Similarly. new roles have been recommended for artificial intelligence applications to education. replacing computer-directed learning with software that supports the learning processes of students engaged in collaborative critical inquiry (Chan & Baskin. 1988; Koschmann. 1996; O’Neill & Gomez. 1994; Roschelle. 1994; Scardamalia & Bereiter. 1994).,True,8rEj1jIAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C,103,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/22909/Suthers-et-al-AAAI-2001.pdf,17295988856619178403,/scholar?cites=17295988856619178403,,https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/22909/Suthers-et-al-AAAI-2001.pdf,0,0,0

Prior work in face-to-face collaborative learning situations has shown that the features of representational notations can influence the focus of learners' discourse and collaborative activities. Two hypotheses were considered in the present study: (1) The influence of knowledge representations in the online condition could be weaker because of the lack of shared awareness and meaning that results from working together in front of a physically shared display. and because of the greater difficulty of utilizing the representations as a resource for conversation through gestural deixis. and (2) The influence of knowledge representations in the online study could be stronger because participants must rely more on them to …,True,8rEj1jIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,94,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131503000721,13057608728164473866,/scholar?cites=13057608728164473866,,https://eecs.wsu.edu/~veupl/pub/Suthers-et-al-Computers-Ed-2002.pdf,0,0,0

The primary contribution of this paper is a methodology for qualitative analysis of activity in a workspace built on the concept of ""uptake"": how participants take up and build on prior contributions. By examining patterns of uptake we can see ways in which participants' activities constitute an intersubjective cognitive activity distributed across persons and the representations they are manipulating.

Prior work on supporting collaboration has relied largely on comparing student discourse to models of collaborative discourse. Comparison of student work to expert solutions is prevalent in individual coaching paradigms. Although these approaches are valuable. our approach evaluates the potential contribution of tracking student participation and comparing students' individual and group solutions. Our theoretical motivation is that conflicts between individual and group solutions constitute learning opportunities. provided that students recognize and address these conflicts. The coach encourages such negotiation when differences are detected. and also encourages participation in other ways. Our evaluation relied primarily on expert judgement and secondarily on student reactions to the coach.

We examined the extent to which gestural deixis is inhibited online. and how shared representations serve as conversational resources in other ways.

It focuses on different impacts of demand response running in the smart grid engaging consumers to participate. The main responsibility of the demand response system is scheduling the operation of appliances of consumers in order to achieve a network-wide optimized performance. Each participating electricity consumer. who owns a set of home appliances. provides the desired expectation of his/her power consumption scenario to the demand response system. It is accompanied with time limits on the flexibility of controllable appliances for shifting their operational time from peak to offpeak periods. The appliance scheduling optimization for demand response is modeled as an optimization problem. It concentrates on reducing the total electricity bills and CO2 emissions as well as flattening the aggregated peak demand at the same time. This paper categorizes the appliances based on shiftability and interruptibility characteristics. It uses information of dwellings to determine an effective appliance scheduling strategy. This strategy gets influenced by grid constraints imposed by distribution system operators. The simulations confirm that scheduling appliances of 100 consumers yields a significant achievement in the peak demand reduction while averagely satisfying the comfort level of consumers.,True,2-O74E0AAAAJ:Tfl4UtY-dJUC,26,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11043446902053999787&hl=en&oi=scholarr,11043446902053999787,/scholar?cites=11043446902053999787,,,0,0,0

This work analyzes and proposes several techniques to improve the robustness of a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system that uses accelerometer signals from different smartwatches and smartphones. This analysis reveals some of the challenges associated with both device heterogeneity and the different use of smartwatches compared to smartphones. When using smartwatches to recognize whole body activities. the arm movements introduce additional variability giving rise to a significant degradation in HAR.

While much effort has gone into achieving high positioning accuracy and easing fingerprint collection. it is our contention that the general problem is not sufficiently well understood. thus preventing deployments and their usage by applications to become more widespread.

In this paper. we report findings from qualitatively studying organisational requirements for indoor Wi-Fi positioning. The studied cases and deployments cover both company and public-sector settings and the deployment and evaluation of several types of indoor Wi-Fi positioning systems over durations of up to several years. The findings suggest among others a need for supporting all case-specific user groups. providing software platform independence. low maintenance. allowing positioning of all user devices. regardless of platform and form factor.

While these smartphone platforms provide varying degrees of control over these permissions. the sheer number of decisions that users are expected to manage has been shown to be unrealistically high. Prior research has shown that users are often unaware of. if not uncomfortable with. many of their permission settings. Prior work also suggests that it is theoretically possible to predict many of the privacy settings a user would want by asking the user a small number of questions. However. this approach has neither been operationalized nor evaluated with actual users before. We report on a field study (n= 72) in which we implemented and evaluated a Personalized Privacy Assistant (PPA) with participants using their own Android devices. The results of our study are encouraging. We find that 78.7% of the recommendations made by the PPA were adopted by users.

However. the significance of privacy policies greatly exceeds the attention paid to them: these documents are binding legal agreements between website operators and their users. and their opaqueness is a challenge not only to Internet users but also to policy regulators. One proposed alternative to the status quo is to automate or semi-automate the extraction of salient details from privacy policy text. using a combination of crowdsourcing. natural language processing. and machine learning. However. there has been a relative dearth of datasets appropriate for identifying data practices in privacy policies. To remedy this problem. we introduce a corpus of 115 privacy policies (267K words) with manual annotations for 23K fine-grained data practices. We describe the process of using skilled annotators and a purpose-built annotation tool to produce the data. We provide findings based on a census of the annotations and show results toward automating the annotation procedure.

Heidelberg,Over the last decade many methods for location privacy have been proposed. but the mapping between classes of location based services and location privacy methods is not obvious. This entails confusion for developers. lack of usage of privacy methods. and an unclear road-map ahead for research within location privacy. This paper presents a two-dimensional classification of existing methods for location privacy grouping them by the type of location based service to which they apply and location privacy method category. The types of location based services identified are Point-of-Interest. Social Networking. Collaborative Sensing. and Route Tracing. and the high level location privacy method categories are Anonymization. Classical Security. Spatial Obfuscation. Temporal Obfuscation. and Protocol.

However. these documents are infrequently read by Internet users. due in part to the length and complexity of the text. These factors also inhibit the efforts of regulators to assess privacy practices or to enforce standards. One proposed approach to improving the status quo is to use a combination of methods from crowdsourcing. natural language processing. and machine learning to extract details from privacy policies and present them in an understandable fashion. We sketch out this vision and describe our ongoing work to bring it to fruition. Further. we discuss challenges associated with bridging the gap between the contents of privacy policy text and website users’ abilities to understand those policies. These challenges are motivated by the rich interconnectedness of the problems as well as the broader impact of helping Internet users understand their privacy choices.

Furthermore. solutions which try to embrace location privacy more generally suffer from being overly complex. This limits the expressiveness and general applicability of such solutions. the consequence being that different location privacy implementations are restricted in the sense of which attacks they protect against. Furthermore. this makes it difficult to compare different solutions making it hard for developers to choose and add sufficient location privacy. In this paper we present the SITA conceptual model to solve the aforementioned problems.

1123926,Mobile Learning in Context—Context-aware Hypermedia in the Wild.,2009,Frank Allan Hansen and Niels Olof Bouvin,3,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies,1,,,Modern project-based education requires students to be able to work with digital materials both in and out of the classroom. Field trips are often an integral part of such projects and greatly benefit students' learning by allowing them to engage with real-world environments firsthand. However. the infrastructure for accessing context sensitive information and supporting in-situ authoring by students while in the field is often lacking. In this paper we present the HyCon framework for mobile. context-aware. and multi-platform hypermedia that aims at supporting several aspects of fieldtrips and project-based education. The framework and its applications utilize information about the users' digital and physical context in order to support digital-physical linking of multimedia materials. and it supports browsing. searching. and creation of new materials which can be linked to points in time and space for later inspection.

The Web has evolved and most Web browsers now support a rich set of media types either by default or by the use of specialised content handlers. known as plug-ins. The limitations of the Web linking model are well known and they also extend into the realm of the other media types currently supported by Web browsers. This paper introduces the Mimicry system that allows authors and readers to link to and from temporal media (video and audio) on the Web. The system is integrated with the Arakne Environment. an open hypermedia integration aimed at Web augmentation. The links created are stored externally. allowing for links to and from resources not owned by the (link) author.

In the past 15 years this has changed substantially. as computer use has spread to work environments very unlike the engineering environment (Grudin. 1990). The new divisions of responsibility and the divergence of quali fications have widened the gulf between the developer and user environments. This gulf must be bridged and the most direct approach for doing so is to increase user involvement in development.Cooperative development—full participation by both developers and users—requires rethinking the tools and techniques used in systems development (Greenbaum & Kyng. 1991).

A critical enabler for a stable solution is the communication protocol between the consumer and the grid operator. Currently. there exist many evaluations of demand response strategies for shifting consumers' usage. but these often do not consider the performance of the demand response protocol enabling this. In this paper. we present a methodology for evaluating the performance of demand response protocols for the Smart Grid in combination with a demand response strategy.

Previous studies have shown that utilizing eye gaze to steer audio through beamformers could be a solution for those situations. Recent studies have shown that in-ear electrodes that capture electrooculography in the ear (EarEOG) can estimate the eye-gaze relative to the head. when the head was fixed. The head movement can be estimated using motion sensors around the ear to create an estimate of the absolute eye-gaze in the room. In this study. an experiment was designed to mimic a multi-talker situation in order to study and model the EarEOG signal when participants attempted to follow a conversation. Eleven hearing impaired participants were presented speech from the DAT speech corpus (1). with three targets positioned at -30°. 0° and +30° azimuth. The experiment was run in two setups: one where the participants had their head fixed in a chinrest. and the other where they were free to move their head. The participants’ task was to focus their visual attention on an LED-indicated target that changed regularly. A model was developed for the relative eye-gaze estimation. taking saccades. fixations. head movement and drift from the electrode-skin half-cell into account. This model explained 90.5% of the variance of the EarEOG when the head was fixed. and 82.6% when the head was free. The absolute eye-gaze was also estimated utilizing that model. When the head was fixed. the estimation of the absolute eye-gaze was reliable.

Toronto. Canada,Background: Electronic cigarette awareness and use has been increasing rapidly. E-cigarette brands have utilized social networking sites to promote their products. as the growth of the e-cigarette industry has paralleled that of Web 2.0. These online platforms are cost-effective and have unique technological features and user demographics that can be attractive for selective marketing. The popularity of multiple sites also poses a risk of exposure to social networks where e-cigarette brands might not have a presence.Objective: To examine the marketing strategies of leading e-cigarette brands on multiple social networking sites. and to identify how affordances of the digital media are used to their advantage. Secondary analyses include determining if any brands are benefitting from site demographics. and exploring cross-site diffusion of marketing content through multi-site users.Methods: We collected data from two e-cigarette brands from four social networking sites over approximately 2.5 years. Content analysis is used to search for themes. population targeting. marketing strategies. and cross-site spread of messages.Results: Twitter appeared to be the most frequently used social networking site for interacting directly with product users. Facebook supported informational broadcasts. such as announcements regarding political legislation.

The knob shapes were evaluated in relation to twelve haptic feedback stimuli. The stimuli were designed as a combination of the most relevant perceptual parameters of force feedback; acceleration. friction. detent amplitude and spacing. The results indicate that there is a relationship between the shape of a knob and its haptic feedback. The perceived functionality can be dynamically altered by changing its shape and haptic feedback. This work serves as basis for the design of dynamic interface controls that can adapt their shape and haptic feel to the content that is controlled. In our demonstration. we show the six distinct knobs shapes with the different haptic feedback stimuli.

But the field is challenged by a multitude of vaguely defined concepts around affordances such as dynamic. spatial. or tactile affordances. In line with this. Alexander et al [1] recently pointed to lack of theory as one of the grand challenges for SCI. This paper proposes a re-analysis of Gibson for resolving the conceptual cacophony in the field of SCI. Essential to the ecological approach to affordances. is that perception is dynamic and people pick up information through exploring objects and environments over time. From this perspective. affordances of Shape-Changing Interfaces become a matter of providing Information-through the design-regarding a) the interfaces' ability to transform its shape and b) how movement suggests level of animacy.

Berlin. Heidelberg,A central tenet of software architecture design is to base this on a formulation of desired quality attributes. such as buildability. performance. and availability of the target system. Thus there is a need for architectural evaluation—ensuring the architecture’s support for desired quality attributes—and a variety of evaluation techniques have been developed. described. and used. Architectural prototyping is an experimental approach that creates executable ‘skeleton’ systems to investigate architectural qualities of a future system. Architectural prototyping is a learning vehicle for exploring an architectural design space as well as an evaluation technique. The contribution of this paper is to explore the evaluation aspect of architectural prototypes from an analytical standpoint. We present an analysis and discussion of architectural prototyping in the context of two well-established quality frameworks.

In line with other researchers. we use the term pervasive computing to describe a computing infrastructure that supports work where users access a dynamic range of computing and software devices. where users can shift between devices. and where users move around while preserving their working environment. This paper describes our design of a pervasive activity-driven computing infrastructure. The main tenet in this approach is to preserve a user’s computational working context enabling him to shift between different devices while on the move and enabling him to interrupt and return to work-activities fluently. Furthermore. the infrastructure contains agents that propose new activities based on the user’s current context.

Objective: To compare the sales of benzodiazepines and SSRIs within the primary care sector in Denmark and relate changes in usage to number of indications and products on the market. Methods: We used data from various sources to establish the sales curves of psychotropic drugs in the period 1970 to 2007. based on the Anatomic Therapeutic Classification system and Defined Daily Doses. Results: Fluctuations in sales of psychotropic drugs that cannot be explained by disease prevalence were caused by changes in sales of the benzodiazepines and SSRIs. We found a decline in the sales of benzodiazepines after a peak in 1986. likely due to the recognition that they cause dependence.

MIS 5e or the Eemian. In the glacial part of the core. annual layers can be identified from impurity records and visual stratigraphy. and stratigraphic layer counting has been performed back to 60 ka. In the deepest part of the core. however. the ice is close to the pressure melting point. the visual stratigraphy is dominated by crystal boundaries. and annual layering is not visible to the naked eye. In this study. we apply a newly developed setup for high-resolution ice core impurity analysis to produce continuous records of dust. sodium and ammonium concentrations as well as conductivity of melt water. We analyzed three 2.2 m sections of ice from the Eemian and the glacial inception. In all of the analyzed ice. annual layers can clearly be recognized. most prominently in the dust and conductivity profiles. Part of the samples is. however. contaminated in dust. most likely from drill liquid. It is interesting that the annual layering is preserved despite a very active crystal growth and grain boundary migration in the deep and warm NGRIP ice. Based on annual layer counting of the new records. we determine a mean annual layer thickness close to 11 mm for all three sections. which. to first order. confirms the modeled NGRIP time scale (ss09sea). The counting does. however. suggest a longer duration of the climatically warmest part of the NGRIP record (MIS5e) of up to 1 ka as compared to the model estimate.

1124099,Towards Highly Affine Visualizations of Consumption Data from Buildings.,2015,Matthias Nielsen and Kaj Grønbæk,,,,247-255,,This paper presents a novel approach AffinityViz to visualize live and aggregated consumption data from multistory buildings. The objective of the approach is to provide a generic but high affinity relation between real buildings’ spatial layouts and the consumption data visualizations. Current approaches come short on maintaining such affinity. This implies an avoidable cognitive load on users such as energy managers and facility managers who need to monitor consumption and make decisions from consumption data. To alleviate this we have transformed three conventional types of visualizations into highly affine visualizations lowering the cognitive load for users. The contributions are: 1) Development of the AffinityViz techniques featuring three generic designs of highly affine visualizations of consumption data. 2) Comparison of the affine visualizations with the conventional visualizations. 3) Initial evaluation of the AffinityViz designs by expert users on real world data. Finally. the design challenges of AffinityViz are discussed. including prospects for AffinityViz as a future tool for visual analysis of data from buildings.,True,ddcOGPMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,3,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d46f/c0689a2abd2c03b00e120168ceac732ffd85.pdf,2242779966834155401,/scholar?cites=2242779966834155401,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d46f/c0689a2abd2c03b00e120168ceac732ffd85.pdf,0,0,0

In an expansion process. the pressure that is applied on the inner tube surface causes the tube to deform radially outward. Further plastic deformation of the tube. while tube in contact with the tubesheet. creates a contact pressure at the interface. Therefore. an optimum expansion pressure adequately develops sufficient contact pressure at the tube-to-tubesheet interface. Wall thinning percentage is generally used in practice to estimate the right amount of expansion. This paper focusses on the wall thickness reduction expressed in percentage. radial displacement of the inner tube surface. contact pressure and theoretical pull-out force for a various expansion pressure range.

Understanding ethanol blending effects with simpler gasoline surrogates is critical to acquire knowledge about ethanol blending with complex multi-component gasoline fuels. In this study. the octane numbers (ON) of ethanol blends with five relevant gasoline surrogate molecules were measured.

Low octane gasoline fuel has been identified as a viable option for the GCI engine applications due to its longer ignition delay characteristics compared to diesel and in the volatility range of gasoline fuels. In this study. we have investigated the effect of different injection timings at part-load conditions using light naphtha stream in single cylinder engine experiments in the GCI combustion mode with injection pressure of 130 bar. A toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) was used as a surrogate for the light naphtha in the engine simulations performed here. A physical surrogate based on the evaporation characteristics of the light naphtha has been developed and its properties have been implemented in the engine simulations. Full cycle GCI computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engine simulations have been successfully performed while changing the start of injection (SOI) timing from -50° to -11 ° CAD aTDC. The effect of SOI on mixing and combustion phasing was investigated using detailed equivalence ratio-temperature maps and ignition delay times. Both experimental and computational results consistently showed that an SOI of -30° CAD aTDC has the most advanced combustion phasing (CA50). with the highest NOx emission.

Although higher molecular weight alcohols (e.g.. n-pentanol and n-hexanol) exhibit higher reactivity that lowers their knock resistance. they are suitable for diesel engines or advanced engine concepts. such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). where higher reactivity at lower temperatures is necessary for engine operation. The present study presents a detailed kinetic model for n-pentanol based on modeling rules previously presented for n-butanol. This approach was initially validated using quantum chemistry calculations to verify the most stable n …,True,Cl0SEFAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,99,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef3012596,16713914185477511069,/scholar?cites=16713914185477511069,,,0,0,0

Improving biofuel engine performance requires understanding its fundamental combustion properties and the pathways of combustion. This research study presents new combustion data for methyl decanoate in an opposed-flow diffusion flame. An improved detailed chemical kinetic model for methyl decanoate combustion is developed. which serves as the basis for deriving a skeletal mechanism via the direct relation graph method. The novel skeletal mechanism consists of 648 species and 2998 reactions. The skeletal mechanism reproduces the behavior of the fully detailed mechanism in plug flow and stirred reactors for temperatures of 900–1800 K. equivalence ratios of 0.25–2.0. and pressures of 101 and 1013 kPa.

Accurate detailed chemical kinetic models are an important prerequisite for high fidelity reacting flow simulations capable of improving combustor design and operation. The development of such models for many new fuel components and/or surrogate molecules is greatly facilitated by the application of reaction classes and rate rules. Accurate and versatile rate rules are desirable to improve the predictive accuracy of kinetic models. A major contribution in the literature is the recent work by Bugler et al.

The use of these two component surrogates to represent real gasoline fuels for simulations of HCCI/PCCI engines needs further consideration. as the mode of combustion is very different in these engines (i.e. the combustion process is mainly controlled by the reactivity of the fuel).  This study presents an experimental evaluation of PRF surrogates for four real gasoline fuels termed FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) A. C.

The gasoline fuels considered in this study have very low sensitivities. S (RON-MON). and also exhibit two-stage ignition behavior. The first stage heat release. which is termed Low Temperature Heat Release (LTHR). controls the combustion phasing in this operating mode. As a result. the performance of the PRF surrogates was evaluated by its ability to mimic the low temperature chemical reactivity of the real gasoline fuels. This was achieved by comparing the LTHR from the engine pressure histories. The PRF surrogates were able to consistently reproduce the amount of LTHR. closely match the phasing of LTHR. and the compression ratio for the start of hot ignition of the real gasoline fuels.

The compression and lean combustion mode eliminates throttle losses yielding higher thermodynamic efficiencies and the better mixing of fuel/air due to the longer ignition delay times of the gasoline-like fuels allows better emission performance such as nitric oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). These gasoline-like fuels which usually have lower octane compared to market gasoline have been identified as a viable option for the gasoline compression ignition (GCI) engine applications due to its lower reactivity and lighter evaporation compared to diesel. The properties. specifications and sources of these GCI fuels are not fully understood yet because this technology is relatively new. In this work. a GCI fuel matrix is being developed based on the significance of certain physical and chemical properties in GCI engine operation. Those properties were chosen to be density. temperature at 90 volume % evaporation (T90) or final boiling point (FBP) and research octane number (RON) and the ranges of these properties were determined from the data reported in literature.

An advanced distillation column (ADC) provides a more realistic representation of volatility characteristics. which can be modeled using equilibrium thermodynamic methods. The temperature reported is that of the liquid. as opposed to the vapor temperature in conventional ASTM D86 distillation standard.

Fuels with lower aromatic content showed decreasing ignition delay time with increasing boiling point (i.e.. molecular weight). However. fuels with higher aromatic content showed an initial decrease in ignition delay time with increasing boiling point. followed by drastic increase in ignition delay time due to fractions containing aromatics.

The naphtha used in this work has research octane number (RON) of 60 and motor octane number (MON) of 58.3. Our experimental data are compared with simulated ignition delay times of three surrogates: primary reference fuel (PRF). toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF). and six-components surrogate. Experimental and simulated ignition delays of the three surrogates show good agreement at high and intermediate temperatures. However. at low temperatures. the multi-component surrogate performs much better than the other two simpler surrogates in capturing the reactivity trends of HSRN.,True,w-e4XwcAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC,0,https://research.kaust.edu.sa/en/publications/ignition-delay-measurements-of-straight-run-naphtha,,,,,0,0,0

The in-depth knowledge of trace elements as micronutrients and metalloenzyme components justifies trace element supplementation into the anaerobic digestion system. Most of the earlier studies reported that trace elements addition at (sub)optimum dosages had positive impacts mainly longer term on digester stability with greater organic matter degradation. low volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration and higher biogas production. However. these positive impacts and element requirements are not fully understood. they are explained on a case to case basis because of the great variance of the anaerobic digestion operation. Iron (Fe). nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) are the most studied and desirable elements.

This research assessed the supporting system used in a surge chamber cavern excavated for Hulu Terengganu hydroelectricity project in the northeast of Peninsular Malaysia. The results obtained were compared with the installed supports. Geological mapping of the excavated region was carried out to outline the discontinuity parameters of the rock. The rock mass quality (Q). the rock mass rating (RMR). the geological strength index (GSI) and the uniaxial compressive strength were evaluated using standard methods and procedures. The strength and rock mass properties were further used to classify the rock and establish the required standard supports for the surge chamber cavern. The wall height is approximately 40 m. It requires systematic bolting with 7 to 11 m length of rock bolt at a maximum wall spacing of 1.5 m. The required reinforce shotcrete falls within a thickness of 50-90 mm. The currently installed shotcrete is within the minimum of 50 mm thickness and has a spacing of 3.0 m along the wall which is too large for reliable safety.

DS is a celluloserich biomass with high volatile matters content. which is suitable for bio-oil production. Thermal decomposition experiments were performed under nitrogen flow at various heating rates (ie. 5 C min–1. 10 C min–1 and 20 C min–1). The model-fitting method represented by Coats-Redfern was applied on the experimental TGA data of DS pyrolysis. The decomposition of DS was divided into three stages: first stage (59 C–200 C) involved removal of moisture and light volatiles; second stage (200 C–400 C) showed decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose; and third stage (above 400 C) presented lignin decomposition. There was 56% weight loss observed in second stage. revealing that decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose contributed the most on volatile production. The model shows that the activation energy was between 42.08 kJ mol–1 and 84.40 kJ mol–1 for the second stage of the pyrolytic process from 200 C to 400 C using different decomposition mechanisms. The Coats-Redfern method is applied successfully for the correlation of experimental TGA data with an average correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.991 while one-way diffusion model D1 gave the highest correlation coefficient of 0.998.

Furthermore. a rapid load increase could amount to a consequent sudden deficit in the generation supply before the next scheduled assessment. Hence. a reliability assessment is conducted at regular and close intervals to ensure adequacy. This study simulates and establishes the relationship between the load growth and generation capacity using the generation and load data of the IEEE reliability test system (IEEE RTS ‘96 standard). The generation capacity states and the risk model were obtained using the sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The load was gradually increased stepwise and is simulated against the constant generation capacity. In each case. the reliability index was recorded in terms of loss-of-load evaluation (LOLE). The recorded reliability index was thereafter fitted with the load-growth trend by the linear regression approach. A predictive assessment approach is thereafter proffered through the obtained fitting equation. In addition. a reliability threshold is effectively determined at a yield point for a reliability benchmark.

For this reason. this study has evaluated the optimization of hydrogen yield from crude glycerol and swine manure. using the response surface methodology. The response surface methodology helps in the compression of the mixture of crude glycerol/swine manure. with the production of hydrogen as a result. which improves the yields of the process. reducing variability and time of development. A central composite design was employed with two factors. six axial points and four central points. The two factors evaluated were crude glycerol and swine manure concentrations. which were examined over a range of 4 to 10 g L− 1 and 5 to 15 g L− 1. respectively. This study demonstrated that the thermal pretreatment method is still the most suitable method to be applied. mainly in the preparation of hydrogen-producing inoculum. The maximum hydrogen yield was 142.46 mL per gram of volatile solid added. It used up 21.56% of the crude glycerol (2.75 g L− 1) and 78.44%(10 g L− 1) of the swine manure. maintaining a carbon/nitrogen ratio of 18.06. with a fermentation time of 21 days. The response surface methodology was employed to maximize the hydrogen production of crude glycerol/swine manure ratios by the optimization of factors with few assays and less operational cost.

1124481,Quantitative Estimation of Differentiated Mental Fatigue between Self-Rising Transfer and Multiple Welfare Robots-Assisted Rising Transfer,2020,Donghui Zhao and Junyou Yang and Dianchun Bai and Martin Onyeka Okoye and Yokoi Hiroshi,9,Electronics,4,594,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The multi-robot system (MRS) and relevant control strategy are a potential and effective approach to assist people with weak motion capability for various forms of assisted living. However. the rising transfer. a frequent and strenuous behavior. and its human-robot interaction (HRI) process with MRS. especially mental state. has never been researched. although it directly determines the user experience and security. In this paper. Functional Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). a brain imaging technique to perform a continuous measure of the mental state. is introduced to monitor the user’s mental fatigue when implementing a behavior transfer in two difficulty levels assisted by multiple welfare-robots. Twenty-five subjects performed self-rising transfer and multiple welfare robots-assisted rising transfer. After removing physiological noises. six features of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbO and HbR. respectively) features. which included the mean. slope. variance. peak. skewness. and kurtosis. were calculated. To maximize the distinction of fNIRS between self-rising transfer and assisted-rising transfer (multiple welfare robots assisted rising transfer). the optimal statistical feature combination for linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification was proposed. In addition. the classification accuracy is regarded as a standard to quantify the difference of mental states between two contrasting behaviors. By fitting the index. we established the mental fatigue model that grows exponentially as the workload increases. Finally. the mental fatigue model is applied to guide the nursing mode of caregivers and the control strategy of the MRS.

1124482,Predictive Reliability Assessment of Generation System,2020,Martin Onyeka Okoye and Junyou Yang and Zhenjiang Lei and Jingwei Yuan and Huichao Ji and Haixin Wang and Jiawei Feng and Tunmise Ayode Otitoju and Weidong Li,13,Energies,17,4350,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Due to increasing load and characteristic stagnation and fluctuations of existing generation systems capacity. the reliability assessment of generation systems is crucial to system adequacy. Furthermore. a rapid load increase could amount to a consequent sudden deficit in the generation supply before the next scheduled assessment. Hence. a reliability assessment is conducted at regular and close intervals to ensure adequacy. This study simulates and establishes the relationship between the load growth and generation capacity using the generation and load data of the IEEE reliability test system (IEEE RTS ‘96 standard). The generation capacity states and the risk model were obtained using the sequential Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The load was gradually increased stepwise and is simulated against the constant generation capacity. In each case. the reliability index was recorded in terms of loss-of-load evaluation (LOLE). The recorded reliability index was thereafter fitted with the load-growth trend by the linear regression approach. A predictive assessment approach is thereafter proffered through the obtained fitting equation. In addition. a reliability threshold is effectively determined at a yield point for a reliability benchmark.

1124483,Investigation of the effect of corrosion on mild steel in five different environments,2014,BO Odio and EC Chinwuko and JL Chukwuneke and JE Sinebe,3,International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research,7,,,Mild Steel is one of the major construction materials used in the industries. It has a young modulus of 200GNm-2. This paper focuses on the experimental study of the corrosion behavior and mechanism for mild steel in five different media namely: 0.1 M of Hydrochloric acid. Underground (soil). Atmosphere. Salt water. Fresh water. Mild steel of diameter 1.2 cm and 8.5 cm long was used for this experiment and studied for a period of five weeks interval weighing and re-immersing. The weight losses were tabulated and analyzed graphically. It was observed that mild steel corroded in the different environments with decreasing intensity in the order of 0.1 M of Hydrochloric acid. Underground (soil). Atmosphere. Salt water. Fresh water. It was then concluded that the laboratory immersion test remains the best method of screening of metal. it remains the quickest and most economical means for providing a preliminary selection of best suited materials for engineering applications as there is no simple way to extrapolate the results obtained from this simple test to the predictions of systems service lifetime.,True,UXDnFrEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,38,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremiah_Chukwuneke/publication/266854801_Investigation_Of_The_Effect_Of_Corrosion_On_Mild_Steel_In_Five_Different_Environments/links/543da3d10cf2d6934ebcf8fe.pdf,8433401595847693858,/scholar?cites=8433401595847693858,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremiah_Chukwuneke/publication/266854801_Investigation_Of_The_Effect_Of_Corrosion_On_Mild_Steel_In_Five_Different_Environments/links/543da3d10cf2d6934ebcf8fe.pdf,0,0,0

1124489,Multi-factorial analysis of atmospheric noise pollution level based on emitted carbon and heat radiation during gas flaring,2014,CI Nwoye and SO Nwakpa and IE Nwosu and JU Odo and EC Chinwuko and NE Idenyi,2,J. Atmos. Pollut,,22-29,,This paper presents a multi-factorial analysis of atmospheric noise pollution level based on emitted carbon and heat radiation during gas flaring. An empirical model; three factorial in nature was derived. validated and used for the noise pollution level analysis. The derived model showed that the noise pollution level was basically dependent on gas flaring output parameters such as emitted carbon and heat radiation since the three occur at the same time. and also on reference distance from flare point. total associated gas and total gas produced. The validity of the model; ϑ= D Log ϕ [Log ϕ (0.0001 ζ2+ ζ)+₰]-1 was rooted on the core model expression D/ϑ≈ S ζ2+ ζ+(₰/Log ϕ) where both sides of the expression are correspondingly approximately equal. Regression model was used to generate results of noise pollution level. and its trend of distribution was compared with that from derived model as a way of verifying its validity relative to experimental results. The results of this verification translated into very close alignment of curves. dimensions of shapes and areas covered. These translated into significantly similar trend of data point’s distribution for experimental (ExD). derived model (MoD) and regression model-predicted (ReG) results. Evaluations from generated results indicated that noise pollution level per unit radiated heat & emitted carbon as obtained from experiment and derived model were 60.42 and 60.00 dBA/Kw m-2 & 4.01 x10-4 and 3.98 x10-4 dBA/ton respectively.

The current design consists primarily of the provision of modulated heat against the background of natural and artificial brooding system of brooding that is prone to fire hazard. This work therefore presents a design for a brooder that makes uses of solar as source of the required heat in the housing. The overall heat transfer coefficient of the door was determined as 3.846 W/m20C and transmission heat loss through door (Qd) results to 30.15 W. Then the heat transfer coefficient is 1.780 such that the total heat of 80.63 W is loss through the walls. Based on the results. it was recommended that if there are several chicks. the temperature can usually be a little lower as the chicks keep each other warm and single chicks have fewer options to self-regulate; In many cases the heating can be moderated once the temperature was regulated down to 21 degrees Celsius.,True,UXDnFrEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/54128603/Design_for_Temperature-Controlled_Solar_Heated_Chick_Brooder.pdf,31860887741142950,/scholar?cites=31860887741142950,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54128603/Design_for_Temperature-Controlled_Solar_Heated_Chick_Brooder.pdf,0,0,0

It is in line with the above that this research work developed a mathematical model of an evaporative cooling pad using sintered Nigerian clay. A physical model of the evaporative cooling phenomenon was developed followed by the derivation of the governing equations describing the energy and mass transfer for the clay model from the laws of conservation of continuum mechanics. A set of reasonable and appropriate as-sumptions were imposed upon the physical model. Constitutive relationships were also developed for further analysis of the developed equations. The finite element model of numerical methods was used to analyse the energy transfer governing equations which resulted in the determination of the temperature of the exposed boundary surface at any given time. t2 after the commencement of the evaporative cooling processes. In this paper. it was found out that surface temperature differences could be as much as 6?C in the first cycle of evaporative cooling with the potential of further reduction. Further. an equation for the prediction of the effectiveness of an evaporative cooling system using clay modeled cooling pads was developed. The findings in this research work can be applied in the design. construction and maintenance of evaporative coolers used to dissipate waste heat when a large amount of natural water is not readily available or if for environmental and safety reasons the large water body can no longer absorb waste heat.,True,UXDnFrEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,2,https://www.scirp.org/html/25217.html?pagespeed=noscript,8743571296233155310,/scholar?cites=8743571296233155310,,https://www.scirp.org/html/25217.html?pagespeed=noscript,0,0,0

Although a large number of scientific papers already describe the synthesis of multifunctional materials by various methods and technologies. a simple. fast and economically feasible synthesis procedure to combine all the materials in one system is still of interest.   This thesis contributes to the development of multifunctional magnetic-core materials scientifically in three parts. Firstly. the synthesis of magnetic core. i.e.. magnetite nanoparticles. was attempted using only ferrous ions (Fe2+) of various concentrations as a magnetite precursor under ambient atmosphere. It was found that the synthesized magnetite was in a non-stoichiometric state. i.e.. oxidation occurs. The introduction of Stöber silica (SiO2) layer in the form of a coreshell structure prevented the oxidation of the synthesized particles. as suggested by the low temperature magnetic measurement and Mössbauer study. Secondly. this thesis introduces a simple. room temperature synthesis method for further functionalization of the magnetite-silica coreshell powders with silver (Ag) and silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) nanoparticles. Based on the proposed approaches. the Ag deposition on the silica shells can take place by three possible mechanisms: a) absorption of Ag+ on the silica surface by ionic bonding between the silver ions and hydroxyl groups (OH) of silica followed by the reduction of Ag+ by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). b) hydrogen bonding between the PVP-coated Ag and the SiO2 shells. and c …,True,B8NLGqMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,4,https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/9019,13055818228150904446,/scholar?cites=13055818228150904446,,https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/handle/123456789/9019/isbn9789526051062.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The adsorptive potential of gypsum on the removal of phenol was investigated. The effect of gypsum loading (0.5–3 g). contact time (2.5–20 min) and solution temperature (298 to 318 K) on the removal of phenol by gypsum was studied at neutral pH. The thermodynamics of the adsorption process was also studied. The kinetic data were fitted into the pseudo-second-order. Elovich. and intraparticle diffusion models. The removal efficiency of phenol increased along with the mass of gypsum. contact time and temperature. The results of the thermodynamics study indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The change in free energy (ΔG0) was found to increase with temperature. The values of the estimated ΔG0 suggest that the phenol adsorption on gypsum is a physical adsorption process.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The major aim/investigation of this research was to fit/model and optimize the removal of Acid Blue 92 (AB92) dye from synthetic effluents (aqueous solutions) using the adsorption process based on neodymium oxide (Nd 2 O 3) nanoparticles. To optimize the adsorption conditions. central composite design (CCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM) was applied. The effects of pH (3–9). adsorbent dosage (0.1–1 g/L). initial concentration of AB92 (100–300 mg/L). and contact time (10–100 min) on the adsorption process were investigated. Apart from equilibrium and kinetic experiments. thermodynamic evaluation of the adsorption process was also undertaken. The adsorption process was found to have the best fitting to Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic equation. Also. the process was found to be spontaneous and favorable with increased temperature. The optimal conditions found were: pH= 3.15. AB92 concentration equal to 138.5 mg/L. dosage of nanoadsorbent equal to 0.83 g/L. and 50 min as contact time. which resulted in 90.70% AB92 removal. High values for the coefficient of determination. R 2 (0.9596) and adjusted R 2 (0.9220) indicated that the removal of AB92 dye using adsorption can be explained and modeled by RSM. The Fisher’s F-value (25.4683) denotes that the developed model was significant for AB92 adsorption at a 95% confidence level.,True,t7zcOA4AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,8,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/3/556,8731593652519132107,/scholar?cites=8731593652519132107,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/3/556/pdf,0,0,0

Nickel. and Chromium from Simulated Wastewater using Electrocoagulation Technique,2018,Joseph T Nwabanne and Chinenye A Igwegbe and Samson O Okpo,,,,448-1135,,Environmental pollution due to the discharge of effluents containing heavy metal is a threat to the world. The applicability of electrocoagulation technique in the effective removal of heavy metals (copper. nickel. and chromium) from simulated wastewater using iron as the sacrificial electrode was investigated. The effects of different parameters such as initial pH (2-10). electrolysis time (5-30 min). current density (0.075–0.186 A/cm2). initial ion concentration (50–250 mg/L). inter-electrode distance (3–6 cm) and temperature (30-70 oC) on the metal ions removal efficiencies were examined. Optimum pH of 8 (with removal efficiency of 99%). 10 (92%) and 7 (99%) were obtained for nickel. copper and chromium. respectively. The electrolysis time was found to increase with optimal removal occurring within the first 10min. An optimal inter-electrode distance of 3cm was obtained for copper. nickel and chromium. which gave removal efficiencies of 99%. 95%. and 98%. respectively. The removal efficiency was found to increase with solution temperature. with optimum removal occurring at 70oC. The results also showed that their removal efficiencies were increased with an increase in the current density. Maximum removal rates of 99%. 95%. and 94% were attained at the current density of 0.186 A/cm2for copper. nickel. and chromium. respectively occurring after 10 min.

University of Ilorin,Biosorbents prepared from fish scales has been used to treat wastewaters containing heavy metals. dyes and pharmaceuticals. These pollutants have been reported in effluents from pharmaceutical. textile. automotive battery and tannery industries amongst others. Biosorption is a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to other treatment technologies including the use very popular activated carbon adsorption. The aim of this review is to catalogue the progress made over the past 15 years in the utilisation of fish scales as biosorbents for the treatment of industrial effluents. Key domains are in source fish species. biosorbent preparation technique. target impurities. optimal levels of biosorption factors. equilibrium and kinetic best-fits and thermodynamic findings. The biosorbents are generally prepared by a twostage chemical pre-treatment process. It is then dried. pulverised and sieved and in some cases calcined. Fish scale biosorbents have been found to have very good adsorption capacity for heavy metals. dyes and pharmaceutical compounds and with excellent removal efficiencies (50-100% for heavy metals and 78-90% for dyes). Optimal biosorption parameters vary significantly for the different target impurities and is only consistent for pH (acidic) and temperature (30-500C). Fish scale biosorption equilibrium is always best fit to Langmuir or Freundlich isotherms with newer models having poorer coefficients of determination. Fish scale biosorption kinetics is best fit to the pseudo-second order model. The review also revealed that fish scale biosorption is generally spontaneous and endothermic (for heavy metals alone).,True,kotzojYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,20,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_O_Ighalo/publication/330737942_A_Review_of_Fish_Scales_as_a_Source_of_Biosorbent_for_the_Removal_of_Pollutants_from_Industrial_Effluents/links/5c51ab37a6fdccd6b5d4d822/A-Review-of-Fish-Scales-as-a-Source-of-Biosorbent-for-the-Removal-of-Pollutants-from-Industrial-Effluents.pdf,2080845901293776191,/scholar?cites=2080845901293776191,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_O_Ighalo/publication/330737942_A_Review_of_Fish_Scales_as_a_Source_of_Biosorbent_for_the_Removal_of_Pollutants_from_Industrial_Effluents/links/5c51ab37a6fdccd6b5d4d822/A-Review-of-Fish-Scales-as-a-Source-of-Biosorbent-for-the-Removal-of-Pollutants-from-Industrial-Effluents.pdf,0,0,0
