One model of SMA pathogenesis invokes an inappropriate persistence of normally occurring motor neuron apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis. the novel gene for neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) has been mapped to the SMA region of chromosome 5q13.1 and is homologous with baculoviral apoptosis inhibitor proteins. The two first coding exons of this gene are deleted in approximately 67% of type I SMA chromosomes compared with 2% of non-SMA chromosomes. Furthermore. RT-PCR. analysis reveals internally deleted and mutated forms of the NAIP transcript in type I SMA individuals and not in unaffected individuals.

A 45 year-old Caucasian male patient with hypertension. who received amlodipine (10 mg/day. single dose orally) for two months. sought medical attention because of the new-onset gingival enlargement. On clinical examination a generalized and firm overgrowth of the gingival throughout the maxilla and the mandible were evident. The lack of gingival inflammation and purulent discharge were other features of the clinical scenario. Histological assessment of the biopsy specimen revealed the hyperplasia of connective tissue. epithelial acanthosis. and elongated rete ridges along with few inflammatory cells. The histological and the clinical evidences were consistent with amlodipine-induced gingival hyperplasia.

Controversy exists about the effects of EMF on various organs. One of the critical issues is that EMF may adversely affect the reproductive system. In order to examine this 30 rat pups were exposed to 50 Hz EMF (non-ionising radiation) during in utero development (approximately 3 weeks) and postnatal life (5 weeks). Groups of exposed rats were subsequently left in an environment free of EMF in order to observe recovery. if any. from the changes induced by EMF on the boundary tissue of the seminiferous tubules. The materials were processed and observed under a light and a transmission electron microscope. In the experimental rats boundary tissue was found disrupted at various layers. This tissue showed infoldings. which were perhaps due to the loss of collagen and reticular fibrils from the inner and outer non-cellular layers. The outer non-cellular layer. which was thinner than that of the control. was stripped away from the myoid cell layer in multiple regions. giving a “blister-like” appearance. The myoid cells showed fewer polyribosomes. pinocytotic vesicles and glycogen granules. Most mitochondria were found to lack cristae. The connections between individual myoid cells were apparently lost. There were signs of recovery in the boundary tissue following withdrawal from EMF exposure. These results suggest that EMF exposure may cause profound changes in the boundary tissue of the seminiferous tubules. Therefore exposure to EMF may result in pathological changes that lead …,True,NK_HhEEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,66,https://journals.viamedica.pl/folia_morphologica/article/view/16081,11863502755812198867,/scholar?cites=11863502755812198867,,https://journals.viamedica.pl/folia_morphologica/article/download/16081/12719,0,0,0

1028864,The hypothesis of ‘biophysical matrix contraction’: wound contraction revisited,2008,Ramin Mostofizadeh Farahani and Luther C Kloth,5,,3,477-482,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Wound contraction is an orchestrated phenomenon that contributes to closure of wounds that heal by secondary intention. However. excessive and premature contraction results in scarring. Although the exact mechanism of contraction is unknown. the wound closure process is accompanied by and followed by changes in the physical and mechanical properties of the wound and periwound tissues during the biological transformation. Transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) induces a contractile phenotype in the cellular–extracellular matrix. Meanwhile. various external and internal mechanical stresses lead to microdeformations of the wound milieu with resultant upregulation of TGF‐β. Furthermore. the mechanical strain exerted on collagen fibres and other piezoelectric tissues leads to development of piezoelectric current in the wound site. which acts synergistically with TGF‐β.

1028865,Study of root canal accessibility in human primary molars,2008,Naser A Aminabadi and Ramin MZ Farahani and Esrafil B Gajan,50,Journal of oral science,1,69-74,Nihon University School of Dentistry,The aim of the present study was to provide a general scheme for pulpectomy of primary molars that may be useful for decision-making about negotiation of root canals and selection of appropriate instruments. A total of 160 vital primary molars in 85 patients (40 males. 45 females) aged 4-6 years were selected. After taking primary radiographs. local anesthesia was induced. and the teeth were isolated using a rubber dam. Canal accessibility index (CAI) and tooth accessibility index (TAI) were calculated according to initial file size. Mandibular first molars had either three canals (79.2%) or four canals (20.8%). and all second molars had four canals. Maxillary first molars had three canals and second molars had either three canals (70.9%) or four canals (29.1%). Lower accessibility of the mandibular first molar distobuccal root accounted for the lower accessibility of these teeth in comparison with mandibular second molars. While three-canal maxillary second molars were more accessible due to the lower accessibility of the distobuccal canal of the maxillary first molar. poor accessibility of the distal canal in four-canal second molars was responsible for the difficult accessibility of these teeth. In conclusion. it seems that the accessibility of a single canal in each tooth determines the difficulty of accessibility for any given tooth. Moreover. while primary second molars are more accessible than first molars. all of them are negotiable.(J.

However. ambiguity still exists in regard to their anatomical locations. identities. functions. and extent of their differentiative abilities. One of the major impediments in the quest of the MSC research has been lack of appropriate in vivo markers. In recent years. this obstacle has been resolved to some degree as PDGFRα emerges as an important mesenchymal stem cell marker. Accumulating lines of evidence are showing that the PDGFRα+ cells reside in the perivascular locations of many adult interstitium and fulfil the classic concepts of MSCs in vitro and in vivo.

1028867,Decomposing health: tolerance and resistance to parasites in animals,2009,Lars Råberg and Andrea L Graham and Andrew F Read,364,,1513,37-49,The Royal Society,Plant biologists have long recognized that host defence against parasites and pathogens can be divided into two conceptually different components: the ability to limit parasite burden (resistance) and the ability to limit the harm caused by a given burden (tolerance). Together these two components determine how well a host is protected against the effects of parasitism. This distinction is useful because it recognizes that hosts that are best at controlling parasite burdens are not necessarily the healthiest. Moreover. resistance and tolerance can be expected to have different effects on the epidemiology of infectious diseases and host–parasite coevolution. However. studies of defence in animals have to date focused on resistance. whereas the possibility of tolerance and its implications have been largely overlooked.

Animals typically exhibit considerable genetic variation for resistance (the ability to limit parasite burden). However. little is known about whether animals can evolve tolerance (the ability to limit the damage caused by a given parasite burden). Using rodent malaria in laboratory mice as a model system and the statistical framework developed by plant-pathogen biologists. we demonstrated genetic variation for tolerance. as measured by the extent to which anemia and weight loss increased with increasing parasite burden. Moreover. resistance and tolerance were negatively genetically correlated.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1406,1637-1641,The Royal Society,We approach the field of stress immunology from an ecological point of view and ask: why should a heavy physical workload. for example as a result of a high reproductive effort. compromise immune function? We argue that immunosuppression by neuroendocrine mechanisms. such as stress hormones. during heavy physical workload is adaptive. and consider two different ultimate explanations of such immunosuppression. First. several authors have suggested that the immune system is suppressed to reallocate resources to other metabolic demands. In our view. this hypothesis assumes that considerable amounts of energy or nutrients can be saved by suppressing the immune system; however. this assumption requires further investigation.

Recently. there has been much interest in physiological trade‐offs between parasite resistance and fitness‐related traits such as secondary sexual characters or reproductive effort.

The vertebrate immune system is by far the best studied example of an inducible defence. yet little is known about the costs of an immune response. especially in natural populations. To test if an immune response per se is costly. we induced an antibody response in female blue tits. Parus caeruleus. by immunising them with human diphtheria–tetanus vaccine. and compared their nestling‐feeding rate with that of saline‐injected controls.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and the autonomic nervous system are recognized as primary effector systems which serve to minimize excursions from the homeostatic state and to restore a relative equilibrium in response to disturbances (3. 4). Many of the physiological adjustments accompanying sympathetic activation complement those brought about by glucocorticoid secretion. Indeed. the responsiveness and physiological consequences of activation of these two systems are so inter-twined as to have generated the hypothesis that activation of the HPA is evoked by sympathoadrenomedullary activation (5. 6).

The expression of leptin receptor and. in some species. leptin. in the placenta suggests a role for leptin in placental development. but this role has not been elucidated. Leptin is required at the time of embryo implantation in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse and has been shown to upregulate expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). enzymes involved in trophoblast invasion. in cultured human trophoblast cells.

We illustrate this using a conceptual example in which the optimal level of PAPs depends on predation. parasitism and host compensation (resistance and tolerance) of parasitism’s negative effects.

Phagocytes participate in this phenomenon by secreting various proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes.  Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as gelatinases are produced by phagocytes and are thought to play  an important role in processes of cell transmigration and tissue remodeling. In this work. we show that  endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and other inflammatory mediators. such as tumor necrosis factor  (TNF). interleukin-8. and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. induce a rapid (within 20 min) release of  gelatinase-B (MMP-9) zymogen in whole human blood. as determined by gelatin zymography.

Cell culture and thymidine incorporation assay showed that addition of GSH enhanced the effect of IL-2 on the proliferation and thymidine incorporation of IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cells such as CTLL-2 and CT-4R. Treatment of the cells with GSH resulted in a 2-fold increase in the amount of IL-2 bound to the cells and a rapid internalization of the bound IL-2. In addition. the degradation of IL-2 in the cells was enhanced by GSH treatment. These effects of GSH were accompanied by an increase in the intracellular GSH level. L-Buthionine-(S.

After activation. human B cells can undergo proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells in response to soluble factors released by T lymphocytes. Factors that promote B cell proliferation are generally referred to as B cell grown factors (BCGF). and for some years they had been considered to be distinct from interleukin 2 (IL2). More recently. however. both immunoaffinity-purified and recombinant IL 2 (rIL 2) were shown to act as a potent BCGF. Moreover. activated B cells have been shown to express receptors for IL 2 indistinguishable from those of activated T cells. Although BCGF activity may be largely related to IL 2. several experimental evidences indicate that molecules distinct from IL 2 may act as BCGF. In this report. we show that recombinant interferon-γ (rIFN-γ) promotes proliferation of anti-μ-activated human B lymphocytes. Moreover. a synergistic effect was observed when IL 2 was simultaneously added to cultures. Because the B cell proliferation induced by crude polyclonal supernatants was strongly reduced by the simultaneous addition of monoclonal antibodies to IL 2 receptors or to IFN-γ. it is likely that IL 2 and IFN-γ at least partially account for the T cell-derived BCGF activity.,True,nj5EERYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,103,https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/b-cell-growth-factor-activity-of-interferon-%CE%B3-recombinant-human-i,2247157953834651097,/scholar?cites=2247157953834651097,,https://www.jimmunol.org/content/jimmunol/136/10/3513.full.pdf,0,0,0

1028930,Hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia: dynamics of adipose tissue growth,2009,Junghyo Jo and Oksana Gavrilova and Stephanie Pack and William Jou and Shawn Mullen and Anne E Sumner and Samuel W Cushman and Vipul Periwal,5,PLoS Comput Biol,3,e1000324,Public Library of Science,Adipose tissue grows by two mechanisms: hyperplasia (cell number increase) and hypertrophy (cell size increase). Genetics and diet affect the relative contributions of these two mechanisms to the growth of adipose tissue in obesity. In this study. the size distributions of epididymal adipose cells from two mouse strains. obesity-resistant FVB/N and obesity-prone C57BL/6. were measured after 2. 4. and 12 weeks under regular and high-fat feeding conditions. The total cell number in the epididymal fat pad was estimated from the fat pad mass and the normalized cell-size distribution. The cell number and volume-weighted mean cell size increase as a function of fat pad mass. To address adipose tissue growth precisely. we developed a mathematical model describing the evolution of the adipose cell-size distributions as a function of the increasing fat pad mass. instead of the increasing chronological time. Our model describes the recruitment of new adipose cells and their subsequent development in different strains. and with different diet regimens. with common mechanisms. but with diet- and genetics-dependent model parameters. Compared to the FVB/N strain. the C57BL/6 strain has greater recruitment of small adipose cells. Hyperplasia is enhanced by high-fat diet in a strain-dependent way. suggesting a synergistic interaction between genetics and diet. Moreover. high-fat feeding increases the rate of adipose cell size growth. independent of strain. reflecting the increase in calories requiring storage. Additionally. high-fat diet leads to a dramatic spreading of the size distribution of adipose cells in both strains; this implies an increase in size …,True,IW8OuDcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,619,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000324,12792353098991416567,/scholar?cites=12792353098991416567,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000324,0,0,0

To fill gaps in our understanding. regional differences in the adult human pancreas were quantitatively analyzed including the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cadaveric pancreas specimens were collected from the head. body and tail regions of each donor. including subjects with no history of diabetes or pancreatic diseases (n = 23) as well as patients with T2D (n = 12). The study further included individuals from whom islets were isolated (n = 7) to study islet yield and function in a clinical setting of islet transplantation. The whole pancreatic sections were examined using an innovative large-scale image capture and unbiased detailed quantitative analyses of the characteristics of islets from each individual (architecture. size. shape and distribution). Islet distribution/density is similar between the head and body regions. but is >2-fold higher in the tail region. In contrast to rodents. islet cellular composition and architecture were similar throughout the pancreas and there was no difference in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets isolated from different regions of the pancreas. Further studies revealed preferential loss of large islets in the head region in patients with T2D.

It is pointed out that a complete model of shock acceleration including a number of considered effects has yet to be given.

In this study. we quantitatively examined pathological changes of the pancreas in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Specifically. we tested a hypothesis that changes in endocrine cell mass and composition are islet-size dependent. A large-scale analysis of cadaveric pancreatic sections from T2D patients (n = 12) and non-diabetic subjects (n = 14) was carried out combined with semi-automated analysis to quantify changes in islet architecture. The method provided the representative islet distribution in the whole pancreas section that allowed us to examine details of endocrine cell composition in individual islets. We observed a preferential loss of large islets (>60 µm in diameter) in T2D patients compared to non-diabetic subjects. Analysis of islet cell composition revealed that the beta-cell fraction in large islets was decreased in T2D patients. This change was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in alpha-cell fraction. however total alpha-cell area was decreased along with beta-cells in T2D. Delta-cell fraction and area remained unchanged. The computer-assisted quantification of morphological changes in islet structure minimizes sampling bias. Significant beta-cell loss was observed in large islets in T2D. in which alpha-cell ratio reciprocally increased. However. there was no alpha-cell expansion and the total alpha-cell area was also decreased. Changes in islet architecture were marked in large islets.

We treat systems biology as the quantitative study of biological systems. aided (or hindered) by technological advances that both permit molecular observations on far more inclusive scales than possible even 15 years ago. and permit computational analysis of such observations. Thus. for the purposes of this book. systems biology is the promise of biology on a larger and quantitatively rigorous scale. a marriage of molecular biology and physiology. Concretely. this defines the focus of the book: data-centric quantitative modeling of biological processes and systems.Biology is an experimentally driven science simply because evolutionary processes are not understood well enough to allow theoretical advances to rest on terra firma. Systems biology is experimentally driven. computationally driven. and knowledge driven. It is experimentally driven because the complexity of biological systems is difficult to penetrate without large-scale coverage of the molecular underpinnings; it is computationally driven because the data obtained from experimental investigations of complex systems need extensive quantitative analysis to be informative; and it is knowledge driven because it is not computationally feasible to analyze the data without incorporating all that is already known about the biology in question.

The proposed method is unsupervised and consists of two steps. During the first step the pixels of a learning set are summarized by a set of codebook vectors using a Probabilistic Self-Organizing Map (PSOM. Statistique et méthodes neuronales. Dunod. Paris. 1997). In a second step the codebook vectors of the map are clustered using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC. Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. 1996). Each pixel takes the label of its nearest codebook vector.

In numerous applications the rapid increase of data size over time makes classical clustering algorithms too slow because of the high computational cost. In such situations online clustering algorithms are an efficient alternative to classical batch algorithms. We present an original online algorithm for graph clustering based on a Erdős–Rényi graph mixture. The relevance of the algorithm is illustrated. using both simulated and real data sets.

1028992,Clustering of spatial data by the EM algorithm,1997,Christophe Ambroise and Mo Dang and Gérard Govaert,,,,493-504,Springer. Dordrecht,A clustering algorithm for spatial data is presented. It seeks a fuzzy partition which is optimal according to a criterion interpretable as a penalized likelihood. We propose to penalize the energy function exhibited by Hathaway (1986) with a term taking into account spatial contiguity constraints. The structure of the EM algorithm may be used to maximize the proposed criterion. The Maximization step is then unchanged and the Expectation step becomes iterative. The efficiency of the new clustering algorithm has been tested with biological images and compared with other clustering techniques.,True,t2SxgaEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,111,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-1675-8_40,10009017841429207425,/scholar?cites=10009017841429207425,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Van_Mo_Dang/publication/2484207_Clustering_of_Spatial_Databythe_EM_Algorithm/links/555c37df08ae8f66f3ade672.pdf,0,0,0

(1996) have proposed a clustering algorithm that is well-suited for dealing with spatial data. This algorithm. derived from the EM algorithm (Dempster et al.. 1977). has been designed for penalized likelihood estimation in situations with unobserved class labels. Some very satisfactory empirical results lead us to believe that this algorithm converges (Ambroise et al.. 1996). However. this convergence has not been proven theoretically. In this paper. we present sufficient conditions and proof of the convergence.

Recently. this tool has received a high interest for the discovery of biological networks. The literature focuses on the case where a single network is inferred from a set of measurements. But. as wetlab data is typically scarce. several assays. where the experimental conditions affect interactions. are usually merged to infer a single network. In this paper. we propose two approaches for estimating multiple related graphs. by rendering the closeness assumption into an empirical prior or group penalties.

The interactions naturally define a graph. and a common way of exploring and summarizing such datasets is graph clustering. Most techniques for clustering graph vertices use only the topology of connections. while ignoring information about the vertices’ features. In this paper we provide a clustering algorithm that harnesses both types of data. based on a statistical model with a latent structure characterizing each vertex both by a vector of features and by its connectivity.

T. gondii differs substantially in its broad distribution from closely related parasites that typically have narrow. specialized host ranges. To elucidate the genetic basis for these differences. we compared the genomes of 62 globally distributed T. gondii isolates to several closely related coccidian parasites. Our findings reveal that tandem amplification and diversification of secretory pathogenesis determinants is the primary feature that distinguishes the closely related genomes of these biologically diverse parasites.

New analytical approaches. such as DNA barcoding have been promoted as a way to reduce monitoring costs and improve efficiency. yet this assumption has not been thoroughly evaluated. We address this question by comparing costs for traditional morphology-based bioassessment. the standard Sanger sequencing-based DNA barcoding approach. and emerging next-generation (NGS) molecular methods. Market demand for molecular approaches is also assessed through a survey of the level of freshwater bioassessment effort in the United States across multiple habitat types (lakes. streams. wetlands) and indicators (benthic invertebrates. fish. algae). All state and regional level programs administered by public agencies and reported via agency web sites were included in the survey. Costs were based on surveys of labs and programs willing to provide such information. More than 19.500 sites are sampled annually across the United States. with the majority of effort occurring in streams. Benthic invertebrates are the most commonly used indicator. but algae and fish comprise between 35% and 21% of total sampling effort. respectively. We estimate that between $104 and $193 million is spent annually on routine freshwater bioassessment in the United States.

Immunization with sporozoites. which was conducted under chloroquine treatment to minimize the influence of blood stage parasites. induced a strong protection against a subsequent sporozoite and. to a lesser extent. against infected RBC challenges. The protection induced by this immunization protocol proved to be very effective. Induction of this protective immunity depended on the presence of liver stage parasites. as primaquine treatment concurrent with sporozoite immunization abrogated protection.

Colonization of the host plant is initiated by direct penetration of cuticle and cell wall of maize epidermis cells. The invading hyphae are surrounded by the plant plasma membrane and proliferate within the plant tissue. We identified a novel secreted protein. termed Pep1. that is essential for penetration. Disruption mutants of pep1 are not affected in saprophytic growth and develop normal infection structures. However. Δpep1 mutants arrest during penetration of the epidermal cell and elicit a strong plant defense response. Using Affymetrix maize arrays. we identified 116 plant genes which are differentially regulated in Δpep1 compared to wild type infections. Most of these genes are related to plant defense. By in vivo immunolocalization. live-cell imaging and plasmolysis approaches. we detected Pep1 in the apoplastic space as well as its accumulation at sites of cell-to-cell passages. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two of the four cysteine residues in Pep1 as essential for function. suggesting that the formation of disulfide bridges is crucial for proper protein folding. The barley covered smut fungus Ustilago hordei contains an ortholog of pep1 which is needed for penetration of barley and which is able to complement the U. maydis Δpep1 mutant.

This interaction requires efficient suppression of plant immune responses. which is attributed to secreted effector proteins. Previously we identified Pep1 (Protein essential during penetration-1) as a secreted effector with an essential role for U. maydis virulence. pep1 deletion mutants induce strong defense responses leading to an early block in pathogenic development of the fungus. Using cytological and functional assays we show that Pep1 functions as an inhibitor of plant peroxidases. At sites of Δpep1 mutant penetrations. H2O2 strongly accumulated in the cell walls. coinciding with a transcriptional induction of the secreted maize peroxidase POX12. Pep1 protein effectively inhibited the peroxidase driven oxidative burst and thereby suppresses the early immune responses of maize. Moreover. Pep1 directly inhibits peroxidases in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Using fluorescence complementation assays. we observed a direct interaction of Pep1 and the maize peroxidase POX12 in vivo. Functional relevance of this interaction was demonstrated by partial complementation of the Δpep1 mutant defect by virus induced gene silencing of maize POX12.

Deletion mutants for pit2 successfully penetrate host cells but elicit various defense responses. which stops further fungal proliferation. We now show that Pit2 functions as an inhibitor of a set of apoplastic maize cysteine proteases. whose activity is directly linked with salicylic-acid-associated plant defenses. Consequently. protease inhibition by Pit2 is required for U. maydis virulence. Sequence comparisons with Pit2 orthologs from related smut fungi identified a conserved sequence motif. Mutation of this sequence caused loss of Pit2 function. Consequently. expression of the mutated protein in U. maydis could not restore virulence of the pit2 deletion mutant. indicating that the protease inhibition by Pit2 is essential for fungal virulence.

Based on transcriptional upregulation during biotrophic development we identified the pit (proteins important for tumours) cluster. a novel gene cluster comprising four genes of which two are predicted to encode secreted effectors. Disruption of the gene cluster abolishes U. maydis‐induced tumour formation and this phenotype can be caused by deleting either pit1 encoding a transmembrane protein or pit2 encoding a secreted protein. Pit1 localizes to the fungal plasma membrane at hyphal tips. endosomes and vacuoles while Pit2 is secreted to the biotrophic interface.

The mechanism of c-Raf activation upon stimulation of cell-surface receptors is not clear. but there seem to exist multiple pathways of activation which involve tyrosine and/or serine phosphorylation of the c-Raf protein in vivo. The activated state of Raf is reflected in an increased apparent molecular weight of the Raf protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels owing to hyperphosphorylation. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) is one of the agents able to induce this hyperphosphorylation of Raf in vivo. suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in the activation of c-Raf in particular situations. Using recombinant baculoviruses expressing PKC and Raf polypeptides. we show here that conventional PKC types (alpha. beta. gamma) but not novel types (delta. zeta. eta) or the unrelated Mos kinase are able to activate c-Raf in a TPA-dependent manner upon coexpression in insect cells. Direct phosphorylation of the Raf protein with PKC in vitro also enhanced the kinase activity of c-Raf. suggesting that c-Raf acts immediately downstream of PKC in a protein kinase cascade which is triggered by TPA and may lead to transcriptional activation of TPA-inducible genes and tumor promotion.,True,Yzr_DCgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,352,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1437148,8328685906911152263,/scholar?cites=8328685906911152263,,,0,0,0

Smoking and chronic nicotine treatment stimulate basal acid output which is more pronounced in the smokers having duodenal ulcer. This increased gastric acid secretion is mediated through the stimulation of H2-receptor by histamine released after mast cell degranulation and due to the increase of the functional parietal cell volume or secretory capacity in smokers. Smoking and nicotine stimulate pepsinogen secretion also by increasing chief cell number or with an enhancement of their secretory capacity. Long-term nicotine treatment in rats also significantly decreases total mucus neck cell population and neck-cell mucus volume.

Such environmental cycles in biotic (e.g. food availability and predation risk) or abiotic (e.g. temperature and light) factors may occur on a daily. annual or tidal time scale. Internal timing mechanisms may facilitate behavioural or physiological adaptation to such changes in environmental conditions. These timing mechanisms commonly involve an internal molecular oscillator (a ‘clock’) that is synchronized (‘entrained’) to the environmental cycle by receptor mechanisms responding to relevant environmental signals (‘Zeitgeber’. i.e. German for time-giver). To understand the evolution of such timing mechanisms. we have to understand the mechanisms leading to selective advantage.

Walls described the concept of a ‘nocturnal bottleneck’ in placental mammals. where these species could survive only by avoiding daytime activity during times in which dinosaurs were the dominant taxon. Walls based this concept of a longer episode of nocturnality in early eutherian mammals by comparing the visual systems of reptiles. birds and all three extant taxa of the mammalian lineage. namely the monotremes. marsupials (now included in the metatherians) and placentals (included in the eutherians). This review describes the status of what has become known as the nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis. giving an overview of the chronobiological patterns of activity. We review the ecological plausibility that the activity patterns of (early) eutherian mammals were restricted to the night. based on arguments relating to endothermia. energy balance. foraging and predation. taking into account recent …,True,cIBCrzcAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,162,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2013.0508,1355698321217181396,/scholar?cites=1355698321217181396,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2013.0508,0,0,0

Several studies made clear that circadian (daily) fluctuations in acetylcholine (ACh) release. cholinergic enzyme activity and cholinergic receptor expression varies remarkably between species and even strains. Apparently. cholinergic features can be flexibly adjusted to the needs of a species or strain. Nevertheless. it can be generalized that circadian rhythmicity in the cholinergic system is characterized by high ACh release during the active phase of an individual. During the active phase. the activity of the ACh synthesizing enzyme Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT) is enhanced. and the activity of the ACh degrading enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is reduced.

Position of the sun. weather conditions. shades. and behavioral variations (eye closure. burrowing) all modulate the light signal reaching the pacemaker. A simple model of a circadian pacemaker allows researchers to explore the impact of these factors on pacemaker accuracy. Accuracy is operationally defined as the reciprocal value of the day-to-day standard deviation of the clock times at which a reference phase (0) is reached. For the purpose of this exploration. the authors used a model pacemaker characterized solely by its momentary phase and momentary velocity.

Studying simple. genetically tractable organisms. such as Drosophila melanogaster. can illuminate principles of neural circuit organization and function.

Previous studies suggested that neurotransmission from MB neurons is only required for memory retrieval. Our unexpected observation that Dorsal Paired Medial (DPM) neurons. which project only to MB neurons. are required during memory storage but not during acquisition or retrieval. led us to revisit the role of MB neurons in memory processing.

Although the mutant SOD1 is toxic. the wild‐type SOD1 performs important functions. Therefore. the ideal therapeutic strategy should be to selectively inhibit the mutant. but not the wild‐type SOD1 expression.

Here we show that starvation in Drosophila potently suppresses sleep. suggesting that these two homeostatically regulated behaviors are also integrated in flies. The sleep-suppressing effect of starvation is independent of the mushroom bodies. a previously identified sleep locus in the fly brain. and therefore is regulated by distinct neural circuitry. The circadian clock genes Clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc) are critical for proper sleep suppression during starvation.

Imaging the activity in the processes of DPM neurons revealed that the neurons respond when the fly is stimulated with electric shock or with any odor that was tested. Pairing odor and electric-shock stimulation increases odor-evoked calcium signals and synaptic release from DPM neurons. These memory traces form in only one of the two branches of the DPM neuron process. Moreover. trace formation requires the expression of the wild-type amnesiac gene in the DPM neurons.

The ability to perceive and react to tissue-damaging stimuli is essential in order to maintain bodily integrity in the face of environmental danger. To prevent damage the systems that detect noxious stimuli are therefore under strict evolutionary pressure. We developed a high-throughput behavioral method to identify genes contributing to thermal nociception in the fruit fly and have reported a large-scale screen that identified the Ca2+ channel straightjacket (stj) as a conserved regulator of thermal nociception. Here we present the minimal anatomical and neuronal requirements for Drosophila to avoid noxious heat in our novel behavioral paradigm. Bioinformatics analysis of our whole genome data set revealed 23 genes implicated in Ca2+ signaling that are required for noxious heat avoidance. One of these genes. the conserved thermoreceptor TrpA1. was confirmed as a bona fide “pain” gene in both adult and larval fly nociception paradigms.

However. an underlying assumption is that the primers used in these studies are universal for the prokaryotic or eukaryotic groups of interest. Full primer universality is difficult or impossible to achieve and studies using different primer sets make biodiversity comparisons problematic. The aim of this study was to design and optimize universal eukaryotic primers that could be used as a standard in future biodiversity studies. Using the alignment of all eukaryotic sequences from the publicly available SILVA database. we generated a full characterization of variable versus conserved regions in the 18S rRNA gene. All variable regions within this gene were analyzed and our results suggested that the V2. V4 and V9 regions were best suited for biodiversity assessments.

Its very short life cycle (4 days at 20 C. 2 days at 29 C) and high female fecundity (300 oocytes on average) offer incomparable perspectives for genetic analysis among nonvertebrate chordates. Here. we show that Oikopleura dioica is also attractive for genome-based studies. because of unusually high gene density and gene compaction. Flow cytometry comparison of sperm DNA content between Oikopleura and the ascidian Ciona intestinalis yielded a value of 72 13 Mb for the Oikopleura genome. In a large-scale shotgun sequencing. 128.386 short reads were assembled in 43.990 nonredundant contigs representing a total of 32.6 Mb. These data. treated with an existing model (3). suggest a minimal genome size of 51 Mb. The shotgun data set also accurately matched. on average. 50% of the length of 113 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). leading to a third estimation of 65 Mb.

The light is due to the oxidation of luciferin. an imidazopyrazine compound. by molecular oxygen. catalyzed by luciferase. The mechanism of the reaction has been studied extensively and the 60 kcal/mol required for the blue emission have been shown to be derived from the oxidation of luciferin via a dioxetanone intermediate. in which the excited state oxyluciferin bound to luciferase is the emitter. However. only limited information is available regarding the properties of the enzyme.

Within metazoans. only nematodes are known to process polycistronic pre-mRNAs. produced from operon units of transcription. into mature monocistronic mRNAs via an SL RNA trans-splicing mechanism. Here we demonstrate that a chordate with a highly compact genome. Oikopleura dioica. now joins Caenorhabditis elegans in coupling trans splicing with processing of polycistronic transcipts. We identified a single SL RNA which associates with Sm proteins and has a trimethyl guanosine cap structure reminiscent of spliceosomal snRNPs.

In mammalian embryos. however. a model of threshold nucleocytoplasmic ratios does not seem to apply. as beginning with the 1‐cell stage. there are regulated cell cycles with the expression of zygotic transcripts during the cleavage period.

Because DNA in sediments may be preserved on long timescales. ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is suggested to be a proxy for the active fraction of a microbial community in the subsurface. During an investigation of eukaryotic 18S rRNA by amplicon pyrosequencing. unique profiles of Fungi were found across a range of marine subsurface provinces including ridge flanks. continental margins. and abyssal plains. Subseafloor fungal populations exhibit statistically significant correlations with total organic carbon (TOC). nitrate. sulfide. and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). These correlations are supported by terminal restriction length polymorphism (TRFLP) analyses of fungal rRNA. Geochemical correlations with fungal pyrosequencing and TRFLP data from this geographically broad sample set suggests environmental selection of active Fungi in the marine subsurface.

This is the so-called capital crunch hypothesis.

An answer from the extraxial-axial theory,2000,Bruno David and Bertrand Lefebvre and Rich Mooi and Ronald Parsley,26,,4,529-555,The Paleontological Society,Homalozoans include four classes of non-pentamerous Paleozoic echinoderms: Homostelea (cinctans). Ctenocystoidea (ctenoid-bearing homalozoans). Homoiostelea (solutes). and Stylophora (cornutes and mitrates). Their atypical morphologies have historically made it difficult to relate them to other classes. Therefore. their systematic positions have been represented by two hypotheses (H): as stem taxa to echinoderms (H1) or as stem taxa to chordates (H2). These conclusions rest on previous inability to recognize synapomorphies with more crownward echinoderms. resulting in a forcing of the homalozoans down the phylogenetic tree that is more artifactual than evolutionary. The Extraxial-Axial Theory (EAT) identifies body-wall homologies. common ontogenetic patterns. and major events in bodyplan evolution.

1029232,Skeletal homologies of echinoderms,1997,Rich Mooi and Bruno David,3,The Paleontological Society Papers,,305-335,Cambridge University Press,The impressive array of disparity within the Echinodermata can be explained by the interplay of components (particularly skeletal elements) making up two major body wall regions: axial and extraxial. Axial skeleton comprises paired plate columns of the ambulacra. formed according to the Ocular Plate Rule (OPR) and in association with the water vascular system. Extraxial skeleton (subdivided into two subtypes: perforate and imperforate) is not formed according to the OPR. and new elements can be added anywhere and at any time within extraxial body wall. Recent work on early development of echinoderms reveals that axial skeleton is formed as an integral part of the rudiment. but that extraxial skeleton is derived from the non-rudiment part of the larval body.

Recent in situ and laboratory observations indicate that cidaroid sea urchins feed on live stalked crinoids. leaving distinct bite marks on their skeletal elements. Similar bite marks on fossil crinoids from Poland strongly suggest that these animals have been subject to echinoid predation since the Triassic. Following their near-demise during the end-Permian extinction. crinoids underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the Middle–Late Triassic that produced distinct morphological and behavioral novelties. particularly motile taxa that contrasted strongly with the predominantly sessile Paleozoic crinoid faunas.

These explanations are divided between those involving adaptation to current conditions in this cold-water environment. selecting for nonpelagic larval development. and those involving vicariant events that either exterminated a high proportion of species with pelagic development (the extinction hypothesis) or enhanced speciation in taxa that already had nonpelagic development. In the latter case. glacial maxima over the Antarctic Continental Shelf in the Pliocene/Pleistocene glacial cycles could have created refuges where speciation occurred (the ACS hypothesis). or the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current passing through Drake Passage for over 30 million years could have transported species with nonpelagic development to new habitats to create new species (the ACC hypothesis). We examine the distribution and phylogenetic history of echinoderms and crustaceans in the Southern Ocean to evaluate these different explanations. We could find little or no evidence that nonpelagic development is a direct adaptation to conditions in the Southern Ocean. Some evidence supports the three vicariant hypotheses. with the ACC hypothesis perhaps the best predictor of observed patterns. both the unusual number of species with nonpelagic development and the notably high biodiversity found in the Southern Ocean.,True,KDxqxAIAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC,100,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/6821/13_Pearse_pg181-196_Poles.pdf,8659072993165534289,/scholar?cites=8659072993165534289,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/6821/13_Pearse_pg181-196_Poles.pdf,0,0,0

Analysing the effects of human disturbance on wildlife from a predator–prey perspective is also of conservation interest. because individual behavioural responses to the perceived risk of predation may ultimately influence population distribution and demography. The Scandinavian brown bear population provides a good model to study the interactions between an expanding large carnivore population. and people who use forests extensively for professional and recreational activities. We experimentally approached 52 GPS‐collared brown bears (293 approaches on foot) from 2006 to 2011. to document the reaction of bears and quantify the effect of disturbance on bear movements.

Whether such behavioral plasticity is due to environmental or anthropogenic factors has not yet been fully clarified. Beyond large carnivore conservation and management. understanding behavioral changes in the movement patterns of these elusive species may prove useful to evaluate anthropogenic influences on ecosystems.

We found that the major vitamin A metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid induces histone acetylation at the FoxP3 gene promoter and expression of the FoxP3 protein in CD4+ T cells. The induction of retinoid-induced FoxP3+ T cells is mediated by the nuclear retinoic acid receptor α and involves T cell activation driven by mucosal dendritic cells and costimulation through CD28. Retinoic acid can promote TGF-β1-dependent generation of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells but decrease the TGF-β1- and IL-6-dependent generation of inflammatory Th17 cells in mouse T cells.

Called Gobero. this suite of closely spaced sites chronicles the rapid pace of biosocial change in the southern Sahara in response to severe climatic fluctuation.  Methodology/Principal Findings Two main occupational phases are identified that correspond with humid intervals in the early and mid-Holocene. based on 78 direct AMS radiocarbon dates on human remains. fauna and artifacts. as well as 9 OSL dates on paleodune sand. The older occupants have craniofacial dimensions that demonstrate similarities with mid-Holocene occupants of the southern Sahara and Late Pleistocene to early Holocene inhabitants of the Maghreb. Their hyperflexed burials compose the earliest cemetery in the Sahara dating to ∼7500 B.C.E. These early occupants abandon the area under arid conditions and. when humid conditions return ∼4600 B.C.E.. are replaced by a more gracile people with elaborated grave goods including animal bone and ivory ornaments.  Conclusions/Significance The principal significance of Gobero lies in its extraordinary human. faunal. and archaeological record. from which we conclude the following:   The early Holocene occupants at Gobero (7700–6200 B.C.E.) were largely sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherers with lakeside funerary sites that include the earliest recorded cemetery in the Sahara.

Lake Albano sequence spans the interval from OIS 2 to the present time. while that from the Lake Nemi provides a detailed record of the Holocene. The longest of the Central Adriatic cores probably extends back to before the last glacial maximum. though the precise age of the base of the sequence is unknown. Two other core sequences span the Lateglacial and Holocene. while the fourth provides a high-resolution record of the mid-to late-Holocene. The results are compared with the recently-published pollen-stratigraphic data from Lago Grande di Monticchio (Watts et al. 1996) and also with a number of other published pollen records obtained from sites in Italy and adjacent marine basins. It is shown that the new pollen data are not only internally consistent. but also show strong resemblances to previously-published pollen records from both terrestrial and marine sites. Pollen stratigraphy thus provides a basis for the correlation and relative dating of lake and marine sequences. For these purposes. a number of very clear pollen-stratigraphic ‘marker’horizons can be recognised. These include (i) a series of very abrupt fluctuations in pollen concentrations during the last (Würm) glacial maximum.(ii) the expansion of deciduous trees at the onset of the Lateglacial period.(iii) the revertance to steppic plant associations during the Younger Dryas cold oscillation.(iv) the marked expansion of a number of tree types at the …,True,0uG7uRoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,128,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Maria_Mercuri/publication/285746187_Pollen_stratigraphy_of_sediment_sequences_from_lakes_Albano_and_Nemi_near_Rome_and_from_the_central_Adriatic_spanning_the_interval_from_oxygen_isotope_Stage_2_to_the_present_day/links/56d5a87308ae5c281ca44f6d/Pollen-stratigraphy-of-sediment-sequences-from-lakes-Albano-and-Nemi-near-Rome-and-from-the-central-Adriatic-spanning-the-interval-from-oxygen-isotope-Stage-2-to-the-present-day.pdf,937040596497298556,/scholar?cites=937040596497298556,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Maria_Mercuri/publication/285746187_Pollen_stratigraphy_of_sediment_sequences_from_lakes_Albano_and_Nemi_near_Rome_and_from_the_central_Adriatic_spanning_the_interval_from_oxygen_isotope_Stage_2_to_the_present_day/links/56d5a87308ae5c281ca44f6d/Pollen-stratigraphy-of-sediment-sequences-from-lakes-Albano-and-Nemi-near-Rome-and-from-the-central-Adriatic-spanning-the-interval-from-oxygen-isotope-Stage-2-to-the-present-day.pdf,0,0,0

Species richness for all lots increased logarithmically with lot age. The species richness of lots 40 months and older. each of which had been mown at least once. did not increase with age. and was positively related to lot area and negatively related to measures of lot isolation.

It has also been established that irradiation of porphyrins noncovalently intercalated between bases or bound to one of the grooves can cause conformational effects on DNA. Conversely. there is no evidence reported in the literature of conformational changes caused by noncovalently bound PPIX to globular proteins for which the porphyrin is not a specific ligand. This study shows that the irradiation of the porphyrin in the PPIX/lactoglobulin noncovalent complex indeed causes a local and limited (∼7%) unfolding of the protein near the location of Trp19. This event causes the intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of the protein to shift to the red by 2 nm and the average decay lifetime to lengthen by approximately 0.5 ns.

Although BLG is not a potential target for the biomedical applications of porphyrins. it is a useful model for investigating the effects of photoactive ligands on small globular proteins. We show in this paper that irradiation causes a large unfolding of the protein and that the conformational change is not mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species. Instead. our data are consistent with an electron-transfer mechanism that is capable of triggering structural changes in the protein and causes the Trp19 residue to undergo chemical modifications to form a derivative of kynurenine.

WT1 physically interacts with and recruits TET2 to its target genes to activate their expression. The interaction between WT1 and TET2 is disrupted by multiple AML-derived TET2 mutations. TET2 suppresses leukemia cell proliferation and colony formation in a manner dependent on WT1. These results provide a mechanism for targeting TET2 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome.

Macrophages cannot limit the uptake of cholesterol and therefore depend on cholesterol efflux pathways for preventing their transformation into foam cells. Several ABC-transporters. including ABCA1 and ABCG1. facilitate the efflux of cholesterol from macrophages. These transporters. however. also affect membrane lipid asymmetry which may have important implications for cellular endocytotic pathways. We propose that in addition to the generally accepted role of these ABC-transporters in the prevention of foam cell formation by induction of cholesterol efflux from macrophages. they also influence the macrophage endocytotic uptake.,True,xamSPtYAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,140,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579306009902,10897507467383202087,/scholar?cites=10897507467383202087,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579306009902,0,0,0

Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels bear a strong independent inverse relationship with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The benefit of this regimen. known as PCV. was recently linked to IDH mutation that occurs frequently in glioma and produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). We report here that D-2-HG inhibits the α-KG-dependent alkB homolog (ALKBH) DNA repair enzymes.

We felt there was a need to broaden our students' perspectives and to introduce them to the variety of morpho-syntactic devices to be found in language in general. For this reason in 1978 we established a course for third year undergraduates in which we survey morpho-syntactic variation across a range of languages. Our aim has been to make the range of languages as wide as possible. going beyond the languages of western Europe. Many linguists unfortunately still seem content to confine their studies to these more familiar languages. That is like trying to base a science of botany on a study of succulents.For the purposes of administration the course was given the title"" Language Typology and Universals"". In practice. however. the course has evolved into a course in typology. since universals. or at least strict universals. usually prove to be fragile and short-lived. The course is divided into two parts. with Blake taking the simple sentence and concentrating on case-marking and Greenberg's universals of word order; Mallinson taking compound and complex sentences and dealing with the ways in which languages construct their co-ordinate and subordinate structures. including a review of the ways in which repeated material is avoided. In both parts of the course we have endeavoured not only to illustrate the variation to be found in morpho-syntactic phenomena but also to stress the nonrandomness of the distribution of data and to attempt to account for it.

The most prominent configuration is when a lncRNA is antisense to a protein coding gene. Increasing evidences prove that antisense transcription may control sense gene expression acting at distinct regulatory levels. However. its contribution to brain function and neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. We have recently identified AS Uchl1 as an antisense to the mouse Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1) gene (AS Uchl1). the synthenic locus of UCHL1/PARK5. This is mutated in rare cases of early-onset familial Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and loss of UCHL1 activity has been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly. manipulation of UchL1 expression has been proposed as tool for therapeutic intervention. AS Uchl1 induces UchL1 expression by increasing its translation. It is the representative member of SINEUPs (SINEB2 sequence to UP-regulate translation). a new functional class of natural antisense lncRNAs that activate translation of their sense genes. Here we take advantage of FANTOM5 dataset to identify the transcription start sites associated to S/AS pair at Uchl1 locus. We show that AS Uchl1 expression is under the regulation of Nurr1. a major transcription factor involved in dopaminergic cells’ differentiation and maintenance. Furthermore. AS Uch1 RNA levels are strongly down-regulated in neurochemical models of PD in vitro and in vivo.

Resensitization of GPCR responsiveness involves agonist-mediated receptor sequestration. Overexpression of β-arrestins in human embryonic kidney cells rescued the sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) mutants defective in their ability to sequester. an effect enhanced by simultaneous overexpression of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1. Wild-type β2AR sequestration was inhibited by the overexpression of two β-arrestin mutants.

Following agonist-mediated desensitization. sequestration of GPCR is presumably associated with the dephosphorylation and recycling of functional receptors. However. the exact mechanisms responsible for GPCR sequestration. even for the prototypic β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). have remained controversial. We demonstrate here that dynamin. a GTPase that regulates the formation and internalization of clathrin-coated vesicles. is essential for the agonist-promoted sequestration of the β2AR. suggesting that the β2AR internalizes via the clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytic pathway. In contrast. internalization of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR). another typical GPCR. does not require dynamin.

In a wide variety of organisms. meiotic HORMA-domain proteins are required to direct DSB repair towards homologues. This inter-homologue bias is required for efficient homology search. homologue alignment. and crossover formation. HORMA-domain proteins are also implicated in other processes related to crossover formation. including DSB formation. inhibition of promiscuous formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). and the meiotic prophase checkpoint that monitors both DSB processing and SCs. We examined the behavior of two previously uncharacterized meiosis-specific mouse HORMA-domain proteins—HORMAD1 and HORMAD2—in wild-type mice and in mutants defective in DSB processing or SC formation. HORMADs are preferentially associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes throughout meiotic prophase. We observe a strong negative correlation between SC formation and presence of HORMADs on axes. and a positive correlation between the presumptive sites of high checkpoint-kinase ATR activity and hyper-accumulation of HORMADs on axes. HORMADs are not depleted from chromosomes in mutants that lack SCs. In contrast. DSB formation and DSB repair are not absolutely required for depletion of HORMADs from synapsed axes. A simple interpretation of these findings is that SC formation directly or indirectly promotes depletion of HORMADs from chromosome axes.

These connections are formed by homologous recombination closely integrated with the development of meiosis-specific. higher-order chromosome structures. The yeast Pch2 protein has emerged as an important factor with roles in both recombination and chromosome structure formation. but recent analysis suggested that TRIP13. the mouse Pch2 ortholog. is not required for the same processes. Using distinct Trip13 alleles with moderate and severe impairment of TRIP13 function. we report here that TRIP13 is required for proper synaptonemal complex formation. such that autosomal bivalents in Trip13-deficient meiocytes frequently displayed pericentric synaptic forks and other defects. In males. TRIP13 is required for efficient synapsis of the sex chromosomes and for sex body formation. Furthermore. the numbers of crossovers and chiasmata are reduced in the absence of TRIP13. and their distribution along the chromosomes is altered. suggesting a role for TRIP13 in aspects of crossover formation and/or control. Recombination defects are evident very early in meiotic prophase. soon after DSB formation. These findings provide evidence for evolutionarily conserved functions for TRIP13/Pch2 in both recombination and formation of higher order chromosome structures. and they support the hypothesis that TRIP13/Pch2 participates in coordinating these key aspects of meiotic chromosome behavior.,True,TAOIy8oAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,140,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001062,16542352117269966938,/scholar?cites=16542352117269966938,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001062,0,0,0

The WD-repeat-containing protein EED is one component of the PRC2 complex that possesses histone methyltransferase activity required for gene repression. Here we report the crystal structure of EED in complex with a 30 residue peptide from EZH2. The structure reveals that the peptide binds to the bottom of the WD-repeat domain of EED. The structural determinants of EZH2-EED interaction are present not only in EZH2 and EZH1 but also in its Drosophila homolog E(Z). suggesting that the recognition of ESC by E(Z) in Drosophila employs similar structural motifs. Structure-based mutagenesis identified critical residues from both EED and EZH2 for their interaction.

Addition of O-glycans onto proteins is an extremely complex process that regulates both sites of attachment and the types of oligosaccharides added. Twenty distinct polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) initiate O-glycosylation and fine-tuning their expression provides a mechanism for regulating this action. Recently. a new mode of regulation has emerged where activation of Src kinase selectively redistributes Golgi-localized GalNAc-Ts to the ER. This relocalization results in a strong increase in the density of O-glycan decoration.

Why. then. is the problem of turbulence so intractable? One major difficulty is that the equations appear insoluble in any reasonable sense. (A direct numerical simulation certainly yields a “solution”. but it provides little understanding of the process per se.) However. three developments are beginning to bear fruit: (1) The discovery. by experimental fluid mechanicians. of coherent structures in certain fully developed turbulent flows; (2) the suggestion. by Ruelle. Takens and others. that strange attractors and other ideas from dynamical systems theory might play a role in the analysis of the governing equations. and (3) the introduction of the statistical technique of Karhunen-Loève or proper orthogonal decomposition. by Lumley in the case of turbulence.

This result is in fact the consequence of a more general ``Harris-like'' ergodic theorem applicable to many dissipative stochastic PDEs and stochastic processes with memory. A simple iterated map example is also presented to help build intuition and showcase the central ideas in a less encumbered setting.

Unlike most previous work. the type of norm we consider for this analysis is neither a weighted supremum norm nor an Ł p-type norm. but involves the derivative of the observable as well and hence can be seen as a type of 1-Wasserstein distance. This turns out to be a suitable approach for infinite-dimensional spaces where the usual Harris or Doeblin conditions. which are geared toward total variation convergence. often fail to hold. In the first part of this paper. we consider semigroups that have uniform behavior which one can view as the analog of Doeblin’s condition. We then proceed to study situations where the behavior is not so uniform. but the system has a suitable Lyapunov structure. leading to a type of Harris condition.

Error estimates for time-averaging estimators are obtained and then used to show that the stationary behavior of the numerical method converges to that of the SDE. The error analysis is based on using an associated Poisson equation for the underlying SDE. The main advantages of this approach are its simplicity and universality. It works equally well for a range of explicit and implicit schemes. including those with simple simulation of random variables. and for hypoelliptic SDEs. To simplify the exposition. we consider only the case where the state space of the SDE is a torus. and we study only smooth test functions.

In particular. they lead directly to precise estimates of the number of steps required to explore the target measure. in stationarity. as a function of the dimension of the state space.

In comparison. newly developed fluorescent phospholipid and cholesterol analogues with improved phase-partitioning properties show more homogenous diffusion. independent of the preference for liquid-ordered or disordered membrane environments.

Synaptotagmin-1 interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin-1A and acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4. 5-bisphosphate (PIP2). However. it is unclear how these interactions contribute to triggering membrane fusion. Using PC12 cells from Rattus norvegicus and artificial supported bilayers. we show that synaptotagmin-1 interacts with the polybasic linker region of syntaxin-1A independent of Ca 2+ through PIP2. This interaction allows both Ca 2+-binding sites of synaptotagmin-1 to bind to phosphatidylserine in the vesicle membrane upon Ca 2+ triggering. We determined the crystal structure of the C2B domain of synaptotagmin-1 bound to phosphoserine. allowing development of a high-resolution model of synaptotagmin bridging two different membranes.

We present FCS and STED experiments showing that dense membrane bound actin networks have severe influence on lipid phase separation. A minimal actin cortex was bound to a supported lipid bilayer via biotinylated lipid streptavidin complexes (pinning sites). In general. actin binding to ternary membranes prevented macroscopic liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domain formation. even at low temperature. Instead. depending on the type of pinning lipid. an actin correlated multi-domain pattern was observed. FCS measurements revealed hindered diffusion of lipids in the presence of an actin network. To explain our experimental findings. a new simulation model is proposed. in which the membrane composition. the membrane curvature. and the actin pinning sites are all coupled. Our results reveal a mechanism how cells may prevent macroscopic demixing of their membrane components. while at the same time regulate the local membrane composition.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01671.001,True,sli-Dy4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,154,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01671,2766645317954884075,/scholar?cites=2766645317954884075,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01671.pdf,0,0,0

Broadly speaking. this may be caused by mechanisms specific to each protein. or may be a consequence of a general pattern that affects the distribution of all membrane proteins. The latter hypothesis has been difficult to test in the past. Here. we introduce several approaches based on click chemistry. through which we study the distribution of membrane proteins in living cells. as well as in membrane sheets. We found that the plasma membrane proteins form multi-protein assemblies that are long lived (minutes). and in which protein diffusion is restricted. The formation of the assemblies is dependent on cholesterol. They are separated and anchored by the actin cytoskeleton. Specific proteins are preferentially located in different regions of the assemblies. from their cores to their edges.

Of particular importance is the genetic network. a set of genes that interact through directed transcriptional regulation. Genes that exert a regulatory role encode dedicated transcription factors (hereafter referred to as regulating proteins) that can bind to specific DNA control regions of regulated genes to activate or inhibit their transcription. Regulated genes may themselves act in a regulatory manner. in which case they participate in a causal pathway. Looping pathways form feedback circuits.

Most people now recognise that we have to be capable of adapting quickly as new and uncertain circumstances emerge: this capability will need to exist at personal. group. community. regional. national and international levels. all at the same time. Systems Practice is structured into four parts. Part I introduces the societal need to move towards a more systemic and adaptive governance against the backdrop of human-induced climate change. Part II unpacks what is involved in systems practice by means of a juggler metaphor; examining situations where systems thinking offers useful understanding and opportunities for change. Part III identifies the main factors that constrain the uptake of systems practice and makes the case for innovation in practice by means of systemic inquiry. systemic action research and systemic intervention. The book concludes with Part IV. which critically examines how systems practice is. or might be. utilised at different levels from the personal to the societal. The development of our capabilities to think and act systemically is an urgent priority and Systems Practice aims to show how to do systems thinking and translate that thinking into praxis (theory informed practical action) which will be welcomed by those managing in situations of complexity and uncertainty across all domains of professional and personal concern.,True,psOymP8AAAAJ:H3xT48m3F74C,331,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oa3HiOpktpEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=info:qDB-1pBI3ioJ:scholar.google.com&ots=A0JWTHsqGI&sig=mTZvZS_lCyg-LNZXwWN3NYNCpcY,3088986181333823656,/scholar?cites=3088986181333823656,,http://oro.open.ac.uk/22901/2/Chapter_9.pdf,0,0,0

To do this we have sim-ulated three robot models. None of them have an internal map. which simplifies them enormously. and instead they rely on an external signal or signals to guide them to the central point. In an ideal world a homing signal can be heard anywhere in the trial area. but we wanted to take into account a first possibility that the signal is line-of-sight only. eg cannot pass through certain obstacles or be received in such valleys or behind such ridges as may be encountered in a"" non-artificial"" environment. The second possibility is that the signal is only short range and cannot be received throughout the area to be covered. and poses the problem as to how the robots can then find their way home from regions further away than this signal range.The first two models we propose roughly correspond to individual foraging in ants. in which each individual searches independently. and can find its own way home from anywhere within the foraging area. The difference between them is that in the first model. and unlike individualy foraging ants. the robots cannot return to the site of their last find. whereas in the second they can. The third model involves a much more collective behaviour in that the robots rely on each other to find their way home. If one wanted to imitate an ant society closely. one might imagine a succesful robot depositing a substance that can guide other robots both to-wards its recent find and back to the nest.

This technique may be used in direct algorithms such as Q-learning. or in indirect algorithms such as adaptive dynamic programming. It is based on two principles. The first is to define a local measure of the uncertainty using the theory of bandit problems. We show that such a measure suffers from several drawbacks. In particular. a direct application of it leads to algorithms of low quality that can be easily misled by particular configurations of the environment. The second basic principle was introduced to eliminate this drawback. It consists of assimilating the local measures of uncertainty to rewards. and back-propagating them with the dynamic programming or temporal difference mechanisms.

Specifically. any local motion detector can measure only the component of motion perpendicular to a contour that extends beyond its field of view 1. 2. This “aperture problem” 3 is particularly relevant to direction-selective neurons early in the visual pathways. where small receptive fields permit only a limited view of a moving object.

Generally. these tuning curves are further modulated by the overall intensity of the stimulus. such that increasing the contrast increases the firing rate. up to some maximum. In this paper. we describe the tuning of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT or V5) of macaque visual cortex for moving stimuli of varying contrast. We find that. for some MT neurons. tuning curves for stimulus direction. speed. and size are shaped in part by suppressive influences that are present at high stimulus contrast but weak or nonexistent at low contrast. For most neurons. the suppression is direction-specific and strongest for large. slow-moving stimuli.

However. small receptive fields tend to confound the orientation and velocity of moving edges. leading to ambiguous or inaccurate motion measurements (the aperture problem). Thus. it is often assumed that neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) carry only ambiguous motion information. Here we show that a subpopulation of V1 neurons is capable of signaling motion direction in a manner that is independent of contour orientation. Specifically. end-stopped V1 neurons obtain accurate motion measurements by responding only to the endpoints of long contours. a strategy which renders them largely immune to the aperture problem. Furthermore. the time course of end-stopping is similar to the time course of motion integration by MT neurons.

The visual cortex must then integrate the information from these localized receptive fields to obtain a more global picture of the surrounding environment. We studied this process in single neurons within the middle temporal visual area (MT) of macaques using stimuli that produced conflicting local and global information about stimulus motion. Neuronal responses in alert animals initially reflected predominantly the ambiguous local motion features. but gradually converged to an unambiguous global representation.

Understanding the relationships between single-neuron spiking and network activity is therefore of great importance and the latter can be readily estimated from low-frequency brain signals known as local field potentials (LFPs). In this work we examine a number of issues related to the estimation of spike and LFP signals. We show that spike trains and individual spikes contain power at the frequencies that are typically thought to be exclusively related to LFPs. such that simple frequency-domain filtering cannot be effectively used to separate the two signals.

For motion signals. integration is complicated by the geometry of the visual world. which renders some velocity measurements ambiguous and others incorrect.

Unambiguous motion signals are located at end points and corners. which are referred to as terminators.

Such rotations complicate the interpretation of the retinal image. because they nullify the retinal motion of the target. while generating retinal motion of stationary objects in the background. This poses a problem for the oculomotor system. which must track the stabilized target image while suppressing the optokinetic reflex. which would move the eye in the direction of the retinal background motion (opposite to the direction in which the target is moving). Similarly. the perceptual system must estimate the actual direction and speed of moving objects in spite of the confounding effects of the eye rotation.

Previous work has shown that neural adaptation can occur on a timescale of milliseconds. but perceptual adaptation has generally been studied over relatively long timescales. typically on the order of seconds. This disparity raises important questions. Can perceptual adaptation be observed at brief. functionally relevant timescales? And if so. how do its properties relate to the rapid adaptation seen in cortical neurons?

As a synapse is used more frequently. its neurotransmission efficiency increases. partly because of increased vesicle clustering in the presynaptic neuron. Vesicle clustering has been believed to result primarily from biochemical signaling processes that require the connectivity of the presynaptic terminal with the cell body. the central nervous system. and the postsynaptic cell. Our in vivo experiments on the embryonic Drosophila nervous system show that vesicle clustering at the neuromuscular presynaptic terminal depends on mechanical tension within the axons. Vesicle clustering vanishes upon severing the axon from the cell body. but is restored when mechanical tension is applied to the severed end of the axon.

However. examination of the wind-sensitive cercal sensory system of the cricket demonstrates that some identified synaptic connections systematically decrease in strength as an animal matures. while others increase in strength over the same period. Moreover. a single sensory neuron could increase the strength of its synaptic connection with one interneuron while decreasing the strength of its connection with another interneuron. Thus. rather than being a hallmark of the vertebrate nervous system. synaptic rearrangement is probably characteristic of the development of many if not all nervous systems.,True,NNCrPrEAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,103,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/240/4854/901.abstract,15738078413763434796,/scholar?cites=15738078413763434796,,,0,0,0

Therefore. understanding the evolutionary history of opsins is key to understanding the evolution of light detection and photoreception in animals. As genomic data have appeared and rapidly expanded in quantity. it has become possible to analyse opsins that functionally and histologically are less well characterized. and thus to examine opsin evolution strictly from a genetic perspective. We have incorporated these new data into a large-scale. genome-based analysis of opsin evolution.

This novel opsin-like protein is expressed in retinal ganglion cells that form the retinohypothalamic tract. a neuronal connection between the retina and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These hypothalamic structures contain the circadian pacemaker. which generates daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. In mammals. proper synchronization of these rhythms to the environmental light−dark cycle requires retinal input. Surprisingly. rod and cone photoreceptors are not required. Instead. the melanopsin-containing ganglion cells are intrinsically sensitive to light. perhaps responding via a melanopsin-based signaling pathway.

HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DRB1*17-bearing haplotypes and interactions at the HLA-DRB1 locus increase risk of MS but it has taken large samples to identify resistance HLA-DRB1 alleles.

HLA-DRB1*14-. HLA-DRB1*11-. HLA-DRB1*01-. and HLA-DRB1*10-bearing haplotypes are protective overall but they appear to operate by different mechanisms. The first type of resistance allele is characterised by HLA-DRB1*14 and HLA-DRB1*11. Each shows a multiplicative mode of inheritance indicating a broadly acting suppression of risk. but a different degree of protection. In contrast. a second type is exemplified by HLA-DRB1*10 and HLA-DRB1*01. These alleles are significantly protective when they interact specifically in trans with HLA-DRB1*15-bearing haplotypes. HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*10 do not interact with HLA-DRB1*17. implying that several mechanisms may be operative in major histocompatibility complex–associated MS susceptibility. perhaps analogous to the resistance alleles.

Sea-ranched trout spend their first 2 years in the hatchery before being released into the wild at the onset of seaward migration. Trout were presented with a novel object (tack) and with food (brine shrimp). and their responses were measured and scored in terms of boldness.

Predictions from these hypotheses were tested in laboratory experiments where behavior and growth were studied in juvenile sea trout. In tact groups of familiar fish were compared with groups that contained both familiar and unfamiliar individuals. In general. the results were in agreement with the first hypothesis. Familiar fish in intact groups had more stable dominance ranks. higher food intake. and better utilization of food. Familiarity also reduced the distance to the nearest neighbor. Furthermore. initiators of conflicts were more likely to win against familiar fish than against strangers.

1029616,The ability of released. hatchery salmonids to breed and contribute to the natural productivity of wild populations,2001,IA Fleming and Erik Petersson,,Nordic Journal of Freshwater Research,,71-98,BLOMS BOKTRYCKERI AB,The success and implications of hatchery release programmes are intimately tied to the reproductive capabilities of the hatchery fish in the wild. Moreover. reproductive interactions are important in understanding the ecological and genetic threats that hatchery fish may pose to wild populations. Reproductive success is a key to self-sustainability. shaping natural and sexual selection. and influencing the genetic diversity of populations. In this paper. we review the determinants of breeding success in natural populations and the implications of parental traits and decisions for offspring survival and success. We then address how rearing and release programmes affect the reproductive traits and performance of fish. A review of such programmes reveals that in the few cases where adequate assessments have been made released fish frequently fail to attain self-sustainability and/or contribute significantly to populations. Clearly. new approaches based on sound scientific research are needed and these need to be tailored specifically to the management objectives.,True,FCZHZNMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,176,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Fleming4/publication/234082032_The_ability_of_released_hatchery_salmonids_to_breed_and_contribute_to_the_natural_productivity_of_wild_populations/links/09e4150ef1a36056f1000000/The-ability-of-released-hatchery-salmonids-to-breed-and-contribute-to-the-natural-productivity-of-wild-populations.pdf,15551400259002160283,/scholar?cites=15551400259002160283,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Fleming4/publication/234082032_The_ability_of_released_hatchery_salmonids_to_breed_and_contribute_to_the_natural_productivity_of_wild_populations/links/09e4150ef1a36056f1000000/The-ability-of-released-hatchery-salmonids-to-breed-and-contribute-to-the-natural-productivity-of-wild-populations.pdf,0,0,0

Parentage analyses based on 11 microsatellites permitted us to infer reproductive success and mate choice preferences in situ. We found that pairs with intermediate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) dissimilarity mated more often than expected by chance. It appears that female choice was the driving force behind this observation because. compared with other individuals. males with intermediate MHC dissimilarity produced a larger proportion of offspring. whereas female reproductive output did not show this pattern. Hence. rather than seeking mates with maximal MHC dissimilarity. as found in several species. brown trout seemed to prefer mates of intermediate MHC difference. thus supporting an optimality‐based model for MHC …,True,FCZHZNMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,137,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01380.x,16864163731339962556,/scholar?cites=16864163731339962556,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01380.x,0,0,0

Baltic Sea salmon Salmo salar have suffered high larval mortality (M74) which can be cured by thiamine treatment. Analyses of long term mortality records (1928–1998) from two salmon hatcheries suggest that before the 1970s M74 did not occur. or was less frequent. This indicates that varying M74 did not cause the long‐term fluctuations of Baltic salmon catches in this period. The frequency of M74 has been correlated positively to the abundance of the salmon's primary prey. sprat Sprattus sprattus.

We investigated the role of the thiol antioxidant dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) and intracellular glutathione (GSH) in R-LA-stimulated glucose transport and explored the hypothesis that R-LA could increase glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes in an oxidant-mimetic manner. R-LA pretreatment of 3T3-L1 cells stimulated glucose transport at early time points (30 min–6 h). whereas it inhibited glucose uptake at later time points.

The cytotoxic property of extracellular glutamate is known to mediate two primary mechanisms. excitotoxicity and excitotoxicity-independent processes. The excitotoxicity-independent pathway was investigated in the current study in a mouse hippocampal-derived HT4 cell line. Exposure of HT4 cells to glutamate for 12 h induced loss of cell viability preceded by rapid loss of intracellular reduced glutathione followed by accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. elevation of intracellular Ca2+. progressive loss of mitochondrial membrane potential swelling and loss of mitochondrial outer membrane integrity. Glutamate-induced loss of DNA integrity has been detected. The antioxidants α-tocopherol and trolox. mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitor Ruthenium Red and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide all showed protection against glutamate …,True,HVMFxm8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,96,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452200000282,6422296634998625343,/scholar?cites=6422296634998625343,,https://content.web-repository.com/s/75981602690223668/uploads/Publications/51.1-s2.0-S0306452200000282-main-9121721.pdf,0,0,0

1029763,A complete classification of Darwinian extinction in ecological interactions,2003,Colleen Webb,161,The American Naturalist,2,181-205,,The evolution of a population by individual‐level natural selection can result in the population’s extinction. Selection causes the spread of phenotypes with higher relative fitness. but at the same time. selection can also indirectly produce changes in the physical. biotic. or genotypical environment through population interactions (e.g.. environment modification. interspecific interactions. and genomic conflict). Because fitness is environment dependent. this can cause mean fitness to decrease. resulting in extinction. I call this process “Darwinian extinction.” Examples of Darwinian extinction include a variety of dynamics and modes of extinction. but the variation is constrained. I determine the complete classification of possible dynamics and modes of Darwinian extinction due to ecological interactions. using bifurcation theory and models with ecological and evolutionary changes occurring on different timescales.

Presence/absence characters for each AFLP allele treat all absences as homologous to one another. With three or more alleles. terminals are grouped by their shared absence of alleles in character-based phylogenetic-inference methods in a manner that is not redundant with their shared presence of an alternative allele. We conducted simulations to quantify how severe the negative effect of using presence/absence characters of individual bands is for phylogenetic inference relative to standard multistate characters. We examined alternative tree topologies. relative branch lengths. numbers of characters. rates of evolution. and numbers of alternative alleles. using both parsimony and Nei-and-Li distance analyses.

Current theoretical approaches to modeling ecosystem response to environmental change often deal only with single environmental drivers or single species traits. simple ecological interactions. and/or steady states. leading to concern about how accurately these approaches will capture future responses to environmental change in real biological systems. To begin addressing this issue. we generalize a previous trait-based framework to incorporate aspects of frequency dependence. functional complementarity. and the dynamics of systems composed of species that are defined by multiple traits that are tied to multiple environmental drivers. The framework is particularly well suited for analyzing the role of temporal environmental fluctuations in maintaining trait variability and the resultant effects on …,True,sqxtKOkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307001129,12050526508605249437,/scholar?cites=12050526508605249437,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2041898/,0,0,0

Nonetheless. relatively little is known about the organism9s virulence factors or their regulatory networks. Septicemia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are two of the more severe forms of A. baumannii disease. To identify virulence factors that may contribute to these disease processes. genetically diverse A. baumannii clinical isolates were evaluated for the ability to proliferate in human serum. A transposon mutant library was created in a strain background that propagated well in serum and screened for members with decreased serum growth.

The group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) are commonly named as putative T1D-inducing agents. We studied CVB replication in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice to assess how infection by diverse CVB strains affected T1D incidence in a model of human T1D. Inoculation of 4- or 8-week-old NOD mice with any of nine different CVB strains significantly reduced the incidence of T1D by 2- to 10-fold over a 10-month period relative to T1D incidences in mock-infected control mice. Greater protection was conferred by more-pathogenic CVB strains relative to less-virulent or avirulent strains.

We demonstrated previously that inoculation of young nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with any of several different CVB strains reduced T1D incidence. We also observed no evidence of CVB replication within islets of young NOD mice. suggesting no role for CVB in T1D induction in the NOD mouse model. The failure to observe CVB replication within islets of young NOD mice has been proposed to be due to interferon expression by insulin-producing beta cells or lack of expression of the CVB receptor CAR. We found that CAR protein is detectable within islets of young and older NOD mice and that a CVB3 strain. which expresses murine IL-4. can replicate in islets.

Infected animals exhibit clinical signs that are of economic significance to stakeholders and include reduced fertility. abortion. poor weight gain. lost draught power. and a substantial decline in milk production. In humans. brucellosis typically manifests as a variety of non-specific clinical signs. Chronicity and recurring febrile conditions. as well as devastating complications in pregnant women are common sequelae. In regions where the disease is endemic. brucellosis has far-reaching and deleterious effects on humans and animals alike. Deeply entrenched social misconceptions and fear of government intervention contribute to this disease continuing to smolder unchecked in most of the developing world. thereby limiting economic growth and inhibiting access to international markets. The losses in livestock productivity compromise food security and lead to shifts in the cognitive competency of the working generation. influence the propagation of gender inequality. and cause profound emotional suffering in farmers whose herds are affected.

Morphology-based identification of bioindicator taxa is time consuming. and rarely supports species-level resolution especially for immature life stages. Much work has been done in the past decade to develop alternative approaches for biodiversity analysis using DNA sequence-based approaches such as molecular phylogenetics and DNA barcoding. On-going assembly of DNA barcode reference libraries will provide the basis for a DNA-based identification system. The use of recently introduced next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches in biodiversity science has the potential to further extend the application of DNA information for routine biomonitoring applications to an unprecedented scale.

Due to this reason. several tissue culture systems have been developed to study the molecular and cellular biology of somatic embryogenesis. One of the basic questions considering the mechanism of somatic embryo induction is related to the importance of the first cell division in the determination of cell fate and embryo polarity. Alfalfa leaf protoplast-derived cells represent a suitable experimental system to study this question: at low 2. 4-D concentrations cells become elongated. vacuolated and divide more or less equally forming unorganised callus tissue. while at ten-times higher concentrations small. densely-cytoplasmic cells preferentially divide asymmetrically developing into embryo-like structures. In addition to investigations of cell division characteristics. the system proved to be suitable to describe other cell physiological. molecular parameters associated with the transition of somatic cells to a dedifferentiated and embryogenic state.

The complex network of these processes is vital to upgrade and maintain the quality of water compatible with providing habitats for a number of aquatic species. Another group of important processes are those which remove excess biogenic elements (primarily N.

The entire system of all these processes is important to maintain a certain level of purity of water. which is an extremely significant condition for making natural water of many water bodies a resource for human consumption.

It is an important feature of the biomachinery of filter-feeders that it removes from water various particles of a very broad range of sizes.

1029846,Towards an evolutionary ecology of sexual traits,2010,Charlie K Cornwallis and Tobias Uller,25,,3,145-152,Elsevier Current Trends,Empirical studies of sexual traits continue to generate conflicting results. leading to a growing awareness that the current understanding of this topic is limited. Here we argue that this is because studies of sexual traits fail to encompass three important features of evolution. First. sexual traits evolve via natural selection of which sexual selection is just one part. Second. selection on sexual traits fluctuates in strength. direction and form due to spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. Third. phenotypic plasticity is ubiquitous and generates selection and responses to selection within and across generations. A move from purely gene-focused theories of sexual selection towards research that explicitly integrates development. ecology and evolution is necessary to break the stasis in research on sexual traits.,True,i9_PLloAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,296,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534709002985,8686008289238579309,/scholar?cites=8686008289238579309,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32973509/Cornwallis2010Trends_Ecol_EvolTowards_an_evolutionary_ecology_of_sexual_traits.pdf,0,0,0

These two processes are likely to operate with limited overlap: kin discrimination is beneficial when variation in relatedness is higher. whereas limited dispersal results in less variable and higher average relatedness. reducing selection for kin discrimination. However. most empirical work on eukaryotes has focused on kin discrimination. To address this bias. we analysed how kin discrimination and limited dispersal interact to shape helping behaviour across cooperatively breeding vertebrates. We show that kin discrimination is greater in species where the: (i) average relatedness in groups is lower and more variable; (ii) effect of helpers on breeders reproductive success is greater; and (iii) probability of helping was measured …,True,i9_PLloAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,139,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01853.x,8947800429376795194,/scholar?cites=8947800429376795194,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01853.x,0,0,0

Disentangling the factors regulating the interplay between traits conferring a reproductive advantage before and after copulation is therefore crucial to understanding how sexual strategies evolve. Here we show in the fowl Gallus gallus. where social status determines copulation success. that dominant males produce more sperm than subordinates but that the quality of dominant males’ sperm decreases over successive copulations. whereas that of subordinates remains constant.

1029850,Mechanisms of pathogenesis. infective dose and virulence in human parasites,2012,Helen C Leggett and Charlie K Cornwallis and Stuart A West,8,PLoS Pathog,2,e1002512,Public Library of Science,The number of pathogens that are required to infect a host. termed infective dose. varies dramatically across pathogen species. It has recently been predicted that infective dose will depend upon the mode of action of the molecules that pathogens use to facilitate their infection. Specifically. pathogens which use locally acting molecules will require a lower infective dose than pathogens that use distantly acting molecules. Furthermore. it has also been predicted that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators may be more virulent because they have a large number of cells in the inoculums. which will cause more harm to host cells. We formally test these predictions for the first time using data on 43 different human pathogens from a range of taxonomic groups with diverse life-histories. We found that pathogens using local action do have lower infective doses. but are not less virulent than those using distant action. Instead. we found that virulence was negatively correlated with infective dose. and higher in pathogens infecting wounded skin. compared with those ingested or inhaled. More generally. our results show that broad-scale comparative analyses can explain variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence. whilst highlighting the importance of mechanistic details.,True,i9_PLloAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,119,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002512,635670476444610678,/scholar?cites=635670476444610678,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002512,0,0,0

It is a dramatic example of a spiteful behaviour in which the victim's fitness is reduced for no immediate direct benefit to the perpetrator 2 and its evolution is unexplained.

Bioinformatics analysis has been used to identify 131 putative odourant receptors from the A. aegypti genome that are likely to function in chemosensory perception in this mosquito. Comparison with the Anopheles gambiae olfactory subgenome demonstrates significant divergence of the odourant receptors that reflects a high degree of evolutionary activity potentially resulting from their critical roles during the mosquito life cycle.

To better understand the molecular basis of mosquito chemosensation we have used whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare transcript expression profiles between the two major chemosensory tissues. the antennae and maxillary palps. of adult female and male An. gambiae. We compared chemosensory tissue transcriptomes to whole body transcriptomes of each sex to identify chemosensory enhanced genes. In the six data sets analyzed. we detected expression of nearly all known chemosensory genes and found them to be highly enriched in both olfactory tissues of males and females. While the maxillary palps of both sexes demonstrated strict chemosensory gene expression overlap. we observed acute differences in sensory specialization between male and female antennae. The relatively high expression levels of chemosensory genes in the female antennae reveal its role as an organ predominately assigned to chemosensation. Remarkably. the expression of these genes was highly conserved in the male antennae. but at much lower relative levels. Alternatively. consistent with a role in mating. the male antennae displayed significant enhancement of genes involved in audition. while the female enhancement of these genes was observed. but to a lesser degree.

1029899,Vertebrate circadian and photoperiodic systems: role of the pineal gland and melatonin,1987,Herbert Underwood and Bruce D Goldman,2,,4,279-315,Sage Publications,In recent years. there has been an explosion of interest in the role of melatonin in vertebrate systems. Since melatonin is only one of a general class of compounds termed &dquo; indoleamines&dquo; that the pineal produces. one question that arises is this: Why has melatonin itself attracted the most interest? One reason is that melatonin was the first of these compounds isolated. and it had the interesting property of causing blanching of frog skin. A more important reason. however. arose from the belief that the terminal enzyme in the synthesis of melatonin. hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT). was uniquely localized to pineal tissue. Consequently. melatonin and related methoxyindoles were. at least potentially. unique pineal products. Finally. interest in pineal products was generated because the pineal appeared to be involved in control-ling important physiological functions. such as reproduction.

The rhythmic synthesis and secretion of the pineal hormone. melatonin. is suggested as the mechanism by which the pineal controls circadian oscillators located elsewhere. Both light and temperature cycles can entrain the pineal melatonin rhythm. The pineal. therefore. acts as a photo and thermoendocrine transducer which functions to synchronize internal cycle with cycles in the environment.

Spiders are unique in synthesizing many different kinds of silk. and using silk for a variety of ecological functions throughout their lives. particularly to make prey-catching webs. Here. we construct a broad higher-level phylogeny of spiders combining molecular data with traditional morphological and behavioral characters. We use this phylogeny to test the hypothesis that the spider orb web evolved only once. We then examine spider diversification in relation to different web architectures and silk use. We find strong support for a single origin of orb webs. implying a major shift in the spinning of capture silk and repeated loss or transformation of orb webs. We show that abandonment of costly cribellate capture silk correlates with the 2 major diversification events in spiders (1).

1029956,Problems with zero-length branches,1994,Jonathan A Coddington and Nikolaj Scharff,,Cladistics,,,,"In this note we call attention to a possibly common situation in which frequently used phylogenetic analysis and diagnosis programs may report cladograms that do not have support at every node from the data matrix analyzed to produce them. The problem involves branches that may or may not be interpreted as having zero length. the ambiguity arising from equally applicable but mutually exclusive alternative optimizations.Platnick et al.(1991) and Wilkinson (1995) commented on manifestations of the problem that involved missing entries and"" arbitrary resolutions"". respectively. Wilkinson (1995) emphasized that programs can report topologies including zerolength branches even when no missing entries are present. However. Wilkinson posed the problem abstractly. a single character on one tree. addressed only one horn of the dilemma (branches ambiguously of zero or greater length were always assigned zero length). considered solutions only within the philosophical framework offered by PAUP. and offered no advice regarding what practicing systematists could do to detect the problem. In addition. the treatment of the zero-length branch problem by programmers is already more diverse than reported by Wilkinson (1995). and users of the most common packages should be aware of the different interpretations adopted by programmers. Wilkinson (1995) offered some algorithmic suggestions for a solution. but his solution. although helpful. strikes us as less than ideal.

The aim of this work was to evaluate whether TP53 mutations classified as functionally inactive (≤20% of wildtype transactivation ability) had different prognostic and predictive values in CRC compared with mutations that retained significant activity.Materials and methods:TP53 mutations within a large. international database of CRC (n = 3583) were classified according to functional status for transactivation.Results: Inactive TP53 mutations were found in 29% of all CRCs and were more frequent in rectal (32%) than proximal colon (22%) tumours (P < 0.001).

The cuticle is a multifunctional device that protects its carriers against dehydration. arms them against predators. constitutes a physical barrier to prevent pathogen entry and serves as an exoskeleton allowing locomotion.

Nuclear uptake of Dorsal depends on a complex signalling pathway comprising two parts: an extracellular proteolytic cascade transmits the dorsoventral polarity of the egg chamber to the early embryo and generates a gradient of active Spätzle protein. the ligand of the receptor Toll; an intracellular cascade downstream of Toll relays this graded signal to embryonic nuclei.

Effects on the capacity of net photosynthesis. dark respiration and …,1990,G Wallin and L Skärby and G Selldén,115,New Phytologist,2,335-344,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Rates of net photosynthesis were measured on Norway spruce. Picea abies (L.) Karst. exposed to three different concentrations of ozone for three seasons (1985–7) in open‐top chambers. The treatments were non‐filtered air + ozone (NF +). non‐filtered air (NF) and charcoal‐filtered air (CF). Ozone was added daily between 11.00–18.00 local time. The study was performed during September and October. 1987. The rate of net photosynthesis was determined using an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) connected to a small cuvette. which was equipped with an artificial light source for unilateral illumination. The measurements were made on shoots of three different age classes: current year. 1 year old and 2 years old. Measurements took place at saturating light intensity (1150 μmol m1s1). at a temperature of 16.6 ±0.7°C. and at a relative humidity of 67.5 ± 5.3%. In current‐year shoots the rate of net photosynthesis …,True,7LdKMpwAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,130,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1990.tb00460.x,7298966047341544329,/scholar?cites=7298966047341544329,,https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1990.tb00460.x,0,0,0
