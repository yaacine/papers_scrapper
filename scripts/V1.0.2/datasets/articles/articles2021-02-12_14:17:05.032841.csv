123253,The complexity of failure: Implications of complexity theory for safety investigations,2011,Sidney Dekker and Paul Cilliers and Jan-Hendrik Hofmeyr,49,Safety science,6,939-945,Elsevier,Complexity theory suggests that we see performance as an emergent property. the result of complex interactions and relationships. This can clash. however. with what stakeholders see as legitimate and normal in accident investigations. When systems fail. it is still common to blame components (e.g. human errors) and when they succeed spectacularly. to think in terms of individual heroism (e.g. the A320 Hudson River landing). In this paper. we lay out the contrast between a Newtonian analysis of failure that can be recognized in many efforts at safety analysis and improvement. It makes particular assumptions about the relationship between cause and effect. foreseeability of harm. time-reversibility and the ability to produce the “true story” of an accident. With inspiration from complexity theory. failures are seen as an emergent property of complexity.

Autophagic flux is often defined as a measure of autophagic degradation activity. and a number of methods are currently utilized to assess autophagic flux. However. despite major advances in measuring various molecular aspects of the autophagic machinery. we remain less able to express autophagic flux in a highly sensitive. robust. and well-quantifiable manner. Here. we describe a conceptual framework for defining and measuring autophagosome flux at the single-cell level. The concept discussed here is based on the theoretical framework of metabolic control analysis. which distinguishes between the pathway along which there is a flow of material and the quantitative measure of this flow.

Moiety‐conserved cycles are metabolic structures that interconvert different forms of a chemical moiety (such as ATP‐ADP‐AMP. the different forms of adenylate). while the sum of these forms remains constant. Their metabolic behaviour is treated within the framework of control analysis [Kacser. H. & Burns. J. A. (1973) Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol 27. 65–104].2. To explain the importance of the conserved sum of cycle metabolites as a parameter of the system. the cycle is first regarded as a ‘black box’. The interactions of the cycle with the rest of the system are expressed in terms of ‘cycle elasticities’ and ‘cycle control coefficients’ by the usual connectivity properties. The conserved sum is seen to be an ‘external’ parameter in the sense that its effect is described by a combined response expression. All cycle coefficients can be written in terms of elasticities and concentrations of cycle metabolites.3.

123259,Quantitative assessment of regulation in metabolic systems,1991,Jan‐Hendrik S HOFMEYR and Athel CORNISH‐BOWDEN,200,,1,223-236,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,We show how metabolic regulation as commonly understood in biochemistry can be described in terms of metabolic control analysis. The steady‐state values of the variables of metabolic systems (fluxes and concentrations) are determined by a set of parameters. Some of these parameters are concentrations that are set by the environment of the system; they can act as external regulators by communicating changes in the environment to the metabolic system. How effectively a system is regulated depends both on the degree to which the activity of the regulatory enzyme with which a regulator interacts directly can be altered by the regulator (its regulability) and on the ability of the regulatory enzyme to transmit the changes to the rest of the system (its regulatory capacity). The regulatory response of a system also depends on its internal organisation around key variable metabolites that act as internal regulators.

This presents no special problem for reactions that follow reversible Michaelis-Menten kinetics. but for enzymes showing cooperative kinetics the full reversible rate equations are extremely complicated. and anyway in virtually all cases the full equations are unknown because suflciently complete kinetic studies have not been carried out. There is a need. therefore. for approximate reversible equations that allow convenient simulation without violating thermodynamic constraints.We show how the irreversible Hill equation can be generalized to a reversible form. including effects of modijiers.

Comparison of the DNA and protein sequence data suggests that a hydrophobic NH2-terminal sequence of 27 amino acid residues is removed from the primary translation product.

Lp(a) also competed with 125I-LDL for binding to human LDL receptors in intact fibroblasts. Binding led to cellular uptake of Lp(a) with subsequent stimulation of cholesterol esterification. After intravenous injection. human Lp(a) was cleared slowly from the plasma of normal mice. The clearance was markedly accelerated in transgenic mice that expressed large amounts of LDL receptors. We conclude that the covalent attachment of apo(a) to apo B-100 in Lp(a) does not interfere markedly with the ability of apo B-100 to bind to the LDL receptor and that this receptor has the potential to play a major role in clearance of Lp(a) from the circulation of intact humans.,True,LaYBCR0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,196,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/114602,14124708213681093784,/scholar?cites=14124708213681093784,,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/114602/files/pdf,0,0,0

Dispersions of PI in the absence of detergent are hydrolyzed at 1-3 pmol/min/mg of protein. a rate only 3-10% of that obtained when optimal concentrations of sodium deoxycholate are present. When hydrolysis of PI in microsomes from mouse L-cells is measured. only 0.01 pmol of PI is hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein. Lipid dispersions prepared from extracts of microsomes are also poor substrates. We added varying amounts of other phospholipids to PI dispersions to explore the effect on PI hydrolysis. Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) had only modest effects on PI hydrolysis. but phosphatidylcholine (PC) was markedly inhibitory.

Glucose oxidase was rendered inactive by removal of the FAD cofactor. The resulting apo-glucose oxidase still binds glucose as observed from a decrease in its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) was found to bind spontaneously to apo-glucose oxidase as seen from an enhancement of the ANS fluorescence. The steady state intensity of the bound ANS decreased 25% upon binding of glucose. and the mean lifetime of the bound ANS decreased about 40%. These spectral changes occurred with a midpoint from 10 to 20 mM glucose. which is comparable to the KD of holo-glucose oxidase.

The ANS-labeled enzyme displayed an approximate 25% decrease in emission intensity upon binding glucose. This decrease can be used to measure the glucose concentration.

The first approximately 30 residues of the 115 amino acid CO2H-terminal cytosolic tail (C-tail) of the Kex2 protein (Kex2p) contain a Golgi retention signal that resembles coated-pit localization signals in mammalian cell surface receptors. Mutation of one (Tyr713) of two tyrosine residues in the C-tail or deletion of sequences adjacent to Tyr713 results in loss of normal Golgi localization. Surprisingly. loss of the Golgi retention signal resulted in transport of C-tail mutant Kex2p to the vacuole (yeast lysosome). as judged by kinetics of degradation and by indirect immunofluorescence.

Dishevelled also has important roles in the governance of polarized cell divisions. in the directed migration of individual cells. and in cardiac development and neuronal structure and function.,True,aUwXBqEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,537,https://dev.biologists.org/content/132/20/4421.short,10038910650866629547,/scholar?cites=10038910650866629547,,https://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/132/20/4421.full.pdf,0,0,0

Noncanonical Wnt pathways are diverse and in many cases less characterized/defined. They are grouped into several categories for clarity and simplicity. Such classifications are not rigid as these pathways likely overlap with or intersect one another and are evolving.(A) Wnt/PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling. Vertebrate Wnt5a and Wnt11 initiate signaling via Fz. which may activate trimeric G proteins and Dvl (likely via phosphorylation). and the assembly of Dvl/effector complexes. Multiple pathways downstream of Dvl regulate actin cytoskeleton/cell adhesion.

The mechanism by which the enzyme is spatially and temporally controlled is not well understood. particularly because the dependence of calpain on calcium exceeds the submicromolar concentrations normally observed in cells. Here we show that the channel kinase TRPM7 localizes to peripheral adhesion complexes with m-calpain. where it regulates cell adhesion by controlling the activity of the protease. Our research revealed that overexpression of TRPM7 in cells caused cell rounding with a concomitant loss of cell adhesion that is dependent upon the channel of the protein but not its kinase activities.
