Ethylene Response Factors (ERF) are the last transcription factors of the ethylene signalling pathway and control a large number of ethylene-responsive genes. Two Hevea brasiliensis ERF. HbERF-IXc4 and HbERF-IXc5. are orthologs to ERF1 a key regulator at the crosstalk of ethylene and jasmonate signalling pathways. These genes were suggested to play an important role in regulating latex cell metabolism in response to tapping and ethephon stimulation. In this study. transgenic lines overexpressing HbERF-IXc4 and HbERF-IXc5 under control of 35S CaMV and HEV2. 1 promoter have been conducted. Transgenic Hevea lines were obtained by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation. The somatic embryogenesis process was affected by these modifications. Agrobacterium tumefaciens genetic transformation procedure has been developed from friable callus line for clone PB260. Hevea callus was sub-cultured as small aggregates on paromomycin selection medium. Transgenic callus lines were established from sub-aggregates showing full GFP activity. Ten transgenic lines were confirmed as transgenic by Southern blot hybridization. This result showed successfully establishment of H. brasiliensis transgenic lines.

NR is a very important industrial material for transportation. consumer. and medical. The demand for NR is increasing from year to year. NR is obtained from latex. The latex flows out from laticifers after tapping the bark. Ethephon. an ethylene releaser. can be applied on certain clones to stimulate the latex production. Tapping and ethephon stimulation are sources of harvesting stresses conducing to the production of secondary metabolites and consequent rubber. Ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signalling pathways play a crucial role in the response to latex harvesting stress. Two Hevea ethylene response factor genes. HbERF-IXc4 and HbERF-IXc5. were predicted to be orthologue to ERF1 from Arabidopsis. ERF1 was suggested to be a key component of defence responses through the integration of ethylene and jasmonic acid signalling pathways. Transcripts of HbERF-IXc4 and HbERF-IXc5 were dramatically accumulated by combining wounding. methyl jasmonate. and ethylene treatment. These factors were assumed to be a key regulator at the crosstalk of ethylene and jasmonate signalling pathways in latex cells.

The WD40 domain protein Ebi has been implicated in the regulation of Notch (N) signaling at the DV boundary (Marygold et al.. 2011). but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that Ebi regulates wing growth by antagonizing the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb). We identified Ebi as a binding partner for the extracellular domain of Crb (). Physical interaction between Ebi and Crb is specifically mediated by the WD40 repeats 7-8 of Ebi and a laminin G domain of . Wing notching caused by reduced Ebi can be suppressed by decreasing the Crb function. indicating that Ebi is antagonistic to Crb. The WD40 repeats of Ebi are essential for binding Crb and antagonizing its function. Consistent with the antagonistic genetic interaction. Ebi knockdown in the DV boundary results in an upregulation of Crb protein level. We show that a fraction of Ebi and Crb proteins are localized together to the endosomal vesicles. Reduced Ebi leads to an accumulation of Crb with recycling endosomes. We reveal that Crb is ubiquitinated. and Ebi is required for the downregulation of Crb by ubiquitination. Taken together. we propose that the interplay of Crb expression and its downregulation by Ebi provides a feedback mechanism for regulated N signaling during wing development.,True,lcGdhkAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://koasas.kaist.ac.kr/handle/10203/222123,,,,,0,0,0

Increased oxidative stress is thought to be the primary cause of arsenite toxicity and the toxic effect is thought to be linear with detrimental effects reported at all concentrations of arsenite. But the paradigm of linear dose response in arsenite toxicity is shifting. In the present study we demonstrate that arsenite effects on mitochondrial respiration in primary hepatocytes follow a nonlinear dose response. In vitro exposure of primary hepatocytes to an environmentally relevant. moderate level of arsenite results in increased oxidant production that appears to arise from changes in the expression and activity of respiratory Complex I of the mitochondrial proton circuit. In primary hepatocytes the excess oxidant production appears to elicit adaptive responses that promote resistance to oxidative stress and a propensity to increased proliferation. Taken together. these results suggest a nonlinear dose-response characteristic of arsenite with low-dose arsenite promoting adaptive responses in a process known as mitohormesis. with transient increase in ROS levels acting as transducers of arsenite-induced mitohormesis.,True,HZoIWjsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,11,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/9251303/abs/,6658950790395888205,/scholar?cites=6658950790395888205,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/9251303/abs/,0,0,0

Evidence suggests that hypoxic survival often requires reprogramming of mitochondrial basal metabolism. However. our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial metabolism are still incomplete. During our studies evaluating the physiological significance of the mitochondrial transporter ABCB6. we uncovered a novel pathway in which loss of ABCB6 expression shifts the balance between mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis because ABCB6 expression decreased mitochondrial respiratory rate and increased glycolysis rate. More importantly. we found that the major transcriptional sensor of oxygen hypoxia‐inducible factor (HIF) was involved in the activation of Abcb6 expression under hypoxic conditions.

Therefore. understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the ‘cancer stemness’ of GSCs will be particularly important for improving the prognosis of glioma patients. We previously established cancerous neural stem cells (CNSCs) from immortalized human neural stem cells (F3 cells). using the H-Ras oncogene. In this study. we utilized the EGFRviii mutation. which frequently occurs in brain cancers. to establish another CNSC line (F3.EGFRviii). and characterized its stemness under spheroid culture. The F3.EGFRviii cell line was highly tumorigenic in vitro and showed high ERK1/2 activity as well as expression of a variety of genes associated with cancer stemness. such as SOX2 and NANOG. under spheroid culture conditions. Through meta-analysis. PCR super-array. and subsequent biochemical assays. the induction of MEK partner-1 (MP1. encoded by the LAMTOR3 gene) was shown to play an important role in maintaining ERK1/2 activity during the acquisition of cancer stemness under spheroid culture conditions.

In the present work. based on the chemical structure of YM155. total 26 analogs were synthesized and tested for stem-toxic activity toward human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced PSCs (iPSCs).

To overcome this risk. a variety of approaches have been developed to eliminate the remaining undifferentiated hPSCs via selective cell death induction. Our study seeks to identify natural flavonoids that are more potent than quercetin (QC). to selectively induce hPSC death. Upon screening in-house flavonoids. luteolin (LUT) is found to be more potent than QC to eliminate hPSCs in a p53-dependent manner. but not hPSC-derived smooth muscle cells or perivascular progenitor cells. Particularly. treating human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes with LUT efficiently eliminates the residual hESCs and only results in marginal effects on cardiomyocyte (CM) functions. as determined by calcium influx. Considering the technical limitations of isolating CMs due to a lack of exclusive surface markers at the end of differentiation.

They are playing an important role on the treatment of several diseases from diabetes to various types of cancers. Today most of the clinically effective pharmaceuticals are developed from plant derived ancestors in the history of medicine. In this study different parts of the plants. namely Centaurea virgata (Lam.). Cichorium intybus (L.). Euporbia macroclada (Boiss.). Melilotus officinalis (L.) Pall. and Zygophyllum fabago (L.) were evaluated for their potential medicinal value in terms of biological targets which are participating in antioxidant defense such as catalase (CAT). glutathione-S-transferase (GST). superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). The results indicate that the highest total phenolic contents of leaf and flower extracts were for E. macroclada. The highest flavonoid contents are detected for the leaves of E. macroclada and Z. fabago. The evaluation of extracts against biological targets reveals that the fruit extract of Z. fabago and the flowers of C. intybus show the inhibition against GST.

Differences between species in the complexity of the hunting with respect to communication. coordination and food sharing have typically been interpreted as a reflection of differences in cognitive abilities. Here we describe for the first time collaborative hunting where individuals play different roles in a fish species. the yellow saddle goatfish Parupeneus cyclostomus. Adults in our study area may live either solitarily or in relatively stable groups formed of similar sized and most likely unrelated individuals. The solitary life style was associated with searching for hidden immobile prey on sandy areas while group living was associated with collaborative hunting of mobile prey in corals.

In most biparental species. parental duties are switched repeatedly allowing for repeated mutual adjustment of the amount of care. In the mouthbrooding cichlid Eretmodus cyanostictus. terms are switched only once with females taking the first share. The timing of the shift of the clutch between mates strongly determines both partners’ brooding period and thereby their parental investment. Females signal their readiness to transfer the young several days before the male finally takes them. suggesting sexual conflict over the timing of the shift. In a lab experiment. we reduced the body condition of either the female or the male of a pair to test whether energy reserves affect the timing of the shift and whether female signalling behaviour depends on energetic state.

However. previous studies are observational. hampering our ability to identify individual decision rules that result in collaboration. We experimentally investigated collaborative hunting in yellow saddle goatfish (Parupeneus cyclostomus) by exposing pairs to a mock prey that fled to an artificial shelter with multiple entrances. The first fish to initiate the chase (the ‘initiator’) was always closest to the prey and pursued it directly in its path. Conversely. the behaviour of the second goatfish (the ‘follower’) depended on its spatial position relative to the initiator. When the follower was less than one body length behind the initiator. it also accelerated directly towards the prey in over 95% of cases.

Its evolution has typically been attributed to the resulting increased prey capture rate. Indeed. many studies have documented positive correlations between the number of individuals and probability of success. suggesting that joint hunting is cooperative. However. all existing data on vertebrates are based on field observations and hence cannot control for factors that may also influence hunting success. such as variation in habitat structure. hunting motivation or prey state.

These metalloregulators have recently been classified according to their structural properties into several families. one of which is the Fur family that is present in many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.[2] It comprises four proteins involved in metal homeostasis Fur (ferric uptake regulator).

Aeration inactivated two enzyme families—[4Fe-4S] dehydratases and nonredox mononuclear iron enzymes—whose homologs. in contrast. remain active in aerobic Escherichia coli. Inactivation-rate measurements of one such enzyme. B. thetaiotaomicron fumarase. showed that it is no more intrinsically sensitive to oxidants than is an E. coli fumarase. Indeed. when the E. coli enzymes were expressed in B. thetaiotaomicron. they no longer could tolerate aeration; conversely. the B. thetaiotaomicron enzymes maintained full activity when expressed in aerobic E. coli.

When oxygen levels finaly rose. they threatened specific types of enzymes: those that use organic radicals as catalysts. and those that depend upon iron centers. Nature has found ways to ensure that such enzymes are still used by contemporary organisms. In some cases they are restricted to microbes that reside in anoxic habitats. but in others they manage to function inside aerobic cells. In the latter case. it is frequently true that the ancestral enzyme has been modified to fend off poisoning. In this review we survey a range of protein adaptations that permit radical-based and low-potential iron chemistry to succeed in oxic environments. In many cases. accessory domains shield the vulnerable radical or metal center from oxygen.

However. it has recently been implicated as a key component of the aerotolerance in several facultative or strict anaerobes. including the highly pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. By combining 18O labeling studies to ESI- and MALDI-TOF MS detection and EMSA experiments. we demonstrate that the active form of PerR reacts with dioxygen. which leads ultimately to disruption of the PerR/DNA complex and is thus physiologically meaningful. Moreover. we show that the presence of O2 assists PerR sensing of H2O2. another feature likely to be important for anaerobic organisms.

1073732,Using bicarbonates for controlling late blight disease of potato plants under field conditions,2012,M. Abd- El- latif F. Abd-El-Kareem and Fatten,9,Life Science Journal,4,,,Late blight disease caused by P. infestans of potato plants was controlled under field conditions using potassium or sodium bicarbonates alone or in combination with Citral. In laboratory experiments. results indicated that complete inhibition in linear growth of P. infestans was obtained with potassium or sodium bicarbonates at 2% and Citral at 0.5%. Moreover. in field experiments. results indicated that the most effective treatment was potassium bicarbonate at 2.0% plus Citral at 0.5% which reduced the disease severity by 84.4 and 82.4% during two growing seasons. The highest reduction was obtained with potassium or sodium bicarbonate at 1.0 or 2.0 respectively plus citral at 0.5% and Redomil which reduced the early blight incidence more than 61.8% as compared with untreated plants. As for potato yield the highest increased was obtained with potassium bicarbonate at 2.0% plus Citral at 0.5% which increased tuber yield by 76.0 and 67.9% during two growing seasons. All treatments significantly increased the chitinase and β-1. 3–glucanase activities. The great increased was obtained with potassium bicarbonate at 2.0 or 1.0% plus Citral which increased the chitinase and β-1. 3–glucanase activities more than 120.0 and 220.1% respectively.

Math. Biol. Neurosci.,,Article ID 4,,Leishmaniasis is endemic in 88 countries throughout Africa. Asia. Europe. and North and South America. It is a vector borne zoonosis with important animal reservoirs and has a two stage life cycle-within animal vector and mammalian host. In this research article. a mathematical model is considered to analyze the disease dynamics of Leishmaniasis consisting susceptible (uninfected) macrophage cell. early stage infected (promastogotes) macrophage cell. late stage infected (amastigotes) macrophage cell and parasite population. The focus is to study the progression of the disease caused by pathogen within mammalian cycle. To study the model in broader aspect. a time delay is introduced into the system as there is a time lag in the interaction between uninfected macrophage cell and parasite population and spread of the disease. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations reveals that. the delay induced system exhibits changes in the progression pattern of infected and uninfected macrophage cell and parasite population. Control effect ie drug dosing can minimize the phagocytic state of macrophages and suppress the state change from promastigotes into amastigotes inside macrophages. Moreover delay induced control give better result than proposed model with control as healthy macrophage cell population reaches more stable nature. Optimal control theory facilitates a cost effective drug dose strategy that increases the healthy macrophage cell population. whereas decreases rest of the population.,True,eG6LKEoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,10,http://www.scik.org/index.php/cmbn/article/view/2371,1041880504087076199,/scholar?cites=1041880504087076199,,http://www.scik.org/index.php/cmbn/article/download/2371/1270,0,0,0

Mode of viral transmission is an important issue in biological point of view while modeling plankton dynamics in the presence of highly abundant free viruses. In this paper we formulate a simple predator-prey model with a viral infection in prey. We assume that the phytoplankton population can be infected by external free viruses following saturating functional form. Our results suggest that the nutrient enrichment can decline disease prevalence and the infection disappears if the nutrient enrichment is above a threshold value. However virus replication and half saturation constant of viral infection also play an important role in persistence of infection.,True,eG6LKEoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Pal/publication/259865741_Effect_of_enrichment_on_plankton_dynamics_where_phytoplankton_can_be_infected_from_free_viruses/links/0deec52e3389ba29a2000000/Effect-of-enrichment-on-plankton-dynamics-where-phytoplankton-can-be-infected-from-free-viruses.pdf,16445819090103111448,/scholar?cites=16445819090103111448,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Pal/publication/259865741_Effect_of_enrichment_on_plankton_dynamics_where_phytoplankton_can_be_infected_from_free_viruses/links/0deec52e3389ba29a2000000/Effect-of-enrichment-on-plankton-dynamics-where-phytoplankton-can-be-infected-from-free-viruses.pdf,0,0,0

In present investigation we emphasized the hypothesis that the zooplankton is less inclined to opt the food based on size selectivity criteria than the preferential selectivity for the safe non-toxic food species. Approach: As a test bed we select one nontoxic phytoplankton (Chaetocerous gracilis). one toxic phytoplankton (Microcystis aeruginosa) and one zooplankton (Artemia salina). Initially the experiment is setup through the small batch cultures of Nontoxic (NTP) and toxic Phytoplankton (TPP). Both the strains of phytoplankton are collected from the deltaic region of river Subarnarekha (87 31” E and 21 37” N) and the isolation is done in the laboratory. Similarly batches of zooplankton (Brand: Red Top. USA) are also hatched and maintained at optimal conditions in the laboratory. We set off the experiments with the physical parameters viz. Photo period: 12: 12 L: D cycle. Temperature: 26-27 C. Salinity: 10 ppt and pH of the medium 7.5. To evaluate our hypothesis in restricted environment we have introduced the zooplankton in a 3 liter beaker with 75: 25 (TPP: NTP) food ratio. Biological activities (feeding) are monitored for each of the species with regular recorded biomass count on each experimental day till the predator population goes to extinct.

The oil-containing seeds of Jatropha curcas plant. a shrub prevalent in many countries. were recently rediscovered as a possible feedstock for biodiesel production. Jatropha plants is affected by many type of pest. among them there are some major pests (less than ten type) which are responsible for flower and fruit abortion. Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (NPV) are belonging to the family of Baculovirus. which are often host specific and usually fatal for the pests invading Jatropha crop. This virus spreads among the pest only and the infected pest can replicate virus. The predator consumes the infected prey only due to tradeoff cost which is beneficial to the plant irrespective of the degree of infection. Taking account of the ecological and functional relation among the pest. predator. virus and the plant. we formulate a five dimensional nonlinear system for Jatropha pest management with application of viral pesticide and extermination of natural pest of Jatropha. In the present work we applied the pesticide in a single foliar application and notice that the pest extermination is not fully achieved. Hence. we apply the same pesticide in a periodic interval till pest exist in the system. We hypothesize that impulsively spraying of viral pesticide may help to eradicate the pest of Jatropha.

Toxic methanol is the major compound in impure alcohol when consumed. It causes severe health hazards and sometimes causes death. Methanol when breakdowns into formate in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes in human liver. it becomes toxic. This enzyme catalyzes the substrate (MeOH) to produce toxic metabolites (i.e. formate). In methanol toxicity. ethanol is suggested to inhibit the metabolism of methanol as antidote. This is the most common treatment for averting toxicity of methanol in clinics.

This bacterial cell wall growth occurs in the presence of enzyme released by it. After maturation by the cell wall formation. pathogenic bacteria become harmful for human body as they are responsible for different diseases. Antibiotics or drugs are employed for curing bacterial diseases through the inhibition of this maturation process and it occurs by the binding progression of antibiotics with the released enzyme. But nowadays. drugs or antibiotics like -lactum family (Amoxcillin) which are generally used for inhibition of bio-synthesis of cell wall become ineffective due to evolution of antibiotic resistance by the bacteria.

Al Basir,2017,Communications in Mathematical Biology and Neuroscience,,Article ID 17,,Leishmaniasis is a vector borne disease. which is caused by a protozoan parasite. Infected female sandflies\textit {(Phlebotomine sp.)} are responsible for such disease transmission. People can carry some species of Leishmania for long periods and the incubation period for Leishmaniasis may be few weeks or several months. Migration depends on host immunological status also. Leishmaniasis is endemic globally in ninety eight countries. Spread of the disease is intensely dependent on migration of the disease among human and vector between various regions or countries. Here. we formulate an -patch mathematical model (such patches can be some states. regions or countries) considering each patch have susceptible. infected human as well as susceptible and infected vector population. We have derived basic reproduction ratio for each patch as well as the general basic reproduction ratio for the system and shown that there exists a disease-free equilibrium that is locally asymptotically stable. Further. we study the system analytically and numerically when the migration between each patch of individual class of humans and vector effects the spreading of the disease. We also established the results taking into account for different number of patches for . Our result reveals that the movement of human and vector from each patch to another patch plays an important role for spreading of the disease.,True,eG6LKEoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,http://www.scik.org/index.php/cmbn/article/view/3361,,,,http://www.scik.org/index.php/cmbn/article/download/3361/1647,0,0,0

1073754,CRISPR-Cas mediated knockout of pdgfrB and foxc1ain zebrafish,,Marta Bastos de Oliveira,,,,,,CRISP Repeats are components of an immune system which protects many bacteria and archea against foreign genetic elements. They function by targeting these elements in a sequence specific fashion. guiding the nuclease Cas9 to degrade them. The CRISPR-Cas system from S. pyogenes has been adapted and is used as an in vivo genome editing tool in a variety of organisms. In this project. we established and optimized the CRISPR-Cas gene editing tool and use it to knock out (KO) genes of interest in zebrafish. This was achieved by co-injecting a gene-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 nuclease mRNA in the early zebrafish embryos. The cleaved DNA is repaired by Non Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism. generating unpredictable indel mutations. The induced mutations were detected by High Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) technique. The targeted genes were pdgfrß. foxc1a. fabp3a. fabp11a and s1pr1. in which a requirement for correct vascular development and function has been demonstrated by a morpholino-mediated knock down (KD) strategy. The pdgfrß and foxc1a genes were successfully mutated in the injected zebrafish and heterozygous carriers for the mutations are currently being raised. We anticipate that the mutant offspring of the carrier founders will be useful in loss of function analyses that will increase our understanding of the roles of these genes in kidney and vasculature biology and pathology. Despite the need to further investigate the specificity as well as germline transmission efficiency. the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a rapid and efficient way of modifying the zebrafish genome.,True,wnX6uJMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://files.webb.uu.se/uploader/858/BIOMSc-14-024-Oliveira-Marta-report.pdf,,,,http://files.webb.uu.se/uploader/858/BIOMSc-14-024-Oliveira-Marta-report.pdf,0,0,0

Our study resulted in capturing 200 individuals belonging to 2 orders and 8 species: one insectivore species (Crocidura leucodon) and seven rodent species (Microtus arvalis. Clethrionomys glareolus. Apodemus agrarius. A. flavicollis. A. sylvaticus. Myoxus glis and Dryomys nitedula). The species composition is different in the two areas: Crocidura leucodon. Clethrionomys glareolus. Myoxus glis and Dryomys nitedula are missing from our captures in Păstăraia Valley. while Apodemus agrarius could not be captured in Huşuieru Valley. Biodiversity indices show that species diversity is greater in Huşuieru Valley than in Păstăraia Valley and that the greatest number of species (S= 5). the highest species diversity (H= 1.45. c= 0.269) and abundance (24.76 ind./100 trap-nights) in different types of habitats were recorded in the meadow. In the overgrazed pasture. no small mammal species could be captured. The most abundant species in the two areas is Apodemus sylvaticus (44.01 ind./100 trap-nights) and the less abundant (excepting the arboreal species) is Clethrionomys glareolus (2.19 ind./100 trap-nights).There are only few research regarding the small mammal fauna of the Transylvanian Plain [2. 3. 5. 11. 20. 21. 25. 30]. some of the papers containing no more than several references on species present here. but no data regarding our study area are available.

The method optimization was performed to determine simultaneously. several relevant mycotoxins from corn seeds that were stored over 8 months. The mycotoxins selected for quantification were: aflatoxin B1. ochratoxin A and zearalenone. They were selected due to their high concentration in the fodder. For the development stages of the HPLC method. it was introduced an internal standard to have accurate results. Taking into account that the analytes should be extracted from the complex matrix they reside. an extraction procedure was performed. using organic solvents. and the selection after repeated tests demonstrated the best capacity for ethyl acetate. The recovery is about 60–70% after the extraction process also there is a good preconcentration (× 2.5) of the analytes and the internal standard for their quantification.The limit of quantification (LOQ) obtained by chromatographic parameters optimization. for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A were about 3–5 µg kg–1 and 14.4 µg kg–1 for zearalenone of raw biological material. making these values lower than those accepted by the actual normatives and regulations.(doi: 10.5562/cca1788),True,r76Vx6AAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,9,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/111036,4444857970743650795,/scholar?cites=4444857970743650795,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/111036,0,0,0

The deficiency of this lysosomal enzyme causes an autosomal recessive disorder. called metachromatic leucodystrophy. However. a low ARSA activity can be observed in clinically healthy people. called ARSA pseudodeficiency. In our study we investigated the possible linkage between ARSA activity and sulfatide deficiency causing characteristic aspects of degenerative diseases. such as end stage kidney disease. type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Parkinson syndrome. prostate cancer and HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. We used a spectrophotometric method to determine the activity of ARSA. This method of enzyme dosage is based on a 4 hour long hydrolysis of the ARSA enzyme on 4-nitrocatechol sulfate (p-NCS) substrate. The unit of this measurement is nmol/ml/4h. Our findings show significant values in type 2 diabetes. Parkinson syndrome and chronic kidney disease. The importance of sulfatide in these diseases is well-known. thus presumably the variation of the ARSA’s activity might play an important role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. involving a vicious cycle between sulfatide degradation andthese diseases.,True,r76Vx6AAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,2,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/amma/61/3/article-p233.xml,9064170166162888844,/scholar?cites=9064170166162888844,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/amma/61/3/article-p233.xml,0,0,0

The Drinos river section Virua-Andon Poçi (10km) was selected as study area. as it provides the optimal combination of the environmental factors relevant to the reproduction of otters. For the identification of the reproduction season of otters we used the following indicators or parameters: changes in the territorial marking intensity (measured as number of sprainting points/200m. number of spraints/200m. and number of jelly secretions/200m). changes in the activity along the river banks. and first sight of the cub's footprints following its mother while hunting. The highest values of the marking intensity were identified in April-May (in average. number of sprainting points/200m= 1.62. number of spraints/200m= 4.48 and number of secretions/200m= 0.72). indicating so an increase of the otter's marking intensity in this period in comparison with other months or seasons. In addition. in the same period (April-May) a high territorial marking activity along the river banks were observed (scratching. rolling. scent marking. male and female tracks and footprints at the same spots). First sight of cub's footprints in the middle of October 2011. is another key indicator for the identification of the start of reproduction season of otters. Based on these indications we conclude that the start of reproduction season for otters in the Drinos river coincides with the bimonthly period April-May. as the most typical characteristics the otter's reproduction behaviour are observed only during this period of time …,True,GG18fQQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ferdinand_Bego/publication/279524313_IDENTIFICATION_OF_THE_REPRODUCTION_SEASON_OF_OTTERS_LUTRA_LUTRA_IN_THE_DRINOS_RIVER/links/5594cfd908ae793d1379a19b/IDENTIFICATION-OF-THE-REPRODUCTION-SEASON-OF-OTTERS-LUTRA-LUTRA-IN-THE-DRINOS-RIVER.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ferdinand_Bego/publication/279524313_IDENTIFICATION_OF_THE_REPRODUCTION_SEASON_OF_OTTERS_LUTRA_LUTRA_IN_THE_DRINOS_RIVER/links/5594cfd908ae793d1379a19b/IDENTIFICATION-OF-THE-REPRODUCTION-SEASON-OF-OTTERS-LUTRA-LUTRA-IN-THE-DRINOS-RIVER.pdf,0,0,0

Growth evaluation of native tree species planted on post coal mining reclamation site in East Kalimantan. Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 134-143. Mining activities affect environmental qualities including the loss of vegetation cover and the damages of physical. chemical and biological properties of soil. As such. regulations enacted by the Indonesian Government state a legal obligation for mining companies to carry out reclamation on post coal mining site. Reclamation is an activity carried out to organize. restore and improve of environmental quality after mining operations to enhance the highly disturbed ecosystem of mined land into ecologically usable state. Yet. there is little body of knowledge on how to monitor the effectiveness of reclamation in improving environmental quality of ex-mining land. Aims of this study are to evaluate of the growth of native tree species planted on various types of reclamation sites in a mining concession in East Kalimantan. and to analyze the most influencing factor of their growth.

The importance of in-situ conservation area in mining concession in preserving diversity. threatened and potential floras in East Kalimantan. Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 198-210. East Kalimantan is the most well-known province in Indonesia with high natural resources. particularly from the mining sector. While delivering benefits for economic development. coal mining operation negatively affects biodiversity. Effort to mitigate impacts on biodiversity is by establishing an in-situ conservation area inside the coal mining area. This area is preserved in the form of arboretum from existing natural forests. The aim of this research is to identify the importance of conservation area in a mining concession in East Kalimantan regarding its plants’ diversity. conservation status. and utilization. The research was conducted by doing vegetation analysis and inventorying plant biodiversity inside the in-situ conservation area by using plot samples. The result showed that the in-situ conservation area protects at least 142 species with a high level of biodiversity on all vegetation phases. indicated by Shannon Wiener diversity indices in which all phase have an index higher than 3. It protects 22 species listed in IUCN Red List of threatened species and contains at least 90 potential plants utilized by traditional Dayak people in their daily life. This study highlights that the conservation area is an important part in mining management to protect biodiversity. and suggest that in-situ conservation area should be preserved by every mining concession.,True,DUgoPwUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,9,https://www.smujo.id/biodiv/article/view/3406,5383408102081745447,/scholar?cites=5383408102081745447,,https://www.smujo.id/biodiv/article/download/3406/2702,0,0,0

One plant taxon that is widely known as a starch source is Dioscorea (Dioscoreaceae). whose starch and protein content make it a healthy food. As the initial step to identify which varieties possess potential as starch sources. we conducted study on starch granule morphology of some local varieties of D. hispida and D. alata. The aim of this study was to determine shape and size variation of starch granule of each variety of D. hispida and D. alata. The results showed that starch granule morphology does not only vary between species of D. hispida and D. alata. but also among varieties of those species. The shape of starch granules in D. hispida is dominantly polygonal (polyhedral). It showed similar results as those reported by other authors in their studies. except that–in this study-we found there is also a triangular shape. which has never been reported before.

In particular. introducing crosslinking reagents into antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) should provide a means to covalently crosslink residues at the antibody–antigen interface.

In all of these functions. it is competing with other tRNAs of similar shape and function. and must both be efficient in the production of proteins. but also highly specific in decoding the genetic code. For these reasons. tRNA molecules are likely under heavy selection pressure. and engineering them unsurprisingly can lead to large fitness costs for an organism.However. if we are to engineer novel genetic codes to improve the diversity of protein function. it will be essential to seamlessly integrate new tRNAs into these novel genetic codes.

1073822,Enabling evolution with expanded genetic codes,2016,Drew Scott Tack,,,,,,The natural genetic code is largely shared amongst all terrestrial life. though variations do exist that provide evidence of genetic code evolution. The field of synthetic biology has developed methods to augment and modify the genetic code. by reassigning codons and genetically incorporating noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs). Most commonly. amino-acyl tRNA synthetases and their cognate tRNAs are engineered to recognize (NCAAs). the tRNA charged with an NCAA is then used during translation to decode the amber stop codon. Using this method. over 200 unique NCAAs have been added to the genetic code. allowing for the site-specific incorporation of useful chemistries. including covalent bond formation and fluorescence. NCAAs have been implemented in biological research and protein engineering. The second chapter of this dissertation explores the biophysical parameters that allow efficient crosslinking with a NCAA. We investigated several environmental factors which could impact crosslinking between two interacting proteins. We define a set of parameters that permit efficient crosslinking. Noncanonical amino acids are a potentially powerful tool in understanding genetic code evolution. Evolutionary experiments using NCAAs have already been used to explore proposed theories on codon evolution. including codon capture and ambiguous intermediate theories. Though several studies have explored the implications of NCAAs in evolution. significant obstacles have prevented the long-term evolution of wild-type organisms with expanded genetic codes.

About 7.2 million houses in the USA and 3.2 million in the European Union have an aquarium. and this number is increasing day by day. Ornamental fish farming is also growing to meet this demand. In India. the state of West Bengal plays the pioneer role for production of ornamental fishes. The ornamental fish trade also helps. to some extent. in improving the socioeconomic condition of rural people and in upliftment of the condition of rural women in India. A rich diversity of fish fauna. low investment in the business. cheap labor. easy distribution channel and export centers in the adjoining areas of Kolkata help the business to improve most. However. instead of a high demand in foreign markets. the business is a “neglected trade” in the state due to the huge losses faced by culturists by various disease outbreaks. The poor culturists now use various chemicals or disinfectants and antibiotics to get rid of the disease outbreaks.The commonly used chemicals. used as disinfectants. are formalin. malachite green. potassium permanganate and methylene blue and antibiotics are oxytetracycline. erythromycin. chloramphenicol and nitrofurans.

Induced breeding is a technique whereby ripe fish breeders are stimulated by pituitary hormone or any other synthetic hormone introduction to breed in captive condition. The stimulation promotes timely release of sperms and eggs.History of Induced breeding: The technique of induced breeding was first evolved in Argentina after producing pituitary extract by Houssay 1930 where viviparous fish was injected with the hormone to make premature birth. In the year of 1934. Brazilians were succeeded in induced breeding by pituitary extract. This technique was also followed in America (Merlin & Hubs) and in Russia (Gerebilisky). In India first attempt of induced breeding was made by Khan in 1937 on Cirrhinus mrigala. Later in 1955 Dr. Hiralal Choudhuri applied this technique in minor carps (Esomus danricus. Pseudeotropius atherinoides). Ramaswamy and Sunderaraj first induced to breed Clarias batrachus & Heteropneustes fossilis. The first successful induced breeding on major carps was done by Dr. Hiralal Choudhuri 1957–Cirrhinus mrigala. C. reba. & Labeo rohita.

Envir. Res,,1581-1603,,Water saving was and remains an acute problem in places with water scarcity and inaccessibility. In order to solve this problem. drip irrigation started to be used in many countries. and for the first time. in Kazakhstan. there were used cultures that consume water sufficiently in large quantities such as rice and soybean. Ways of irrigation have significant effect on elements of structure of a rice and soybean crop. Drip irrigation with a two-row tape way of crops forms essentially distinct structure of a rice crop in comparison with usual technology of cultivation of rice and soybean. Rice (Оryza sativa L.) and soybean (Glycine Max L. Merr.) crops were grown in 2013-2016 to determine effect of drip irrigation in the different variants water levels on growth and productivity under conditions of the south-east of Kazakhstan. In result of three years of researches on studying of rice and soybean drip irrigation efficiency were made the following conclusions: Drip irrigation (Di) with application of the mulching film promotes emergence of early and amicable shoots of rice and soybean. intensive growth and development of plants. productivity increase. Drip irrigation with use of the mulching film at 8-10 times reduces a contamination of crops of rice that allows to exclude application of manual use. mechanical and chemical processing of crops. Use of the mulching film under rice drip irrigation promotes creation of the favorable nitric mode of the soil with big accumulation of ammoniac and nitrate nitrogen and mobilization of motile phosphorus.

By employing the fossil record. we can investigate how animals responded to past climatic changes and biodiversity loss. The paleontological record of the late Quaternary (past~ 22000 years) encompasses a period of considerable environmental change in North America. Rising temperatures and climatic fluctuations are coupled with the extinction of the majority of large bodied mammals on the landscape. The combination of climate and extinction events led to changes in vegetation and community structure which likely affected the resources available and interactions between the remaining mammals within communities.

Soil nutrient content measurements measured using the flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS ) method. which uses barium chloride extraction. were compared with those of the now-unused Gedroiz method. which uses ammonium chloride extraction (calcium by titration. magnesium. potassium and sodium by weighing). Natural forest soils from the Ukrainian Carpathians at the localities of Javorník and Pop Ivan were used. Despite the risk of analysis errors during the complicated analytical procedure. the results showed a high level of correlation between different nutrient content measurements across the whole soil profile. This allows concentration values given in different studies to be linearly recalculated on results of modern method.

The aim of the study was to clarify the data on the distribution of S. herbacea within the Maramures massif of the Ukrainian Carpathians since this species is reported by different authors for the massif without specific geographical and habitats descriptions. Field studies were conducted in the Maramures massif on the slopes of Pip Ivan Marmarosky (1936 m asl) and Rapa (1872 m asl) mountains in 2017–2019.

Microbes employ systems of complementary carbohydrate-specific enzymes to deconstruct algal or plant polysaccharides (glycans) into monosaccharides. Because of the high diversity of glycan substrates. the functions of these enzymes are often difficult to establish. One solution to this problem may lie within naturally occurring microdiversity; varying numbers of enzymes. due to gene loss. duplication. or transfer. among closely related environmental microbes create metabolic differences akin to those generated by knock-out strains engineered in the laboratory used to establish the functions of unknown genes.

Bacteria digest and consume laminarin with laminarinases. Their genomes frequently contain multiple homologs; however. the biological role for this replication remains unclear. We investigated the four laminarinases of glycoside hydrolase families GH16 and GH17 from the marine bacterium Vibrio breoganii 1C10. which can use laminarin as its sole carbon source. All four laminarinases employ an endolytic mechanism and specifically cleave the β-1.3-glycosidic bond. Two primarily produce low–molecular weight laminarin oligomers (DP 3–4) whereas the others primarily produce high–molecular weight oligomers (DP > 8). which suggests that these enzymes sequentially degrade laminarin.

1073878,Determining and differentiating protein-biopolymer interactions,2017,Geethika Yalamanchili,,,,,,The goal of my research is to understand how proteins selectively bind biopolymers. This problem is closely examined by quantitative modeling of the readout mechanism of protein binding to DNA. determining the specific DNA sequences recognized by transmembrane receptors and resolving the effect of enzymes on polysaccharides. I have developed both computational and experimental tools that identify various factors governing the protein- biopolymer interactions. Below. I list the major projects that I worked on during the course of my PhD.    Promoter engineering aims at defining gene expression patterns. which in turn define the behavior of the cells. To date. promoter engineering has been done by trail and error methods experimentally. which is labor intensive and makes it difficult to identify the controlling parameters. Hence it is important to resort to more robust computational methods to make the process less probabilistic. In the past. several computational models have tried to characterize the promoter functionality and strength based on the sequence of the core binding regions (-10. -35. extended -10. discriminator region). but have not been successful. This leads us to believe that various other factors are involved in characterizing the promoter activity.  In this work. we try to uncover the importance of shape features and flanking regions in differentiating the functionality of the promoter regions. We used the experimentally determined promoters regions of  σ70  and σ 38 holoenzyme as our database. This work has important applications for promoter design in bacterial genome engineering.

Marine algae hold great promise for biofuel production and have advantages over terrestrial biomass and freshwater algae. Despite this potential. little effort has been made to date to harness the enzymatic machinery that bacteria use to convert marine algal carbohydrates into bioenergy substrates. Our project capitalizes on this unexplored opportunity via three distinct activities: bioprospecting for novel algal polysaccharide-degrading genes. functional screening for enzymes with desired biochemical properties. and repackaging pathways in reusable genetic modules.Brown seaweeds are an attractive source of feedstocks for biofuel production. since they have advantages over terrestrial feedstocks.

Clinically. corticosteroid therapies are applied systemically or via inhalation for the treatment of lung inflammation. and a number of novel therapies are being developed that require preclinical testing. In alveoli. macrophages and dendritic cells play a key role in initiating and diminishing pro-inflammatory reactions and. in particular. macrophage plasticity (M1 and M2 phenotypes shifts) has been reported to play a significant role in these reactions. Thus far. no studies with in vitro lung epithelial models have tested the comparison between systemic and direct pulmonary drug delivery. Therefore. the aim of this study was to develop an inflamed human alveolar epithelium model and to test the resolution of LPS-induced inflammation in vitro with a corticosteroid. methylprednisolone (MP). A specific focus of the study was the macrophage phenotype shifts in response to these stimuli. First. human monocyte-derived macrophages were examined for phenotype shifts upon exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). followed by treatment with MP. A multicellular human alveolar model. composed of macrophages. dendritic cells. and epithelial cells. was then employed for the development of inflamed models. The models were used to test the anti-inflammatory potency of MP by monitoring the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators (interleukin (IL)-8. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β) through four different approaches. mimicking clinical scenarios of inflammation and treatment.

Desmarest. 1823),2017,Marion R Hauville and Eric J Cassiano and Kevin P Barden and Matthew L Wittenrich and Craig A Watson,48,Aquaculture Research,10,5439-5442,,The French grunt. Haemulon flavolineatum. has emerged as a candidate species for aquaculture due to its popularity in aquarium displays and recent success in larval rearing. Major obstacles to commercial production of grunts are reported to be the control of captive maturation and finding suitable first feed organisms (Chang. 1997; Leu. Meng. Siong. Kuo. and Hung. 2012). The first feeding stage of marine fish. when larvae transition from relying on endogenous yolk reserves to feeding exogenously. is the most often reported bottleneck to large-scale. commercial production of marine fish (Olivotto. Holt. Carnevali & Holt. 2006; Cassiano. Wittenrich. Violetta & Watson 2012). Studies have demonstrated increased growth and survival of larvae fed copepod nauplii through larval development. supporting the notion that copepods are an ideal prey source (Olivotto. Holt.

1073938,Larviculture and nutrition of three of Florida’s high value food and stock enhancement finfish. common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus …,2014,Marion R Hauville,,,,,University of Stirling,The main objective of this thesis was to gain new insights in three of Florida’s high value food and stock enhancement finfish nutrition (Common snook. Florida pompano and red drum) to improve larviculture protocols. The main bottleneck in snook production is the extremely low larval survival rate. which hinders subsequent research. This work first focused on the source of the larvae by looking at potential nutritional deficiencies in captive broodstock. The lipid composition of wild and captive common snook broodstock were compared to identify disparities and gain the information necessary for the formulation of a suitable diet for captive stocks. Results showed that captive snook lipid content was significantly higher than that of wild fish. However. cholesterol and arachidonic acid (ARA) levels were significantly lower compared to wild broodstock. with potential impact on steroid and prostaglandin production. reproductive behavior and gametogenesis. Eggs from captive broodstock incorporated high docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels and low ARA levels. Consequently. ARA/EPA ratio in captive eggs was more than half of that in wild eggs (2.3 ± 0.6 and 0.9 ± 0.1 respectively). with a probable perturbation in eicosanoid production and adverse effects on embryo and larval development. The large differences observed between wild and captive broodstock most likely contributed to the reproductive dysfunctions observed in captive snook broodstock (e.g. incomplete oocyte maturation. low milt production and poor egg quality). In addition. the presence of hydrocarbons was detected in the liver of most of the wild …,True,eVbqrJEAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,1,http://www.storre.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/20896,15826592230166413331,/scholar?cites=15826592230166413331,,http://www.storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20896/1/M.Hauville-PhD.Thesis.pdf,0,0,0

We perturbed this system in vivo using a medically relevant radiation model in the presence or absence of ovarian function to understand integrated tissue interaction.   Methodology/Principal Findings Ovary-intact and ovariectomized mice underwent either no radiation or single fractional 16 Gy radiation to the caudal skeleton (I±R. OVX±R). Marrow fat. hematopoietic cellularity. and cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV %) were assessed. Ovariectomy alone did not significantly reduce marrow cellularity in non-irradiated mice (OVX−R vs. I−R. p = 0.8445) after 30 days; however it impaired the hematopoietic recovery of marrow following radiation exposure (OVX+R vs. I+R. p = 0.0092). The combination of radiation and OVX dramatically increases marrow fat compared to either factor alone (p = 0.0062). The synergistic effect was also apparent in the reduction of hematopoietic marrow cellularity (p = 0.0661); however it was absent in BV/TV% changes (p = 0.2520). The expected inverse relationship between marrow adiposity vs. hematopoietic cellularity and bone volume was observed. Interestingly compared with OVX mice. intact mice demonstrated double the reduction in hematopoietic cellularity and a tenfold greater degree of bone loss for a given unit of expansion in marrow fat.

Alterations in cell differentiation may play a role in CITBL. Marrow stromal cells harvested from p53 knock out transgenic mice were plated into culture flasks. Twelve hours after plating the flasks were irradiated at different clinically relevant radiation doses. The flasks were fixed and stained following two weeks. four weeks. and six weeks of culture and separated into three different analytical groups looking at: Mineralization. Adiposity. and Gene Expression between the different sets of radiation doses. We are investigating the effects of radiation. time dependent cellular differentiation. and reductions in mineralization and adiposity.

The hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effect of drug is a result of altered histological and antioxidant status of the organ. In order to document the extent of cisplatin (CDDP) effect on liver we have studied long term treatment of cisplatin (CDDP) to rat. In our previous studies we have demonstrated changes in reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione related enzymes of liver followed by increased lipid peroxidation process.Materials: Light microscopy (LM) was carried out in liver tissue by haematoxylin and eosin staining. Electron microscopy was performed by staining with uranil acetate and lead citrate.Results: Recent reports depicts that CDDP treatment caused significant alteration at histopathological level showing increased vacuolation in hepatocytes. A noticeable change observed after drug treatment is large perilobular connective and expanded portal spaces. Morphological alterations after transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed heterochromatic border in nucleus followed by prescence of large agglutinations of lysosomes. numerous rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and mitochondria has been observed as one of the significant effect of drug.Conclusion: Thus cytoarchitectural studies signify that long term of CDDP intervention at 0.4 mg/kg/day/animal caused least damage to liver.,True,ufAlmhUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,6,https://www.academia.edu/download/53486136/Cisplatin_Induced_Histological_and_Ultra20170613-32366-19xiydg.pdf,11983505846821995773,/scholar?cites=11983505846821995773,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53486136/Cisplatin_Induced_Histological_and_Ultra20170613-32366-19xiydg.pdf,0,0,0

1073987,Induction of Sirt1 and PGC-1α are important for aspirin ability to induce ApoE and PON1 genes,2017,P Kamble and K Selvarajan and D Litvinov and M Nandave and CA Narasimhulu,9,Biol Med (Aligarh),374,2,,In our previous findings we reported Aspirin (ASA) and Salicylic acid (SA) produced H2O2 which acts as an inducer of Sirt1 and other downstream targets of Sirt1. HepG2 cells incubated with either 50 μM and 0.1 mM ASA for 48 h showed an increase in Paraoxynase 1 (PON1). Apoliprotein E (ApoE). Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). ATP binding cassette (ABCA1). Fibrinogen growth factor (FGF19) and Sirtuin (Sirt3) genes. These genes might be beneficial to increase HDL levels and functionality. prevent LDL-oxidation. clear cholesterol and triglyceride. and increase Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). The rationale behind this study is that Sirt1 and PGC-1α induction by ASA shown in previous studies could be important to induce Apo E and PON1 gene. Also an increase in Sirt1 deacetylated and activated target genes such as PGC-1α. Tfam. UCP1 and STAT3 followed by increase in Sirt3 and Sirt4 would provide substantial benefits in increasing cell bioenergetics and mitochondrial biogenesis required for regulating various metabolic pathways.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can produce detrimental effects that include atherosclerosis. However. mild oxidized products could also impose antiatherogenic action. Present study suggests that HepG2 cells treated with [1-14C] Linoleic acid formed oxidized linoleic acid (13-hydroperoxy-9. 11-octadecadienoic acid)[13-HPODE] and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]. In addition to that cells exposed to oxidized [1-14C] HPODE showed peroxisomal degradation of oxidized [1-14C] HPODE to H2O2 which might be a lipoxygenase enzymatic reaction. Azelaic acid which is lipid peroxidation-derived lipophilic dicarboxylic acid is also formed during the reaction. The generation of this compound can induce anti-atherosclerotic effect. Similarly. in absence of HepG2 cells [1-14C] linoleic acid and [1-14C] HPODE independently formed least oxidation. Ox-LDL treatment to HepG2 cells at 0-4 h showed increase in H2O2 generation.

However. genetic diversity studies using molecular markers with Cerrado species are scarce. and the inadequate extractive exploitation of fruits and the expansion of agricultural frontiers may also affect genetic variability. Therefore. studies in this field are of interest as they can provide sources for conservation and breeding programs. In this context. we investigated the genetic diversity of native populations of C. adamantium from different sites and the relationship between genetic variability and the land use and land cover of each site. A total of 207 plants were sampled in seven sites and characterized with seven polymorphic microsatellite markers. The use and coverage of land were mapped based on aerial images. and the land was classified into different categories. The genetic diversity was high in all populations. with low levels of differentiation due to allele sharing. mainly in Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraguay populations. The geographically closest populations were more genetically similar. The use and coverage of land indicated that intense agriculture promotes a significant decrease in genetic variability.

In this paper. we present a novel rule-based XAI strategy (including pre-processing. knowledge-extraction and functional validation) for finding biologically relevant sequential patterns from longitudinal human gene expression data (GED). To illustrate the performance of our pipeline. we work on in vivo temporal GED collected within the course of a long-term dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (GSE77962). As validation populations. we employ three independent datasets following the same experimental design. As a result. we validate primarily extracted gene patterns and prove the goodness of our strategy for the mining of biologically relevant gene-gene temporal relations. Our whole pipeline has been gathered under open-source software and could be easily extended to other human temporal GED applications.,True,LF6JmIYAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,3,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007792,152543804006536417,/scholar?cites=152543804006536417,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007792,0,0,0

Inter-individual variability in metformin response could be partially explained by the genetic component. Here. we aimed to test whether common genetic variants can predict the response to metformin intervention in obese children. The study was a multicenter and double-blind randomized controlled trial that was stratified according to sex and pubertal status in 160 children with obesity. Children were randomly assigned to receive either metformin (1g/d) or placebo for six months after meeting the defined inclusion criteria. We conducted a post hoc genotyping study in 124 individuals (59 placebo. 65 treated) comprising finally 231 genetic variants in candidate genes. We provide evidence for 28 common variants as promising pharmacogenetics regulators of metformin response in terms of a wide range of anthropometric and biochemical outcomes. including body mass index (BMI) Z-score. and glucose. lipid. and inflammatory traits. Although no association remained statistically significant after multiple-test correction. our findings support previously reported variants in metformin transporters or targets as well as identify novel and promising loci. such as the ADYC3 and the BDNF genes. with plausible biological relation to the metformin’s action mechanism.

1074011,Epigenética de la obesidad,2018,Concepción María Aguilera and Augusto Anguita-Ruiz,2,"Nutrición Clínica En Medicina, XII",,47-60,,>> ABSTRACTEpigenetics is defined as heritable modifications in the expression of genes that can not be explained by changes in the ADN sequence. Epigenetic changes are modulated by environmental exposure (including nutrition and physical activ ity). so that epigenetics is presented as a possible factor involved in the deve lopment of diseases such as obesity. Currently the study of obesity epigenome focuses mainly on the analysis of ADN methylation patterns. particularly due to the stability in the extracted ADN compared to other epigenetic marks. such as histone modifications. In addition. due to its biological plasticity. it is an attractive biomarker with great potential for clinical utility. One of the tools that is helping to know the epigenetic characteristics of obese individuals are studies of type EWAS (epigenomewide association study). which are characterized by analyzing thousands or millions of CpGs in a certain number of individuals. The realization of EWAS in peripheral blood of children and its relationship with obesity is of great interest both for the study of the influence of maternal obesity and for the detection of epigenetic markers in childhood in order to make an early diagnosis of deve lopment of the disease and its metabolic complications. The validity of this type of studies is evident. Several studies have demonstrated the stability of epigenetic marks in the form of ADN methylations during the first years of life. as well as the influence of environmental factors during pregnancy. The objectives of this review are: 1) to understand the molecular basis of the regulation of gene expression through epigenetic modifications; 2) to describe …,True,LF6JmIYAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,3,http://www.aulamedica.es/nutricionclinicamedicina/pdf/5062.pdf,12377849192672622167,/scholar?cites=12377849192672622167,,http://www.aulamedica.es/nutricionclinicamedicina/pdf/5062.pdf,0,0,0

Moreover. puberty could also influence this relationship. since it entails physiological cardiometabolic changes. We aimed to evaluate plasma antioxidants and oxidative stress biomarkers in MU and metabolically healthy (MH) prepubertal and pubertal children and their associations with pro-inflammatory and endothelial damage biomarkers. taking puberty into account. A total of 1444 Spanish children aged 3–17 years (48.9% males. 66% prepubertal. 47.1% with obesity) were recruited. Blood pressure. anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. and children were categorized as having a MU or MH status according to risk factors. Retinol. carotenes. tocopherols. total antioxidant capacity (TAC). oxidized low-density lipoprotein and selected pro-inflammatory and endothelial damage biomarkers were analyzed. General linear models adjusted for age. sex. recruitment center and body mass index. partial correlations and stepwise linear regressions were performed. Lower carotenes and tocopherols levels were found in MU than in MH children. Plasma TAC was lower in prepubertal and higher in pubertal children with obesity compared to normal-weight children. Antioxidants and oxidative stress biomarkers showed novel associations with several pro-inflammatory and endothelial damage biomarkers. with pubertal differences. supporting the importance of considering both the antioxidant and oxidative stress status and puberty in the prevention of metabolic diseases in childhood.

Furthermore. we aimed to solve the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of HPV16 PsV. The suspension f HEK-293 FT cells were generated from adherent cells by a stepwise decrease in serum content and the addition of an anti-clumping agent during culturing. The resultant HEK-293 FT suspension cells were transfected with an L1/L2 expression vector and pN31-EGFP plasmid to generate HPV16 PsV in the Wave Bioreactor. Following cell lysis. HPV16 PsV was purified by sucrose density gradient and subsequent CsCl iso-density gradient ultra-centrifugation The final titer of HPV16 PsV was 8.2× 10 (5) TCID (50)/μL. Purified HPV16 PsV was comfirmed to as contain L1 and L2protein by western blotting. and the L1 concentration was determined to be 156.0 μg/mL by quantitative ELISA.

Azoles are the principal class of antifungal drug and the only available oral treatment for fungal disease. Recent occurrence and increase in azole resistance is a major concern worldwide. Known azole resistance mechanisms include over—expression of efflux pumps and mutation of the gene encoding the target protein cyp51a. however. for one of the most important fungal pathogens of humans. Aspergillus fumigatus. much of the observed azole resistance does not appear to involve such mechanisms. Here we present evidence that azole resistance in A. fumigatus can arise through mutation of components of mitochondrial complex I. Gene deletions of the 29.9KD subunit of this complex are azole resistant. less virulent and exhibit dysregulation of secondary metabolite gene clusters in a manner analogous to deletion mutants of the secondary metabolism regulator. LaeA. Additionally we observe that a mutation leading to an E180D amino acid change in the 29.9 KD subunit is strongly associated with clinical azole resistant A. fumigatus isolates. Evidence presented in this paper suggests that complex I may play a role in the hypoxic response and that one possible mechanism for cell death during azole treatment is a dysfunctional hypoxic response that may be restored by dysregulation of complex I.

Furthermore. the situation is worsening due to advent of increased antibiotic resistance due to the evolution of multi-resistant antibiotic plasmid genes. Extended Spectrum B-lactmases (ESBLs) are plasmid mediated and these enzyme producing organisms exhibit co resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The wide spread presence of drug resistant E. coli and other pathogens in our environment necessitates regular monitoring of antibiotics susceptibility trends in the clinical isolates obtained from different regions to provide the basis for developing National and International prescription programs that can be used for delineating guidelines to maintain the desired effectiveness of antibiotics. In the present study. out of 135 isolates. 76 isolates were of E. coli. These isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and plasmid profiles. The results revealed that more than 50% of the isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance. Out of 76 E. coli isolates. 40 (52.6%) were found to possess plasmids. Some isolates possess single sized plasmid while other had multiple plasmids with different size ranged from 2.3 kb to 26 kb. very high antibiotic resistance was detected from isolates possessing high molecular weight plasmids (23kb).

They were randomly divided into 3 equal groups. Groups 1 and 2 received 10 and 20 mm Hg CO2 pressures during pneumoperitoneum. respectively. and group 3 was the control group. CO2 gas was insufflated through a cannula into abdominal cavity of rats in groups 1 and 2 for one hour; then perfusion was performed for half an hour. In group 3. cannula was put into the rats’ abdominal cavities without releasing any gas. Then the rats were killed. and their livers and spleens were removed after laparotomy to study expression of gene P33 and apoptosis using RT-PCR and TUNEL techniques.Results: The TUNEL technique revealed a significant rise in apoptosis in liver cells of rats that received 20 mm Hg pressure of gas compared to rats that received 10 mm Hg pressure of gas and the control group (P< 0.001). Similarly. the increase in apoptosis in spleen cells was also significant in rats that received 20 mmHg gas pressure compared to rats in 10 mmHg gas pressure and control groups (P< 0.006). Furthermore. RT-PCR revealed a significant decrease in P33 gene mRNA in liver and spleen cells in 20 mmHg group compared to other two groups (P< 0.001).Conclusion: Pressure level and duration of CO2 gas administration affect viability of liver and spleen cells.

Here. we show that the circadian clock gates shade-induced gene expression and hypocotyl elongation at night. ELF3 is involved in nighttime suppression via interaction with and inactivation of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7). Loss of function of ELF3 restores the shade induction. which is largely reduced in the absence of PIF7. indicating that ELF3 acts upstream of PIF7.

We would expect mimics to resemble their models closely. yet the widespread existence of imperfect mimics confounds this expectation. and has led to a profusion of possible explanations for the phenomenon. Despite this. we still lack an understanding of what general evolutionary principles. if any. result in imperfect mimicry. A common approach to this problem is to test and compare several imperfect mimicry hypotheses with the aim of uncovering such general evolutionary principles. We suggest. however. that a better understanding of the hypotheses and clarification of the distinctions or similarities between them is necessary. since each hypothesis makes very different assumptions. requiring different analytical approaches.

THP-1. The effects were assessed by measuring the levels of secretory proteins and mRNA of TNF-α and IL-6. the levels of nitric oxide (NO) secretion and the expression of iNOS in THP-1 cells. Cells were treated with 5 μg lipopolysaccharide/ml (LPS) in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of extracts from the aerial parts of H. triquetrifolium. During the entire experimental period. we used extract concentrations (up to 250 μg mL−1) that had no cytotoxic effects. as measured with MTT and LDH assays. Hypericum triquetrifolium extracts remarkably suppressed the LPS-induced NO release. significantly attenuated the LPS-induced transcription of iNOS and inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the expression and release of TNF-α.

This in vitro study aimed to investigate the role of Hypericum triquetrifolium (50% ethanol: 50% water) extract (HTE) treatment on apoptosis. cell cycle modulation. and cell cycle arrest in human colon cancer cell line (HCT-116). HTE induced cell death via an apoptotic process. as assayed by an Annexin V-Cy3 assay. Exposing HCT-116 cells to 0.064. 0.125. 0.25. and 0.5 mg/mL of HTE for 24 h led to 50±9%. 71.6±8%. 85±5%. and 96±1.5% apoptotic cells. respectively. HCT-116 cells treated with 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL HTE for 3 h resulted in 38.9±1.5% and 57.2±3% cleavage of caspase-3-specific substrate. respectively. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the HTE extract had no effect on mRNA levels of Apaf-1 and NOXA. Moreover. the addition of 0.125 mg/mL and 0.25 mg/mL HTE for 24 h was clearly shown to attenuate the cell cycle progression machinery in HCT-116 cells. GC/MS analysis of the extract identified 21 phytochemicals that are known as apoptosis inducers and cell cycle arrest agents. All the compounds detected are novel in H. triquetrifolium. These results suggest that HTE-induced apoptosis of human colon cells is mediated primarily through the caspase-dependent pathway. Thus.

1074166,Removal and Re‐use of Tar‐contaminated Sediment by Freeze‐dredging at a Coking Plant Luleå. Sweden,2016,Susanne C Rostmark and Manuel Colombo and Sven Knutsson and Gunilla Öberg,88,Water Environment Research,9,847-851,Water Environment Federation,Submerged tar‐contaminated sediment are generally very loose. which makes remediation challenging. We tested if a modified version of freeze‐dredging could be used to remove and dewater such sediment in a canal down‐stream a coking plant. PVC hoses carrying a heat medium were placed horizontally in the submerged sediment. Five days of freezing allowed straightforward removal of most of the sediment. Flat freeze cells were placed side by side in the canal to remove the rest. The freeze‐thaw process increased the dry substance content from approximately 50 to 80%.

Prochilodus lineatus. 16 sterol biomarkers were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry from fish muscle (n: 144) collected along 1200 km in the Rio de la Plata basin. Sterol concentrations were fairly homogeneous (2.4 ± 1.3 mg g−1 dry weight). but their proportion in lipids was highly variable and inversely related to both body mass and lipid contents. reflecting the more conservative character of sterols compared to the rapid accumulation of fat as fish grows. As expected. the muscle sterol signature was widely dominated by cholesterol (92 ± 4.5% of total sterols). but it exhibited a remarkable diversity with variable proportions of fecal coprostanol (4.0 ± 4.4%) and plant sterols (3.1 ± 1.9%. e.g. sitosterol and campesterol).

Its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and its exclusion from the transcriptionally inactive XY body in pachytene spermatocytes implicate it in mRNA transcription and transport. We generated Dazap1 mutant alleles to study the role of DAZAP1 in mouse development. Most mice homozygous for the null allele as well as a hypomorphic Fn allele died soon after birth.

1074172,FGF/FGFR signal induces trachea extension in the drosophila visual system,2013,Wei-Chen Chu and Yuan-Ming Lee and Yi Henry Sun,8,PloS one,8,e73878,Public Library of Science,The Drosophila compound eye is a large sensory organ that places a high demand on oxygen supplied by the tracheal system. Although the development and function of the Drosophila visual system has been extensively studied. the development and contribution of its tracheal system has not been systematically examined. To address this issue. we studied the tracheal patterns and developmental process in the Drosophila visual system. We found that the retinal tracheae are derived from air sacs in the head. and the ingrowth of retinal trachea begin at mid-pupal stage. The tracheal development has three stages. First. the air sacs form near the optic lobe in 42-47% of pupal development (pd). Second. in 47-52% pd. air sacs extend branches along the base of the retina following a posterior-to-anterior direction and further form the tracheal network under the fenestrated membrane (TNUFM). Third. the TNUFM extend fine branches into the retina following a proximal-to-distal direction after 60% pd. Furthermore. we found that the trachea extension in both retina and TNUFM are dependent on the FGF(Bnl)/FGFR(Btl) signaling. Our results also provided strong evidence that the photoreceptors are the source of the Bnl ligand to guide the trachea ingrowth. Our work is the first systematic study of the tracheal development in the visual system. and also the first study demonstrating the interactions of two well-studied systems: the eye and trachea.,True,oxg3B-QAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073878,7282802797956630380,/scholar?cites=7282802797956630380,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073878,0,0,0

The results show that a properly substituted cyclohexane unit and a six-carbon side chain seem to be indispensable for high ABA-like activity. whereas the oxidation state of the terminal carbon atom in the side chain appears to be less essential.

We also detected the DNA sequences of plants (cultivated and natural) that may have come from hamlets or isolated freshwater swamps located further inland.

Eleven of the 14 Peninsular Malaysian species range into the mountains. Distribution. disturbance adaptability and collection frequency were used to formulate their commonness category. Common (U. aurea. U. bifida. and U. minutissima) and fairly common (U. gibba and U. uliginosa) species are mostly lowland plants that ascend to open montane microhabitats. while the fairly common (U. striatula). narrow-range (U. caerulea pink form and U. involvens). rare (U. furcellata and U. scandens). and endemic (U. vitellina) species are restricted to mountainous sites. Common species that colonise dystrophic to oligotrophic man-made sites in late succession could serve as predictors for general health and recovery of wet habitats. Rarer species are often locally abundant. their niches situated around pristine forest edges. When in decline. they indicate the beginning of problems affecting the forest. Utricularia is reportedly nutritious. mildly astringent. and diuretic. Preadapted to nutrient-poor. waterlogged soils. U. bifida is suitable as an alternative for small-scale herb cultivation on low pH. wet poor soils usually deemed not suitable for any crops.,True,WW5HRscAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,3,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/234820/abs/,229281034856667801,/scholar?cites=229281034856667801,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/234820/abs/,0,0,0

Drought is a major production constraint for common bean. a situation that will be aggravated with current climate change scenarios. In this context. new tools designed to understand the genetic basis governing the phenotypic responses to abiotic stress are required to improve transfer of desirable traits into cultivated beans.

This population was assessed under drought conditions in two field trials for yield. 100 seed weight. iron and zinc accumulation. phenology and pod harvest index. Transgressive segregation was observed for most of these traits. Yield was positively correlated with yield components and pod harvest index (PHI). and negative correlations were found with phenology traits and micromineral contents.

Geomorphologia Slovaca et Bohemica. 7. 2007. 2. 8 Figs.. 5 Refs. The paper summarizes the results of measuring accumulation forms (bars) in the Bodva river. Measuring and assessing the bars with each part being 100 meter long it was possible to process the statistics of changes of accumulation forms and compare it with conversion longitudinal glide slope of the Bodva river. It was also possible to relate the changes of accumulation forms with the changes of geological forms in the borders with the Medzevská Pahorkatina hills as a part of the Košická valley into the Volovské vrchy Mts.

We stemmed from the 100 metres area measurements. The measurements were processed and evaluated for one kilometre length. The analysis of accumulation forms was processed in relative values (the share of absolute length/width of accumulation forms to number). Specific parameter formulated as share of channel area to summary areas of accumulation forms was used. The pictures 4 and 5 depict the correlations relative values size parameters of accumulation forms in the studied area. The picture 7 demonstrates the rate between the area of the channel and the area of the accumulation forms. This relation is convenient to show the intensity of sediments accumulation and so the creation of floods. The influence of inclination which compensates the rise of water level and flooding is included in the formula.

While the relationship between valley and channel parameters has previously been researched. establishment of the diverse conditions in trough formation enables better understanding of the basin/riverbed relationship. Our research is based on field measurements of representative sections of nine segments defined by changes in the longitudinal profile. The field measurements were performed in autumn months during a low water period to ensure the best conditions for repeated measurements. Significantly. as much as 75% asymmetry of the measured flow encourages the assumption of strong tectonic influence on the riverbed formation. While the difference between the assumed continuous changes of measured parameters and the actual measured or evaluated parameters remains a matter of interpretation. the detected anomalies enable interpretation of the parameters’ relationships. The river bed and the valley morphological parameters were evaluated on the model of The Olšava River basin which drains the eastern part of the Košická kotlina Basin (the Toryská pahorkatina Upland). The location of the basin at the foot of the Slanské vrchy Mts. is an important factor in the formation of the river network asymmetries.

The tree species composition is analysed and interpreted in relation with altitude. inclination and exposure of slopes. geological base as well as natural ecological requirements of each species. We found the hornbeam is the most widespread tree species in the Slovenský kras.

Its pathogenesis. however. remains largely unclear. The purpose of the present work was to gain an insight into the role of contractility and microbiota in the etiology of CC. To this end. we studied spontaneous and evoked contractile activity of descending colon segments from patients that have undergone surgery for refractory forms of CC. The juxta-mucosal microbiota of these colon samples were characterized with culture-based and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. In patients with CC the spontaneous colonic motility remained unchanged compared to the control group without dysfunction of intestinal motility. Moreover. contractions induced by potassium chloride and carbachol were increased in both circular and longitudinal colonic muscle strips. thus indicating preservation of contractile apparatus and increased sensitivity to cholinergic nerve stimulation in the constipated intestine. In the test group. the gut microbiota composition was assessed as being typically human. with four dominant bacterial phyla. namely Firmicutes. Bacteroidetes.

High resolution maps based on objective spatial units are needed to more precisely detect associations between disease and environmental factors. Method: We propose to use a Restricted and Controlled Monte Carlo (RCMC) process to disaggregate polygon-level location data to achieve mapping aggregate data at an approximated individual level. RCMC assigns a random point location to a polygon-level location. in which the randomization is restricted by the polygon and controlled by the background (eg. population at risk). RCMC allows analytical processes designed for individual data to be applied. and generates high-resolution raster maps. Results: We applied RCMC to the town-level birth defect data for New Hampshire and generated raster maps at the resolution of 100 m. Besides the map of significance of birth defect risk represented by p-value. the output also includes a map of spatial uncertainty and a map of hot spots. Conclusions: RCMC is an effective method to disaggregate aggregate data. An RCMC-based disease mapping maximizes the use of available spatial information. and explicitly estimates the spatial uncertainty resulting from aggregation.

Local normal ESR values were obtained from hospital data. while geographical factors that include altitude. sunshine hours. relative humidity. temperature and precipitation were obtained from the National Geographical Data Information Centre in China. The results show that predicted values are statistically in agreement with measured values. Model results exhibit significant agreement between training data and test data.

1074248,Gel-based proteomics in plants: time to move on from the tradition,2015,Arun K. Anguraj Vadivel,6,Frontiers in Plant Science,,369,,In more than 20 years of the proteomics era. considerable technical developments and scientific discoveries have contributed to the advancement of this field of research. Gel-based proteomics has been popular for studying the proteomic changes during growth and development of plants as well as for the analysis of responses to different biotic and abiotic stimuli. The most widely used gel-based technique is two dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. in which around 2000 protein spots can be clearly visualized and processed prior to identification by mass spectrometry. Although many techniques have been developed to improve the quality and number of spots in a 2D gel. these enhancements are still not good enough to study the entire cellular proteome. It is important to also consider low abundant proteins. many of which could play critical roles in particular biological processes. Considering that thousands of proteins are expressed at a given time and each protein can undergo one or more post-translational modifications—are we able to capture all this information and the entire proteome using gel-based proteomic techniques? Are gel-free alternatives capable of addressing these challenges? The answer is no for both approaches. So. how long are we going to run traditional 1D and 2D gels in our research? Though we have been successful in developing many advanced gel-free proteomic techniques to study the cellular proteome. we still lack advances that enable the examination of each and every protein expressed in a system as well as any post-translational modification (PTM) at a given time.

1074253,GmMYB176 Interactome and Regulation of Isoflavonoid Biosynthesis in Soybean,2017,Arun Kumaran Anguraj Vadivel,,,,,,MYB transcription factors are one of the largest transcription factor families characterized in plants. They are classified into four types: R1 MYB. R2R3 MYB. R3 MYB and R4 MYB. GmMYB176 is an R1MYB transcription factor that regulates Chalcone synthase (CHS8) gene expression and isoflavonoid biosynthesis in soybean. Silencing of GmMYB176 suppressed the expression of the GmCHS8 gene and reduced the accumulation of isoflavonoids in soybean hairy roots. However. overexpression of GmMYB176 does not alter either GmCHS8 gene expression or isoflavonoid levels suggesting that GmMYB176 alone is not sufficient for GmCHS8 gene regulation. I hypothesized that GmMYB176 acts cooperatively with another factor (s) for the regulation of GmCHS8 gene expression and it may also regulate other isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes in soybean. The objective of this research was to identify the GmMYB176 interactome for GmCHS8 gene regulation and elucidate the role of GmMYB176 in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in soybean. GmMYB176 interacting proteins were identified using two translational fusion baits (GmMYB176-YFP and YFP-GmMYB176) by co-immunoprecipitation. followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The interaction of selected candidates with GmMYB176 was validated in planta and their DNA binding activities determined. GmMYB176 may form a transcriptional complex with Gm04bZIP and/or Gm05bZIP for the regulation of GmCHS8 gene expression.

It focuses on the systemic effects of fluoride (rather than the eects of fluoride on the teeth) since fluoride research concentrates largely on the teeth to the virtual exclusion of systemic eects. is is surprising given that fluoride is a known systemic toxin. About 400 million people (~ 6% of the world’s population) drink fluoridated water. e eect of fluoride on the teeth is topical (directly on the teeth) and not systemic. so drinking fluoridated water has no benefit. Fluoride is a lipid soluble neurotoxin and enzyme poison. Fluoride accumulates in the pineal gland (9.000 ppm on average) and bone. Dental fluorosis is a marker for skeletal fluorosis. At 1 ppm 32% of US children have dental fluorosis. At 1 ppm some sections of the population (eg infants) will ingest too much fluoride. Unfluoridated and fluoridated countries have similar rates of tooth decay. Given that fluoridation of water supplies is not necessary to maintain a reduction in tooth decay and that the side eects of ingestion are undesirable. the practice is likely to come under increasing scrutiny.

Several studies have also aimed to minimise the time required to establish death and implicitly reduce stress and pain (LAMbOO-IJ et al.. 2002; AcErEtE et al.. 2009). Slaughter is usually a two-step process. First. the animal is stunned to induce insensitivity to pain. and death is induced by various methods. including bleeding or oxygen deprivation (OLIVEIrA and GALHArDO. 2007). these two phases may occur together. but when they occur separately. the stunning time should be minimised to avoid recovery of consciousness before death (LINES et al.. 2003). When correctly applied. the stunning methods should cause little stress. improve the physical properties of meat. reduce muscular energy exhaustion. generate less lactic acid. maintain muscle pH balance. delay rigor mortis and. consequently. produce better fish quality (cONtE. 2004).A typical stunning method in the fish processing industry is thermal shock (ASHLEY. 2007). in which water temperature is decreased to approximately 1 c. this low temperature decreases metabolic rate and oxygen consumption. causing the fish to become immobilised until death (rIbAS et al.. 2007). the effectiveness of this …,True,b6_qcc8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ghadeer_Mehyar/publication/267032478_Effect_of_harvesting_time_and_storage_temperature_on_the_duration_of_Balah_stage_of_'Barhi'_dates/links/552380290cf2a2d9e146f472.pdf#page=8,5422697257694247239,/scholar?cites=5422697257694247239,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ghadeer_Mehyar/publication/267032478_Effect_of_harvesting_time_and_storage_temperature_on_the_duration_of_Balah_stage_of_'Barhi'_dates/links/552380290cf2a2d9e146f472.pdf#page=8,0,0,0

There are plant symbiotic-soil bacteria which can solubilize phosphate or produce IAA. The objectives of this research are to determine the best soil bacteria in producing IAA or solubilizing phosphate and to know their roles in promoting plant growth in unfertile soil. As many as 8 isolates of phosphate solubilizing bacteria and 5 isolates of IAA producing bacteria were found. Among those isolates. there were 2 potential isolates (P2 & P4) that were able to solubilize phosphate and 1 potential isolate (I3) that was able to produce IAA. Isolate P4 produced holozone as wide as 1.45 cm and isolate P2 was 1.3 cm. Meanwhile. isolate I3 produced the highest concentration of IAA compared to the other isolates. that was 33.3 ppm. These isolates were applicated further on unfertile soil (yellow soil) as a medium for soybean growth. Soybeans have been grown for 10 weeks to observe the effect of those potential isolates on plant growth and productivity.

Photolysis promotes drug release from the RBC carrier thereby providing the means to target specific diseased sites. This strategy is realized with a vitamin B12‐taxane conjugate (B12‐TAX). in which the drug is linked to the vitamin via a photolabile CoC bond. The conjugate is introduced into mouse RBCs (mRBCs) via a pore‐forming/pore‐resealing procedure and is cytoplasmically retained due to the membrane impermeability of B12. Photolysis separates the taxane from the B12 cytoplasmic anchor. enabling the drug to exit the RBC carrier.

1074307,Spatial and Temporal Delivery of Small Molecules from Long Wavelength Sensitive Phototherapeutics using Erythrocytes as Biological Carriers,2018,Christina Marvin,,,,,,The need for safe and potent therapeutics has prompted designs of site-targeting drugs and the development of delivery systems that spatially and temporally deposit active agents directly at disease sites. The work in this dissertation presents the design and implementation of a two-part drug delivery system in which light-activated B12 drug conjugates. loaded on erythrocyte drug carriers. photo-release bioactive moieties both in vitro and in vivo. Historically. light-activated “caged compounds” have been developed to trigger biological responses on command with light. Light provides exquisite control that allows for more precise study into the dynamics of biological systems. mainly in vitro. Unfortunately. most caged compounds have been limited to light below the optimal window of tissue penetration (long wavelengths. 600-1000 nm). severely limiting their utility in biological systems beyond imaging. Common drug carriers in clinical practice include liposomes and nanoparticles. However. both systems exhibit fast clearance from the body. prompting attention towards naturally derived drug carriers. such as human cells. This dissertation describes three generations of B12-loaded RBCs extended into the optimal window of tissue penetration and demonstrates the evolution of light-induced drug delivery from B12 scaffolds. Modification with fluorophore antennas alters the B12 photochemistry so that single photon illumination results in bond scission reactions and release of modified cargo. Both the RBC membrane and internal cavity can be utilized for drug delivery purposes. both having advantages and disadvantages.

One challenge of A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation is eliminating the bacteria after plant transformation to prevent detrimental effects to plants and the release of engineered bacteria to the environment. Here we use a reverse genetic approach to identify genes involved in ampicillin resistance with the goal of utilizing these antibiotic-sensitive strains for plant transformations. We show that treating A. tumefaciens C58 with ampicillin led to increased β-lactamase production. a response dependent on the broad-spectrum β-lactamase AmpC and its transcription factor AmpR. Loss of the putative ampD orthologue. atu2113. led to constitutive production of AmpC-dependent β-lactamase activity and ampicillin resistance. Finally. one cell wall remodeling enzyme. MltB3. was necessary for the AmpC-dependent β-lactamase activity and its loss elicited ampicillin and carbenicillin sensitivity in the A. tumefaciens C58 and GV3101 strains. Furthermore. GV3101 ΔmltB3 transforms plants with comparable efficiency to wildtype but can be cleared with sub-lethal concentrations of ampicillin.

Currently. how polar growing bacteria modulate cell wall hydrolysis during growth and division remains largely unknown. This work includes the comprehensive analysis and characterization of the role of cell wall hydrolyses involved in bacterial growth. division. recycling and beta-lactam resistance in A. tumefaciens. First. we performed bioinformatic analyses and used reverse genetics to better understand the role cell wall hydrolases in A. tumefaciens. Inactivation of most cell wall hydrolases. led to no phenotypic defects suggesting a high degree of redundancy. However. inactivation of the amidase. AmiD. and the lytic transglycosylase Atu3779. revealed significant changes in beta-lactam resistance suggesting that these proteins are involved in the activation beta-lactamases and outer-membrane integrity. Next. we developed a tool (Figueroa-Cuilan et al.. 2016) to dissect the role of essential genes. which enabled characterization of the essential regulator of cell division. DipM. a LytM-containing factor. Absence of DipM causes severe cell division defects. including increased cell length. mid-cell width and lysis. A cell wall composition analysis of cells devoid of DipM shows an increase in the activity of the PG hydrolases. lytic transglycosylases. suggesting that DipM may inhibit the activity of these enzymes.

This study aims to enhance water percolation in phosphatic clay using porous diatom frustules under laboratory conditions. Phosphatic clay collected from settling areas was brought to the laboratory for the experiment. Diatom frustules were purchased commercially and dry samples of the diatom. Didymosphenia were provided by the University of Colorado-Boulder. Oven-dried clay was mixed with diatom frustules into 125 mL centrifuge tubes following a 1:1 volume ratio as experimental set-ups while pure phosphatic clay was used as control.

They are specialized in the transcytosis of luminal antigens. Their transcytotic capacity and location in an immunocompetent environment has prompted the study of these cells as possible targets for oral drug delivery systems. Currently. the models most commonly used to study M cells are restricted to in vivo experiments conducted in mice. and in vitro studies conducted in models comprised either of primary epithelial cells or established cell lines of murine or human origin. In vitro models of the follicle-associated epithelium can be constructed in several ways.

A critical aspect is the dynamic culture environment they provide. However. the associated inherent requirement for controlled fluid shear stress (FSS) and therefore the need for precise pumps limits their implementation. To address this issue. here a novel approach to manufacture pumpless and tubeless organs‐on‐chips is reported. It relies on the use of a hydrophilic thread to provide a driving force for the perfusion of the cell culture medium through constant evaporation in the controlled conditions of a cell incubator. Well‐defined and tuneable flow rates can be applied by adjusting the length and/or diameter of the thread.

Differently. the existence of presynaptic release-regulating metabotropic glutamate type 1 (mGlu1) heteroreceptors in these terminals is still matter of discussion. although confocal microscopy unveiled the existence of mGlu1α with GABAB1 or GABAB2 proteins in cortical VGAT-positive synaptosomes. The group I mGlu agonist 3.5-DHPG failed to modify on its own the 12 mM KCl-evoked [3H]GABA exocytosis from cortical nerve endings. but. when added concomitantly to the GABAB agonist. it significantly reduced the 3 µM (±)baclofen-induced inhibition of [3H]GABA exocytosis.

The (±)baclofen-induced inhibition of [3H]GABA exocytosis was more pronounced in cortical synaptosomes from Grm1 crv4/crv4 mice. which bear a spontaneous mutation of the Grm1 gene leading to the functional inactivation of the mGlu1 receptor.

One of the efforts to improve the productivity of the soil is done by inoculating the microorganisms in the soil. that is with using mycorrhizal fungi. Sorghum bicolor is a plant that quite often found in Indonesia and resistant to heavy metals. for the example is chromium. Research of the mycorrhizal association of Glomus fasciculatum or Glomus mosae with plants in reducing heavy metal contamination has been done. but the mechanism of resistance to heavy metals Cr VI in Sorghum bicolor which associated with mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosae and Glomus fasiculatum has not been explained yet. The study was conducted experimentally using a randomized block design with three treatment concentrations of Cr VI (0 ppm. 5 ppm. 10 ppm) and 3 treatment\of mycorrhiza (without mikiroza; Glomus mosae; Glomus fasiculatum). Each treatment was made 5 replications. Plants kept in polybags arranged randomly. The study was conducted for one month. and the data were analyzed with ANOVA analysis with SPSS applications. The study aims to compare the effect of giving mycorrhizal Glomus Glomus fasiculatum and mosae to plant Sorghum bicolor on media contaminated with heavy metals chromium in various concentrations. The results showed that G. mosae and G. fasciculatum can increase plant tolerance to heavy metals. The presence of mycorrhizae cause the concentration of Cr VI is lower than in the absence of mycorrhiza on S. bicolor.

We documented the distribution of these species among the seven physiographic regions we recognize. The number of species in these regions ranges from 30 in the Sierras y Llanuras Occidentales to 135 in the Gran Sierra Plegada. The species reside in from one to seven regions (x–= 2.5). The greatest number of single-region species occurs in the Gran Sierra Plegada. About six out of every 10 species are restricted to one or two physiographic regions. which is of considerable conservation significance. We constructed a Coefficient of Biogeographic Resemblance (CBR) matrix in which the number of shared species is demonstrated as ranging from six to 73. We employed these data in building a UPGMA dendrogram. which illustrates that the low elevation regions cluster together. as well as the higher elevation regions. of which all of the latter abut portions of the former. The most distinctive but least speciose physiographic region is located in the southwestern corner of the state and abuts the most speciose region to the east.

Pharmacogenomics investigates the way that the variations of the human genome influence the specific responses to the medicines and allows the adaptation of the medication to the individual genetic constellation of a person. through “patient tailored” treatments. with increased efficacy and safety. The polymorphism of the genes that are involved in the metabolism of anti-epileptic drugs determine modified activity of the encoded enzymes; consequentially. differences result regarding the plasmatic concentration of the drugs. and there are also differences in the therapeutic efficacy and safety. more evident in the case of medicines with narrow therapeutic window. Genotyping CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 represents an alternative for traditional methods of investigation of the phenotype. and a predictive method for the low metabolizer status of the individual. status related to the increase of drugs’ toxicity and to more frequent side effects. Acenocoumarol is the main drug used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disease (TED) in Romania. although its adverse effects are causing 10% of the hospitalizations in the USA and Europe. There is a high inter-individual variability of the CYP2C9. with implications in the metabolism of acenocoumarol. Variability is caused mainly by the two frequent polymorphisms of the gene CYP2C9.

Genotyping prior to drug administration seems to be a promising clinical approach in order to reduce the adverse effects of the drugs and to increase their efficacy. Oral anticoagulants (OAs) are drugs largely used in the prevention and treatment of thrombo-embolic diseases. Patients under treatment with OAs present a high risk for severe haemorrhage. Irreversible inhibition of VKORC1 enzyme by OA blocks regeneration of vitamin K. which leads to unfunctional pro-coagulant factors. VKORC1* 2 haplotype is linked to an excessive anticoagulation risk at average doses of OAs. while other polymorphisms of the gene are linked to the resistance to OAs. Acenocoumarol is inactivated by CYP2C9 enzyme. so people carrying at least one defective allele CYP2C9* 2 but particularly CYP2C9* 3 are susceptible to excessive anticoagulation at average doses of acenocoumarol. In conclusion. the combined analysis of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 allows the explanation of 30-40% of the individual variability in equilibrium dose of oral anticoagulants and. consequently. in treatment response.,True,iZb4ulkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://www.terapeutica.ro/img/art/pdf/105/1.R.%20Militaru.pdf,,,,http://www.terapeutica.ro/img/art/pdf/105/1.R.%20Militaru.pdf,0,0,0

Thirty Swiss Albino BALB/C female mice were equally divided into three groups: normal mice group (GP I). untreated tumor positive control mice (GP II) and ELF MPs-tumor local exposure mice group (GP III)(1h/day. for 3 alternative days). Body weight changes and blood hematological findings of three experimental groups have been assessed. Tumor volume following up and structure changes of tumor tissues form the two tumor bearing mice groups (control and exposed) were scanned under light microscope (LM). ELF MPs caused a reduction in increase percentage of mice body weight. as compared with the untreated control mice. The results also indicated that tumor local exposure to ELF MPs retarded its growth activity. Moreover. ELF MPs can modulate some blood hematological parameters of exposed tumor bearing mice (lymphocytes percentage. hemoglobin concentration and platelet count). with respect to the control mice.

Therefore. there is a great interest in optimizing the computations performed with these models especially when considering development of specialized low-power hardware for deep networks. One way of reducing the computational needs is to limit the numerical precision of the network weights and biases. This has led to different proposed rounding methods which have been applied so far to only Convolutional Neural Networks and Fully-Connected Networks. This paper addresses the question of how to best reduce weight precision during training in the case of RNNs. We present results from the use of different stochastic and deterministic reduced precision training methods applied to three major RNN types which are then tested on several datasets. The results show that the weight binarization methods do not work with the RNNs. However. the stochastic and deterministic ternarization. and pow2-ternarization methods gave rise to low-precision RNNs that produce similar and even higher accuracy on certain datasets therefore providing a path towards training more efficient implementations of RNNs in specialized hardware.,True,6DnYAWAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,59,https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06902,5490824999935921798,/scholar?cites=5490824999935921798,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06902,0,0,0

Ltd,We studied the ability of typical unmyelinated cortical axons to conduct action potentials at fever‐like temperatures because fever often gives CNS symptoms. We investigated such axons in cerebellar and hippocampal slices from 10 to 25 days old rats at temperatures between 30 and 43 C. By recording with two electrodes along axonal pathways. we confirmed that the axons were able to initiate action potentials. but at temperatures> 39 C. the propagation of the action potentials to a more distal recording site was reduced. This temperature‐sensitive conduction may be specific for the very thin unmyelinated axons because similar recordings from myelinated CNS axons did not show conduction failures. We found that the conduction fidelity improved with 1 mmol/L TEA in the bath. probably due to block of voltage‐sensitive potassium channels responsible for the fast repolarization of action potentials.

Their membrane potentials are of particular interest because these axons are different from most axons that have been investigated using intra-axonal or gap techniques. One of the main differences is that gray matter axons typically have closely spaced presynaptic specializations. called boutons or varicosities. distributed along their entire paths.In response to electrical activation of bundles of parallel fiber axons we were able to record small (128–416 μV) but stable signals that we show most likely represented a fraction of the trans-membrane action potentials.

1074423,The responsiveness of the rat intergeniculate leaflet neurons to glutamatergic agonists,2007,A Błasiak and D Pękala and MH Lewandowski,58,Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology,4,669-681,,The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) has been shown to be a functional constituent of the circadian timing system. The IGL receives a monosynaptic input from the retina and is known to mediate some of the effects of light on the circadian clock. In the majority of retinal ganglion cells. glutamate functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter. The effect of monosodium glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). on the extracellularly recorded discharge activity of IGL neurons was studied in vitro. The application of monosodium glutamate induced either an excitatory. a biphasic or an inhibitory response. Application of NMDA induced an excitatory response in the majority of tested neurons. To determine the role of NMDA receptors in the response to glutamate application. the selective antagonist of NMDA receptors-AP-5. was applied to the incubation medium. The presence of AP-5 reduced the response of the IGL cells to focal application of glutamate and completely blocked their responsiveness to NMDA. To clarify whether GABAergic interneurons are involved in mediation of the inhibitory effects of glutamate. we repeated our experiments in the presence of bicuculline in the incubation medium. Since bicuculline did not influence the observed inhibitory effects. the involvement of GABAA receptors was excluded. The present study provides the first electrophysiological evidence that neurons in the rat IGL. respond to glutamate probably through NMDA receptors. However. our results also suggest that other types of glutamate receptors may play an additional role in mediating the action of this excitatory amino acid on the IGL neurons.,True,BNXKb0wAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marian_Lewandowski/publication/5657049_The_responsiveness_of_the_rat_intergeniculate_leaflet_neurons_to_glutamatergic_agonists/links/0deec514c881c0ce8c000000.pdf,12545677700302156158,/scholar?cites=12545677700302156158,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marian_Lewandowski/publication/5657049_The_responsiveness_of_the_rat_intergeniculate_leaflet_neurons_to_glutamatergic_agonists/links/0deec514c881c0ce8c000000.pdf,0,0,0

The boutons are usually found along the full path of typical grey matter axons (GMAs). They constitute ~50% of the GMA membrane and contain the machinery for transmitter release. The small diameters of GMAs (on average 0.17 um) has prevented intracellular electrical recordings and knowledge about electrical events in GMAs is therefore very limited. We have explored repolarization of the action potential (spike) in cerebellar parallel fibers in adult rat brain slices by utilizing a greasegap technique with which we can distinguish between fast (few ms) and slow (tens of ms) repolarization. The fast repolarization stops abruptly at a potential more positive than rest (’brake point’). and transits to a depolarizing after-potential (DAP) with a decay time constant of 65 ms on …,True,BNXKb0wAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://lsmuni.lt/cris/handle/20.500.12512/14343,,,,,0,0,0

Nature inserts and deletes residues to optimize energy and function. but allowing variable length indels in the context of an interactive protein design session presents challenges with regard to speed and accuracy. Here we present a new module (INDEL) for InteractiveRosetta which allows the user to specify a range of lengths for a desired indel. and which returns a set of low energy backbones in a matter of seconds. To make the loop search fast. loop anchor points are geometrically hashed using C α-C α and C β-C β distances. and the hash is mapped to start and end points in a pre-compiled random access file of non-redundant. protein backbone coordinates. Loops with superposable anchors are filtered for collisions and returned to InteractiveRosetta as poly-alanine for display and selective incorporation into the design template. Sidechains can then be added using RosettaDesign tools. INDEL was able to find viable loops in 100% of 500 attempts for all lengths from 3 to 20 residues.

The gene concept is used as an example of knowledge content that is common to both biological research and education. The purpose is to study how knowing about the gene is expressed in different forms of knowledge contexts at the university. This is important to study in order to understand documented learning problems regarding the gene concept but also to better understand the relation between knowledge in research and teaching. Knowledge has to be transformed to become an educational content. a process that is of special interest within the field of Didaktik. The thesis is based on three qualitative case studies.

1074454,En didaktisk studie av kunskapsinnehåll i biologi på universitetet: med genbegreppet som exempel,2015,Veronica S Flodin,,,,,,En gång i tiden undervisade jag mycket i mikrobiologi på universitetet. När jag som föreläsare efter ett tag hade blivit” varm i kläderna” började jag undra varför jag sa just det här innehållet och på det här sättet? Frågorna drev mig mot vetenskapsfilosofin men de fick väl inte riktigt något svar där. Jag kände mig heller inte riktigt hemma bland alla lagar och axiom. Så småningom var jag med om att samordnade ett pedagogiskt projekt där vi undervisade biologi med PBL (problembaserat lärande) som undervisningsmetod. Jag gick lite till grunden med PBL och fann att inspirationskällorna var pragmatismen och Dewey. något jag inte alls hade mött under mina teoretiska filosofistudier. Jag funderade över vad det betydde när jag föreläste (vilket vi trots allt gjorde till en del). och i princip sa” så här är det” och när studenterna sedan gick till att lösa (mer eller mindre) konkreta. komplexa problem och fann att” så här kan det vara”. Jag upplevde att det var helt olika syn på kunskap i föreläsningssituationen och i studenternas aktiviteter som på något sätt inte gick att förena. Dessa frågor drev mig vidare mot en forskningsansökan med titeln” Preliminary study of the didactics in advanced education in biology”. Det här var nu rätt många år sedan och didaktiken fanns inte alls som fält på det sättet som det finns idag. På ett mer formellt plan är således förhoppningen att avhandlingens innehåll innebär en inbjudan till att se med en didaktisk lins på högre utbildning. På ett personligt plan upplever jag att jag har nått mitt mål och kan besvara mig själv och mina frågor i dag. vilket förstås är tillfredsställande.

After reading this book. by Rheinberger and Müller-Willie. the answer is Byes.^ This book covers all you need to know about the gene concept in a very precise and concise way. Their aim is to help us to better understand the changing role of the gene concept by tracking its history. The authors raise the problem of when to stop and look at the Bhistory^ of the gene concept considering the speed of scientific development. However. the time seems ripe. since the shift into postgenomics does not yet seem to include any paradigmatic changes concerning the gene. The book starts with a quote by Nietzsche about what is possible to define. namely things without history. Therefore. a quick conclusion is that the authors mean that the gene concept defies a definition because it has a long history of use.

Arbetet i denna uppsats är begränsat till den del av forskning och undervisning som är inriktad mot användningen av vetenskapliga begrepp i texter. och vilka innebörder användningarna leder till. Arbetet baseras på två studier.I den första studien visas att i en enda. mycket använd lärobok i biologi. kan man finna (åtminstone) fem olika innebörder av hur genbegreppet används. Det som är intressant är att dessa olika innebörder kan knytas till framväxten av olika biologiska discipliner. Det kan tyckas självklart när man ser det som resultat. men faktum är att genbegreppet inte framskrivs som kontextberoende. Detta borde i sin tur leda till att förståelsen av genbegreppet försvåras. eftersom betydelsen varierar med sammanhanget och dessutom kan olika innebörder blandas i ett och samma sammanhang. De lärandeproblem som tidigare studier har visat på. kan bland annat ha sin grund i ett innehållsproblem.

Kunskaperna behövs inte bara för att ägna sig åt naturvetenskaplig forskning. utan också inom en rad olika yrken. och för att kunna delta i samhällslivet i stort. t. ex. för att förstå vad experter säger. för att leva ett liv i hälsa eller för att ta ställning i en demokrati. Naturvetenskapliga kunskaper och naturvetenskapliga sätt att skaffa sig kunskap är också en möjlig väg för människor att berika sina liv och att finna mening i tillvaron. Dessa betydelser av naturvetenskaplig kunskap brukar sammanfattas som “civic scientific literacy “eller “naturvetenskaplig allmänbildning “(Miller. Pardo. & Niwa. 1997; Sjöberg. 2000).Även om undersökningar i en rad länder har visat att människor ofta är intresserade av att veta mer om naturvetenskap och att de anser att sådana kunskaper är betydelsefulla för en rad områden i deras liv (Miller et al.. 1997). så upplever ändå många människor naturvetenskap i skolan och på universitetet som svårbegriplig eller till och med främmande (Skolverket & Högskoleverket. 1995; 1997; 1998; Wester. 1997; Sjöberg. 2000). De har svårt att koppla ihop vad de lär sig i sin utbildning med andra områden (Andersson. Emanuelsson. & Zetterqvist. 1993; Säljö. 1995). Många har också argumenterat att en orsak till att undervisningen upplevs som främmande är att den ger en förvrängd bild av hur vetenskapen faktiskt bedrivs av levande forskare (Säljö. 1995; Osborne. 1996; Sutton. 1996).

ScAmy43 appeared as a 43 kDa monomeric enzyme. as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Superdex 75 gel filtration. The MALDI peptide mass fingerprint of ScAmy43 tryptic digest as well as internal sequence analyses indicate that the enzyme has an original primary structure when compared with other fungal a-amylases.

Two -amylases ScAmy54 and ScAmy43 predicted to play an important role in starch degradation were showed to produce specific oligosaccharides essentially maltotriose that have a considerable commercial interest. Primary structure of the two enzymes was established by N-terminal sequencing. MALDI-TOF masse spectrometry and cDNA cloning. The two proteins have the same N-terminal catalytic domain and ScAmy43 derived from ScAmy54 by truncation of 96 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal region. Data of genomic analysis suggested that the two enzymes originated from the same -amylase gene and that truncation of ScAmy54 to ScAmy43 occurred probably during S. sclerotiorum cultivation. The structural gene of Scamy54 consisted of 9 exons and 8 introns. containing a single 1.500-bp open reading frame encoding 499 amino acids including a signal peptide of 21 residues. ScAmy54 exhibited high amino acid homology with other liquefying fungal -amylases essentially in the four conserved regions and in the putative catalytic triad.

Iraq. during the year 2014 (80 samples in each season). The study presented the occurrence of three groups of ectoparasites on the different sites of the host in all season includes: protozoans. monogeneans and crustaceans. Seasonal fluctuations and prevalence of infestations by different parasite groups were recorded. A most abundant ectoparasite group was crustacean during all four seasons followed by protozoans then monogeneans. High Prevalence of infections by crustacean (82.5%) was recorded during autumn and low (36.25%) during summer. High prevalence of infections by protozoans (51.25%) and monogeneans (32.5%) were recorded during winter and low prevalence of infections of both groups were recorded during summer and spring (30% and 17.5% respectively).

The most promising approach for VL diagnosis uses serological assays with recombinant proteins. since they are more efficient and easier to perform. Tests developed for the human form of the disease. however. have not been shown to be efficient for its diagnosis in the canine host. the major reservoir for the American VL.   Methodology/Principal findings Here. we describe a systematic approach aimed at the production of a new chimeric protein potentially able to be used for both human and canine VL diagnosis and based both on in silico gene design and experimental data. Starting from the previous identification of Leishmania infantum recombinant antigens efficient for the diagnosis of either human or canine VL. three of the best performing antigens were selected (Lci2.

Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). we showed that the Tau–MT interaction was distributed along MTs in periodic hotspots of high and low FRET intensities. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed a two-phase exchange of Tau with MTs as a rapid diffusion followed by a slower binding phase. A real-time FRET assay showed that high FRET occurred simultaneously with rescue and pause transitions at MT ends. To further explore the functional interaction of Tau with MTs. the binding of paclitaxel (PTX). tubulin acetylation induced by trichostatin A (TSA). and the expression of non-acetylatable tubulin were used.

The determination of phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) levels in blood plasma is very important not only in early diagnostic. but also in monitoring the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). Purpose. We present a simple. sensitive and accurate procedure to determine simultaneously the plasma concentrations of Phe and Tyr. Procedure. The measurement involves two steps: a) separation of plasma (from blood prelevated on heparin). isolation and preparation of a concentrated solution of amino acids (by ion-exchange column chromatography on Dowex-50X8). and b) determination of Phe and Tyr concentrations in the solution of amino acids by HPLC (using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 instrument equipped with a diode array detector). The analytical column was a Thermo Scientific Acclaim 120. C18. 5 µm Analitic (4.6 x 250 mm). coupled with an Acclaim C18 guard column. The values of Phe and Tyr concentrations in plasma of several patients were calculated using a calibration curve made with standards of Phe (1834.4 µmol/L in deionized water) and Tyr (600 µmol/L in deionized water).

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most frequent inherited amino acid metabolic disorder. and it may also be treated by dietary means. The determination of phenylalanine (Phe) levels in the blood plasma is important not only in early diagnostic. but also in monitoring the treatment of PKU.Purpose. The aim of our work was to develop a simple. sensitive and highly accurate procedure to determine the plasma concentration of Phe. Procedure. The measurement of plasma Phe concentration involves two steps: a) separation of plasma (from the blood taken on heparin). isolation and preparation of a concentrated solution of amino acids (by ion-exchange column chromatography on Dowex-50X8 and evaporation of the eluate in vacuum at 40 C). and b) determination of Phe concentration in the solution of amino acids by HPLC. This analysis was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 instrument equipped with a Ultimate 3000 diode array detector (DAD). The values of Phe concentration in the plasma of several patients were calculated using a calibration curve made with standards of Phe (dilutions of a stock solution of 50 mg/dL). The measurements in duplicate (plasma Phe) or a greater number of samples from the same concentration of standards of Phe showed extremely small sample to sample differences. Concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/dL could be determined. Conclusion. The whole procedure presented here is relatively simple. rather inexpensive. however very sensitive and highly accurate.

Chromosomal imbalances may lead to spontaneous abortions. or an offspring with multiple congenital anomalies. This report emphasizes the importance of the cytogenetic investigations in couples with recurrent spontaneous abortions. A couple was referred for cytogenetic prenatal testing because of a history of recurrent miscarriages and due to the fact that after an ultrasound examination the foetal heart rate was not perceived and the suspicion that the pregnancy stopped growing was raised. Chromosome studies of the chorionic villi from the foetus revealed a karyotype with deletion of the terminal region of chromosome 11. Analysis of the chromosomes of the couple revealed the presence of a chromosomal rearrangement. a balanced translocation (10; 11) for the mother. while the father had a normal karyotype. Further investigation of the family from the mother side revealed the same balanced translocation for her mother and her brother. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using telomere probes for the short arm of chromosome 10 and the long arm of chromosome 11 was performed to better characterize the balanced state in the mother. This helped delineate the 46. XX. der (11)(11pter→ 11q21:: 10p14→ 10pter) karyotype of the foetus.

Mrhl RNA negatively regulates Wnt signaling in mouse spermatogonial cells through p68/Ddx5 RNA helicase. Mrhl RNA is present both in the nucleoplasm and chromatin of mouse spermatogonial Gc1-Spg cells. We have mapped the genome wide chromatin occupancy of mrhl RNA by ChOP (Chromatin Oligo affinity Precipitation) technique which identified total 1370 statistically significant genomic loci. Among these. genes at 37 genomic loci also showed altered expression pattern upon mrhl RNA down regulation which are referred to as GRPAM (Genes Regulated by Physical Association of Mrhl RNA) and hence represent the putative regulatory targets of mrhl RNA. These targets included genes related to Wnt signaling and spermatogenesis. p68 silencing drastically reduced mrhl RNA occupancy at GRPAM loci and also perturbed their expression which shows that p68 is required for the chromatin templated gene regulation function of mrhl RNA. Interestingly. we also observe that Wnt3a ligand treatment of Gc1-Spg cells down regulated mrhl RNA expression. Our current unpublished work has delineated detailed molecular mechanism of mrhl RNA down regulation which involves recruitment of TCF4. beta-catenin and the Ctbp1 corepressor accompanied by increase in repressive histone modification marks at promoter of mrhl RNA.

Numerous laboratory studies have revealed that light experienced during a critical window of the circadian (daily) rhythm can influence reproductive physiology.

1074543,Graduate School,2017,Katie Beth Needham,,,,,,In virtually all species. reproduction must be precisely timed to coordinate breeding and rearing of offspring with favorable conditions. It is imperative for individuals to time the highest energetic cost to themselves or highest needs by offspring with greatest food availability in either abundance or nutrient make-up. To accomplish this. individuals must integrate signals conveying both internal and external status and accordingly alter the activity of the reproductive axis. To date most efforts to identify variation in control mechanisms for reproduction in seasonally breeding animals have focused on the brain as the initiator for reproduction. However. recent studies have re-directed attention to two other potential tissues. the pituitary and ovary. where variation in brake sensitivity may be important. To this end. a series of experiments were performed in two songbird species to elucidate the hormonal role in timing of breeding and the interaction of an energetic trade-off on the decision to breed in both males and females. I used two species. the wild dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and the wild-caught captive house sparrow (Passer domesticus) as model systems to address the following questions: 1) What physiological mechanisms explain individual variation in onset of gametogenesis? And 2) How are mechanisms of energy integrated with the reproductive axis’ control of reproduction and timing of breeding to regulate energetic trade-offs?

However. considering the PHM system’s impact on the system failure probabilities can benefit the system design early on and subsequently reduce costs. The identification of failure paths in the early phases of engineering design can guide the designer toward a safer. more reliable and cost-efficient design. Several functional failure modeling methods have been developed recently. One of their advantages is to allow for risk assessment in the early stages of the design. Risk and reliability functional failure analysis methods currently developed do not explicitly model the PHM equipment used to identify and prevent potential system failures. This paper proposes a framework to optimize prognostic systems selection and positioning during the early stages of a complex system design. A Bayesian network. incorporating the PHM systems. is used to analyze the functional model and failure propagation. The algorithm developed within the proposed framework returns the optimized placement of PHM hardware in the complex system. allowing the designer to evaluate the need for system improvement. A design tool was developed to automatically apply the proposed method. A generic pressurized water nuclear reactor primary coolant loop system is used to present a case study illustrating the proposed framework. The results obtained for this particular case study demonstrate the promise of the method introduced in this paper.

1074565,A Risk and Reliability Analysis of a Sodium-Cooled Fast Nuclear Reactor,2016,GUILLAUME L’HER,,,,,,Various risk and reliability analysis methods were applied to the ASTRID nuclear reactor design. The design demonstrated remarkable safety features. with exceedingly low chances of accidents causing the release of radioactivity in the environment. A more complete analysis could reveal potential cost savings actions while keeping the system safety extremely high.This improved safety comes at the cost of a slightly downgraded reliability. with the reactor being shutdown preemptively in numerous cases as part of the defense system. It is recommended to consider a coupled system for electricity generation during higher than demand production time. to cover for most of the plant downtime and drastically increase cost effectiveness. One of the point of interest seen in this analysis that would merit a more in depth analysis is the loss of offsite power. forcing the use of numerous. historically often unreliable. backup generators and shutting down the plant due to lack of powered sensors in the core. Alternative electricity generation solution should be studied. This analysis should be repeated with greater details once the design is more advanced. in order to confirm the findings of this document and potentially make informed cost-saving modifications.,True,NJUVlJwAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.guillaumelher.com/resources/nuclear_design_risk.pdf,,,,https://www.guillaumelher.com/resources/nuclear_design_risk.pdf,0,0,0

This recognition–rejection process is the primary host defense against costly brood parasitism. The Red-crested Cardinal (Paroaria coronata) is an occasional host of the generalist Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) that successfully rejects all parasitic eggs.

For the Chestnut-bellied Euphonia (Euphonia pectoralis). endemic to the Atlantic Forest of South America. nests and eggs have been described. but other aspects of natural history and reproductive biology are unknown. Here we report observations on foraging and ten reproductive events in eight nests between 2003 and 2018 in Misiones. Argentina. We observed a primarily frugivorous diet in adults and nestlings. although adults occasionally consumed insects when they foraged in mixed species flocks. In contrast to other species of Euphonia. we observed low frequencies of consumption of Santalales fruits. Nests were globular structures of plant material. supported on epiphytic plants. tree trunks. tree ferns. or thin branches 0.93–5.30 m above the ground. Clutch size was 2–3 eggs (n = 6). smaller than for species of Euphonia inhabiting tropical regions. supporting the idea that this genus departs from the general pattern in birds. in which clutch size increases with latitude. The incubation period lasted 16 days and the nestlings fledged when 17–21 days old (n = 2). Both parents participated in nest construction but only the female incubated. brooded. and took care of nest hygiene. ingesting the gelatinous fecal mass directly from the cloaca of her offspring.

Argentina. Fueron trazadas 46 transectas en 20 sitios dentro del área de distribución de un bosque nativo conocido localmente como Talares y se usó el programa ‘Distance’para estimar la abundancia y densidad de cardenales durante el invierno 2009. La densidad promedio fue de 0. 29 individuos/ha y se detectaron en promedio 0. 34 individuos/100m de transecta recorridos. La abundancia de cardenales estuvo negativamente asociada a la distancia entre parches de bosque y positivamente asociada con el ancho de copa de los árboles. Los sectores del bosque con árboles de mayor tamaño podrían ofrecer mayor ocultamiento y mejores sitios de anidación y alimentación. mientras que la menor distancia entre los parches podría facilitar la dispersión y ofrecer corredores que les permitan acceder a nuevos sitios de alimentación y reproducción. Solo en cinco de los 20 sitios se registraron ejemplares juveniles. sugiriendo que sólo estos sitios reúnen las condiciones necesarias para la reproducción.

As neural innervation of the peripheral tissue continues to develop after birth. neurons may modulate tissue inflammation in an age-related manner. Here we showed that sympathetic nerves underwent a dopaminergic-to-adrenergic transition during post-natal development of the lung in mice and humans. Dopamine signaled through a specific dopamine receptor (DRD4) to promote T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. The dopamine-DRD4 pathway acted synergistically with the cytokine IL-4 by upregulating IL-2-STAT5 signaling and reducing inhibitory histone trimethylation at Th2 gene loci.

Our results showed that β-hematin formation was induced by phospholipids in the fluid phase but not in the gel phase. The ability of phospholipids to induce β-hematin formation was inversely correlated with gel-to-liquid phase transition temperatures. suggesting an essential insertion of heme into the hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipid membrane to form β-hematin.

The function of Lsd1 as a regulator of lipolysis in Drosophila has been demonstrated. as the Lsd1 mutant causes an increase of lipid droplet size. However. the functions of this gene during development are still under investigation. In order to determine the function of Lsd1 during development. Lsd1 was knocked down in Drosophila using the GAL4-UAS system. Selective knockdown of Lsd1 in the dorsal wing disc caused an atrophied wing phenotype. The generation of reactive oxygen species in the wing pouch compartment of the Lsd1-knockdown flies was significantly higher than in the control. Immunostaining with caspase-3 antibody revealed a greater number of apoptotic cells in Lsd1-knockdown wing discs than in the control. Cell death by autophagy was also induced in the knockdown flies. Moreover. cells deprived of Lsd1 showed mitochondrial expansion and decreased ATP levels. These results strongly suggest that knockdown of Lsd1 induces mitochondrial stress and the production of reactive oxygen species that result in cell death. via apoptosis and the autophagy pathway. These results highlight the roles of Drosophila Lsd1 during wing development.

Here. we focused on the Drosophila model to develop therapeutics for preventing obesity. The brummer (bmm) gene in Drosophila melanogaster is known to be homologous with human adipocyte triglyceride lipase. which is related to the regulation of lipid storage. We established a Drosophila model for monitoring bmm expression by introducing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as a downstream reporter of the bmm promoter. The third-instar larvae of Drosophila showed the GFP signal in all tissues observed and specifically in the salivary gland nucleus. To confirm the relationship between bmm expression and obesity. the effect of oral administration of glucose diets on bmm promoter activity was analyzed. The Drosophila flies given high-glucose diets showed higher lipid contents. indicating the obesity phenotype; this was suggested by a weaker intensity of the GFP signal as well as reduced bmm mRNA expression.

Although its roles in lipid metabolism in adipocyte tissue. skeletal muscle. and the liver. and as a transcriptional co-activator are known. its functions during development are still under investigation. In this study. we analyzed the role of Drosophila lipin (dLipin) in development. Specifically. we showed that the tissue-selective knockdown of dLipin in the wing pouch led to an atrophied wing. Elevated DNA damage was observed in the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies. dLipin dysfunction induced accumulation of cells in S phase and significantly reduced the number of mitotic cells. indicating DNA damage-induced activation of the G2/M checkpoint. Reduced expression of cyclin B. which is critical for the G2 to M transition. was observed in the margin of the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies. The knockdown of dLipin led to increased apoptotic cell death in the wing imaginal disc.

Apis mellifera,2016,Rong Ma and Ulrich G Mueller and Juliana Rangel,47,Apidologie,1,135-144,Springer Paris,The larval pheromone (E)-β-ocimene (EBO) inhibits worker ovary development and accelerates the behavioral transition from nursing to foraging in the honey bee. Apis mellifera. Because EBO diffuses throughout the hive. it has been hypothesized that honey bee workers can use it to indirectly assess brood abundance. Here. we evaluate this hypothesis by testing whether EBO plays a role in the regulation of worker foraging activity. We exposed paired colonies to a pulse of either synthetic β-ocimene or paraffin oil control and recorded the subsequent number of pollen and non-pollen foragers returning to the colony. Exposure to synthetic β-ocimene moderately but significantly increased overall foraging activity. but not pollen foraging.

In decentralized systems in which individuals use local cues to decide how to allocate their time amongst multiple tasks. a “global” signal detectable over large distances by all members of the group could have a profound effect on task allocation and coordination. Honeybees provide a unique opportunity to study how information transfer modulates behavior because they produce pheromones that can regulate the actions of thousands of individuals in a colony. We used electrophysiological and behavioral assays to compare the transmission modes of 2 larval pheromones to test the hypothesis that larval pheromones can act as “global” signals by rapidly regulating behavior throughout a colony without direct physical interactions between …,True,NYUuavYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,6,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/29/5/1132/5048804,17874168376665888812,/scholar?cites=17874168376665888812,,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/29/5/1132/5048804,0,0,0
1074646,Honey bee (Apis mellifera) larval pheromones may regulate gene expression related to foraging task specialization,2019,Rong Ma and Juliana Rangel and Christina M Grozinger,20,BMC genomics,1,1-15,BioMed Central,Foraging behavior in honey bees (Apis mellifera) is a complex phenotype that is regulated by physiological state and social signals. How these factors are integrated at the molecular level to modulate foraging behavior has not been well characterized. The transition of worker bees from nursing to foraging behaviors is mediated by large-scale changes in brain gene expression. which are influenced by pheromones produced by the queen and larvae. Larval pheromones can also stimulate foragers to leave the colony to collect pollen. However. the mechanisms underpinning this rapid behavioral plasticity in foragers that specialize in collecting pollen over nectar. and how larval pheromones impact these different behavioral states. remains to be determined. Here. we investigated the patterns of gene expression related to rapid behavioral plasticity and task allocation among honey bee foragers exposed to two larval pheromones. brood pheromone (BP) and (E)-beta-ocimene (EBO). We hypothesized that both pheromones would alter expression of genes in the brain related to foraging and would differentially impact brain gene expression depending on foraging specialization. Combining data reduction. clustering. and network analysis methods. we found that foraging preference (nectar vs. pollen) and pheromone exposure are each associated with specific brain gene expression profiles. Furthermore. pheromone exposure has a strong transcriptional effect on genes that are preferentially expressed in nectar foragers.

This conflict can be observed as differential expression of matrigenes and patrigenes. or parent specific gene expression (PSGE). In honey bees (Apis mellifera). intragenomic conflict is hypothesized to occur in multiple social contexts. Previously. we found patrigene biased expression in reproductive tissues was associated with increased reproductive potential in worker honey bees. consistent with the prediction that patrigenes are selected to promote selfish behavior in this context.

In honey bees. there are two distinct pheromones emitted by larvae. brood pheromone and (E)-beta-ocimene. By integrating behavior. chemical ecology. and transcriptomics. this dissertation analyzes several key stages in signal transmission in a systematic effort to understand how these two pheromones affect behavior. and in the process. generates a synthetic understanding of a highly complex system of communication.  Previous studies have explored behavioral and gene expression patterns related to honey bee pheromones; however. none have compared the roles that two divergent pheromones from a common source play in rapid regulation of foraging behavior. Furthermore. while previous studies have investigated the mechanisms of pheromone detection and the factors involved in regulation of foraging behavior. it remains unclear how individual responses to pheromone exposure scales to colony-level changes in behavior.

1074660,Estudios de zooplancton marino en Costa Rica: una revisión y perspectivas a futuro,2018,Álvaro Morales-Ramírez and Marco Corrales-Ugalde and Octavio Esquivel-Garrote and Allan Carrillo Baltodano and Karina Rodríguez-Sáenz and Carolina Sheridan,66,,1-1,S24-S41,,This review summarizes marine zooplankton research performed in the Costa Rican Pacific and Caribbean coasts and at Isla del Coco National Park. Composition. abundance. biomass. distribution and some ecological features of the zooplankton for each system is discussed. Pacific coastal zooplankton composition has been described in Bahía Salinas and Bahía Culebra. The local oceanography of these bays is heavily influenced by the Papagayo wind jet. which produces seasonal coastal upwelling and most likely drives the seasonal changes in zooplankton abundance and biomass. Copepods and ostracods were the dominant taxonomic groups throughout the year with a strong seasonality. furthermore 53 hydromedusae species has been found. where Liriope tetraphylla (Chamisso & Eysenhardt. 1821). Solmundella bitentaculata (Quoy & Gaimard. 1833) and Aglaura hemistoma (Péron & Lesueur. 1810). were the most abundant species. Zooplankton herbivory rates at Gulf of Nicoya estuary was estimated over 50% removal of primary production. This is a typical value for tropical productive environments. Copepods numerically dominated zooplankton community from the Gulf of Nicoya. Other dominant taxa includes merozooplanktonic decapod larvae and ichthyoplankton. Biomass is high and there are strong crossshelf gradients in the Gulf. Zooplankton collected in the southern Pacific coast (close to Isla del Caño) is also dominated by copepods. while Bahía Coronado has a mixed zooplankton composition of oceanic and coastal transition waters.

It is traditionally used as anti-pyrogenic agent. Objective: The present study was aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic activities leaf extracts from Tiliacora triandra (TTE) in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Methods: TTE was prepared and daily and orally administered at dose of 300 mg/kg bw to the rats for 8 weeks. The body weight and blood glucose level were measured weekly. At the end of the experiments. blood samples were collected from cardiac puncture and analyzed for serum insulin levels. The pancreatic tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin for histo-pathological investigations. Results: Normal and diabetic rats treated with TTE and glibenclamide tended to have an increased body weight. TTE significantly decreased the blood glucose level by 25.01±19.77% in week 3 in diabetic rats and similar to that of glibenclamide group (27.01±11.89%). However. the extracts slightly decreased the blood glucose level in normal rats by 9.48±2.14% in week 2. TTE significantly increased serum insulin level by 21.63±1.39 IU/mL in diabetic rats compared to the controls (10.63±0.37 IU/mL) but not in normal rats. In additions. TTE activated the regeneration of pancreatic Islets of Langerhans in diabetic rats which in turn stimulated insulin secretion.

We observed the cows kept in two loose housing systems: cubicle stalls and deep litter in easy-to-assemble compartments. The decrease in temperature led to decreasing productivity (by 10.86%. 3.55 kg) of cows in cubicle stalls and by 5.65%(1.82 kg) of cows in deep litter housing; the milk fat content increased by 0.09 and 0.08% respectively. During low-temperature period. the cows spent less time feeding. drinking. and walking in both housing systems. but spent more time when relaxing compared to thermoneutral period.

Богдана Хмельницкого,The analytical review attempts to summarize the results of numerous scientific research conducted by scientists around the world on selenium scattering and accumulation in natural environment. with considerable attention paid to the concentration of this trace element in soils. natural waters and plants. It is shown that selenium content in agricultural products is caused by the processes of physico-chemical and biogenic migration of this element in the biogeochemical food chain. According to the modern classification of trace elements. which is based on their biological significance for living organisms. selenium belongs to the vital group or biogenic elements. As a biotic element. it has unique physicochemical and biochemical properties and with adequately absorbed into the human body has a positive effect on a number of physiological processes. Various research shows that the majority of the world population (except in some regions) today consumes less selenium with the food than necessary and its consumption decreases every year. Insufficient selenium intake in the human body (less than 15–30 μg/day) leads to the development one of the hypomicroelementosis – hyposelenosis. Selenium deficiency is considered as a possible etiological factor in some cardiovascular. cancer. osteoarticular and neurodegenerative diseases that threaten to human life.

1074727,Chemical tools to investigate the role of sphingolipids in disease,2016,Yadira Ordóñez Vivanco,,,,,,Sphingolipids (SLs) encompass a large and diverse family of lipids that are essential constituents of cellular membranes. In addition to their structural functions. SLs are also emerging as important signalling molecules with an essential role in controlling different cellular processes such as cell proliferation. growth. migration. differentiation. senescence and apoptosis.  Ceramide (Cer) and dihydroceramide (dhCer) are the central molecules of SLs metabolism. The bioactive role of dhCer has been recently described and it has been implicated in processes like autophagy. Alterations in SLs levels are strongly correlated with the initiation and progression of several diseases. such as type 2 diabetes. Alzheimer’s disease or different types of cancer. The metabolism of the SLs are catalyzed by specific enzymes. like dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (Des1). ceramidases (CDases). among others. and their study is important to understand the role of SLs.  As mentioned above. experimental evidences suggest a role for dhCer in autophagy induction. but whether dhCer leads to prosurvival or lethal autophagy is subject of controversy. On the other hand. despite the advances in the development of Acid Ceramidase (AC) directed activity based probes (ABP). there is still a clear need for more specific and potent tools to characterize AC activity in cells. In this context. the objectives of this thesis are:  1. To validate the role of dihydroceramides as mediators of autophagy induction and outcome in cancer cell models. To achieve this objective. dhCer levels were induced to increase using two different types of compounds: Metabolic precursors and Des1 inhibitors …,True,mJmpECMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/399916,,,,https://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/399916/YOV_THESIS.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Terminal erythroid differentiation results in dramatic upregulation of alpha-globin genes making their expression comparable to the rRNA transcriptional output. Little is known about the influence of the erythroid-specific alpha-globin gene transcription outburst on adjacent. widely expressed genes and large-scale chromatin organization. Here. we have analyzed the total transcription output. the overall chromatin contact profile. and CTCF binding within the 2.7 Mb segment of chicken chromosome 14 harboring the alpha-globin gene cluster in cultured lymphoid cells and cultured erythroid cells before and after induction of terminal erythroid differentiation. We found that. similarly to mammalian genome. the chicken genomes is organized in TADs and compartments. Full activation of the alpha-globin gene transcription in differentiated erythroid cells is correlated with upregulation of several adjacent housekeeping genes and the emergence of abundant intergenic transcription. An extended chromosome region encompassing the alpha-globin cluster becomes significantly decompacted in differentiated erythroid cells. and depleted in CTCF binding and CTCF-anchored chromatin loops. while the sub-TAD harboring alpha-globin gene cluster and the upstream major regulatory element (MRE) becomes highly enriched with chromatin interactions as compared to lymphoid and proliferating erythroid cells.

Insights into chromatin conformation on both local and global scales can be provided by the Hi-C (high-throughput chromosomes conformation capture) method. One of the drawbacks of Hi-C analysis and interpretation is the presence of systematic biases. such as different accessibility to enzymes. amplification. and mappability of DNA regions. which all result in different visibility of the regions. Iterative correction (IC) is one of the most popular techniques developed for the elimination of these systematic biases. IC is based on the assumption that all chromatin regions have an equal number of observed contacts in Hi-C. In other words. the IC procedure is equalizing the experimental visibility approximated by the cumulative contact frequency (CCF) for all genomic regions. However. the differences in experimental visibility might be explained by biological factors such as chromatin openness. which is characteristic of distinct chromatin states. Here we show that CCF is positively correlated with active transcription. It is associated with compartment organization. since compartment A demonstrates higher CCF and gene expression levels than compartment B. Notably. this observation holds for a wide range of species. including human. mouse. and Drosophila. Moreover. we track the CCF state for syntenic blocks between human and mouse and conclude that active state assessed by CCF is an intrinsic property of the DNA region. which is independent of local genomic and epigenomic context.

Hi-C experiments have revealed that chromosomes are subdivided into sets of self-interacting domains called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs).

We present linear regression models with four types of regularization. gradient boosting. and recurrent neural networks (RNN) as tools to study chromatin folding characteristics associated with TADs given epigenetic chromatin immunoprecipitation data. The bidirectional long short-term memory RNN architecture produced the best prediction scores and identified biologically relevant features. Distribution of protein Chriz (Chromator) and histone modification H3K4me3 were selected as the most informative features for the prediction of TADs characteristics.

A threedimensional model of exploring personal change through transformative education leading to social/cultural change was employed throughout this research. A critical poststructural ecofeminist frame undergirded an autoethnographic self-study where I changed my living practices to become more sustainable while living within society. and used this as a platform for how I could become a better environmental educator and activist. I reduced my ecological footprint from 16.4HA to 1.8HA and taught a preservice teacher course in environmental education. where I explored student resistances. power and relationships. a critique of curriculum. and personal change as a result of transformative education. One particular pedagogical strategy. the Action Learning Group Project. was developed and used to support others to undergo personal change through transformative education leading to social/cultural change.

In this study a dendroecological approach in defining regions of provenance was tested in Latium (Italy) and combined with the phenological responses of forests. Previous dendroclimatic research demonstrated the relationship between plant growth and climatic parameters; in Latium. similar bioclimatic responses from different forest stands growing at similar elevations were statistically grouped into three homogeneous altitudinal …,True,fEDU098AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827581.2010.485776,2990907291083755576,/scholar?cites=2990907291083755576,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02827581.2010.485776,0,0,0

New insights to infer intra-specific phylogeographic relationships in the previously neglected North African cork oak stands are here provided by means of genetic analyses of the maternally inherited plastid genomes (PCR-RFLP at 5 chloroplast loci). We have analysed 17 populations from Morocco (7). Algeria (6) and Tunisia (4); resulting data were included in a phylogeographical framework obtained from 95 populations throughout the species range. Five total haplotype lineages were identified for the entire species’ range. Of these. three haplotypes occur along the North African Mediterranean coast. delineating two clear suture zones: at East (Northeastern Algeria) and at West (Central Morocco). Genetic diversity parameters were determined for the different geographic areas of the entire species range. showing interesting variation where paleogeography. hybridization. adaptation. fragmentation. and human impact all play an important role. The importance of the North African territories for the evolutionary history of the species and the urgency for measures to preserve the current biodiversity in this area are stressed.,True,fEDU098AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/45734704/Vessella_biogeography_quercus_suber.pdf,2477441059595659578,/scholar?cites=2477441059595659578,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45734704/Vessella_biogeography_quercus_suber.pdf,0,0,0

Les projets MDP ont été développés afin de répondre à deux objectifs majeurs. Le premier consiste à atténuer les changements climatiques. Le second consiste à mettre en place des actions de développement durable. A l’heure actuelle. un seul projet MDP forestier existe en Afrique sub-Saharienne et pourtant. de nombreuses études et conférences parlent de l’Afrique comme un potentiel important pour accueillir ce type de projet. En effet. la mise en place des projets MDP fait face à de nombreuses contraintes.Tout d’abord. la procédure du MDP est longue. coûteuse et complexe et. les pays sub-Sahariens ne disposent pas des capacités nécessaires. Les coûts de transactions nécessaires sont conséquents et découragent nombre de développeurs. Puis. les crédits issus des MDP boisements et reboisement ne sont pas fongibles sur le marché Européen. Ceci limite les investissements. Enfin. les systèmes arborés africains sont complexes et sont généralement intégrés ou en étroite relation avec une multitude d’autres activités. Développer des projets MDP ne peut être fait qu’à partir d’une bonne connaissance de ces interactions. Toutes ces contraintes font qu’aujourd’hui le MDP forestier n’a pas su trouver de terrain fertile en Afrique sub-Saharienne.

In the present study. we report that 7-O-succinyl macrolactin A (SMA) suppresses tumor growth by stabilizing the β-catenin destruction complex. which was achieved through inhibition of regulatory components associated with the complex. SMA significantly reduced the activities of PI3K/Akt. which corresponded with a decrease in GSK3β phosphorylation. an increase in β-catenin phosphorylation. and a reduction in nuclear β-catenin content in HT29 human colon cancer cells. At the same time. the activity of tankyrase. which inhibits the β-catenin destruction complex by destabilizing the axin level. was suppressed by SMA. Despite the low potency of SMA against tankyrase activity (IC50 of 50.1 μM and 15.5 μM for tankyrase 1 and 2. respectively) compared to XAV939 (IC50 of 11 nM for tankyrase 1). a selective and potent tankyrase inhibitor. SMA had strong inhibitory effects on β-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity (IC50 of 39.8 nM). which were similar to that of XAV939 (IC50 of 28.1 nM). In addition to suppressing the colony forming ability of colon cancer cells in vitro. SMA significantly inhibited tumor growth in CT26 syngenic and HT29 xenograft mouse tumor models. Furthermore. treating mice with SMA in combination with 5-FU in a colon cancer xenograft model or with cisplatin in an A549 lung cancer xenograft model resulted in greater anti-tumor activity than did treatment with the drugs alone.

Methods: A 23 factorial design was employed in formulating the GFDDS in which parameters. such as amount of HPMC (X1). sodium bicarbonate+ citric acid (X2). and crospovidone (X3) were characterized as independent variables. whereas percent metoprolol release at 30 min (Y1). 4 hr (Y2). 8 hr (Y3). floating lag time (Y4). and total floating time (Y5) were considered as dependent variables. Findings: The formulations showed the biphasic release of metoprolol. where the immediate layer was completely disintegrated within 30 min and the release of the sustained layer was extended to 8 hr. Prompt disintegration of the immediate layer was facilitated by the combined effects of sodium starch glycolate and sodium bicarbonate+ citric acid. whereas the extended release was assisted by HPMC. Formulations. where HPMC played the major role. were considered the best formulations.

Other than ribavirin and vaccine. there is no cure for the disease thus medicinal plants being studied for their potential active compounds to be used as either mono or combined treatment with drugs. The objective of this study was to test antiviral activity of octadecanoic acid. methyl ester (OA). extracted from Cymbopogon nardus (sweet lemon grass) against measles virus in both mono and combination with ribavirin. The cytotoxicity and antiviral activity were tested at low concentration for the compound (25. 12.5 and 2.5 µg/ml) and ribavirin (0.1. 0.05 and 0.01 CC50). The cytotoxicity result showed that the low concentrations of both compounds have low cytotoxicity on Vero cell although there was slight increment of toxicity when they were combined.

It is one of the most common malignancies in the southern area of China and South-East Asia. NPC is frequently reported in Sarawak. Malaysia especially in males and is endemic to certain ethnic groups. including the Bidayuh and Chinese. The development of NPC is associated with multiple factors. with one common mechanism involving persistent infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This study will aim to gain a clearer understanding regarding the mechanism of EBV influencing p53 pathway to facilitate NPC development. Mutations in p53 mutation have been associated with oncogenesis of several human malignancies. however such mutations are relatively rare in NPC and the mechanisms through which p53 in inactivated in this malignancy remain poorly understood.

1074808,CYTOTOXICITY EFFECT OF CYMBOPOGON NARDUS METHANOLIC FRACTION AGAINST VERO AND CAOV3 CELLS,2012,Reagan Entigu Ak Linton and Samuel Lihan Jerah and Ismail bin Ahmad,,,,,,Ovarian cancer has contributed to death among women with 50% survival rate. Conventional treatments available such as chemotherapy and radiotheraphy have low successful rate of recovery. Plants provide valuable resource of secondary metabolites that possessed various biological activities. Secondary metabolites from Cymbopogon nardus have not been widely studied compared to its other sister species. Methanolic fractions of Cymbopogon nardus cytotoxicity were tested against Vero and Caov3 cell line. The objective of the study was to screen potential anticancer compound from the fractions. Test concentrations were based on fractions’ lethal concentration. 1.0 LC50 to cause 50% Vero cell death. At 0.5 LC50 fraction C2 showed higher toxicity against Caov3 compared to Vero cells at 16.6% and 85.6% cell viability. respectively. Further fractionation of C2 with column chromatography yielded 9 subfractions with C2. 1 cytotoxicity against Caov3 and Vero cell viability at 39.9±1.9% and 94.75±1.2%. respectively. The subfraction was spotted on thin-layer chromatography. TLC and ran with solvent system acetic acid: dichloromethane: methanol; 1: 8: 1. The separation of the subfraction C2. 1 revealed 4 spots and these spots were scrapped for cytotoxicity assay. At test concentration of 25 µg mL-1. the second spot has the highest toxicity towards Caov3 with 39.65±0.9% cell viability while Vero was at 90.03±1.3%. The GCMS analysis of the second spot showed that it was stearic acid.

Assays for cell proliferation. colony formation efficiency. induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were performed using the IC50 of cisplatin (8.6 μΜ) as a reference value and a concentration of EGCG (30 μΜ) that caused a non-significant reduction in cell proliferation. Pre-treatment of cells with EGCG for 24 h before the addition of cisplatin increased cytotoxicity up to 8.5% (p < 0.05) and the number of apoptotic cells by 40%. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate failed to alter S-phase cell cycle arrest induced by cisplatin and to modulate cisplatin effects on mitochondrial function.

However. PSA testing has been recently put under the microscope mainly due to its weak correlation with prostate malignancy. In several clinical trials the PSA-screening validity for the diagnosis of PCa was evaluated. PSA lacks the ability to define the progression potential of the disease usually resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment of patients. Therefore. the development of new “multivariate” prediction models for PCa that would combine the PSA screening marker (and probably PSA metrics) with better biomarkers and imaging techniques has become an evolving field. New screening tests and/or methods with increased specificity could reduce the number of men undergoing prostate biopsy-thus alleviating patients from the anxiety and the distress experienced by an unnecessary (negative) biopsy-and minimizes the healthcare cost.

The arterialized venous flap technique depends on the use of two veins in the skin flap that are used respectively for arterial flow and venous drainage. The blood in the arterialized venous flap disperses faster and over a larger area than in flow-through venous island flaps. Survival depends on the size of the flap. arterial inflow. and venous outflow. For good results. an arterialized venous flap should be designed to contain most of the venous network in the centre. the arterial inflow should be anastomosed to one afferent vein. and two or more efferent veins should drain the arterialized venous flap. Nine cases of skin defects were treated with a free arterialized venous flap. The aetiology of the defects was secondary to release of scar contracture. Five patients were suffering from post-burn contracting scars. Two cases were secondary to post-traumatic scar and two cases presented a recent traumatic skin defect. The results showed that the arterialized venous flap was useful as a free flap in small soft tissue defects.

It is mainly utilized in mitochondria for biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. hemes and other cofactors. Mitoferrin 1 and mitoferrin 2. two homologues proteins belonging to the mitochondrial solute carrier family. are required for iron delivery into mitochondria. Mitoferrin 1 is highly expressed in developing erythrocytes which consume a large amount of iron during hemoglobinization. Mitoferrin 2 is ubiquitously expressed. whose functions are less known. Zebrafish with mitoferrin 1 mutation show profound hypochromic anaemia and erythroid maturation arrests. and yeast with defects in MRS3/4. the counterparts of mitoferrin 1/2. has low mitochondrial iron levels and grows poorly by iron depletion. Mitoferrin 1 expression is up-regulated in yeast and mouse models of Fiedreich's ataxia disease and in human cell culture models of Parkinson disease. suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases with mitochondrial iron accumulation. In this study we found that reduced mitoferrin levels in C. elegans by RNAi treatment causes pleiotropic phenotypes such as small body size. reduced fecundity. slow movement and increased sensitivity to paraquat. Despite these abnormities. lifespan was increased by 50% to 80% in N2 wild type strain. and in further studies using the RNAi sensitive strain eri-1. more than doubled lifespan was observed.

Deletion of clk-1 is lethal in mice. but its mutation in C. elegans mildly extends lifespan. slows physiological rate and leads to sickness. We found that if growth retardation was taken into account the average lifespan of clk-1 mutants would not be prolonged or would be shortened. suggesting the necessity to reevaluate the role of clk-1 in aging. In addition. recent study showed that knocking down of clk-1 shortened lifespan. Although the extension of lifespan in clk-1 mutants was mild and was not observed sometimes. some progenies indeed had prolonged maximum lifespan even if retardation of growth was taking into account. These paradoxes implicate the existence of individual specificity in the aging process even in the same cohort. just like a drug is beneficial for some people while for others it is detrimental. We also categorized the lifespan curves into five patterns to reflect the kinds of lifespan alternations observed in organisms: N (normal); L (long-lived); S (short-lived); F (flattened); ST (steepened). and found that the curve of clk-1 mutants fit into the F pattern.

And deficiencies of the electron transport chain subunits increased longevity through similar mechanisms. We surprisingly found that ROS were down-and up-regulated respectively upon chronic and transient paraquat treatments. although the same ROS measuring approaches were applied. Adaptive responses were shown to be responsible for the reduction under chronic stress. Post young adult stage started treatments shortened lifespan at all concentrations tested. and mild extension was only observed by treating with “proper” concentration of paraquat from egg hatching. Nevertheless. the extension in the latter case can be fully explained by growth retardation. Thus. paraquat actually accelerated aging rather than slowed down it.

The absorbance increased in the range of 4-10 mg of phenol and reached the plateau between 10-16 mg per 1 mL of acid. The color intensity was a linear function of total water volume (sugar-water-phenol). The sensitivity increased eight times as total water volume was changed from 50 up to 400 µL. The curve for acid volume peaked at about 1 mL. The optimal assay condition was determined to be 13 mg of phenol (200 µL 6.5%). 400-425 µL of total water volume (100 µL of sugar. 100 µL water) for 1 mL of acid. The initial spontaneous high temperature is essential the reaction to proceed and any handling gives inconsistent results and decreases the precision and sensitivity of the method.

Acid soluble glycogen (ASG) is extracted. while the insoluble fraction (AIG) is liberated using hot alkaline. The current study was performed to separate and measure ASG. AIG and total glycogen in the same sample simultaneously.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol has the four phases of tissue digestion. extraction. separation of fractions and measurement. The liver tissue was weighed and digested with four volumes of 30% KOH and heated in boiling water bath for 10 min. Total glycogen was extracted with ethanol at a final concentration of 55%. The suspension of total glycogen was separated into the two fractions of acid soluble and insoluble by adding of 30 µL PCA (70%) followed by a short and mild centrifugation. Total glycogen. ASG and AIG have derived from the same sample and analyzed for glucose. RESULTS: Analysis of different weights of the liver tissue using the current procedure shows that the fractions of glycogen are measured accurately. The CV% was less than 5% for inter-and intra-assays of total glycogen and ASG. The CV% was more than 5% for inter-assays of AIG. but it lessened in intra-assays. During 24 h starvation. total glycogen depleted completely (71.4±8.3 mg/g wet vs. 4.4±1.2. p≤ 0.004) and the change occurred entirely in ASG (66.9±7.8 vs. 1.9±1.1. p≤ 0.004). while AIG did not change significantly (4.4±1.3 vs. 2.2±0.9. p≤ 0.08).

Visfatin level alteration is one of the mechanisms by which obesity promotes cancer. Ligand-independent activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is also associated with carcinogenesis. The activity of ERα is modulated through phosphorylation on multiple sites by a number of protein kinases. Here we investigated the effect of visfatin as a novel adipocytokine on the phosphorylation and activity of ERα in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We showed that exogenous administration of visfatin significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERα at serine 118 (Ser118) and 167 (Ser167) residues. Visfatin-induced Ser118 phosphorylation was diminished after treatment of cells with U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor).

During the winter. the sea level is high. and the conditions are less conducive for the injection of nutrients through the eddy-pumping mechanism. In this study. we use satellite observations and a physical-ecosystem model to examine the role of horizontal advection associated with Rossby waves in enhancing chlorophyll concentration in the SEAS. Zonal advection dominates over meridional advection. and its effect is more prominent in the south of Indian subcontinent and west of the Maldives. Except along the coast and around the islands. the vertical processes are weak and do not lead to a substantial increase in chlorophyll.

L. theobromae causes fruit rot. canker. and dieback of twigs in various woody plants. Protection of pruning wounds using fungicides is the prevalent strategy to management of the diseases caused by L. theobromae. Chemical control of plant diseases is not environmentally safe and the residues of fungicides are a threat to nature. Furthermore. genetic resources of resistance to plant diseases in woody plants are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the e ciency of RNA silencing using an e cient hairpin structure based on tef-1α gene to management of L. theobromae. Hairpin structure of tef-1α was cloned in pFGC5941 binary vector and the recombinant construct was named pFGC-TEF-d. Transient expression of pFGC-TEF-d using Agrobacterium LBA4404 in grapevine (Bidaneh Se d cv.) and strawberry cultivars (Camarosa and Ventana) led to reduction in disease progress. The disease reduction in grapevine was estimated by 55% and in strawberries cultivars Camarosa and Ventana by 58% and 93%. respectively.

However. as a consequence of this very fast-growing scientific area. some issues still remain surrounded by uncertainties. without a final agreement having been reached. Examples include the definitions of vitamin D sufficiency and insufficiency.(ie. 20 vs. 30 ng/mL). the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) and parathyroid hormone.(ie. linear vs. no linear). the referent to consider.(ie. total vs. free determination). the utility of screening versus universal supplementation. and so on. In this review. the issues related to vitamin D supplementation in subjects with documented hypovitaminosis. and the role of vitamin D in cancer will be concisely considered. Daily. weekly. or monthly administration of cholecalciferol generally leads to essentially similar results in terms of an increase in 25 (OH) D serum levels. However. we should also consider possible differences related to a number of variables.(ie. efficiency of intestinal absorption. binding to vitamin D binding protein. and so on). Thus. adherence to therapy may be more important than the dose regimen chosen in order to allow long-term compliance in a sometimes very old population already swamped by many drugs. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions at present regarding the relationship between cancer and vitamin D.

To enhance its selectivity. the nanoparticles were decorated with glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) to target HepG2 cells. The highly insoluble CPT was derivatized with a reductive-cleavable PEG chain to improve its loading within the MSN. The preparation of these particles consisted of four steps. First. CPT-PEG was loaded within the pores of the MSN. Then. dihydrazide polyethylene glycol chains were introduced onto the surface of an aldehyde-functionalized MSN by means of a hydrazone bond. Afterwards. DOX was covalently attached to the other end of the dihydrazide polyethylene glycol chains. Finally. the resulting nanoparticles were decorated with GA by formation of an imine bond between the amino group of DOX and a benzaldehyde-GA derivative. The system was stable at physiological conditions and the release of both drugs was negligible. However. at acidic pH. a burst release of DOX and a gradual release of CPT-PEG takes place. GA-decorated drug delivery systems (DDS) selectively internalizes into HepG2. In vitro tests demonstrated that this system shows a great cytotoxicity towards HepG2 cells. Furthermore. glutathione cleavage of CPT prodrug assures the formation of free CPT leading to a synergistic effect in combination with DOX.,True,uRPr2JcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/11/1048,14513592625455921099,/scholar?cites=14513592625455921099,,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/11/1048/pdf,0,0,0
1074926,Radial-capped mesoporous silica nanoparticles for multiple drug delivery,2020,Gabriel Martínez Edo,,,,,,In this PhD dissertation. a pH-responsive multiple drug delivery system (DDS) based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with a radial-capping of its pores has been developed. This is a new concept that relies on the functionalization of the particle surface with PEG chains substituted with a drug at its end to preserve the inner cargo of the MSN. First. the concept of radial-capping has been studied to assess the practical usefulness of such capping method. Thus. different types of charged PEGs. namely quaternary amines and neutral PEGs. have been introduced upon an MSN in order to study its capping ability. As a proof of concept. the dye safranin was loaded into the nanoparticles pores. which were subsequently capped with PEGs chains. Then. the release of safranin was assessed under physiological conditions (pH 7.4). The results obtained demonstrated that PEG chains possessing positive charge …,True,uRPr2JcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://84.88.27.106/handle/10803/669168,,,,,0,0,0

The preparation of macrocycles such as porphycenes. amethyrins or cyclopyrroles is based on the coupling or condensation of the proper functionalized bipyrrole or terpyrrole. Although longer α.α-linked oligopyrroles have been reported. their chemical instability has hampered their use as synthetic building blocks. Our group have developed a new family of 2.2’-bipyrroles 1 which possesses a remarkable chemical stability ascribed to the presence of two electron withdrawing groups. Bipyrroles 1 can be easily brominated at the α positions allowing their homologation with pyrrole units by means of palladium catalyzed reactions. This strategy has allowed the concise preparation of quaterpyrrole 2 and sexipyrrole 3.

Here. using a panel of 18 rodent species with diverse lifespans. we show that more robust DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. but not nucleotide excision repair (NER). coevolves with longevity. Evolution of NER. unlike DSB. is shaped primarily by sunlight exposure. We further show that the capacity of the SIRT6 protein to promote DSB repair accounts for a major part of the variation in DSB repair efficacy between short- and long-lived species. We dissected the molecular differences between a weak (mouse) and a strong (beaver) SIRT6 protein and identified five amino acid residues that are fully responsible for their differential activities.

These include antiinflamatory. antiallergic. immunosuppressor or antitumor activities. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the glucocorticoid receptors and the intrinsic multiple activity of glucocorticoids there are a number of unwanted side effects. In recent studies elsewere we have reported that the shortterm epicutaneouse application of some halogenated or unhalogenated topical glucocorticosteroids in young rats. exert steroid-diabetogen secondary side-effects. manifested throught hypergliycemia. hepatic glucose overproduction. elevated serum lipids. muscular resistance to insulin. All these endocrine-metabolic disorders were accompanied by thymolisis. adrenal atrophy. The mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced cell death is not known exactly. Some data suggest that dexamethasone treatment triggers cell death in thymocytes and in other lymphocytes. In lymphocytes. treatment increases the concentration of ROS (reactive oxygen species). while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and activity of glutathione redox cycle key enzymes are decreased. In other cells. treatment causes opposite effect. A small dose of dexamethasone and other glucocorticoids have antiapoptotic effect in neutrophils.

HPV can be grouped into cutaneous types and mucosal types based on their preferred tissue tropism. Cutaneous types are typically found in the general population and cause common warts. Mucosal HPV is further classified into high-risk and low-risk types. based on their association with cervical cancer. The most common low-risk types are HPV 6 and 11. detected most often in benign genital warts. HPV 16. 18. 31. and 45 are predominant types found in cervical squamous cell carcinoma. HPV 16 is the most prevalent type in cervical cancer (55%). followed by HPV 18 and HPV 45.

Snail control is the best measure to control schistosomiasis. Plant-derived molluscicides have gained increasing attention for the control of schistosomiasis because they have low toxicity towards non-target organisms. Tannins are particularly suitable for snail control because they are less toxic than saponins to non-target organisms.

Routine assays for assessment of infected snails are time consuming and may not be able to detect prepatent schistosomal infections. In the present study two methods were evaluated for assessment of infected snails. The first was detection of S. mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA) in snail hemolymph using two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in sandwich ELISA assay. The S. mansoni antigens measured in the hemolymph of infected snails at intervals 1. 2. 3 weeks post exposure to miracidia. at early shedding snails (4. 5) weeks and after the infected snails stopped shedding. Although the positivity. sensitivity and specificity were 100% in the infected control group of snails. the detection of antigen (s) was only possible after the second weak of miracidial infection. In the second method. genomic DNA of infected snails in addition to non infected (as negative control) were subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction PCR using primers specific to S. mansoni fructose-1. 6-bis phosphate aldolase (SMALDO) gene. PCR was able to detect infection (100% sensitivity) at the 3rd day post infection. In spite of the superiority and the higher specificity of the immunodetection for larg scale detection of prepatency of B. alexandrina snails infected with S mansoni. the nested PCR assay revealed much higher sensitivity which enables 100% detection of S. mansoni infection down to 3 days post infection.

1074993,Correlations between the Harris Hip Score and the Visual Analogue Scale in the assessment of total hip replacement in hip dysplasia,2014,SG Zuh and O Nagy and Ancuța Zazgyva and OM Russu and I Gergely and TS Pop,76,ARS Medica Tomitana,1,6-13,DE GRUYTER, Total hip replacement is one of the most frequently performed orthopaedic interventions that can significantly improve the functional status and the quality of life of patients suffering from hip arthrosis. Recently patient satisfaction and patient-reported results of total hip arthroplasty are increasingly emphasised as important tools for the assessments of these interventions. For patients with arthrosis secondary to hip dysplasia. these evaluations can be more difficult. due to younger age and higher functional demands. In this study we compared the Visual Analogue Scale and the Harris Hip Score in order to determine the correlations between these instruments and analyse the possibility of replacing the Harris Score with the Visual Analogue Scale in evaluating the results of hip surgery in patients with dysplastic hips. Our study included 37 women and 4 men (53 hips). with a mean age of 50.96 years (35-58 years). followed for a mean of 4 years postoperatively. Both assessment instruments were used preoperatively and at the follow-up visits. We observed a positive correlation of the values of the Visual Analogue Scale and the Harris Hip Score both preoperatively and postoperatively. with correlation coefficients of +0.71(P <0.001) and +0.77 (P <0.001) respectively. Given these positive correlations. we assumed that the Visual Analogue Scale could replace the Harris Hip Score in the evaluation of patients after total hip replacement.

In addition. CCl4 induced profound elevation of free radical generation and oxidative stress. as evidenced by increasing lipid peroxidation and reducing catalase. superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in liver. kidney and testicular tissues; these effects were suppressed by coexposure with rutin. Moreover. the increase in the levels of serum triglycerides. cholesterol. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol induced by CCl4 was effectively counteracted by rutin. The decrease in the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the CCl4 group was also counteracted by rutin treatment. Interestingly. the decreased levels of hormonal mediators associated with sperm production. including serum testosterone. luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. and the impaired sperm quality induced by CCl4 were reversed by rutin.

In this work we investigated the protective effect of quercetin on Cd-induced hepatorenal damage in rats. Cd toxicity was confirmed by evaluating its level in serum and tissues. Liver function enzymes. bilirubin. albumin. creatinine. uric acid. and urea were assessed in serum. However. lipid peroxidation and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes were examined in tissues. In addition. liver and kidney were studied histologically. Our results showed that the concentration of Cd was higher in tissues of Cd-treated rats while in the Cd and quercetin co-treated group. the Cd concentration was significantly reduced. Co-administration of Cd with quercetin improved the liver function as evident by the reduced levels of ALP. ALT. AST. bilirubin. and the increase in concentration of total protein and albumin.

Indonesia. Six relatively large and two small islands were attained to perform 125 plots of 34 stations. Molluscs’ diversity in each habitat were calculated using Shannon-Wiener formulation whereas Mann-Whitney formulation for comparing between habitats. Multivariate analyses for clustering of PAST 2.17 was utilized to further the analyses. A number of 101 species gastropods (26 families) and 51 species of bivalves (19 families) were recorded. Seagrass bed was inhabited by 100 species. followed by coral reef by 85 and sandflat by 44 species. Shannon-Wiener indexes for molluscs’ diversity range in seagrass was 0.39 to 1.29. in coral was 0.27 to 1.14 and in sandflat was 0.52 to 0.99. Clustering analyses for stations revealed that three stations in seagrass were the most dissimilar. followed by one station in coral due to habitat. Clustering analyses for species found four dissimilar groups of molluscs. whereas a group has many consimilar members.,True,j-PmECYAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,0,http://e-journal.biologi.lipi.go.id/index.php/jurnal_biologi_indonesia/article/view/3665,,,,http://e-journal.biologi.lipi.go.id/index.php/jurnal_biologi_indonesia/article/download/3665/2993,0,0,0

Klymnyuk,37,Experimental oncology,2,111-115,National Academy of sciences of Ukraine. RE Kavetsky institute of experimental pathology. oncology and radiobiology.,Aim-to investigate the association of MDM2 expression at the mRNA levels in neuroblastoma with clinical features and unfavorable disease factors to determine the possibility of it usage as a prognostic marker of neuroblastoma. Total RNA and DNA were extracted from tumor tissue samples of total 91 neuroblastoma patients (mean age: 39. 45+-4. 81 months). MDM2 mRNA levels were detected with Q-PCR. TP53 gene deletion was detected with FISH method. MYCN amplification was detected with Q-PCR analysis in fresh tumor samples and FISH in FFPE samples. We investigated the association of MDM2 mRNA expression with clinical outcome in neuroblastoma patients (n= 91). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant association of high MDM2 expression with poor event-free survival (p<< 0.001). Clinical outcome of patients without MYCN amplification with low MDM2 expression was associated with better event-free survival than with high MDM2 expression (p<< 0.001). Overexpression of MDM2 can be used as significant prognostic marker for patient stratification on risk groups and treatment optimization. Conclusion: our results showed that the high expression of MDM2 at mRNA levels is an important factor of neuroblastoma prognosis.

The isolation. storage and evaluation of human thymic samples quality is critical for development of autologous transplantation strategy. In this study. thymic cell samples were prepared by enzymatic digestion of thymus tissue and stored in liquid nitrogen using a cryoprotective medium containing Me2SO and dextran-40. To evaluate the quality of stored thymic cell samples. immediate post-thaw cell viability. cryopreservation efficacy. confluence. cell composition. gene expression and specific aggregation and differentiation in co-culture were assessed. Confluency evaluation was more easily assessed on culture days 7 and 14. Long-term storage of thymic cell samples was unfavorable for CD326+ thymic epithelial cells expressing FOXN1 gene but had no sufficient impact on STRO-1+ mesenchymal cells and fibroblast (FSP+ cells). Frozen-thawed thymic cell samples produced stromal-epithelial monolayer formed by CD326+ thymic epithelial cells. STRO-1+ mesenchymal cells and FSP+ fibroblasts that was effective in co-culture with autologous CD45+ thymocytes in terms of their differentiation into CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes.

Baghdad-Iraq,2014,Rana R Al-Ani and AHMJ Al Obaidy and Rana M Badri,2,International Journal of Advanced Research,5,1125-1131,,Water scarcity is increasing worldwide and pressure on the existing water recourses is increasing due to the growing demands in several sectors such as. domestic. industrial. agriculture. hydropower generation. etc.[1]. It is reported that the availability of water in Iraq shows a great deal with spatial and temporal variability. and suffered of remarkable stress in terms of water quantity due to the dams built on Tigris and Euphrates in the riparian countries. the global climatic changes and the local severe decrease of the annual precipitation rates [2]. For the time being. deteriorating water quality is a serious threat in countries with a scarcity of water resources. Therefore. sustainable use of water resources requires continuous monitoring and assessment programs [3]. The quality of water required to maintain ecosystem health is largely a function of natural background conditions. Some aquatic ecosystems are able to resist large changes in water quality without any detectable effects on ecosystem composition and function. whereas other ecosystems are sensitive to small changes in the physical and chemical makeup of the water body and this can lead to degradation of ecosystem services and loss of biological diversity [4].Contamination of water has been frequently found associated with transmission of diseases causing bacteria.

Some caterpillar species have evolved strategies to manipulate this system by inducing specific pathways that suppress plant defense responses. Effectors in the labial saliva (LS) secretions of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars are believed to induce the salicylic acid (SA) pathway to interfere with the jasmonic acid (JA) defense pathway; however. the mechanism underlying this subversion is unknown. Since Noctuid caterpillar LS contains enzymes that may affect cellular redox balance. this study investigated rapid changes in cellular redox metabolites within 45 min after herbivory. Caterpillar LS is involved in suppressing the increase in oxidative stress that was observed in plants fed upon by caterpillars with impaired LS secretions. To further understand the link between cellular redox balance and plant defense responses. marker genes of SA. JA and ethylene (ET) pathways were compared in wildtype. the glutathione-compromised pad2-1 mutant and the tga2/5/6 triple mutant plants. AtPR1 and AtPDF1.2 showed LS-dependent expression that was alleviated in the pad2-1 and tga2/5/6 triple mutants. In comparison. the ET-dependent genes ERF1 expression showed LS-associated changes in both wildtype and pad2-1 mutant plants and the ORA 59 marker AtHEL had increased expression in response to herbivory. but a LS-dependent difference was not noted.

In addition. nitrate availability will affect metabolism and levels of nitrogen-containing defense compounds. such as glucosinolates (GSLs). We compared Arabidopsis foliar metabolic profile in plants grown under two CO2 regimes (440 vs 880 ppm). nitrate fertilization (1 mM vs 10 mM) and in response to mechanical damage of rosette leaves. Constitutive foliar metabolites in nitrate-limited plants show distinct global patterns depending on atmospheric CO2 levels; in contrast. plants grown under higher nitrate fertilization under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions have a unique metabolite signature. Nitrate fertilization dampens the jasmonate burst in response to wounding in plants grown at elevated CO2 levels. Leaf GSL profile mirrors the jasmonate burst; in particular. indole GSLs increase in response to damage in plants grown at ambient CO2 but only in nitrate-limited plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions. This may reflect a reduced capacity of C3 plants grown under enriched CO2 and nitrate levels to signal changes in oxidative stress and has implications for future agricultural management practices.,True,ewRMXfAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-016-0752-1,10385267919598310769,/scholar?cites=10385267919598310769,,https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-016-0752-1,0,0,0

As such. osteoblasts have enhanced demand for amino acids to sustain high rates of matrix synthesis associated with bone formation. The precise systems utilized by osteoblasts to meet these synthetic demands are not well understood. WNT signaling is known to rapidly stimulate glutamine uptake during osteoblast differentiation. Using a cell biology approach. we identified two amino acid transporters. γ(+)-LAT1 and ASCT2 (encoded by Slc7a7 and Slc1a5. respectively). as the primary transporters of glutamine in response to WNT. ASCT2 mediates the majority of glutamine uptake. whereas γ(+)-LAT1 mediates the rapid increase in glutamine uptake in response to WNT. Mechanistically. WNT signals through the canonical β-catenin (CTNNB1)-dependent pathway to rapidly induce Slc7a7 expression. Conversely.

Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling is critical in establishing proper digit identity and number. Mouse models of increased SHH signaling (Gli3 xt) produce a PPD phenotype. although the mechanism (s) are unclear. Interestingly. Gli3xt mice exhibit expanded Hes1 expression within the anterior autopod. To determine whether altered Hes1 expression is relevant to PPD. we generated Hes1 gain-of-function mice that over-express Hes1 within the limb bud mesenchyme (Prx1cre; R26-Hes1 f/f)(HES1 GOF).

However. increasing biotic and abiotic stresses. increasing populations. and sharply reducing natural resources especially water for agricultural purposes. push the breeders for organizing and developing improved cereal varieties with higher yield potential. In combination with developments in agricultural technology. plant breeding has made remarkable progress in increasing crop yields for over a century. Molecular markers are widely employed in plant breeding. DNA markers are being used for the acceleration of plant selection through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Genes of agronomic and scientific importance can be isolated especially on the basis of their position on the genetic map by using molecular markers technologies. In this review. the current status of marker development technologies for crop improvements will be discussed.

The plant transformation technologies have changed the face of agriculture and plant biology. Plant genetic transformation is one of the key technologies for crop improvement in addition to emerging approach for producing recombinant proteins in plants. Both plastid genomes and plant nuclear can be genetically modified. Until now. essential functional differences between the prokaryotic-like genome of the plastid and the eukaryotic genome of the plant cell nucleus will have an impact on characteristics of transgenic organism. Thus. the main goals are to generate transgenic plants with the traits of interest as well as minimizing the amount of transgenic DNA in plants while maximizing stability of gene expression and trait performance.

The aim of this work was to estimate the genetic diversity and population structure in Iraqi faba bean using SSR markers for utilization in crossing and variety development. To assess genetic variation and population structure among faba bean accessions. 25 microsatellite loci were exerted. The analysis of diversity indices in the set of faba bean accessions examined here showed that the microsatellites were informative for genotype characterization. In total. 72 polymorphic alleles were exposed to an average of 2.88 per locus and three unique alleles were detected. The average of PIC. gene diversity. marker index. resolving power and Shannon diversity was 0.513. 0.569. 1.671. 2.173 and 0.830. respectively. The patterns detected in the dendrogram and PCA divided 19 accessions into five distinct clusters with different levels of sub-grouping within the cluster. High-level genetic differentiation within a population or group (83%) was significantly greater than that among groups or populations (17%). as planned by Analysis Of Molecular Variance (AMOVA).

Ils sont couramment utilisés dans les domaines agroalimentaires. cosmétiques et thérapeutiques pour leurs propriétés biologiques et technofonctionnelles. Ils disposent en effet de caractéristiques structurales uniques. Ils sont très riches en fonctions hydroxyles ce qui leur confère un fort caractère hydrophile. ils sont souvent hydrosolubles et peuvent établir de nombreuses liaisons hydrogène. Ils sont donc en mesure de s’ associer en réseaux ce qui leur confère des propriétés épaississantes. stabilisantes et/ou gélifiantes. En général. les polysaccharides sont de structures très variables et complexes dont l’inventaire est très incomplet. Son évolution régulière est souvent associée à des succès commerciaux. dans des domaines très variés allant des marchés de niche (cosmétique. nutraceutique) jusqu’à des applications plus larges (agro-alimentaire. adhésifs. matériaux bio-sourcés…..).

Crohn's disease (CD). ulcerative colitis (UC) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients treated with biologics are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). We compared the risk of active TB in patients who were treated with biologics having 2 different mechanisms of action. anti-IL12/23 and anti-TNF. using data from previous company-sponsored randomized clinical trials. Methods: Using safety data from the Phase 2 and 3 adult clinical trial programs for anti-IL 12/23 (ustekinumab) and representative anti-TNFs (infliximab and golimumab). we compared incidence rates of active TB in patients who received treatment or placebo for RA.

Results: The overall number of active TB cases in the randomized clinical trials using anti-IL 12/23 (ustekinumab) were lower (2.< 0.1%) than with the anti-TNFs (58. 0.5%)(see Table). The duration of follow-up varied among the clinical trials; therefore. the incidence rate of active TB cases per 100 patient-years was compared between anti-IL 12/23 and anti-TNFs. When adjusted for patient-years. the incidence rates of active TB for anti-IL 12/23 were lower than those observed with anti-TNFs: anti-IL 12/23 0.02 (95% CI: 0.00. 0.06) vs anti-TNFs 0.28 (95% CI: 0.21. 0.37);(cases per 100 patient-years).

To prevent this complication. it is recommended that everybody irrespective of IBD should get immunized after the age of 60. Our aim was to evaluate the proportion of patients with IBD who are vaccinated for HZ. Methods: We used the Veterans Affairs (VA) database for our study as it is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States and patients do not have to pay for vaccinations. The study period was from January 1. 2000. through June 30. 2016.

SPiCE predictions allow prioritization of downstream in vitro RNA study.SPiCE combines in silico predictions from Splice Site Finder-like (SSF-like) and MaxEntScan (MES)(2. 3) and uses logistic regression to define two optimal decision thresholds: optimal sensitivity threshold (ThSe) and optimal specificity threshold (ThSp). 0.115 and 0.749 respectively.

1075167,The Fishery and Ecology of Cittarium pica in the West Indies,2016,Reuban James-Allen MacFarlan,,,,,,Cittarium pica. the West Indian Top Shell or “whelk.” is an understudied but culturally and ecologically important intertidal gastropod in the Caribbean. The species faces overexploitation and possible extirpation in much of its range due to a confluence of factors including life-history traits. a diffuse artisanal fishery. and lack of basic scientific knowledge. The undocumented. unregulated. and unreported nature of artisanal and small-scale commercial harvesting of this species renders its study quite different from that of other more recognizable species such as conch or spiny lobster. Here I have compiled four manuscripts that address specific questions related to the ecology and fishery of whelks in contemporary. historic. and pre-historic time periods. The first chapter addresses whether there is variation in shell shape and attachment strength related to sea conditions. The second and third chapters are sequential and in chapter 3 I first decouple the contributions of harvesting and wave exposure as drivers of size and abundance of whelks. The second part of that study expands the number of sites. introduces land development as a factor and tests the confounding roles of harvesting. waves. or and development in structuring size and abundance of whelks.

1075168,Isolating The Effect of Artisanal Fishing on an Intertidal Gastropod in the Caribbean Aislando el Efecto de la Pesca Artesanal en un Gasterópodo Intermareal en el Caribe Isoler …,,RJA MACFARLAN and GRAHAM E FORRESTER and ELIZABETH MCLEAN,,,,,,Small-scale fisheries in the Caribbean are important to coastal communities. but their effects on exploited populations are notoriously hard to quantify. We evaluated the effect of artisanal and recreational fishing on populations of a large tropical intertidal gastropod. Cittarium pica. in the British Virgin Islands. C. pica is argued to be the third most important marine invertebrate landed in the Caribbean following spiny lobster and queen conch. It is widely held that C. pica populations are in decline from overfishing. but fishers also believe that coastal development has impacted populations. The rarity and small size of C. pica on sheltered shore provides circumstantial evidence for overfishing. because sheltered shores are easy for fishers to access. It is. however. unclear whether C. pica are more common and larger on exposed shores because of reduced fishing pressure in these areas. or because C. pica is simply responding to a natural gradient in wave forces. By surveying sites that spanned gradients in both access by fishers and exposure to prevailing sea conditions. we found that fishing access is at least partly responsible for declines in abundance and body size on shores that are sheltered and/or easy to access on foot. Despite size-regulations and a closed season. chronic overharvesting of C. pica is occurring at some sites. and we consider possible alternative management strategies for C. pica to ensure sustainable long-term exploitation.,True,HRLqWUIAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Mclean/publication/304629605_Isolating_The_Effect_of_Artisanal_Fishing_on_an_Intertidal_Gastropod_in_the_Caribbean_Aislando_el_Efecto_de_la_Pesca_Artesanal_en_un_Gasteropodo_Intermareal_en_el_Caribe_Isoler_l'Effet_de_la_Peche_Art/links/5775b73e08aead7ba07001f2/Isolating-The-Effect-of-Artisanal-Fishing-on-an-Intertidal-Gastropod-in-the-Caribbean-Aislando-el-Efecto-de-la-Pesca-Artesanal-en-un-Gasteropodo-Intermareal-en-el-Caribe-Isoler-lEffet-de-la-Peche-Arti.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elizabeth_Mclean/publication/304629605_Isolating_The_Effect_of_Artisanal_Fishing_on_an_Intertidal_Gastropod_in_the_Caribbean_Aislando_el_Efecto_de_la_Pesca_Artesanal_en_un_Gasteropodo_Intermareal_en_el_Caribe_Isoler_l'Effet_de_la_Peche_Art/links/5775b73e08aead7ba07001f2/Isolating-The-Effect-of-Artisanal-Fishing-on-an-Intertidal-Gastropod-in-the-Caribbean-Aislando-el-Efecto-de-la-Pesca-Artesanal-en-un-Gasteropodo-Intermareal-en-el-Caribe-Isoler-lEffet-de-la-Peche-Arti.pdf,0,0,0

The constantly growing use of these various products means that water soluble detergents have become one of the most problematic groups of pollutants for the aquatic and terrestrial environments. It is thus important to identify bacteria having the ability to survive in the presence of a large quantity of detergent and efficiently decompose it to non-surface active compounds. In this study. we used peaty soil sampled from a surface flow constructed wetland of a wastewater treatment plant to isolate bacteria that degrade sodium dodecyl sulfate. We identified and initially characterized 36 Pseudomonas spp. strains that varied significantly in their ability to use SDS as their sole carbon source. Five strains having the closest taxonomic relationship to the P. jessenii subgroup appeared to be the most efficient SDS degraders. decomposing from 80% to 100% of the SDS present in an initial concentration 1 g/L in less than 24 hours.

Cassava production is constantly threatened by several diseases. including cassava bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam). it is the most destructive disease causing heavy yield losses. Here. we report the detection and localization on the genetic map of cassava QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) conferring resistance to cassava bacterial blight (CBB). An F1 mapping population of 117 full sibs was tested for resistance to two Xam strains (Xam318 and Xam681) at two locations in Colombia: La Vega. Cundinamarca and Arauca. The evaluation was conducted in rainy and dry seasons and additional tests were carried out under controlled greenhouse conditions. The phenotypic evaluation of the response to Xam revealed continuous variation. Based on composite interval mapping analysis. 5 strain-specific QTL for resistance to Xam explaining between 15.8 and 22.1% of phenotypic variance. were detected and localized on a high resolution SNP-based genetic map of cassava. Four of them show stability among the two evaluated seasons. Genotype by environment analysis detected three QTL by environment interactions and the broad sense heritability for Xam318 and Xam681 were 20% and 53%. respectively.

The scarce knowledge of how this type of resistance works has hindered plant breeders to fully take advantage of it. To overcome these obstacles new methodologies for the study of quantitative traits have been developed. Approaches such as genetic mapping. identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and association mapping. including candidate gene approach and genome wide association studies. have been historically undertaken to dissect quantitative traits and therefore to study QDR. Additionally. great advances in quantitative phenotypic data collection have been provided to improve these analyses. Recently. genes associated to QDR have been cloned. leading to new hypothesis concerning the molecular bases of this type of resistance. In this review we present the more recent advances about QDR and corresponding application. which have allowed postulating new ideas that can help to construct new QDR models. Some of the hypotheses presented here as possible explanations for QDR are related to the expression level and alternative splicing of some defense-related genes expression. the action of"" weak alleles"" of R genes. the presence of allelic variants in genes involved in the defense response and a central role of kinases or pseudokinases.

One of the most important antioxidant compounds in potatoes is the anthocyanin pigments. Some reports indicate a high positive correlation between color intensity. anthocyanins content. and antioxidant level in potato tubers. The variation in anthocyanins composition and content in potato tubers among diverse germplasm sources has important nutritional and health implications and constitutes an interesting trait for potato breeding programs focused on enhancing the anthocyanin and antioxidant contents of potato materials. We identified and quantified five anthocyanidins (delphinidin. cyanidin. petunidin. pelargonidin. and peonidin) on tubers from the Colombian germplasm collection of Solanum tuberosum L. Group Phureja. The phenotypic data were merged into a genome-wide association study in order to identify genomic regions associated with the nutritional compounds’ variation in potatoes. The association was conducted using a 7520 single nucleotide polymorphisms markers matrix. Seven quantitative trait loci were identified. Chromosomes I and X harbored the most stable quantitative trait loci (QTL). Three quantitative trait loci were identified close to previously reported genes involved in the regulation of anthocyanins in potato tubers. The genomic regions of these QTL reveal presumptive candidate genes as genetic factors that are the basis for a better understanding of the genetic architecture of the regulation of nutritional compounds in potatoes.

Facultad de Agronomía,One of the most important phytosanitary problems of the carnation crops in Colombia and in the entire world is vascular wilting produced by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi. Currently. an effective treatment against the pathogen does not exist; the search for resistant varieties has been the most successful method for control of this disease. Breeding programs are vital to solving the problem of the carnation fusariosis. The objective of this research was the phenotypic evaluation of carnation F1 populations. products of contrasting crossing. resistant per susceptible to F. oxysporum f. sp. dianthi. in order to determine if the resistance is inherited in the lines. This information will contribute to the selection of material and to the successful introduction of the resistant characteristic. whose expression is commercially acceptable. to the gene pool. The methodology adopted was a phenotypic evaluation of the response to the parasite in the population (450 individuals) and in the parental. This evaluation estimated the area under the curve (AU DPC). using a scale of symptoms reported for carnation vascular wilt. Three different phenotypes were established with this evaluation. The moderately susceptible one is the predominant phenotype and an analysis of phenotypic frequencies was carried out on it. The results show that the individuals of the evaluated F1 population were distributed between two extreme ranges. resistant and susceptible; this shows that there is segregation for the trait resistant to F. oxysporum f. sp dianthi.

Estudios realizados muestran que la manera más eficaz de tratar el problema. es buscar la tolerancia natural de las plantas. Así. este trabajo buscó mediar la respuesta de 16 líneas híbridas y cuatro variedades comerciales de clavel frente a un aislamiento de Fusarium oxysporum y un aislamiento de Fusarium culmorum. aplicando dos metodologías in vitro y una bajo invernadero. Así mismo buscó. establecer una relación entre los niveles de tolerancia presentada para cada ensayo y el color de los pétalos de la flor. La primera metodología in vitro consistió en un cultivo dual. en donde callos de la línea híbrida o variedad comercial. fueron enfrentados al patógeno. Con este ensayo se buscó medir el desplazamiento del patógeno hacia el callo y una posible respuesta inhibidora de éste hacia el crecimiento del hongo. En la segunda metodología. se infectaron microplántulas. permitiendo que el patógeno reconociera. infectara las raíces y ascendiera por el tallo. evaluando el nivel de colonización. Por otra parte. la medición de tolerancia bajo invernadero se realizó infectando plantas y evaluando la presencia o no de síntomas en el tiempo. Los datos obtenidos de la tolerancia a Fusarium sp y los parámetros de la evaluación floral. muestran una relación directa entre la distribución del color en la flor del clavel y la tolerancia a los dos aislamientos de Fusarium.

1075202,Brief communication: Preliminary examination of sport horse competition data for genetic evaluation,2010,FE Creagh and RE Hickson and CW Rogers,,Proc. NZ Anim. Prod,,143-145,,A sport horse can be defined as a horse which participates in one of the three equestrian disciplines represented at Olympic level. These disciplines are dressage. eventing and show jumping. There are approximately 5.000 horses registered for equestrian sport in New Zealand (Rogers & Firth. 2005). Despite the relatively small size of the New Zealand equestrian sport population. the New Zealand industry has been successful in International sport with the production of predominantly show jumpers and event horses for the export market (Rogers. 1993; Rogers & Firth. 2005). However. in contrast to the European equestrian sport communities. the New Zealand industry lacks a formal integration of the breeding and sport sectors (Huizinga & Vandermeij. 1989; Koenen et al.. 2003). This lack of integration means that performance data is not readily available to the breeding sector and conversely the pedigree data is sometimes incompletely recorded by the sporting sector. Many of the measures of performance recorded for equestrian sport are often not suitable for estimation of genetic merit without transformation. The solution to this is varied amongst the major sport horse breeding nations depending on the data recorded by the competition sector. In Germany and France. data utilised for genetic analysis are logarithmic annual earnings and logarithmic annual earnings per start respectively. In Sweden and The Netherlands. data available is a point based system with logarithmic accumulated lifetime upgrading points and logarithmic lifetime points used respectively (Huizinga & Vandermeij. 1989; Langlois & Blouin. 1997; Langlois & Blouin. 1998 …,True,MBr6l1wAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris_Rogers2/publication/249645211_Preliminary_examination_of_sport_horse_competition_data_for_genetic_evaluation/links/0c9605237a6027774c000000.pdf,16712710128865663701,/scholar?cites=16712710128865663701,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris_Rogers2/publication/249645211_Preliminary_examination_of_sport_horse_competition_data_for_genetic_evaluation/links/0c9605237a6027774c000000.pdf,0,0,0

Official performance data for the 2008/09 and 2009/10 competition seasons were obtained from Equestrian Sport New Zealand. Initially data were examined using descriptive statistics. There were 1123 and 1472 horses registered for dressage. 902 and 1255 horses registered for eventing and 1326 and 1331 horses registered for show jumping during the 2008/09 and 2009/10 seasons respectively. 13.2% and 14.2% of horses registered for dressage. 15% and 3.8% of horses registered for eventing and 16.3% and 17.2% of horses registered for show jumping had no sire recorded. Between 63.6% and 75% of sires had only 1 progeny record. For dressage and eventing points and number of starts were recorded. Zero points were recorded for 1.8% and 1.1% of horses in dressage and 64.6% and 13% of horses in eventing. For show jumping. prize money was recorded and records were usually only available for horses which placed in competition. Data on points. number of starts and prize money was skewed but approached normality under log10 transformation for all 3 disciplines. EBVs were calculated for these variables. 11.8%. 11.3 % and 14.2% of sires had 5 or more progeny records available for genetic analysis. Estimated breeding values for points per start ranged from -0.066 to 0.158 and -0.076 to 0.182 for dressage and eventing.

This study focused on commonly found mycotoxins in Africa and the possible means of prevention or reduction of their contaminating effects. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of mold and fungi; they are generally toxic to living organisms. Hundreds of mycotoxins have been identified thus far. with some. such as aflatoxins. ochratoxins. trichothecenes. zearalenone. fumonisins. and patulin. considered agro-economically important.

Non-surgical treatments for this condition have been shown to be ineffective. Surgery is the only effective treatment and obtains the best long-term outcomes. Surgery is indicated when BMI is greater than 40. or BMI is greater than 35 with significant associated comorbidities. Four types of operations are currently performed: restrictive. malabsorptive. combined procedures (malabsorptive-restrictive) and motility-reducing procedures. With restrictive procedures (adjustable gastric banding and vertical banded gastroplasty). patients can expect a long-term excess weight loss of 44-68%; for combined procedures (Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass) this is 60-70%. whereas for malabsorptive procedures (biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch). this is 75-80%. Intra-gastric stimulation is the least invasive treatment. but induces the lowest excess weight loss (32%) in the first two years after the operation. Gastric banding offers the best results when balancing risks and benefits. All procedures are now performed laparoscopically with comparable results to open surgery.

The aim of immediate breast reconstruction is to improve well-being and quality of life for women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer. Immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy has increased over the past decade. following the unequivocal demonstration of its oncological safety and the availability of reliable methods of reconstruction. The use of latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap to replace the volume loss after major breast resection is an option where the tumour to breast volume ratio is large. The latissimus dorsi muscle flap is a simple and reliable technique for breast reconstruction and was first described in 1896. The latissimus dorsi flap is known to be a well-vascularized flap with minimal risk of fat necrosis. The main disadvantage of this procedure is a high rate of donor-site seroma. Comparing with other techniques of reconstruction. the technique of latissimus dorsi flap is simple and imply a few steps: marking the flap. raising the flap. anterior transposition of the flap. covering the defect and donor site closure. This procedure must be known by all surgeons (general. plastic and breast) involved in breast surgery.

Venezuela,1991,Hedelvy J Guada and Pedro Vernet,53,Marine Turtle Newsletter,,12-13,,The Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempi) sea turtle has a unique history that has been widely discussed by sea turtle biologists. It is the most endangered of the sea turtles and as far as we know it has the most restricted breeding range. The primary nesting site for the Kemp's ridley is located in eastern Mexico approximately 322 km (200 mi) south of the United States border. near the village of Rancho Nuevo in the state of Tamaulipas (Hildebrand. 1963). Scattered nesting occurs to the south and north along the Mexican coast and along the southern and central coastline of Texas (Pritchard and Marquez. 1973; Werler. 1951; Carr. 1961; Fuller. 1978; Francis. 1978; Hildebrand 1963. 1980; Shaver. 1988). There is one record of a nesting Kemp's ridley on the west coast of Florida (Meylan et al.. 1990). Outside the breeding area. the Kemp's ridley range includes other coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico. the east coast of the US from Florida to Maine and into Nova Scotia (Pritchard and Marquez. 1973; Bleakney. 1965). and the Eastern North Atlantic along the European coast from the British Isles. Netherlands and France (Brongersma. 1972; Manzella et al.. 1988). Brongersma and Carr (1983) reported one record from Malta in the Mediterranean.

The current consensus model has Q8H2 oxidized at a low affinity site (QL). passing electrons to a tightly bound quinone cofactor at a high affinity site (QH site) that stabilizes the one-electron reduced ubisemiquinone. facilitating the transfer of electrons to the redox active metal centers where O2 is reduced to water. The current work shows that the Q8 bound to the QH site is more dynamic than previously thought. In addition. mutations of residues at the QH site that do not abolish activity have been re-examined and shown to have properties expected of mutations at the substrate binding site (QL): an increase in the KM of the substrate ubiquinol-1 (up to 4-fold) and an increase in the apparent Ki of the inhibitor HQNO (up to 8-fold).

The present study investigated the physiological time (Degree-Days) and the number of generations of tomato leaf miner (TLM). Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) in Varamin region (Tehran. Iran) on two tomato cultivars (Cal JN3 and Early Urbana Y) under field-cage and open-field conditions during tomato growing seasons in 2015 and 2016. The environmental temperature was recorded hourly using an electronic data logger. The results indicated that TLM completed three generations during tomato growing seasons on the two tomato cultivars in both years. Degree-days for each generation and the thermal requirements of immature stages were a little different under field-cage and open-field conditions in 2015 and 2016. Furthermore. the pest completed each generation. one to three days earlier in the open-field conditions depending on tomato cultivars.

The goal of this work is to estimate the efficiency of the regulation to limit the fluctuations of the number of copies of a given protein. The autoregulation considered in this paper relies mainly on a negative feedback: the proteins are repressors of their own gene expression. The efficiency of a production process without feedback control is compared to a production process with an autoregulation of the gene expression assuming that both of them produce the same average number of proteins. The main characteristic used for the comparison is the standard deviation of the number of proteins at equilibrium.

These phenomena are indeed rarely considered in classic models of protein production and no relative quantitative comparison among them has been performed. The parameters for a large and representative class of proteins are determined using experimental measures. The main important and surprising conclusion of our study is to show that despite the significant fluctuations of free RNA polymerases and free ribosomes. they bring little variability to protein production contrary to what has been previously proposed in the literature.

The number of different naive T cell clones in an organism reflects the number of different T cell receptors (TCRs) arising from recombination of the V (D) J gene segments during T cell development in the thymus. TCR diversity and more specifically. the clone abundance distribution is an important factor in immune function. Specific recombination patterns occur more frequently than others while subsequent interactions between TCRs and self-antigens are known to trigger proliferation and sustain naive T cell survival. These processes are TCR-dependent. leading to clone-dependent thymic export and naive T cell proliferation rates. Using a mean-field approximation to the solution of a regulated birth-death-immigration model and a modification arising from sampling. we systematically quantify how TCR-dependent heterogeneities in immigration and proliferation rates affect the shape of clone abundance distributions (the number of different clones that are represented by a specific number of cells. or"" clone counts""). By comparing predicted clone counts derived from our heterogeneous birth-death-immigration model with experimentally sampled clone abundances. we show that although heterogeneity in immigration rates causes very little change to predicted clone-counts. significant heterogeneity in proliferation rates is necessary to generate the observed abundances with reasonable physiological parameter values.

1075291,Stochastic models for protein production: the impact of autoregulation. cell cycle and protein production interactions on gene expression,2017,Renaud Dessalles,,,,,,The mechanism of protein production. to which is dedicated the majority of resources of the bacteria. is highly stochastic: every biochemical reaction that is involved in this process is due to random collisions between molecules. potentially present in low quantities. The good understanding of gene expression requires therefore to resort to stochastic models that are able to characterise the different origins of protein production variability as well as the biological devices that potentially control it. In this context. we have analysed the variability of a protein produced with a negative autoregulation mechanism: i.e. in the case where the protein is a repressor of its own gene. The goal is to clarify the effect of this feedback on the variance of the number of produced proteins. With the same average protein production. we sought to compare the equilibrium variance of a protein produced with the autoregulation mechanism and the one produced in “open loop”. By studying the model under a scaling regime. we have been able to perform such comparison analytically. It appears that the autoregulation indeed reduces the variance; but it is nonetheless limited: an asymptotic result shows that the variance won’t be reduced by more than 50%. The effect on the variance being moderate. we have searched for another possible effect for autoregulation: it havs been observed that the convergence to equilibrium is quicker in the case of a model with autoregulation. Classical models of protein production usually consider a constant volume. without any division or gene replication and with constant concentrations of RNA-polymerases and ribosomes.

The source of information does not focus on conventional learning like text in the book. It is wider than conventional learning. The low number of visual aid in school creates a difficulty for teacher in teaching and learning process so that students are hard to concentrate and understand the material delivered by the (Bustomi. 2010).Learning is a process that happens as a result of the interaction between humans and their environment whether or not it is intentional. Humans have learned if there is a better improvement of their behavior and knowledge. The rapid development of technology has made the needs of a concept and mechanism of IT-based teaching and learning (in education) unavoidable. This concept is known as e-learning. The new branch of e-learning is mobile-based learning or called mobile learning. The emergence of mobile learning is caused by the demand to utilize some more sophisticated mobile devices (smart phone. tab. note-book) which have not been utilized in education. Besides. the total production of those mobile devices is greater than laptop and PC. Generally. mobile learning is a learning media using mobile devices.

Tempuyung or show thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.) belongs to the Asteraceae. Morpho-anatomy and DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) barcoding of the plant correlates with species identification and metabolite synthesis. This research aims to look at morpho-anatomical structures and analyze the DNA barcode of Sonchus arvensis L (tempuyung). Three samples used for morpho-anatomical analysis are leaves. stems. roots. fruit. and seeds. Anatomical samples are made using the embedding method. DNA barcode uses multiple locus from plastid genome: rbcL and matK. Morpho-anatomical structure of tempuyung showed a similar structure of Sonchus genus. The stem presents in the intercellular space. whereas the roots and leaves present in the vascular tissue and the seeds. Fruits present in each part of the body. Tissues that formed root are epidermis. cortex. endoderm. and stele. Tissues that formed stem are epidermis. cortex. and stele. Tissues that formed leaf are epidermis. cortex. phloem. and xylem. Tissues that formed the fruit and seed are paranormal and sclerenchyma tissues. Sonchus arvensis sequence for rbcL has a similar 100% maximum identity to rbcL gene of S. arvensis.

Even as our efforts to exterminate them have developed into ever more complex forms of chemical warfare. roaches’ basic design of six legs. two hypersensitive antennae. and one set of voracious mandibles has persisted unchanged for millions of years. But as Richard Schweid shows in The Cockroach Papers. while some species of these evolutionary superstars do indeed plague our kitchens and restaurants. exacerbate our asthma. and carry disease. our belief in their total villainy is ultimately misplaced. Traveling from New York City to Louisiana. Mexico. Nicaragua. and Morocco. Schweid blends stories of his own squirm-inducing roach encounters with meticulous research to spin a tale both humorous and harrowing. As he investigates roaches’ more nefarious interactions with our species—particularly with those of us living at the margins of society—Schweid also explores their astonishing diversity. how they mate. what they’ll eat. and what we’ve written about them (from Kafka and Nelson Algren to archy and mehitabel). Knowledge soon turns into respect. and Schweid looks beyond his own fears to arrive at an uncomfortable truth: We humans are no more peaceful. tidy. or responsible about taking care of the Earth or each other than these tiny creatures that swarm in the dark corners of our minds. homes. and cereal boxes.,True,pfIdMfEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,12,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14282313107229489118&hl=en&oi=scholarr,14282313107229489118,/scholar?cites=14282313107229489118,,,0,0,0

1075337,Arsenic and lead in foods: a potential threat to human health in Bangladesh,2014,Md Saiful Islam and Md Kawser Ahmed and Md Habibullah-Al-Mamun and Kazi Nazrul Islam and Md Ibrahim and Shigeki Masunaga,31,Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A,12,1982-1992,Taylor & Francis,The non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk of arsenic and lead to adults and children via daily dietary intake of food composites in Bangladesh was estimated. The target hazard quotients (THQs). hazard index (HI) and target carcinogenic risk (TR) were calculated to evaluate the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk from arsenic and lead. Most of the individual food composites contain a considerable amount of arsenic and lead. The highest mean concentrations of arsenic were found in cereals (0.254 mg kg–1 fw) and vegetables (0.250 mg kg–1 fw). and lead in vegetables (0.714 mg kg–1 fw) and fish (0.326 mg kg–1 fw). The results showed the highest THQs of arsenic in cereals and lead in vegetables for both adults and children which exceeded the safe limit (> 1) indicating that cereals and vegetables are the main food items contributing to the potential health risk.

The present study aimed to understand the stress responses of fish fingerlings transported in a traditional way in Bangladesh. As indicators of oxidative stress. we monitored the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and activity of two antioxidant enzymes. superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) during hypoxic transportation and after reoxygenation events. Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) fingerlings were transported in hypoxic condition for 6 hours in aluminum vessels and subsequently released into normoxic (DO> 5.0 mgL-1) condition and reared for 16 days to observe delayed mortality. We found that Silver carp fingerlings were most susceptible to mortality during transportation and delayed mortality (51.93±8.06%) was found even higher than the Tilapia fingerlings. During hypoxic transportation H2O2 production was significantly (p< 0.05) higher but SOD and GPx activities were found significantly (p< 0.05) lower. However. at normoxic condition after initial increase up to 12 hours theH2O2 production gradually decreased while the GPx and the SOD activity increased gradually in the transported fingerlings. Our findings suggest that fish fingerlings transported in the traditional system suffer from oxidative stress. playing role in their early and delayed mortality even after release to normoxic condition.,True,dkVDQboAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,http://www.bioresearchcommunications.com/index.php/brc/article/view/83,12947159902185176068,/scholar?cites=12947159902185176068,,https://www.bioresearchcommunications.com/index.php/brc/article/download/83/77,0,0,0

Herein. we present new data about the distribution of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in neritic waters off the northern coast of Peru: an area that constitutes a transitional path from cold. upwelling waters to warm equatorial waters where the breeding habitat is located. Data was collected during four consecutive austral winter/spring seasons from 2010 to 2013. using whale-watching boats as platforms for research. A total of 1048 whales distributed between 487 groups were sighted. The spatial distribution of humpbacks resembled the characteristic segregation of whale groups according to their size/age class and social context in breeding habitats; mother and calf pairs were present in very shallow waters close to the coast. while dyads. trios or more whales were widely distributed from shallow to moderate depths over the continental shelf break. Sea surface temperatures (range: 18.2–25.9°C) in coastal waters were slightly colder than those closer to the oceanic realm. likely due to the influence of cold upwelled waters from the Humboldt Current system. Our results provide new evidence of the southward extension of the breeding region of humpback whales in the Southeast Pacific.

From August to October 2010. aerial displays were quantified from a whale-watching boat together with shore sightings. Our results indicated that the most frequent aerial display was breaching. followed by tail and flipper splashing. The maximum number of displays occurred in September. Groups made of pairs of whales performed the most frequent aerial behavior during the study period. Our results contrast with previous information off Ecuador suggesting that most intense aerial displays are performed when humpbacks are gathered in larger groups (more than 3 whales).

Upwelling fuels high levels of primary and secondary productivity (Chavez et al.. 2008). thus creating niche conditions that support diverse and abundant mysticete and odontocete species of the Southeast Pacific. particularly in neritic waters (Majluf & Reyes. 1989). Although the species richness is known. the information has been gathered from distinct sources with different spatial and temporal effort. Sources include records from stranding. bycatch. and whaling reports (Van Waerebeek et al.. 1988; Reyes. 2009). but less effort has been made on in situ observations. Cruise surveys along Peruvian neritic and oceanic waters are conducted once or twice per year to monitor oceanographic conditions and stocks of small pelagic fish (eg. Bertrand et al.. 2014). Sightings of cetaceans are conducted during those cruises. but records are available in just a handful of reports (eg.

Fungi have the ability to metabolize lignocellulosic substances to proteins which are assimilable for both animals and humans. Through this controlled decomposition of waste organic matter. the pollutant feature of these lignocellulosic residues is converted into an economically profitable aspect. Purpose: To investigate the role of microwave treatment in the improvement of the lignocellulosic waste processing biotechnology. Materials and methods. The biological material was represented by mushroom cultures of a Pleurotus ostreatus strain grown on malt agar medium. incubated at 20-25 C0C for 7 days. The mushroom cultures were used to inoculate a barley grains buffer medium with 2% CaCO3. Incubation was performed at 20-25 0C for 30 days. The obtained culture was inoculated on coarse lignocellulosic substratum. previously moistened and treated by microwaves for 5-6 minutes. at 65-80 0C. Results. Fructification was vigorous. suggesting that microwave treatment initiated preliminary thermal transformations in the substratum. which facilitated or speeded the decomposition of lignocellulosic substances by fungi.

Cuza"" din Iasi",1,49,""" Alexandru Ioan Cuza"" University of Iasi. Faculty of Biology. Professional Laboratory of Plant Biology",GENŢIANA MIHAELA IULIA PREDAN*. ANGELA TONIUC** Abstract. In this paper we point out the microsporogenesis and male gametophyte at some representatives of the Taxaceae family. Taxus L. and Torreya Arn. Both of them are dioecious plants. In Romania Taxus is cultivated and spontaneous while Torreya is only cultivated. The male cones are usually herbaceous and much less conspicuous even at full maturity. The male cones (microstrobilus cones or pollen cones) of cultivated Taxus baccata L. are 2-5 mm long. globose. From a central axis 6-12 peltate microsporophylls are radially extending out. Under each microsporophyll 6-8 microsporangia (pollen sacs) are attached on the adaxial. inner side. The male cones shed pollen in the early spring (March and April). that is carried on the wind to the female cone. Male cones of Torreya species (T. californica Torr.. T. nucifera (L.) Sieb. et Zucc.. and T. taxifolia Arnott) are ovoid or oblong. bigger than those of Taxus cones but have a similar structure. We emphasize the sporogenous tissue. the sporogenous cells. another wall structure. tetrads. the released young microspores from tetrads. and non-saccate pollen.

However. resistance is being developed in sandflies against the insecticide of choice that is DDT (dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane). Botanicals have potential to act as an alternative to chemical insecticides as the crude extracts and active molecules of some plants show insecticidal effect to sandflies. This will lead to safe. easy and environment friendly method for control of sandflies. Therefore. information regarding botanicals acting as alternative to chemical insecticide against sandflies assumes importance in the context of development of resistance to insecticides as well as to prevent environment from contamination. This review deals with some plants and their products having repellent and insecticidal effect to sandflies in India and abroad. Different methods of extraction and their bioassay on sandflies have been emphasized in the text. Various extracts of some plants like Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae). Solanum jasminoides (Solanaceae). Bougainvillea glabra (Nyctaginaceae). Capparis spinosa (Capparidaceae).

The study involved Murdoch University. the Department of Biodiversity. Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) (formerly Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Swan River Trust) and the Australian Centre for Applied Aquaculture Research (ACAAR). It was designed to complement a concurrent project to develop aquaculture techniques to produce and release M. dalli and re-engage the local community with prawning and the estuary (led by ACAAR. DBCA’s Parks and Wildlife Service and the West Australian Fish Foundation). funded by the Recreational Fishing Initiatives Fund. The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation provided matching funds for the current study. Biological data on M. dalli were collected from 20 sites in nearshore and 16 in the offshore waters of the Swan-Canning Estuary. ranging from the mouth of the system to ~40 and 30 km upstream in the Swan and Canning rivers. respectively. in every lunar month between October 2013 and March 2016. Laboratory studies were also completed to investigate the survival and growth of larval prawns in different salinity. water temperature and algal food conditions. Results were presented as part of the Prawn Watch program to engage the community in the research and encourage stewardship of the fishery and the estuary.,True,xY1_W6kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,2,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/40114/,11661192817133740759,/scholar?cites=11661192817133740759,,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/40114/1/Tweedley%20et%20al%20(2017)%20RSP13MUR01_DBCA_compress.pdf,0,0,0
1075371,Understanding the ecology of the Western School Prawn to maximize restocking success,2015,J Tweedley and Brian Poh and A Broadley and J Crisp and N Loneragan,,,,,,Historically the Western School Prawn (Metapenaeus dalli) was an important and iconic catch for commercial and recreational fishers in the Swan-Canning Estuary. However. the abundance of this penaeid declined dramatically since the 1960s. resulting in the closure of the commercial fishery and essentially the cessation of the recreational prawning. In 2012. a restocking and associated research program was initiated to try and increase the abundance of this popular species. Monthly sampling. for two years. of the fish and crustacean faunas of the shallow and deeper waters of this estuary has shown that; 1) the abundance of M. dalli changes markedly throughout the year. particularly in the shallow waters. 2) M. dalli moves into the shallows between November and March to spawn. but that that timing changes slightly among years according to environmental conditions. 3) The distribution of adult and juvenile prawns changes temporally and can be used to inform broodstock collection and release sites. In addition. dietary analysis was performed on 11 abundant fish species in the estuary to determine those species that predate on post-larval M. dalli (direct predators) and those that also target other small crustaceans (potential predators). Key predators included the Gobbleguts Ostorhinchus rueppellii (all sizes) and the Black Bream Acanthopagrus butcheri (<100 mm in length). These dietary results together. with monthly prawn and fish abundance data for 36 sites across the estuary have been used to design an effective release strategy and highlight the value in restocking programs being supported by robust quantitative faunal surveys.,True,xY1_W6kAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/28772/,17385805475041783666,/scholar?cites=17385805475041783666,,,0,0,0

This study provides the first data on the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate fauna of Hill Inlet. the northernmost estuary in south-western Australia. Sampling was conducted in June 2019 (Austral winter). when water levels were very high due to recent heavy rainfall and the bar at the mouth of the estuary was intact. Surface salinities were oligohaline and declined along the longitudinal axis. ranging from 12 to 3. A marked halocline was present at most sites. resulting in pronounced hypoxia. High water levels precluded the use of a seine net at some sites to sample the nearshore fish fauna. however. two species were recorded (Pseudogobius olorum and Acanthopagrus butcheri). both of which complete their life-cycle within the estuary. Deeper. offshore waters. sampled using gill nets. yielded only four species (Mugil cephalus. A. butcheri. Adrichetta forsteri and Pomatomus saltatrix). due to the bar at the mouth of the estuary being closed prior to sampling thus limiting recruitment from marine species. Ten benthic macroinvertebrates species were collected. representing mainly polychaetes. molluscs and crustaceans. The low number of species was likely caused by the hypoxia present throughout most of the bottom waters. Although these data represent a benchmark against which future changes can be detected. it is recommended that additional sampling is conducted when water levels are lower and the bar has been open to provide a more holistic assessment of the fauna of Hill Inlet.,True,xY1_W6kAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163402v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/21/2020.06.21.163402.full.pdf,0,0,0

A snapshot survey was conducted in June 2019. when water levels were very high due to recent heavy rainfall and the bar at the mouth of the estuary remaining intact. Salinities in the surface waters of the estuary were oligohaline and declined along the longitudinal axis. ranging from 12 ppt at the bar to only 3 ppt~ 1.5 km upstream. A marked halocline was present at all except the most downstream site. which resulted in hypoxia occurring throughout most of the deeper waters. The surface waters were. however. well-oxygenated.High water levels precluded the use of a 21.5 m seine net at most sites to sample the nearshore fish fauna. leading to only two species being recorded. ie Black Bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) and Bluespot Goby (Pseudogobius olorum). both of which complete their life-cycle within the estuary. Due to the lack of effective sampling during the current study and knowledge of the species present in other estuaries in the region. these species are considered an underestimate of those likely to occur in Hill Inlet. Four species of fish were collected from gill nets in the offshore waters of the estuary. They included two Tailor (Pomatomus saltatrix) from the most downstream site. Yelloweye Mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri) from the lower estuary and Sea Mullet (Mugil cephalus) and A. butcheri throughout the entire system. As the fish species present in the offshore waters of south-western Australian estuaries typically comprise marine species. the depauperate nature of these catches likely reflects the fact at the bar at the mouth of the …,True,xY1_W6kAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Tweedley/publication/338015459_Snapshot_survey_of_the_fish_and_invertebrate_fauna_of_Hill_Inlet/links/5dfa493a299bf10bc36380d6/Snapshot-survey-of-the-fish-and-invertebrate-fauna-of-Hill-Inlet.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Tweedley/publication/338015459_Snapshot_survey_of_the_fish_and_invertebrate_fauna_of_Hill_Inlet/links/5dfa493a299bf10bc36380d6/Snapshot-survey-of-the-fish-and-invertebrate-fauna-of-Hill-Inlet.pdf,0,0,0

1075375,Assessing the sediment preference of a penaeid prawn to inform release strategies,2015,Amber Bennett and James R Tweedley and Brian Poh and N Loneragan,,,,,,The abundance of the Western School Prawn (Metapenaeus dalli) declined markedly in the Swan-Canning Estuary after the 1960s. resulting in the initiation of a restocking program in 2012. Further to the decline in abundance. anecdotal evidence from recreational fishers indicated that there had been a spatial shift in the distribution of this prawn. To test the hypothesis that a change in sediment composition may be responsible. the density of M. dalli. recorded monthly between October 2013 and August 2014. was correlated against sediment organic matter content and grain size distribution. Densities of M. dalli were found to differ among sediment types in summer. but not winter. Controlled laboratory experiments were used to investigate whether M. dalli exhibited a preference for sediments from either the upper or lower reaches of their distribution within the estuary. Prawns exhibited a preference for nearshore and offshore sediments that contained a lower percentage contribution of larger grain sizes and/or a higher percentage contribution of finer grain sizes. i.e. sediments from the lower rather than upper reaches. These experiments also revealed that emergence and activity rates of M. dalli are strongly related to photoperiod. with individuals preferring to remain buried during daylight hours and become active during darkness. Visual observations also indicated that the prawns were able to bury more rapidly in finer than coarse sediments. thus reducing their length of exposure to predators. The implications of these findings on the current restocking program for M. dalli in the Swan-Canning Estuary are discussed.,True,xY1_W6kAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/28778/,,,,,0,0,0

The work of TFs is well regulated at each stage of their activities. TFs usually consist of three protein domains required for DNA binding. dimerization. and transcriptional regulation. Alternative splicing (AS) produces multiple proteins with varying composition of domains. Recent studies have shown that AS of some TF genes form small proteins (small interfering peptide/small interfering protein. siPeP/siPRoT). which lack one or more domains and negatively regulate target TFs by the mechanism of protein interference (peptide interference/protein interference. PePi/PRoTi). The presence of an alternative form for the transcription factor CCA1 of Arabidopsis thaliana. has been shown to be involved in the regulation of the response to cold stress. For the PtFLC protein. one of the isoforms was found. which is formed as a result of alternative splicing and acts as a negative repressor. binding to the full-length TF PtFLC and therefore regulating the development of the Poncirus trifoliata. For A. thaliana. a FLM gene was found forming the FLM-δ isoform. which acts as a dominant negative regulator and stimulates the development of the flower formation process due to the formation of a heterodimer with SVP TF. Small interfering peptides and proteins can actively participate in the regulation of gene expression. for example. in situations of stress or at different stages of plant development. Moreover. small interfering peptides and proteins can be used as a tool for fundamental research on the function of genes …,True,1hEBZMIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alisa_Vyacheslavova/publication/328876780_Protein_interference_for_regulation_of_gene_expression_in_plants/links/5c04c8d345851523d159b589/Protein-interference-for-regulation-of-gene-expression-in-plants.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alisa_Vyacheslavova/publication/328876780_Protein_interference_for_regulation_of_gene_expression_in_plants/links/5c04c8d345851523d159b589/Protein-interference-for-regulation-of-gene-expression-in-plants.pdf,0,0,0

The successful gene coexpression can be obtained by using 2A-sequence. which mediates the effective cleavage of peptide products co-translationally. Compared to other coexpression systems the 2A-one has such advantages as: production of complex proteins consist of several subunits in equimolar proportion without proteolytic enzymes; subsequent targeting of translation products to one or different cell compartments. Currently. the wide range of expression vectors is used. For instance. plant transient expression vector pXSN is convenient due to capability of TA-cloning and existence of suicide gene ccdB for self-ligation control.

Portugal,2012,Joana F Augusto and Patrícia Rachinas-Lopes and Manuel E dos Santos,92,Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom,8,1773-1782,Cambridge University Press,The resident population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the Sado Estuary. Portugal. has been declining at least during the past three decades. A complete photographic census produced a current count of 24 animals—19 adults. three subadults and two calves. It appears to be phylopatric and essentially closed. but given the likely importance that exchanges with neighbouring coastal groups may play. even if rare. the most adequate term to define this dolphin should be community and not population. Large groups with all age-classes are common in the community. possibly as a calf and subadult protection strategy. and this may be related to the fact that these age-classes have had high mortality rates in the last decade. Maternity of two calves was determined. and we found that the two mothers adopted different parenting strategies. While one mother spent more time alone with her calf. the other mother spent more time with her calf in larger groups. The average coefficient of association for this community is 0.45. quite high for this species. Associations and typical group size are similar between all individuals. with no patterning according to age-class or sex. which constitutes an atypical trait for dolphin societies. There are also no clear divisions in this community according to cluster analysis. Associations are preferred and long term. lasting approximately 34 days and fitting a pattern of casual acquaintances. where individuals associate for a period of time. disassociate and may reassociate after that.

Costa,13,PLoS ONE,8,e0201614,PLoS ONE,Scoring and tracking animal movements manually is a time consuming and subjective process. susceptible to errors due to fatigue. Automated and semi-automated video-based tracking methods have been developed to overcome the errors and biases of manual analyses. In this manuscript we present D-Track. an open-source semi-automatic tracking system able to quantify the 3D trajectories of dolphins. non-invasively. in the water. This software produces a three-dimensional reconstruction of the pool and tracks the animal at different depths. using standard cameras. D-Track allows the determination of spatial preferences of the animals. their speed and its variations. and the identification of behavioural routines. We tested the system with two captive dolphins during different periods of the day. Both animals spent around 85% of the time at the surface of the Deep Area of their pool (5-meters depth). Both dolphins showed a stable average speed throughout 31 sessions. with slow speeds predominant (maximum 1.7 ms-1). Circular swimming was highly variable. with significant differences in the size and duration of the “circles”. between animals. within-animals and across sessions. The D-Track system is a novel tool to study the behaviour of aquatic animals. and it represents a convenient and inexpensive solution for laboratories and marine parks to monitor the preferences and routines of their animals.,True,1AZI6tMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201614,11666113065546762104,/scholar?cites=11666113065546762104,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201614,0,0,0

Whistles may be emitted in stereotyped (signature) or variant patterns. and their production might be affected by sex. age. environmental. and social contexts. This study examined. non-intrusively. the whistle emissions of six captive bottlenose dolphins at Zoomarine in Algarve. Portugal. in two separate time sets and three different contexts: two of the animals in isolation in 2008. and all six in 2012. both segregated from their group and in social context. From a total of 1.681 whistles. 1.249 were analyzed from 32 samples in different contexts: seven samples in isolation in 2008. 18 in segregation in 2012. and seven in social context. Through visual inspection of spectrograms. whistles were classified into 12 different contour categories. Only one category was found in both time sets and could be considered a signature whistle by SIGID criteria (Janik et al.. 2013). This contour was associated with the same animal in 2008 and 2012. Whistle emission rates were 7.8 times higher in isolation as compared with social context. and significant differences were also found in the end and maximum frequencies as well as number of inflections and loops. Multiloop whistles were more common in isolation than in social contexts. The variant (nonstereotyped) contours dominated the whistle production in segregated contexts (but not by isolated animals) as well as in social contexts.

Remodeling occurs when Twine/Cdc25 falls below a critical threshold. Timing is based on Twine destabilization induced by zygotic transcription. It is conceivable that appropriate starting levels are also important for timely reaching the threshold. Mechanisms for controlling Twine levels at the onset of MBT are unknown. Here we identify a function of the protein phosphatase V in this mechanism. Twine was increased in PpV mutants. whereas the decay rate was comparable to wildtype. PpV mutants frequently underwent an extra nuclear division. We detected PpV-dependent phosphosites in Twine. Phosphosite mutants contain higher Twine levels and frequently underwent an extra nuclear division. comparable to PpV mutants.

This is particularly problematic when ecological models are used to make conservation and management plans whose outcomes may depend strongly on model formulation. Nonlinear time series approaches allow us to circumvent this issue by using the observed dynamics of the system to guide policy development. However. these methods typically require long time series from stationary systems. which are rarely available in ecological settings. Here we present a Bayesian approach to nonlinear forecasting based on Gaussian processes that readily integrates information from several short time series and allows for nonstationary dynamics.

1075409,Size-conditional smolting and the response of Carmel River steelhead to two decades of conservation efforts,2017,Juan Lopez Arriaza and David A Boughton and Kevan Urquhart and Marc Mangel,12,PloS one,11,e0188971,Public Library of Science,Threshold effects are common in ecosystems and can generate counterintuitive outcomes in management interventions. A threshold effect proposed for steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is size-conditional smolting and marine survival. Steelhead are anadromous. maturing in the ocean but migrating to freshwater to spawn. where their offspring reside for one or more years before smolting—physiologically transforming to a saltwater form—and migrating to the ocean. In conditional smolting. juveniles transform only if growth exceeds a threshold body size prior to migration season. and subsequent marine survival correlates with size at ocean entry. Conditional smolting suggests that efforts to improve freshwater survival of juveniles may reduce smolt success if they increase competition and reduce growth. Using model-selection techniques. we asked if this effect explained declining numbers of adult Carmel River steelhead. This threatened population has been the focus of two decades of habitat restoration. as well as active translocation and captive-rearing of juveniles stranded in seasonally dewatered channels. In the top-ranked model selected by information-theoretic criteria. adult decline was linked to reduced juvenile growth rates in the lower river. consistent with the conditional smolting hypothesis. According to model inference. since 2005 most returning adult steelhead were captively-reared. However. a lower-ranked model without conditional smolting also had modest support. and suggested a negative effect of captive rearing. Translocations of juvenile fish to perennial reaches may have reduced the steelhead run slightly by raising …,True,XO_IdBoAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188971,13043799017359589394,/scholar?cites=13043799017359589394,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188971,0,0,0

It typically arises because of variability in local flow velocities. Because the pattern of spreading by dispersion is similar to Fickian diffusion. dispersion has been traditionally modeled as a pseudo-diffusive process that depends on the concentration gradient. However. there is no physical basis for this dependence of dispersion on concentration gradient. This unphysical formulation of dispersive flux has led to a number of major shortcomings including (a) lack of a self-consistent. mechanistic. and independent approach for predicting dispersion coefficient; and (b) dependence of the dispersion coefficient on transport distance.

1075413,The Use of Mathematical Models for Informing Management Strategies: An Application in Steelhead Trout and Fleet Dynamics A thesis submitted in partial satisfaction of the …,2013,Juan Lopez Arriaza,,,,,,Mathematical models can be of tremendous benefit in a multitude of fields. Here I will present the applicability of mathematical models to both behavioral bioeconomics and life history biology. In each section we develop and apply models that provide clear insight into each of the respective fields. In both cases. we opt to sacrifice some fidelity to nature to both obtain more easily interpretable results and to deal with the fact of a data poor system. We will use the setting of an insect parasitoid as gateway to study the use of stochastic dynamic programming in the field of behavioral bioeconmics as it applies to a simple fishery model. We investigate the effects of applying spatial penalties for fishing as a management strategy to reduce by-catch levels. We then turn our attention to the growth potential of the endangered Southern California Steelhead population in the Santa Ynez River basin. Applying an individual based bioenergetics model. we characterize the the growth potential landscape using temperature data gathered from May to October 2012. Since density-dependent food availability has the potential to be the driver of growth within the watershed. we augment the simple model with a model of survival of individuals. Using these techniques we are able to provide a general pattern of growth throughout the watershed. Albeit both of the scenarios that are studied in the following sections utilize simple models which require some biologically justified assumptions. they are able to serve as powerful tools in a management scenario.,True,XO_IdBoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.348.4873&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.348.4873&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

MATa cells choose HML as template. whereas MATα cells use HMR. The recombination enhancer (RE) located on the left arm regulates this process. One long-standing hypothesis is that switching is guided by mating-type-specific and possibly RE-dependent chromosome folding. Here. we use Hi-C. 5C. and live-cell imaging to characterize the conformation of chromosome III in both mating types. We discovered a mating-type-specific conformational difference in the left arm. Deletion of a 1-kb subregion within the RE. which is not necessary during switching. abolished mating-type-dependent chromosome folding.

Because this signalling pathway is highly conserved from invertebrates to mammals and DAF-16 is a key player in innate immunity. we wondered whether a high-glucose diet. resembling the hyperglycaemic conditions in diabetic patients. would affect the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial pathogens isolated from different clinical situations (urinary tract or diabetic foot infections).

1075434,Dynamique de la chromatine et la régulation du changement du type sexuel chez la levure,2017,Sylvain Audibert,,,,,,"La recombinaison homologue (RH) est un mécanisme de réparation des cassures d'ADN double brin (CDB) essentiel pour le maintien de l'intégrité du génome. Chez la levure Saccharomyces cerevisiae. l'étude du ""changement de type sexuel"". comme modèle de recombinaison. a contribué à la compréhension des notions fondamentales de cette voie de réparation. Le changement de type sexuel implique la conversion allélique du locus MAT d'une forme ""MATa"" à ""MATα"". Ce mécanisme est initié par l'apparition d'une CDB unique induite par l'endonucléase HO au niveau du locus MAT. Les séquences homologues HMLα et HMRa. présentes sur le chromosome III. sont utilisées comme donneur lors de la réparation. L'alternance du type sexuel s'explique par le choix récurant du donneur de type sexuel opposé. assurant le changement allélique du locus MAT à chaque génération cellulaire. L'étude du choix du donneur a conduit à l'identification d'une séquence appelée le ""recombination enhancer"" (RE). située proche du locus HMLα sur le bras gauche du chromosome III. Dans les cellules MATa. le RE ""activé"" permettrait la formation d'une boucle entre la région RE et le locus MAT favorisant la recombinaison avec la séquence HMLα proche. Cependant. la formation de cette boucle sur le chromosome III et les facteurs impliqués sont encore mal caractérisés.

These conformations contribute to the regulation of gene expression. cellular development. chromosome transmission. and defects can lead to human disease. The highest functional level of this hierarchy is the partitioning of the genome into compartments of active and inactive chromatin domains (1’s-10’s Mb). These compartments are further partitioned into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that spatially cluster co-regulated genes (100’s kb–1’s Mb). The final level that has been observed is long range loops formed between regulatory elements and promoters (10’s kb–100’s Mb).

P exhibits a high affinity for DnaB. the major replicative helicase for unwinding double stranded DNA. The concept of P-lethality relates to the hypothesis that P can sequester DnaB and in turn prevent cellular replication initiation from oriC. Alternatively. it was suggested that P-lethality does not involve an interaction between P and DnaB. but is targeted to DnaA. P-lethality is assessed by examining host cells for transformation by ColE1-type plasmids that can express P. and the absence of transformants is attributed to a lethal effect of P expression. The plasmid we employed enabled conditional expression of P. where under permissive conditions. cells were efficiently transformed. We observed that ColE1 replication and plasmid establishment upon transformation is extremely sensitive to P. and distinguish this effect from P-lethality directed to cells. We show that alleles of dnaB protect the variant cells from P expression. P-dependent cellular filamentation arose in ΔrecA or lexA [Ind-] cells. defective for SOS induction. Replication propagation and restart could represent additional targets for P interference of E. coli replication. beyond the oriC-dependent initiation step.

To address this question. we used three mouse models of liver fibrosis. repeated CCl 4 administration for 2. 6 and 12 months to induce pericentral damage. as well as bile duct ligation (21 days) and mdr2−/− mice to study periportal fibrosis. Analyses were performed by RNA-sequencing. immunostaining of zonated proteins and image analysis. RNA-sequencing demonstrated a significant enrichment of pericentral genes among genes downregulated by CCl 4; vice versa. periportal genes were enriched among the upregulated genes. Immunostaining showed an almost complete loss of pericentral proteins. such as cytochrome P450 enzymes and glutamine synthetase. while periportal proteins. such as arginase 1 and CPS1 became expressed also in pericentral hepatocytes. This pattern of fibrosis-associated ‘periportalization’was consistently observed in all three mouse models and led to complete resistance to hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen (200 mg/kg). Characterization of the expression response identified the inflammatory pathways TGFβ. NFκB. TNFα. and transcription factors NFKb1. Stat1. Hif1a. Trp53. and Atf1 among those activated. while estrogen-associated pathways. Hnf4a and Hnf1a. were decreased. In conclusion. liver fibrosis leads to strong alterations of lobular zonation. where the pericentral region adopts periportal features. Beside adverse consequences. periportalization supports adaptation to repeated doses of hepatotoxic compounds.

It is the best option in treatment of resistant schizophrenia. It causes many metabolic side effects. including diabetes mellitus. This study aims to detect the histopathological change of the rat pancreas under chronic clozapine treatment. Twenty adult male albino rats were divided into two groups; control; received daily 2 mL tap water by intragastric tube for 21 days. and treated; received instead 25 mg/kg clozapine in 2 mL tap water. Animals were sacrificed and specimens from the pancreatic tails were processed for histopathological and morphometric studies. In treated animals. the islets were large and irregular. Most interlobular and interlobar ducts were dilated and some showed a related area of endocrine-like cells. which was sometimes immunoreactive to the antiinsulin antibody. Masson’s trichrome revealed increased interlobular and interacinar collagen fibers. PAS stain revealed an increase in the thickness of the islet capillary basement membrane. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-insulin antibody showed strong staining of the islets of treated animals. Morphometric study revealed a highly significant increase in the number of both islets and interlobular ducts/lobule and in the diameter of both islets and interlobular ducts. It also revealed a highly significant increase in the diameter of the periductal fibrotic area and in the thickness of the islets capillary basement membrane in treated animals.

Diseases of the aorta causes serious back effects on the heart. This study aims to detect the histological changes of the aged aorta and to understand their underlying mechanisms to help in development of the prophylactic and treatment measures. Ten adult and ten aged male albino rats were used. Specimens from their thoracic aorta were prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Orcein for elastic laminae. and anti-actin antibody. Morphometric measurements for the thickness of the tunica intima and elastic laminae of the tunica media were performed. Aged aorta showed thickening of the tunica intima. thinning and fragmentation of elastic laminae. proliferation of medial smooth muscle with reduction of their actin myofibrils. and fibrosed tunica adventitia. Atherosclerosis was also detected with epithelioid changes in the medial smooth muscle and focal thickening of the intima. It is concluded that. aging is a risk factor for aortic atherosclerosis. Intimal thickening and proliferation of medial smooth muscle are the earliest signs.

However. functional redundancy between invasive and native species could reduce non-native species effects on native ecosystems. Despite this. even small differences in functional traits between these species may still have unpredictable effects on colonized ecosystems. Invasive crayfish. as ecosystem engineers. potentially have wide and complex effects on recipient ecosystems. even when replacing a native counterpart. We used laboratory microcosms to test whether native (Astacus astacus) and invasive crayfish species (Orconectes limosus.

Several recent studies have provided mixed evidence. however. and in some instances females seem to prefer genetically similar males. A preference for genetically similar mates can be adaptive if outbreeding depression is more harmful than inbreeding depression or if females gain inclusive fitness benefits by mating with close kin. Here. we investigated genetic compatibility and mating patterns in an insular population of house sparrow (Passer domesticus). over a three-year period. using 12 microsatellite markers and one major histocompability complex (MHC) class I gene.

But sometimes. seemingly successful invasions. in which the invasive species may reach high densities. suddenly collapse. with abrupt decline and extinction of the invader. Diseases have been implicated in invasion collapses. though the underlying mechanism accounting for the entire invasion arc is unresolved. In this study. we simulated a disease-mediated invasion (DMI) by constructing a susceptible-infected-susceptible model for infection and population dynamics of a native and an invasive species.

The degree to which regenerative ability is distributed across different taxa. however. is harder to ascertain given the potential for phylogenetic constraint or inertia. and adaptive processes to shape this pattern. Here. we examine the phylogenetic history of regeneration in two groups where the trait has been well‐studied: arthropods and reptiles. Because autotomy is often present alongside regeneration in these groups. we performed ancestral state reconstructions for both traits to more precisely assess the timing of their origins and the degree to which these traits coevolve.

This initial disappointment is not exclusive to the FFC because this particular discrepancy between effort and results is inherent to students’ college life. Indeed. every student will encounter a time when their efforts will not yield the expected results on a test (formative or summative). However. following the first underperformance. student’s frustration (Figure 1C) can lead them to apply even more. but similar efforts toward learning (Figure 1D). Because these efforts are identical to the previous ones they will often result either in the same failure or in a marginal increase in performance compared to the efforts applied (Figure 1E). In fact. the main issue with the FFC is the lack of change from the student caught in the cycle applying similar type of learning techniques (aka efforts) over and over. Students are expecting different results simply due to the sheer amount of effort applied to the task. After the second iteration of underperforming. those students often develop anger (Figure 1F) toward the learning task. their teacher. themselves. or all of the above. Blinded or motivated by their anger. students proceed through the cycle once again (Figure 1G) exacerbating the underperforming outcomes at every cycle.Not all underperformances lead students to enter the FFC.

These studies now show that Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF1) is required for differentiation of classical DC type 1 (cDC1) subsets and monocyte-derived DC (Mo-DC). Phenotypic studies found that AIF1 expression increased in committed subsets differentiating from common myeloid progenitors (CMP). However. silencing AIF1 expression in hematopoietic stem progenitors restrained the capacity to differentiate into Mo-DC and cDC1 cell subsets under GM-CSF or Flt3-L stimuli conditions. respectively. This was further marked by restrained expression of IRF8. which is critical for development of Mo-DC and cDC1 subsets. As a result. absence of AIF1 restrained the cells at the Lin-CD117+FcγR-CD34+ CMP stage. Further biochemical studies revealed that abrogating AIF1 resulted in inhibition of the NFκB family member RelB expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation during differentiation of Mo-DC. Lastly. protein binding studies identified that AIF1 interacts with protein kinase C (PKC) to influence downstream signaling pathways. Taken together. this is the first report showing a novel role of AIF1 as a calcium-responsive scaffold protein that supports IRF8 expression and interacts with PKC to drive NFκB-related RelB for successfully differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells into cDC and Mo-DC subsets under Flt3-L and GM-CSF stimuli. respectively.,True,0I0dFzwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,7,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00173/full,14995604376408757277,/scholar?cites=14995604376408757277,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00173/full,0,0,0

Mediterranean region. Madeira. Canary Islands and up to Southwestern Asia. According to the present knowledge it is however almost absent from Southeastern Europe. In this paper we present first record of M. aspersus from the Republic of Kosovo. This is at the same time first country record of the genus. Unlike many countries where this species is present abundantly in our case it is extremely rare. A single adult male specimen of M. aspersus was found in an ultraviolet light trap at the Blinajë Hunting Reserve on August 23rd 2013. This has been a single specimen of this species caught at this locality during a one year monthly sampling of caddisflies with UV light traps and entomological net. Another male specimen has been caught on September 24th 2014 at the same locality. Streams and rivers in all parts of Kosovo were surveyed during the period 2009-2014 for Trichoptera species and currently the Blinajë Hunting Reserve is the only locality where this species has been found. The distributional area of this species has been considerably expanded by this record.

Eötvös Loránd University,The discovery of the new Agaphylax genus with unique paramere organisation has initiated our lineage sorting of tribes by parameres in the Limnephilinae subfamily applying the principles and procedures of fine phenomics in order to establish transformation series of the polarized plesiomorphy-apomorphy character states for each limnephiline genera. According to the extraordinary high diversity the paramere that is the stimulatory and titillating structure of the phallic organ is a speciation supertrait. This adaptive trait is directly involved in the processes of reproductive isolation and diverging as subtle initial split of lineages producing the incipient sibling species in the recent past of contemporary speciation processes. Contrary. the drastic divergence of the Agaphylax plated paramere is much older. similarly to the many-spined parameres of the Hesperophylacini tribe. It has been initiated by drastic combined and synchronous external and internal stochastic effects. processed in ancestral sexual integrative adaptation as well as organised and fixed in older and deeper coalescence events and appears as a character with tribe ranking potential. To open a wider perspective. a systemic relational analysis is required in the future including other adaptive or neutral character transformation series. due to the burden of taxonomic incongruences grounded by chimerism in stochastic genetic reticulation. Traits of species are mixed products coming from various sources. Only character combinations can and ought to be analysed in terms how to classify taxa.

The water quality indices are intended to provide a single value for the water quality of a source or a stream that reduces the large amount of parameters in a simpler expression and enables an easy interpretation of the monitoring data. During 2017. seventeen physicochemical parameters were measured in spring. summer. autumn and winter. in five locations along the Morava e Binçës River in Kosovo. For the assessment we employed the Water Quality Index (WQI) which uses the physicochemical parameters for the evaluation of the water quality. The findings of this study ascertain that MB1 station had the best quality with a value of WQI 88 and is classified in the Good Category. whereas the lowest quality of water was found on in MB4 station with a value of WQI 65 and it is thus classified in the Fair Category.

XXX) is a gonosomal aneuploidy characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in a female person. Usually the diagnosis is established made postnatally by chromosome analysis in patients with suggestive clinical signs. Clinical signs vary by age. In prepubertal patients have a growth retardation associated with uncharacteristic facial dysmorphism. mild mental retardation with behavioral disorders. plus clinical signs of ovarian dysgenesis. postpubertal. Aim: We analyzed retrospectively the genotype-phenotype correlations for a selected group of 36 patients diagnosed with trisomy X (homogeneous or mosaic) by cytogenetic methods (X chromatin and karyotype).

Due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity of ID. in about 50% of cases an etiologic diagnosis cannot be established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a combination of MLPA kits to establish the diagnosis in 369 patients with syndromic ID and normal or uncertain routine karyotype results. All patients were assessed for chromosome imbalance using SALSA MLPA P064 or P096 kits. if the phenotype was suggestive of a microdeletion syndrome (subgroup A - 186 patients). or subtelomeric P036 and P070 kits. if the phenotype was not suggestive of a microdeletion syndrome or if the result of the standard karyotype was uncertain (subgroup B - 183 patients). Abnormal results detected by these kits were further characterized using appropriate follow-up MLPA kits (Telomere Follow-up set. P029-A1. P250-B2. ME028-B1). In subgroup A we identified 25 patients with microdeletions (13.4%).

Along with phenotypic responses that occur during development (i.e. ‘within-generation’ plasticity). such ‘transgenerational plasticity’ (TGP) has been documented in a diverse array of taxa spanning many environmental perturbations. New theory predicts that temporal stability is a key driver of the evolution of TGP. We tested this prediction using natural populations of zooplankton from lakes in Connecticut that span a large gradient in the temporal dynamics of predator-induced mortality. We reared more than 120 clones of Daphnia ambigua from nine lakes for multiple generations in the presence/absence of predator cues. We found that temporal variation in mortality selects for within-generation plasticity while consistently strong (or weak) mortality selects for increased TGP.

The importance and generality of these ecoevolutionary dynamics are largely unknown. In this chapter. we promote the use of waterfleas (Daphnia sp.) as a model organism in the exploration of eco-evolutionary interactions in nature. The many characteristics of Daphnia that make them suitable for laboratory study in conjunction with their wellknown ecological importance in lakes. position Daphnia to contribute new and important insights into eco-evolutionary dynamics. We first review the influence of key environmental stressors in Daphnia evolution. We then highlight recent work documenting the pathway from life history evolution to ecology using Daphnia as a model.

Denisovans. and Homo heidelbergensis. This article explains how interbreeding between early H. sapiens and archaic hominins occurred. The availability of edible insects in East Asia aided the spread of the unaggressive. highly cooperative Neanderthals. who interbred with H. sapiens in Asia. resulting in a higher admixture of Neanderthal DNA in East Asian populations. Geographical variation in degree of interbreeding between H. sapiens and Neanderthals likely contributed to neurological and behavioral differences in modern humans.

1075634,Origins of human intelligence: The chain of tool-making and brain evolution.,2016,Kwang Hyun Ko,22,Anthropological Notebooks,1,,,Although the definition of intelligence is debatable. it can be allocated to only one anatomical location: the brain. Arguments regarding general measures of animal intelligence and discussions of its evolution up to the Neanderthals arise only because hominids have evolved to have larger brains; ie. they have become more “intelligent”. Hominids clearly evolved in the past. but whether evolution is still ongoing is debated. Ironically. because hominids have created technologies and innovations to aid their survival. their evolution has included adaptation to the environment generated by their inventions. Similar to the recent evolution of ADHD traits or gluten tolerance. the hominid brain has undergone major changes over the past seven million years due to man-made habitats and technologies. Tool-making creates an environment conducive to increased social interactions. as it facilitates increased provisioning and protection. while increased opportunities for interactions and observations lead to advances in toolmaking. These changes have been offset by the concurrent evolution of language and tool-making. Biologically. hominid brains have increased in size in areas where toolmaking and language-processing coincide. This increase in brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools. including the use of fire. and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic that stood on the shoulders of the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and versatile hands enhanced the momentum of brain evolution.

1075635,Origins of bipedalism,2015,Kwang Hyun Ko,58,Brazilian archives of biology and technology,6,929-934,Tecpar,This article aimed to review various theories of bipedalism and provide a holistic answer to human evolution. There have been two questions regarding bipedalism: i) why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal?. and ii) why did hominins become increasingly bipedal over the time and replaced their less bipedal ancestors? To answer these questions. the prominent theories in the field. such as the savanna-based theory. the postural feeding hypotheses. and the provisioning model. are collectively examined. Because biological evolution is not a simple causation; there may be multiple answers to the evolution of bipedalism. The postural feeding hypothesis (reaching for food/balancing) provides an explanation for the partial bipedalism of the earliest hominins. The savannah-based theory describes how the largely bipedal hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal. The provisioning model (food-gathering/monogamy) explains questions arising after the postural feeding hypothesis and before the savannah theory in an evolutionary timeline. Indeed. there are no straight lines between the theories. and multiple forces could have pushed the evolution of bipedalism at different points. Finally. the arboreal hominins that possessed ambiguous traits of bipedalism were eliminated through the choice and selection. Using the biological analogy of the okapi and giraffe. efforts were put to explain how one of the branches (Homo) became increasingly bipedal. while the other (Pan) adapted to locomotion for forest life by narrowing the anatomical/biological focus in evolution.,True,H40eYMQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,11,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-89132015000600929&script=sci_arttext,14077251408646487325,/scholar?cites=14077251408646487325,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-89132015000600929&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

In this manuscript. the author analyzes the infant developmental stage. human anatomy. animal behavior studies. and anthropological changes. Furthermore. prominent theories in the field. such as the provisioning model. ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) theory. and the metabolic hypothesis for human altriciality are considered in an evolutionary context to unravel the origin of language. First. two evolutionary adaptations in humans. bipedalism and delicate muscle movements. resulted in the lack of a need for “hyperfocus”. Second. a relatively safe and rich environment replaced “hyperfocus” with social cohesion. Third. a burgeoning social interaction ushered in natural selection. whereby child helplessness or early parturition supported exceptional self-consciousness (intelligence). The result of concentrated self-consciousness. which involved enlargement of the posterior parietal cortex (sense of self). prefrontal cortex (social cognition). and temporal lobe (language interpretation). was human language.

Humans have evolved from ape-like ancestors for 7 million years. Along with a prominent increase in brain size. the reorganization of the brain marked by the sulcus generated the evolutionary momentum toward the development of human language. This article reviews the reorganization of the human brain using an interdisciplinary approach of examining animal behavior and anthropological and biological studies. This brain reorganization must have occurred during early maturity and is thought to be responsible for eidetic imagery in some adolescents and superior short-term memory in chimpanzees. During early development. the neural connections in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal lobe rapidly expand. while visual memory capacity of human brain would become limited.

Undetected misplacement in the esophagus is a preventable complication that can lead to fatalities in 5–10% of patients who undergo emergency intubation. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring and other proper placement detection methods are useful. yet the problem of misplacement persists. Our previous work demonstrated the utility of spectral reflectance sensors for differentiating esophageal and tracheal tissues. which can be used to confirm proper endotracheal tube placement. In this study. we examine the effectiveness of spectral characterization in the presence of saline. blood.“vomit”. and soot in the trachea.

California,2007,Paul Anthony Schuette and J Diffendorfer and D Deutschman and S Tremor,,,,,,The Mediterranean climate of southern California supports a rich assemblage of flora and fauna. and is considered a hotspot of biological diversity (Dobson et al. 1997). This shrubland dominated environment also experiences frequent wildfires. which if too frequent. pose a serious threat to southern California’s biological diversity (Keeley 1995). Fire frequencies have increased dramatically in the past half-century in association with rapid population growth (Keeley and Fotheringham 2001) and expansion of the human-wildland interface (Keeley et al. 1999). Los Angeles. San Diego. Orange. and Riverside Counties are four of the fastest growing counties in the nation and the region’s population is expected to exceed 24 million by 2015 (Culliton 1998). Therefore. large. destructive wildfires are an increasing concern to local residents and natural resource managers tasked with preserving biological diversity in remaining shrubland habitats of southern California.

Overview: Fire immediately alters the composition of the mammal community in chaparral and coastal sage scrub vegetation. although species responses to fire. including changes over time following fire. are highly species-specific. In chaparral. overall rodent richness is similar between burned and unburned areas. but the composition of the community is very different between these conditions. Furthermore. even after 4 years. the post-burn communities differ from their pre-fire status and from unburned communities. Fire in coastal sage scrub reduced rodent diversity to a simpler community. similar to that that of disturbed habitats dominated by annual grasses and forbs. Carnivore species appear not to be strongly affected by fire. We also detected little effect of burn status on the bat community. although at least two species appear to forage more frequently over unburned chaparral.

With the exception of P. tarsius. which presented three telocentric pairs. all the species analyzed had conservative karyotypic features. Heterochromatic patterns in the genomes of these species revealed by C-banding and fluorochrome staining indicated the presence of a large number of non-centromeric blocks.

The phylogenetic relationships of Cophomantini have been comprehensively reviewed in the literature. providing a suitable framework for the study of chromosome evolution. Employing different banding techniques. we studied the chromosomes of 25 species of Boana and 3 of Hyloscirtus; thus providing. for the first time. data for Hyloscirtus and for 15 species of Boana. Most species showed karyotypes with 2n = 2x = 24 chromosomes; some species of the B. albopunctata group have 2n = 2x = 22. and H. alytolylax has 2n = 2x = 20. Karyotypes are all bi-armed in most species presented. with the exception of H. larinopygion (FN = 46) and H. alytolylax (FN = 38). with karyotypes that have a single pair of small telocentric chromosomes. In most species of Boana. NORs are observed in a single pair of chromosomes. mostly in the small chromosomes. although in some species of the B. albopunctata.

For the most highly endangered species. captive assurance colonies have been established as an emergency measure to avoid extinction. Experimental research has suggested that symbiotic microorganisms in the skin of amphibians play a key role against Bd. While previous studies have addressed the effects of captivity on the cutaneous bacterial community. it remains poorly studied whether and how captive conditions affect the proportion of beneficial bacteria or their anti-Bd performance on amphibian hosts. In this study we sampled three amphibian species of the highly threatened genus. Atelopus. that remain in the wild but are also part of ex situ breeding programs in Colombia and Ecuador. Our goals were to (1) estimate the diversity of culturable bacterial assemblages in these three species of Atelopus. (2) describe the effect of captivity on the composition of skin microbiota. and (3) examine how captivity affects the bacterial ability to inhibit Bd growth. Using challenge assays we tested each bacterial isolate against Bd. and through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. we identified species from thirteen genera of bacteria that inhibited Bd growth. Surprisingly. we did not detect a reduction in skin bacteria diversity in captive frogs. Moreover. we found that frogs in captivity still harbor bacteria with anti-Bd activity. Although the scope of our study is limited to a few species and to the culturable portion of the bacterial community. our results indicate that captive programs do not necessarily …,True,tCK0hY8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,12,https://peerj.com/articles/3594/,7804137319349041346,/scholar?cites=7804137319349041346,,https://peerj.com/articles/3594/,0,0,0

The peptide profile of the skin secretion of Agalychnis spurrelli has not been investigated; therefore. the structural and biological characterization of its compounds signify an inestimable opportunity to acquire new biologically-active chemical scaffolds. In this work. skin secretion from this amphibian was analysed by molecular cloning and tandem mass spectrometry. Although the extent of this work was not exhaustive. eleven skin secretion peptides belonging to five peptide families were identified. Among these. we report the occurrence of two phyllokinins. and one medusin-SP which were previously reported in other related species. In addition. eight novel peptides were identified. including four dermaseptins. DRS-SP2 to DRS-SP5. one phylloseptin-SP1. and three orphan peptides. Phylloseptin-SP1 and dermaseptins-SP2 were identified in HPLC fractions based on their molecular masses determined by MALDI-TOF MS. Among the antimicrobial peptides. dermaseptin-SP2 was the most potent. inhibiting Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus aureus. and ORSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2.68 μM. and Candida albicans with an MIC of 10.71 μM. without haemolytic effects.

Methods: Silurus glanis. a freshwater fish were hunted from Tigris river passing through Al-Rashidiya region/Nineveh Governorate. North Iraq. during November 2017 and May 2018. Bioaccumulation of Fe. Cr. and Mn were estimated in different body tissues of infected and uninfected catfish. and in catfish intestinal tapeworm P. armata. Atomic absorption Spectrophotometer was used to estimate heavy metal concentration as µg of a particular metal/gm of fresh weight. Results: Concentration of the metals in catfish tissues were in the order of Mn> Fe> Cr. Whereas. concentration of the metals of the tapeworm P. armata were in the order: Fe> Mn> Cr. Moreover. mean concentrations of the three heavy metals (Cr; Fe and Mn) were lesser in body tissues of infected catfish than in the uninfected fish. This lessening of metals accumulation in the infected fish may be related to the presence of the intestinal tapeworm. It also appeared that the three metals are mostly accumulated in liver of the catfish. then in gills. and muscles at lesser extent. Conclusions: Present work is drawn out that measuring concentration of heavy metals in parasitic and host tissues that inhabit a certain aqueous environment could be adopted as bioindicators for assessing heavy metals pollution.INTRODUCTION: Water is the fundamental composite of life and the most important requisite for civilizations emergence and …,True,isQAC-QAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marwah_Daood3/publication/339129610_ESTIMATION_OF_SOME_HEAVY_METALS_BIOACCUMULATION_IN_TISSUES_OF_THE_INTESTINAL_CESTODA_POSTGANGESIA_ARMATA_AND_ITS_DEFINITIVE_HOST_THE_EUROPEAN_CATFISH_SILURUS_GLANIS_L_FROM_TIGRIS_RIVER_PASSING_THROUGH/links/5e4f8281458515072dac0694/ESTIMATION-OF-SOME-HEAVY-METALS-BIOACCUMULATION-IN-TISSUES-OF-THE-INTESTINAL-CESTODA-POSTGANGESIA-ARMATA-AND-ITS-DEFINITIVE-HOST-THE-EUROPEAN-CATFISH-SILURUS-GLANIS-L-FROM-TIGRIS-RIVER-PASSING-THROUGH.pdf,14678494606669392801,/scholar?cites=14678494606669392801,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marwah_Daood3/publication/339129610_ESTIMATION_OF_SOME_HEAVY_METALS_BIOACCUMULATION_IN_TISSUES_OF_THE_INTESTINAL_CESTODA_POSTGANGESIA_ARMATA_AND_ITS_DEFINITIVE_HOST_THE_EUROPEAN_CATFISH_SILURUS_GLANIS_L_FROM_TIGRIS_RIVER_PASSING_THROUGH/links/5e4f8281458515072dac0694/ESTIMATION-OF-SOME-HEAVY-METALS-BIOACCUMULATION-IN-TISSUES-OF-THE-INTESTINAL-CESTODA-POSTGANGESIA-ARMATA-AND-ITS-DEFINITIVE-HOST-THE-EUROPEAN-CATFISH-SILURUS-GLANIS-L-FROM-TIGRIS-RIVER-PASSING-THROUGH.pdf,0,0,0

Evolution from perfusion type tracers to targeted agents however has proven difficult. 99mTc labeled antibodies for imaging specific disease biomarkers would be of great interest. however the disparity between the isotopes half-life (6 hours) and the long circulation time of most antibodies (multiple days) has been a significant barrier. Furthermore. the conjugation of bifunctional 99mTc-chelate complexes to small molecules often has a detrimental impact on targeting.  The use of bioorthogonal chemistry derived from tetrazines and trans-cyclooctene derivatives. along with pretargeting has the potential to overcome these issues and create a new generation of targeted 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals.   Initially. the synthesis of three generations of imidazole based tridentate chelates linked to a tetrazine was completed. These new ligands were labeled with 99mTc under mild conditions (60 °C. 20 min. pH 3.5) with modest to good radiochemical yields ranging from 31 to 83%.

The distribution of the two domestic camel species is clearly differs. although they meet at the latitude corresponding to an average temperature of around 21 C. The Bactrian occurs in the eastern area of Afro-Eurasia continent; from Mongolia to Central Asia. While. the dromedary inhabits western area; from the Arabian Peninsula to the Sahara desert. In Kazakhstan. they keep both species and hybrid of them. The dromedary is dominant in the eastern Kazakhstan. around Almaty; and the Bactrian is prevalent in north-western part. around Aktobe. In our study. we found that nowadays. the geographic distribution of both camel species is greatly determined by the climatic factors; for instance the one-humped camel could be breed in environment where the annual average air temperature is above 10 C and the record low air temperature dips minus 38 C or above. It is difficult to keep one-humped camels in the northern region to the 45 N altitude. Also. economic demand is important factor for the geographic distribution of both camel species. Nowadays. the dromedary is dominant especially in Almaty region despite its severe climatic conditions. Because.

Since 1970. the natural hydrological regime of the Ili River. both absolute flow rates and cycles. has changed due to construction of reservoirs such as that at Kapchagai. as well as natural climatic cycles and the growth of water consumption in the basin. Using data from Kazhydromet. we calculated that flow rates below Kapchagai dam averaged 468 m3/sec before construction of the dam. 366 m3/sec while the reservoir was being filled. and 489 m3/sec between 1988 and 2013.

Kazakhstan. under Decreasing Water Inflow: An Economic Assessment,2020,Elisabeth Baranowski and Niels Thevs and Altyn Khalil and Azim Baibagyssov and Margulan Iklassov and Ruslan Salmurzauli and Sabir Nurtazin and Volker Beckmann,10,Agriculture,7,281,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,River deltas provide the most productive pastures in Central Asia. Simultaneously they are highly vulnerable to water inflow changes. The aim of this study was to conduct an economic assessment of the short-and medium-term effect of reduced water inflow on farmers’ performance within the Ili Delta. Primary data were collected through 35 interviews with farmers and additional experts in 2015. Production parameters for three types of individual farms were estimated and entered into a full cost accounting. Contribution margins were calculated for three scenarios:(I) sufficient water inflow (normal situation).(II) decreasing water inflow. and (III) significantly reduced water inflow (worst case). Farmers purchase hay to adapt to pasture production loss due to decreasing water inflow. This more than doubled the variable costs of worst case in comparison to normal situation for small-. medium-. and large-scale type of individual farm. Monte Carlo simulation indicates a risk of 74%(small-scale farm) and 3%(medium-scale farm) that already variable costs will exceed revenues. Despite their high fixed costs. only large-scale individual farms generate positive net farm income from operations in the worst case due to government payments from participation in elite bull program that account for one-third of total revenue.

A rapid and accurate investigation of acute dyspnea is vital since treatment of dyspnea can differ markedly depending on the initial clinical impression. However. the rapid and accurate differentiation of heart failure from other causes of dyspnea remains a clinical challenge. After evaluating patient’s symptoms. conducting a physical examination. and performing electrocardiography (ECG) and chest radiography. the clinician is often left with considerable diagnostic uncertainty. which results in misdiagnosis and delays the initiation of appropriate therapy. Distinguishing between cardiac and non-cardiac causes of dyspnea is often challenging. Therefore. an assay with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value would be useful both in detecting dyspnea due to heart failure and in ruling out the diagnosis in patients with confounding co-morbid conditions.

In this study. exposure to high dietary iron (HDI) revealed no significant difference in the number of iron-positive cells and iron content in the cortex and hippocampal region between wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice; however. compared with the control mice. the HDI-treated mice exhibited upregulated divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin (Fpn) expression. and downregulated transferrin receptor (TFR) expression. Importantly. we confirmed that there were significantly fewer NeuN-positive neurons in both APP/PS1 and WT mice given HDI. than in the respective controls. Moreover. this iron-induced neuron loss may involve increased ROS and oxidative mitochondria dysfunction. decreased DNA repair. and exacerbated apoptosis and autophagy. Although HDI administration might trigger protective antioxidant. anti-apoptosis. and autophagy signaling. especially in pathological conditions. these data clearly indicate that chronic iron exposure results in neuronal loss due to apoptosis. autophagy. and ferroptosis. hence increasing the risk for developing AD.

Here. we compare the acetylomes of baker’s yeast and the three deadliest human fungal pathogens. Cryptococcus neoformans. Candida albicans. and Aspergillus fumigatus. Using mass spectrometry enriched for acetylated peptides together with public data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. we show that fungal acetylomes are characterized by dramatic evolutionary dynamics and limited conservation in core biological processes. Notably. the levels of protein acetylation in pathogenic fungi correlate with their pathogenicity. Using gene knockouts and pathogenicity assays in mice. we identify deacetylases with critical roles in virulence and protein translation elongation.

However. efficient treatment for the disease is limited due to the poor penetration across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Here. we develop a nose-to-brain drug delivery system utilizing nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). We demonstrated that fluorescent-dye-loaded NLCs efficiently uptake into the cytoplasm of encapsulated C. neoformans cells. In comparison with current antifungal drugs. the ketoconazole (keto)-NLCs show significantly increased antifungal activity against C. neoformans in vivo under various growth conditions. The NLCs show enhanced tissue colonization properties. Importantly. using animal imaging analyses. NLCs are able to enter brain tissues via the olfactory bulb region by intranasal administration. bypassing the BBB. In addition.

In studying the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. mouse and rabbit infection models are often employed to shed light on the disease mechanisms but that may not be clinically relevant. In this study. we developed an animal infection model using the non-human primate cynomolgus monkey Macaca fascicularis. In addition. we systematically profiled and compared transcriptional responses between the infected mice and the cynomolgus monkey. using simultaneous or dual RNA next-generation sequencing. We demonstrated that there are shared but distinct transcriptional profiles between the two models following C. neoformans infection. Specifically. genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses are all upregulated. Osteoclastogenesis and insulin signaling are also significantly co-regulated in both models and disrupting an osteoclastogenesis-associated gene (OC-STAMP) or the insulin-signaling process significantly altered the host tolerance to C. neoformans. Moreover. C. neoformans was shown to activate metal sequestration. dampen the sugar metabolism. and control cell morphology during infection. Taking together. we described the development of a non-human primate model of cryptococcosis that allowed us to perform an in-depth analysis and comparison of transcriptome profiles during infections of two animal models and conceptually identify host genes important in disease responses.

Understanding the host’s response to C. neoformans infection is critical for developing effective treatment. Even though some have elucidated the host response at the transcriptome level. little is known about how it modulates its defense machinery through the proteome mechanism or how protein posttranslational modification responds to the infection. In this work. we employed a murine infection model and mass spectrometry to systematically determine the proteome and acetylome statuses of lungs and brains in the early stage of infection. To extensively analyze the host response. we integrated the proteome data to the transcriptome results. Critical genes. including genes involved in phagosome. lysosome and platelet activation are significantly altered in protein and gene expression during infection. In the acetylome analysis. we demonstrated that lung and brain tissues differentially regulate protein acetylation during infection. The three primary groups of proteins altered in acetylation status are histones. proteins involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. and proteins from the immune system. These analyses provide an integrative regulation network of the host responding to C. neoformans and shed new light on understanding the host’s regulation mechanism when responding to C. neoformans.,True,7IXrmvMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00575/full?report=reader,10069238906883344199,/scholar?cites=10069238906883344199,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00575/full?report=reader,0,0,0

Recent studies have demonstrated that metals are critical factors for the regulation of fungal virulence in hosts. In this study. we systemically investigated the function of C. neoformans magnesium transporters in controlling the intracellular Mg balance and virulence‐associated factors. We identified three Mg transporters in C. neoformans: Mgt1. Mgt2. and Mgt3. While we could not detect a Mg2+‐related growth phenotype in mgt1 and mgt3 knockout strains. a GAL7p‐Mgt2 strain showed significant Mg‐dependent growth defects in the presence of glucose. Further analysis demonstrated that MGT2 is a homolog of MNR2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. which is localized to the vacuolar membrane and participates in intracellular Mg transport. Interestingly. a transcriptome analysis showed that Mgt2 influenced the expression of 19 genes …,True,7IXrmvMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mbo3.564,10522032986788148482,/scholar?cites=10522032986788148482,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mbo3.564,0,0,0

However. the current lysine acetylation site identification mainly adopts experimental detection methods which are time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore. several shallow machine learning algorithms were applied for protein lysine acetylation site prediction. However. traditional machine learning algorithms are not as accurate as deep learning algorithms. As a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN). long short-term memory (LSTM) can not only process sequence data but also solve the vanishing gradient problem. Therefore. this paper proposes a method based on LSTM to predict lysine acetylation sites.
