103827,Cyclooxygenases: structural. cellular. and molecular biology,2000,William L Smith and David L DeWitt and R Michael Garavito,69,,1,145-182,Annual Reviews,The prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases-1 and 2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2; also cyclooxygenases-1 and 2. COX-1 and COX-2) catalyze the committed step in prostaglandin synthesis. PGHS-1 and 2 are of particular interest because they are the major targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin. ibuprofen. and the new COX-2 inhibitors. Inhibition of the PGHSs with NSAIDs acutely reduces inflammation. pain. and fever. and long-term use of these drugs reduces fatal thrombotic events. as well as the development of colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this review. we examine how the structures of these enzymes relate mechanistically to cyclooxygenase and peroxidase catalysis. and how differences in the structure of PGHS-2 confer on this isozyme differential sensitivity to COX-2 inhibitors. We further examine the evidence for independent signaling by PGHS-1 and …,True,d2IO63sAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3214,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.145,18290559694242783583,/scholar?cites=18290559694242783583,,http://education.expasy.org/cours/Outreach/Chimiscope/Publication/annurev.biochem.cyclooxygenases.pdf,0,0,0

Before 1991. only one PGHS had been described. the isozyme now called PGHS-1. COX-1 (for cyclooxygenase-1) or the constitutive enzyme. At that time Simmons and Herschman and their colleagues discovered mRNAs whose expression was induced in chicken and mouse fibroblasts in response to src and tumor-promoting phorbol esters. respectively. and which encoded proteins having 60% amino acid sequence identity with PGHS-1. Subsequent work has shown that the new protein. called PGHS-2. COX-2 or the inducible isoform. is very similar to PGHS-1 in structure but differs substantially from PGHS-1 with respect to its pattern of expression and its biology. The reason for the existence of the two PGHS isozymes is unknown. However. PGHS-1 and-2 are often coexpressed in the same cell and may act as parts of separate prostanoid biosynthetic systems that function somewhat independently to channel prostanoids to the extracellular milieu and the nucleus. respectively. PGHS-1 and-2 are interesting in the context of both structural biology and enzymology in that they are homodimeric. heme-containing. glycosylated proteins with two catalytic sites. Moreover. the enzymes have a novel mechanism for membrane attachment; they are anchored to one leaflet of the lipid bilayer through the hydrophobic surfaces of amphipathic helices rather than through transmembrane motifs typical of many integral membrane proteins.

The first step in prostaglandin synthesis involves enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid. which is catalyzed by prostaglandin H(PGH) synthase. also referred to as cyclooxygenase. We have cloned an inducible form of this enzyme from rat brain that is nearly identical to a murine. mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase identified from fibroblasts. Our studies indicate that this gene. here termed COX-2. is expressed throughout the forebrain in discrete populations of neurons and is enriched in the cortex and hippocampus. Neuronal expression is rapidly and transiently induced by seizures or NMDA-dependent synaptic activity. No expression is detected in glia or vascular endothelial cells.

NSAIDs block the cyclooxygenase activities of the closely related PGH synthase-1 and PGH synthase-2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2) isozymes. NSAIDs are therapeutically useful due to their analgesic. anti-pyretic. anti-inflammatory. and anti-thrombogenic properties. Major side-effects of NSAIDs include their ulcerogenic and nephrotoxic activities. All clinically approved NSAIDs in general use today inhibit both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2. Recently. inhibitors have been identified that are selective toward PGHS-2 and that have potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities with minimal ulcerogenic activity. If the new PGHS-2 selective NSAIDs can effectively inhibit inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis by PGHS-2. without inhibiting PGHS-1 prostaglandin synthesis required to regulate sodium and water resorption. and renal blood flow. it is likely that these new drugs will also have significantly less renal toxicity than present-day NSAIDs.

Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the rate‐limiting step in the synthesis of prostaglandins and exists in two isoforms. Regulation of the inducible isoform. cyclooxygenase 2. is thought to play a key role in the brain's response to acute inflammatory stimuli.

103847,PGH synthase isoenzyme selectivity: the potential for safer nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,1993,David L DeWitt and Elizabeth A Meade and William L Smith,95,,2,S40-S44,Elsevier,With the recent cloning of a second gene coding for the prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase (cyclooxygenase). it has become obvious that mammalian cells contain two related. but unique. isozymes of PGH synthase. Both of these isozymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2. leading to production of biologically active prostaglandins. Although the first of these isozymes. PGH synthase-1 (PGHS-1). has long been thought to be the primary and sole site of action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). it is now known that the second isozyme. PGH synthase-2 (PGHS-2). is also sensitive to NSAIDs.

WI-38. with interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) results in a large increase in the production of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).

The glucocorticoid. dexamethasone. blocks the IL-1 alpha-mediated increases in both cPLA2 and PGE2 without affecting the cyclooxygenase level.

In this study. A. leptopus tea. prepared from the dried aerial parts. was evaluated for lipid peroxidation (LPO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzyme inhibitory activities. The tea as a dried extract inhibited LPO. COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes by 78%. 38% and 89%. respectively. at 100               𝜇           g/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract yielded a selective COX-2 enzyme inhibitory phenolic aldehyde. 2.3.4-trihydroxy benzaldehyde. Also. it showed LPO inhibitory activity by 68.3% at 6.25               𝜇           g/mL. Therefore. we have studied other hydroxy benzaldehydes and their methoxy analogs for LPO.

The analogs showed only marginal LPO activity at 6.25               𝜇           g/mL. The hydroxy analogs 6. 7 and 9 showed 55%. 61% and 43% of COX-2 inhibition at 100               𝜇           g/mL. However. hydroxy benzaldehydes 3 and 12 showed selective COX-1 inhibition while compounds 4 and 10 gave little or no COX-2 enzyme inhibition at 100               𝜇           g/mL. At the same concentration. compounds 14. 21 and 22 inhibited COX-1 by 83. 85 and 70%. respectively.

There are two PGHS isozymes-PcHs-l and PGHS-Z-which are encoded by separate genes. Both enzymes catalyze formation of PGH2 from arachidonic acid. The enzymes are similar structurally and exhibit quite similar kinetic properties. Both PGHS-I and PGHS-2 arc inhibited by. common nonsteroidal anti-inflam-matory drugs (NSAIDs). PGHS-1 is generally considered to be a constitutive enzyme. Its expression is regulated developmentally. PGHS-2 is the inducible isozyme; it is expressed transiently in response to growth factors. tumor promoters.? rd cytokines. PGHS-I and PGHS-2 appeu to function at least somewhat independently.

Boston. MA,It is clear from studies conducted in a number of laboratories that the biosynthesis of prostaglandins in the kidney is compartmentalized (Fig. 1). Compartmentalization of synthesis is apparently associated with compartmentalization of function. For example. in the renal tubule there is evidence that prostaglandins are formed by the thin limb of Henle’s loop. at least in the hydronephrotic rabbit kidney.1 by the thick ascending limb.2 and by the cortical and medullary collecting tubules.3–6 and that prostaglandins affect ion or water transport7–9 and/or adenylate cyclase activities10.11 in each of these regions of the tubule. Thus one of the major goals of studies on renal prostaglandin biochemistry has been that of localization—to define which cells form prostaglandins. to determine which of the active prostaglandin derivatives are formed by each of these cells. and. finally. to determine the site and mechanism of …,True,d2IO63sAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,8,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-4277-9_3,12771584978242285646,/scholar?cites=12771584978242285646,,,0,0,0

103946,Cyclooxygenase inhibitors,2001,William L Smith and David L De Witt,,Therapeutic Immunology. Massachusettes: Blackwell Science,,117-31,,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the cyclooxygenase activities of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs). thereby blocking the biosynthesis of prostanoids (Fig. 8-1)(1-10). Prostanoids are oxygenated fatty acids most commonly derived from arachidonic acid and include the prostaglandins and thromboxanes (11. 12). There are two PGHS isozymes. which are properly called PGH synthase-1 and-2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2) but are also known as cyclooxygenase-1 and-2 (COX-1 and COX-2). Both isozymes are capable of catalyzing the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis. In intact cells. prostanoid biosynthesis occurs in three stages (see Fig. 8-1)(11): 1) release of arachidonic acid from phospholipid precursors catalyzed by various phospholipase A2s (13-15); 2) oxygenation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) catalyzed by PGHSs; and 3) conversion of PGH2 to a biologically active end product (PGD2. PGE2. PGF2a. prostacyclin (PGI2) or thromboxane A2 (TXA2) through the action of a synthase or reductase (12). Newly synthesized prostanoids can exit the parent cell. probably by carrier-mediated diffusion (16) and then act locally on the parent (autocrine) and/or neighboring (paracrine) cells through G protein-linked receptors (17-21). Alternatively. prostanoids may interact with nuclear receptors that are transcription factors. such as the peroxisomal proliferator activating receptors (PPAR)(22. 23). NSAIDs exhibit a variety of pharmacologic activities. They are antipyretic. analgesic. anti-inflammatory. and antithrombogenic. In addition. NSAIDs appear to diminish the incidence of colon cancer …,True,d2IO63sAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,6,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4111879943113037690&hl=en&oi=scholarr,4111879943113037690,/scholar?cites=4111879943113037690,,,0,0,0

Point mutations of EZH2 at Tyr641 and Ala677 occur in subpopulations of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. where they drive H3K27 hypertrimethylation.

Histone H3K27 trimethylation is a mechanism for suppressing transcription of specific genes that are proximal to the site of histone modification. Point mutations of the EZH2 gene (Tyr641) have been reported to be linked to subsets of human B-cell lymphoma. The mutant allele is always found associated with a wild-type allele (heterozygous) in disease cells. and the mutations were reported to ablate the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex for methylating an unmodified peptide substrate.

While traditional in vitro methods view drug–target interactions exclusively in terms of equilibrium affinity. the residence time model takes into account the conformational dynamics of target macromolecules that affect drug binding and dissociation.

Ispinesib is the first potent. highly specific small-molecule inhibitor of KSP tested for the treatment of human disease. This novel anticancer agent causes mitotic arrest and growth inhibition in several human tumor cell lines and is currently being tested in multiple phase II clinical trials. In this study we have used steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic assays to define the mechanism of KSP inhibition by ispinesib. Our data show that ispinesib alters the ability of KSP to bind to microtubules and inhibits its movement by preventing the release of ADP without preventing the release of the KSP−ADP complex from the microtubule. This type of inhibition is consistent with the physiological effect of ispinesib on cells. which is to prevent KSP-driven mitotic …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,122,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi702061g,2136926287449970522,/scholar?cites=2136926287449970522,,,0,0,0

During hit and lead characterization. one sometimes observes apparently linear progress curves after jump dilution that display activity recoveries that are intermediate between those expected for fully reversible and irreversible inhibition. Computer simulations of progress curves after jump dilution indicate that seemingly linear progress curves can result when dealing with tight-binding inhibitors if substoichiometric concentrations of inhibitor are preincubated with enzyme. In this situation. the activity recovered is comparable to that expected for instantaneously reversible inhibitors. In addition. simulations demonstrate that intermediate values of activity recovery may be observed for compounds with modestly slow dissociation rates (i.e.. residence times >0 min but ⩽20 …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,67,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000326971100337X,2733825431108788088,/scholar?cites=2733825431108788088,,,0,0,0

We report here that combining EPZ-6438 with CHOP in preclinical cell culture and mouse models results in dramatic synergy for cell killing in EZH2 mutant germinal center NHL cells. Surprisingly. we observe that much of this synergy is due to Prednisolone – a glucocorticoid receptor agonist (GRag) component of CHOP.

In non-stimulated cells NFκB is anchored in the cytoplasm via the inhibitory protein IκBα. Following exposure to diverse pro-inflammatory signals (eg TNFα. IL1. LPS) various signal transduction cascades are initiated converging on the IκB kinase (IKK). IKK phosphorylates IκBα on serines 32 and 36 signaling the inhibitory protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The SCF β-TRCP complex is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for mediating phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of IκBα. Here we reconstitute phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of IκBα using recombinant components. Our results suggest that the cullin specificity of the SCF complex may reflect its ability to associate with Rbx1. We demonstrate specific ubiquitination of IκBα by Ubc3 and Ubc4 in a phosphorylation and SCF β-TRCP dependent manner and that …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C,51,https://www.nature.com/articles/1203647,7337074171656252405,/scholar?cites=7337074171656252405,,https://www.nature.com/articles/1203647,0,0,0

No changes in the CD spectra were observed upon ligand binding. nor did the degree of tryptophan fluorescence quenching change significantly in the complexes. These data argue against any large-scale changes in protein secondary or tertiary structure accompanying ligand binding. The change in tyrosine fluorescence intensity was used to determine the dissociation constants for the heparin and phytic acid complexes of arrestin. The only change observed was a saturable diminution of tyrosine fluorescence signal from the protein. For both ligands. the data suggest two distinct binding interactions with the protein—a …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC,23,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026311832660,15692839979158803829,/scholar?cites=15692839979158803829,,,0,0,0

Robust ATP hydrolysis is catalyzed by phosphorylated MEK in the absence of the protein substrate ERK. This ERK-uncoupled ATPase activity is dependent on the phosphorylation status of MEK and is abrogated by the selective MEK kinase inhibitor U0126. ADP production is concomitant with Raf-mediated phosphorylation of MEK. Based on this finding. a coupled Raf/MEK assay is developed for measuring the Raf activity.

104164,Cytochrome c binding affects the conformation of cytochrome a in cytochrome c oxidase.,1992,Stephen R Lynch and David Sherman and Robert A Copeland,267,Journal of Biological Chemistry,1,298-302,Elsevier,Second derivative absorption spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of complex formation between cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase on the conformation of the cytochrome a cofactor. When ferrocytochrome c is complexed to the cyanide-inhibited reduced or mixed valence enzyme. the conformation of ferrocytochrome a is affected. The second derivative spectrum of these enzyme forms displays two electronic transitions at 443 and 451 nm before complex formation. but only the 443-nm transition after cytochrome c is bound. This effect is not induced by poly-L-lysine. a homopolypeptide which is known to bind to the cytochrome c binding domain of cytochrome c oxidase. The effect is limited to cyanide-inhibited forms of the enzyme; no effect was observed for the fully reduced unliganded or fully reduced carbon monoxide-inhibited enzyme.

New York, Wiley-VCH, Inc",,1-11,,Life depends on a well-orchestrated series of chemical reactions. Many of these reactions. however. proceed too slowly on their own to sustain life. Hence nature has designed catalysts. which we now refer to as enzymes. to greatly accelerate the rates of these chemical reactions. The catalytic power of enzymes facilitates life processes in essentially all life-forms from viruses to man. Many enzymes retain their catalytic potential after extraction from the living organism. and it did not take long for mankind to recognize and exploit the catalytic power of enzyme for commercial purposes. In fact. the earliest known references to enzymes are from ancient texts dealing with the manufacture of cheeses. breads. and alcoholic beverages. and for the tenderizing of meats.

Hence. there is increasing interest in evaluating hit compounds from high-throughput diversity screening to determine their mode of interaction with the target. In this work. the common inhibition modalities are reviewed and clarified. The impact of substrate concentration. relative to substrate KM. for each common inhibition modality is also reviewed. The pattern of changes in IC50 that accompany increasing substrate concentration are shown to be diagnostic of specific inhibition modalities.

Patients with MLL-rearranged leukemias have aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Recent studies suggest that DOT1L. a histone methyltransferase that methylates lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79). plays a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of this genetically defined subset of leukemia. Rearrangements of the MLL gene result in the expression of MLL-fusion proteins that gain the ability to recruit DOT1L to chromatin.

The majority of these common chemical reactions. however. proceed at spontaneous rates that are too slow to support life. Hence. all living organisms rely on the catalytic power of enzymes to accelerate reaction rates. and thus sustain life. While the importance of enzymatic catalysis in normal physiology cannot be overstated. aberrant catalysis can also play an important role in a variety of human diseases. A significant number of genetic disorders. for example. result in the overexpression or mutation-based gain of function for key enzymes of metabolic pathways. Other diseases. such as cancers and inflammatory diseases. involve aberrant hyperproliferation of specific cell types. The metabolic pathways that fuel cell proliferation all involve enzyme catalysis. making the enzymes of these path-ways attractive targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. Enzymatic catalysis is required not only for human life. but also for life in micro-organisms (eg viral. bacterial and protozoan life) and larger parasites that infect human beings. Hence. essential enzyme functions within these organisms are also attractive targets for infectious disease therapies.It is not surprising. then. that the abolition of aberrant enzyme activity. through the administration of small molecule enzyme inhibitors. is a common strategy for pharmaceutical intervention in human diseases.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 editing of specific loci offers an alternative method to RNA interference and small molecule inhibitors for determining whether a cell line is dependent on a specific gene product for proliferation or survival. In our initial studies using CRISPR-Cas9 to verify the dependence on EZH2 activity for proliferation of a SMARCB1/SNF5/INI1 mutant malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) cell line. we noted that the initial reduction in proliferation was lost over time. We hypothesized that in the few cells that retain proliferative capacity. at least one allele of EZH2 remains functional. To verify this. we developed an assay to analyze 10s-100s of clonal cell populations for target gene disruption using restriction digest and fluorescent fragment length analyses. Our results clearly show that in cell lines in which EZH2 is essential for proliferation. at least one potentially functional allele of EZH2 is retained in the clones that survive. This assay clearly indicates whether or not a specific gene is essential for survival and/or proliferation in a given cell line.

Proteins involved in these processes. such as the PRC2 and SWI/SNF complexes are often genetically altered in cancer. Importantly. these two complexes normally compete with each other in binding to and affecting chromatin; genetic alterations can create an imbalance in this antagonism. For instance. INI1 (SMARCB1. SNF5. BAF47) is a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex that is lost in nearly all rhabdoid tumors. which creates an oncogenic dependency on the PRC2-EZH2 methyltransferase. and rhabdoid tumor models are sensitive to EZH2 small molecule inhibitors. In synovial sarcoma. another INI1-deficient tumor type. a recurrent chromosomal translocation fuses the SS18 gene (a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) on chromosome 18 to one of three related genes on the X chromosome. SSX1. SSX2 and rarely SSX4. This results in the expression of an oncogenic SS18-SSX fusion protein that binds to the SWI/SNF complex evicting both the wild-type SS18 and the tumor suppressor INI1. which are subsequently degraded. This results in aberrant gene expression and ultimately the development of cancer.Methods: Synovial sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were evaluated for their sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

In this chapter we shall see that both substrate specificity and rate acceleration result from the precise three-dimensional structure of the substrate binding pocket within the enzyme molecule. known as the active site. Enzymes are (almost always) proteins. hence the chemically reactive groups that act upon the substrate are derived mainly from the natural amino acids.

These genetic alterations are hypothesized to confer a cellular survival dependency on EZH2 enzymatic activity in these cancers. Here. we disclose the discovery of EPZ-6438 (E7438). as a potent. selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 in preclinical models of NHL.

104273,Protein methyltransferases as targets for personalized cancer,2012,Victoria M Richon and Mikel P Moyer and Robert A Copeland,19,AARC Annual Meeting,15,,,BackgroundA variety of molecular mechanisms work together to effect strict control of gene transcription in human cells. Paramount among these mechanisms is a collection of post-translational modifications of chromatin that facilitate conformational transitions between transcriptionally permissive and suppressive chromatin structures (Figure 1; refs. 1. 2). Each of these modifications is catalyzed by a specific set of enzymes (Figure 2). Not surprisingly. dysregulation of chromatin modification leads to pathologic alterations in gene transcription. hence to human disease. Among chromatin modifying enzymes. the protein methyltransferases (PMTs) stand out due to the large size of the class. and the disease association of many of these enzymes (3). The PMTs have thus emerged as a novel target class for oncology indications where specific genetic alterations. affecting PMT activity. drive cancer tumorigenesis. This target class has proved quite druggable; small molecule inhibitors (PMTi) of several PMT enzymes have been identified that display a diversity of chemical structures and target binding modalities. Here we present two examples of PMTs that are genetically altered in specific human cancers and use these to illustrate the breath of genetic alterations seen among the PMT targets that directly impact cancer pathogenesis.,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC,1,https://epizyme.com/pdf/AACR%20Ed%20Book%20Richon%20et%20al.pdf,6102903866719314578,/scholar?cites=6102903866719314578,,https://epizyme.com/pdf/AACR%20Ed%20Book%20Richon%20et%20al.pdf,0,0,0

Methylation of specific residues on histones leads to localized chromatin remodeling that in turn controls gene transcription. A number of PMTs have been shown to be genetically altered in cancers through. for example. gene amplification. chromosomal translocations and point mutations; in several cases the enzymatic activity of the genetically altered PMT has been shown to be critical for malignancy. We are approaching drug discovery efforts against these enzymes in two distinct. but interrelated manners.

Additionally. dysregulation of methylation has been linked to a variety of diseases. including cancer. The type I protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) CARM1 has been implicated in a variety of cancers including AML1 and breast2. prostate3. lung4 and colorectal5 carcinomas. making it a potential protein target for drug discovery efforts.The PRMT family of enzymes. including CARM1 (PRMT4). has been well characterized by x-ray crystallography. Crystal structures of CARM1 were first solved in 20076. 7 revealing the catalytic core common to the type I PRMTs. In 2011. crystal structures of two inhibitors of CARM1 were published8. showing two different chemical moieties bound in the arginine pocket. Although CARM1 is known to methylate multiple histone (H3) and non-histone (PABP1. p300/CBP. AIB1/SRC-3) substrates9. no crystal structure of CARM1 with substrate peptides have been published. despite success in obtaining peptide complexes for other PRMTs.,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC,0,https://www.epizyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Boriack-Sjodin_CARM1peptides_Poster_v7.pdf,,,,https://www.epizyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Boriack-Sjodin_CARM1peptides_Poster_v7.pdf,0,0,0

The primary p53 binding site on mdm2 is located in its N‐terminal domain. Through binding to p53 at its N‐terminal transactivation domain. mdm2 directly blocks the transcriptional activation function of p53. To understand how the binding interaction between mdm2 and p53 is related to the mdm2‐catalyzed p53 ubiquitination. we compared the ubiquitin ligase activity and binding interaction of full length mdm2 (mdm2‐FL) and various N‐terminally truncated mdm2 constructs toward p53. Our results indicate that the interaction between the N‐terminal domains of mdm2 and p53 is not required for the mdm2‐catalyzed p53 ubiquitination. Our results further indicate a second p53 binding site on mdm2 that is critical for its ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53; this site is located …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.21.5.a273-b,,,,,0,0,0

104332,Kinetic Studies on-Site Amyloid Precursor Protein-cleaving Enzyme (BACE),2003,Larisa Toulokhonova and William J Metzler and Mark R Witmer and Robert A Copeland and Jovita Marcinkeviciene,,,,,,The steady-state kinetic mechanism of-amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE)-catalyzed proteolytic cleavage was evaluated using product and statine-(Stat (V)) or hydroxyethylene-containing (OM99-2) peptide inhibition data. solvent kinetic isotope effects. and proton NMR spectroscopy. The noncompetitive inhibition pattern observed for both cleavage products. together with the independence of Stat (V) inhibition on substrate concentration. suggests a uni-bi-iso kinetic mechanism. According to this mechanism. the enzyme undergoes multiple conformation changes during the catalytic cycle. If any of these steps are rate-limiting to turnover. an enzyme form preceding the rate-limiting conformational change should accumulate. An insignificant solvent kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) on kcat/Km. a large inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect on kcat. and the absence of any SKIE on the inhibition onset by Stat (V) during catalysis together indicate that the ratelimiting iso-step occurs after formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. A moderately short and strong hydrogen bond (at 13.0 ppm and of 0.6) has been observed by NMR spectroscopy in the enzyme-hydroxyethylene peptide (OM99-2) complex that presumably mimics the tetrahedral intermediate of catalysis. Collapse of this intermediate. involving multiple steps and interconversion of enzyme forms. has been suggested to impose a rate limitation. which is manifested in a significant SKIE on kcat. Multiple enzyme forms and their distribution during catalysis were evaluated by measuring the SKIE on the noncompetitive (mixed) inhibition constants for the C-terminal reaction product.

The enzyme consists of a polypeptide chain of 322 amino acids that shares 68% identity with the cognate type A enzyme from the bacterium Lactococcus lactis. E. faecalis DHODase A catalyzed the oxidation of L-dihydroorotate while reducing a number of substrates. including fumarate. coenzyme Q0. and menadione. The steady-state kinetic mechanism has been determined with menadione as an oxidizing substrate at pH 7.5. Initial velocity and product inhibition data suggest that the enzyme follows a two-site non-classical ping-pong kinetic mechanism.

Under normal physiological conditions. constitutive expression of the MMPs is low. as is their catalytic activity which is held in check by naturally occurring inhibitors termed TIMPs (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases). However. under pathologic conditions such as rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. MMP expression in cartilage is disregulated.

104353,Residue-Specific Chemical Modification of Proteins,1994,Robert A Copeland,,,,151-160,Springer. Boston. MA,Over the past 50 years a variety of reagents have been found that covalently modify specific amino acid residues within proteins. Such compounds can be useful analytical tools for assessing the distribution of a particular amino acid type between the interior and surface of a folded protein molecule. The rationale for this type of analysis goes as follows. If there exist buried and surface exposed populations of a certain amino acid type within a protein. then treatment with a covalent modifying reagent under native conditions will only result in modification of the surface exposed residues. Those residues within the hydrophobic interior of the protein will not make contact with the modifying reagent. and will thus be protected from covalent modification. Comparison of the number of modification events per molecule of protein in the folded and unfolded (denatured) states can thus be used to describe the distribution of …,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-1505-7_8,,,,,0,0,0

The four convenient wavelengths produced by the YAG laser fourth harmonic (266 nm) and the first. second. and third anti-Stokes H2-shifted lines (240. 218. and 200 nm) are particularly useful for probing a variety of UV chromophores that occur widely in biology. Good quality spectra have been obtained at these wavelengths for proteins. and also for the constituent peptide. phenylalanine. tyrosine. and tryptophan chromophores. and for nucleic acids and the nucleotides. Time-resolved studies have focussed on transient states of hemoglobin (Hb). following the photolysis of the Co complex. in order to elucidate the protein dynamics of this important molecule. Using visible and ultraviolet excitation. it is possible to monitor both the heme groups and the aromatic residues in the protein. The UVRR spectra indicate that a T-like quaternary structure is formed within 7 ns of Hbco photolysis. implying a surprisingly rigid connection between the heme groups and the subunit interfaces.,True,H7I-BtcAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14260980361466515088&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Among the well-known covalent modifications of histones. the reversible acetylation of internal lysine residues in histone amino-terminal domains has long been positively linked to transcriptional activation. Recent biochemical and genetic studies have identified several large. multisubunit enzyme complexes responsible for bringing about the targeted acetylation of histones and other factors.

Here. we report that a human ortholog of Sir2p. sirtuin type 2 (SIRT2). is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein that colocalizes with microtubules. SIRT2 deacetylates lysine-40 of α-tubulin both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of SIRT2 via siRNA results in tubulin hyperacetylation. SIRT2 colocalizes and interacts in vivo with HDAC6. another tubulin deacetylase. Enzymatic analysis of recombinant SIRT2 in comparison to a yeast homolog of Sir2 protein (Hst2p) shows a striking preference of SIRT2 for acetylated tubulin peptide as a substrate relative to acetylated histone H3 peptide.

Protein phosphorylation is a highly regulated process by which information can be shuttled from the cell surface to the nucleus. There are two classes of enzymes that regulate signalling through the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins. namely protein kinases and protein phosphatases.

HGP is dynamically controlled by a signaling/transcriptional network that regulates the expression/activity of gluconeogenic enzymes. A key mediator of gluconeogenic gene transcription is PGC-1α. PGC-1α's activation of gluconeogenic gene expression is dependent upon its acetylation state. which is controlled by the acetyltransferase GCN5 and the deacetylase Sirt1. Nevertheless. whether other chromatin modifiers—particularly other sirtuins—can modulate PGC-1α acetylation is currently unknown. Herein. we report that Sirt6 strongly controls PGC-1α acetylation.

SIRT1 was upregulated through c-MYC in embryonic and postnatal Pkd1-mutant mouse renal epithelial cells and tissues and could be induced by TNF-α. which is present in cyst fluid during cyst development. Double conditional knockouts of Pkd1 and Sirt1 demonstrated delayed renal cyst formation in postnatal mouse kidneys compared with mice with single conditional knockout of Pkd1.

Organism-wide SIRT3 loss manifests in metabolic alterations; however. the coordinating role of SIRT3 among metabolically distinct tissues is unknown. Using multi-tissue quantitative proteomics comparing fasted wild-type mice to mice lacking SIRT3. innovative bioinformatic analysis. and biochemical validation. we provide a comprehensive view of mitochondrial acetylation and SIRT3 function.

GCN5 is the catalytic subunit of a large multi-subunit complex that functions in the regulation of gene activation via acetylation of lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of core histone proteins. Using acetyl-CoA as a co-substrate. the high affinity binding of acetyl-CoA is a critical first step in the reaction.

Increasing evidence suggests that vast combinations of PTMs exist within chromatin histones. These complex patterns. rather than individual PTMs. are thought to define functional chromatin states. However. the ability to interrogate combinatorial histone PTM patterns at the nucleosome level has been limited by the lack of direct molecular tools. Here we demonstrate an efficient. quantitative. antibody-free. chromatin immunoprecipitation-less (ChIP-less) method for interrogating diverse epigenetic states. At the heart of the workflow are recombinant chromatin reader domains. which target distinct chromatin states with combinatorial PTM patterns.

In this study. we uncover a tissue-restricted isoform of SIRT1 (SIRT1-ΔE2) that lacks exon 2 (E2). Candidate-based screening of SIRT1 substrates demonstrated that the domain encoded by this exon plays a key role in specifying SIRT1 protein-protein interactions. The E2 domain of SIRT1 was both necessary and sufficient for PGC1α binding. enhanced interaction with p53. and thus downstream functions.

This lysine modification is reversibly controlled by histone (lysine) acetyltransferases and deacetylases.

P2X7 contains many single nucleotide polymorphisms. including several mutations located within its intracellular C-terminal trafficking domain. Mutations within the trafficking domain result in attenuated receptor activity and cell surface presentation. but the mechanisms by which amino acid changes within this region promote altered P2X7 function have not been elucidated.  Methods and Results We analyzed the amino acid sequence of P2X7 for any potential trafficking signals and found that P2X7 contains putative Arg-X-Arg ER retention sequences. Alanine substitutions near or within these sequences were constructed. and we determined that single mutation of R574 and R578 but not R576 or K579 attenuates P2X7-stimulated activation of ERK1/2 and induction of the transcription factors FosB and ΔFosB. We found that mutation of R578 within the trafficking domain to the naturally occurring Gln substitution disrupts P2X7 localization at the plasma membrane and results in R578Q displaying a higher apparent molecular weight in comparison to wild-type receptor. We used the glycosidase endoglycosidase H to determine that this difference in mass is due in part to the R578Q mutant possessing a larger mass of oligosaccharides. indicative of improper N-linked glycosylation addition and/or trimming.

The conserved FHA domain of Fkh1 regulates donor preference by juxtaposing two distant regions on chromosome III to promote their recombination. A model posits that this Fkh1-mediated long-range chromosomal juxtaposition requires an interaction between the FHA domain and a partner protein(s). but to date no relevant partner has been described. In this study. we used structural modeling. 2-hybrid assays. and mutational analyses to show that the predicted phosphothreonine-binding FHA domain of Fkh1 interacted with multiple partner proteins. The Fkh1 FHA domain was important for its role in cell-cycle regulation. but no single interaction partner could account for this role. In contrast. Fkh1’s interaction with the Mph1 DNA repair helicase regulated donor preference during mating-type switching. Using 2-hybrid assays. co-immunoprecipitation. and fluorescence anisotropy. we mapped a discrete peptide within the regulatory Mph1 C-terminus required for this interaction and identified two threonines that were particularly important. In vitro binding experiments indicated that at least one of these threonines had to be phosphorylated for efficient Fkh1 binding. Substitution of these two threonines with alanines (mph1-2TA) specifically abolished the Fkh1-Mph1 interaction in vivo and altered donor preference during mating-type switching to the same degree as mph1Δ.

In the present study. we further characterized expression of the transgene. Northern blot analysis showed that the human renin gene is expressed in the kidney but not in the liver of two lines of transgenic mice with 10 and 50 copies of the transgene. suggesting that the integrated copy number of the human renin gene does not influence the dominant-renal expression pattern. Immunohistochemical study using a monoclonal antibody specific for human renin demonstrated that expression of human renin in the transgenic mouse kidney is confined to the epithelioid juxtaglomerular cells. Transfection experiments indicated that the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion gene containing the 3-kb upstream sequences of the renin gene is activated only in human epithelioid embryonic 293 cells derived from kidney but not in human HepG2 cells from liver.

We previously found that an ectopically introduced H19 ICR fragment in transgenic mice acquired paternal allele-specific methylation in the somatic cells of offspring. whereas it was not methylated in sperm. suggesting that its gametic and postfertilization modifications were separable events. We hypothesized that this latter activity might contribute to maintenance of the methylation imprint in early embryos.

Second. we cloned C. elegans homologues corresponding to the MTD by RT-PCR and identified the three related products. two of which exhibited weak transcriptional activity. Finally. by means of the yeast two hybrid screening using MTD as a bait. we cloned hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α and Stat2 cDNAs.

Although clinical and experimental studies have suggested that inhibition of RAS is associated with progression of anemia. little evidence is available to support this claim. Here we report that knockout mice that lack angiotensin II. including angiotensinogen and renin knockout mice. exhibit anemia. The anemia of angiotensinogen knockout mice was rescued by angiotensin II infusion. and rescue was completely blocked by simultaneous administration of AT1 receptor blocker. To genetically determine the responsible receptor subtype. we examined AT1a. AT1b. and AT2 knockout mice. but did not observe anemia in any of them. To investigate whether pharmacological AT1 receptor inhibition recapitulates the anemic phenotype. we administered AT1 receptor antagonist in hypotensive AT1a receptor knockout mice to inhibit the remaining AT1b receptor. In these animals. hematocrit levels barely decreased. but blood pressure further decreased to the level observed in angiotensinogen knockout mice. We then generated AT1a and AT1b double-knockout mice to completely ablate the AT1 receptors; the mice finally exhibited the anemic phenotype. These results provide clear evidence that although erythropoiesis and blood pressure are negatively controlled through the AT1 receptor inhibition in vivo. the pathways involved are complex and distinct. because erythropoiesis is more resistant to AT1 receptor inhibition than blood pressure control.,True,zFumNBEAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC,12,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129484,8011849425781407010,/scholar?cites=8011849425781407010,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129484,0,0,0

In the present study it was examined whether blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) could improve survival in cases of chronic severe AR. Methods and Results AR was induced by puncturing the aortic valves of wild-type (WT) and AT1a knockout (KO) mice. Mice that survived for 4 weeks after the operation were deemed to be a model of chronic severe AR and were followed up for 50 weeks (WT. n= 29; KO. n= 31). Baseline measurements made 4 weeks after surgery showed similar LV cavity and function in both genotypes. These conditions progressively worsened in both genotypes. but 16 weeks after baseline. KO mice showed significantly less LV dilatation. hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis than WT mice. Cardiac mRNA expression of B-type natriuretic peptide and type I collagen was lower in KO than WT mice. The 50-week mortality rate was significantly lower among KO (45.2%) than WT (86.2%) mice. and postmortem findings indicated that the lower mortality was attributable to a lower incidence of congestive heart failure.

Mass spectroscopic analysis showed that oANG has a molecular weight (M.) of 52.126. although the M. calculated from the amino acid sequence is 49.000. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that oANG is a typical globular protein (M. 49.100) and a monomer in solution. Little free thiol was present in oANG. indicating that the only two cysteine residues (Cysls and Cysm) form an intramolecular disulfide bond. A single deglycosylated form (M. 49.000) was produced from intact oANG (M. 52.000) by digestion with peptide-N-glycosidase E and any other deglycosylated form was not observed.

In transfected HepG2 cells. a hepatoma celi line. only the rat renin promoter was capable of driving the CAT gene expression.

We investigated gene expression using transgenic mice in our previous study on the renin-angiotensin system [2]. However. in such mice it was difficult to do quantitative RNA analysis on small tissue samples. including those from the pituitary or adrenal gland. Furthermore. transgenic mice as animal models are too small for surgical manipulation and collection of specimens. This is why the transgenic rat is assumed to be a convenient alternative species for these studies. Only a few researchers have tried to produce transgenic rats at research labs for biomedical studies because more labor and lar ger spaces are required for maintenance of breeding colonies of donor and recipient rats than are needed for mice. In the present study. we produced transgenic rats by a new system using donor and recipient. pregnant and pseudopregnant. rats prepared at a breeding farm and transported to our laboratory. Donor and recipient Wistar-Imamichi rats (adult females) were prepared at a breeding farm. Imamichi Institute for Animal Reproduction. They were allowed free access to food and water.

However. recent studies have reported that gamete methylation is not restricted at the ICRs. thus highlighting the significance of ICR methylation maintenance during the preimplantation period where genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Using transgenic mice (TgM). we previously demonstrated that the H19 ICR possesses autonomous activity to acquire paternal-allele-specific DNA methylation after fertilization. Furthermore. this activity is indispensable for the maintenance of imprinted methylation at the endogenous H19 ICR during the preimplantation period. In addition. we showed that a specific 5′ fragment of the H19 ICR is required for its paternal methylation after fertilization. while CTCF and Sox-Oct motifs are essential for its maternal protection from undesirable methylation after implantation. To ask whether specific cis elements are sufficient to reconstitute imprinted methylation status. we employed a TgM co-placement strategy for facilitating detection of postfertilization methylation activity and precise comparison of test sequences. Bacteriophage lambda DNA becomes highly methylated regardless of its parental origin and thus can be used as a neutral sequence bearing no inclination for differential DNA methylation. We previously showed that insertion of only CTCF and Sox-Oct binding motifs from the H19 ICR into a lambda DNA (LCb) decreased its methylation level after …,True,zFumNBEAAAAJ:9DLIHnF0jcYC,6,https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-018-0207-z,1290893584974683764,/scholar?cites=1290893584974683764,,https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-018-0207-z,0,0,0

The rat angiotensinogen mRNA was present in the extract of RNA from the cloned cells and the recombinant angiotensinogen is immunologically identical to rat angiotensinogen. By the treatment of cloned cells with tunicamycin. all isoforms of 55 kDa recombinant angiotensinogen were replaced by a single protein of 48 kDa. The 48 kDa angiotensinogen failed to bind to concanavalin A (ConA). We concluded that glycosylated or non-glycosylated angiotensinogen is secretable and functional as prohormone.A wealth of information suggests that angiotensin II plays an important role in hypertension (14). Angiotensinogen is its prohormone. which upon reaction with the enzyme renin releases the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI). The primary structure of human and rat angiotensinogen has been deduced from the base sequence ofthe corresponding cDNA (2. 10. 12). Comparison of mRNAs of angiotensinogen in several tissues (5. 6) indicates that there is only one gene for angiotensinogen. Pure angiotensinogen was isolated from the plasma of several species (1. 7. 9. 13. 15. 18).

Because a randomly integrated H19 ICR fragment. when incorporated into the genome of transgenic mice (TgM). was allele-specifically methylated in somatic. but not in germ cells. it was suggested that allele-discriminating epigenetic signature. set within or somewhere outside of the Tg H19 ICR fragment in germ cells. was later translated into a differential DNA methylation pattern. To test if the chicken β-globin HS4 (cHS4) chromatin insulator might interfere with methylation imprinting establishment at the H19 ICR. we inserted the H19 ICR fragment. flanked by a set of floxed cHS4 core sequences. into a human β-globin locus YAC and generated TgM (insulated ICR' TgM). As controls. the cHS4 sequences were removed from one side (5'HS4-deleted ICR') or both sides (pseudo-WT ICR') of the insulated ICR' by in vivo cre-loxP recombination. The data show that while maternally inherited transgenic H19 ICR was not methylated in insulated ICR' TgM. it was significantly methylated upon paternal transmission. though the level was lower than in the pseudo-WT ICR' control. Because this reduced level of methylation was also observed in the 5'HS4-deleted ICR' TgM. we speculate that the phenotype is due to VEZF1-dependent demethylation activity. rather than the insulator function. borne in cHS4. Collectively. although we cannot rule out the possibility that cHS4 is incapable of blocking an allele-discriminating signal from outside of the transgene. the epigenetic signature appears to be marked intrinsically …,True,zFumNBEAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073925,13896981639914801024,/scholar?cites=13896981639914801024,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073925,0,0,0

At pH 6.5 and 37 C. the Michaelis constant (Km) of rh-renin reacting with rhANG was 1.62. uM. and catalytic center activity (kcat) was 1.05 per second. In this study. we provided a basis for the study of the structure-function relationships of the human renin-angiotensin system using recombinant proteins.Renin [EC 3.4. 23. l5] is an aspartic protease that regulates the initial and rate-limiting step in the production of the potent pressor octapeptide angiotensin II (AII)(7). Renin selectively cleaves the decapeptide angiotensin I (AI) from the amino terminus of angiotensinogen and a proposed role of renin in the regulation of blood pressure makes renin-angiotensinogen reaction an attractive target for the development of inhibitors that could be powerful antihypertensive agents. Despite the interests in renin inhibitors. little is known about the catalytic mechanism of renin relative to other proteases. and the structure-function relationships that account for the enzymatic features of the renin-angiotensin system. species specificity. strict substrate specificity and preference for neutral pH. remained undefined. For the purpose of the detailed studies on the structure-function relationships of renin and angiotensinogen. we previously established the high level production and rapid purification system of recombinant human active renin (rh-renin)(6) and recombinant human angiotensinogen (rhANG)(5).

The mechanisms involved in the progression of IPF remain incompletely understood. although the immune response accompanied by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation may contribute to some of them. This study aimed to examine the association of p38 activity in the lungs with bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and its transcriptomic profiling. Accordingly. we evaluated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis during an active fibrosis phase in three genotypes of mice carrying stepwise variations in intrinsic p38 activity in the AEC II and performed RNA sequencing of their lungs. Stepwise elevation of p38 signaling in the lungs of the three genotypes was correlated with increased severity of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis exhibiting reduced static compliance and higher collagen content. Transcriptome analysis of these lung samples also showed that the enhanced p38 signaling in the lungs was associated with increased transcription of the genes driving the p38 MAPK pathway and differentially expressed genes elicited by BLM. including those related to fibrosis as well as the immune system.

We found that expression of a 15-kb human RENIN (hREN) transgene was aberrantly upregulated (>4.2-fold). while the endogenous mouse renin (mRen) gene was suppressed (>1.7-fold) in Tsukuba hypertensive mice (THM). a model for genetically induced hypertension. We then generated transgenic mice using a 13-kb mRen gene fragment that was homologous to the 15-kb hREN transgene and found that its expression was also upregulated (>3.1-fold) in THM. suggesting that putative silencing elements of the renin genes were distally located in the loci. We next examined the possible role of a previously identified mouse distal enhancer (mdE) located outside of the 13-kb mRen gene fragment. Deletion of the mdE in the context of a 156-kb mRen transgene did not affect its transcriptional repression in THM. implying that although the silencing element of the mRen gene is located within the 156-kb fragment tested. it is distinct from the mdE. Consistent with these results. deletion of the 63-kb region upstream of the mdE from the endogenous mRen gene locus abrogated its transcriptional repression in THM.

In this study. we showed that the molar potency of ET-1 to induce Erk activation was two orders of magnitude higher in dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP)-treated astrocytes than in quiescent astrocytes. This DBcAMP-enhanced molar potency of ET-1 in Erk activation was selectively inhibited by pretreatment of astrocytes with PTX. The expression level of EDNRB in astrocytes was markedly upregulated by DBcAMP-induced cytodifferentiation. However. this up-regulation was simply attributed to the high expression of low-affinity sites. The molar potency of ET-1 to induce both stimulation of inositol trisphosphate production and activation of protein kinase C in DBcAMP-treated astrocytes was similar to that in quiescent astrocytes. On the contrary. the molar potency of ET-1 to induce accumulation of Ras-GTP was two orders of magnitude higher in DBcAMP-treated astrocytes than in quiescent astrocytes. which was consistent with the case of ET-1-induced Erk activation. Moreover. the ET-1-induced Ras activation was PTX sensitive. These results suggest that cytodifferentiation selectively enhances the PTXsensitive Ras/Erk pathway induced by ET-1 in astrocytes. and that cytodifferentiation-induced EDNRB up-regulation might not contribute to this selective potentiation of ET-1 signaling.,True,zFumNBEAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C,1,https://europepmc.org/article/med/15838308,16928976660096203210,/scholar?cites=16928976660096203210,,,0,0,0

We investigated the possible role of podocyte injury in glomerular macrophage and foam cell infiltration in a podocyte-selective injury model (NEP25 Q 7 mice) and hypercholesterolemic model [low-density lipoprotein receptor deficiency (LDLR À/À) mice] with doxorubicin (Adriamycin) einduced Q 8 nephropathy. Acute podocyte selective injury alone failed to induce glomerular macrophages in the NEP25 mice. However. in the doxorubicintreated hypercholesterolemic LDLR À/À mice. glomerular macrophages/foam cells significantly increased and were accompanied by lipid deposition and the formation and ingestion of oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs). The number of macrophages significantly correlated with the amount of glomerular oxPL. The NEP25/LDLR À/À mice exhibited severe hypercholesterolemia. glomerular lipid deposition. and renal dysfunction. Imaging mass spectrometry revealed that a major component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein. lysophosphatidylcholine 16: 0 and 18: 0. was present only in the glomeruli of NEP25/LDLR À/À mice. Lysophosphatidylcholine 16: 0 stimulated mesangial cells and macrophages. and lysophosphatidylcholine 18: 0 stimulated glomerular endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines. promoting macrophage adhesion and migration in vitro. In human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. glomerular macrophagee derived foam cells contained oxPLs accompanied by the expression of chemokines in the tuft.

105280,Possible involvement of downregulation of the apelin–APJ system in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity 2,2015,Junji Ishida Kako and Akiyoshi Fukamizu,,,,,,Apelin peptide is an endogenous ligand of APJ (a putative receptor protein 19 related to the angiotensin receptor AT1). which is a member of a G-protein–coupled 20 receptor superfamily with seven transmembrane domains. Recent findings have 21 suggested that the apelin–APJ system plays a potential role in cardiac contraction 22 and cardioprotection. Here we show that the apelin–APJ system is disrupted in 23 doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity. We found downregulation of apelin and 24 APJ mRNA expressions in C57Bl/6J mouse hearts on days 1 and 5 after Dox 25 administration (20 mg/kg. ip). Plasma apelin levels and cardiac APJ protein 26 expression were significantly decreased on day 5 after Dox injection. Cardiac apelin 27 contents were reduced on day 1. but increased to the basal levels on day 5 after Dox 28 injection. We also examined the effects of APJ gene deletion on Dox-induced 29 cardiotoxicity. Compared with wild-type mice. APJ knockout mice showed 30 significant depression in cardiac contractility on day 5 after Dox treatment (15 mg/kg. 31 ip). followed by a decrease in 14-day survival rates. Moreover. Dox-induced 32 myocardial damage. cardiac protein carbonylation. and autophagic dysfunction were 33 accelerated in APJ knockout mice. Rat cardiac H9c2 cells showed Dox-induced 34 decreases in viability. which were prevented by APJ overexpression and the 35 combination with apelin treatment. These results suggest that the suppression of APJ 36 expression after Dox administration can exacerbate Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. 37 which may be responsible for depressed protective function of the …,True,zFumNBEAAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4260478688624617337&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The clinical features of RA include chronic inflammation of systemic joints associated with synovial hyperplasia followed by impairment of quality of life [3. 4]. Recently. we have shown that Synoviolin/Hrd1. an E3 ubiquitin ligase. is a novel causative factor for arthropathy [5]. However. the mechanism that regulates synovial cell outgrowth is not fully understood.Materials and methodsHuman embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. HEK-293T cells.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the inoculation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (PLC/PRF/5) into athymic nude mice alters the expression of genes encoding the drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in host liver. The livers from non-tumor and tumor-bearing mice were initially subjected to drug metabolism gene microarray analysis. Microarray analysis indicated that tumor inoculation had little effect on drug metabolism-related genes. including several cytochrome P450s (Cyp). Cyp1a. Cyp2b and Cyp3a.

Recently. Kuba et al. have reported that the degree of cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in apelin-deficient and wild type (WT) mice are not significantly different (2007. Circ Res). Since we had generated APJ-deficient (APJ KO) mice. we examined whether apelin-APJ system affected the pathogenesis of catecholamine-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Materials and Methods: APJ KO mice and WT mice at 3-month old (n= 11. respectively) received chronic infusion of isoproterenol (ISO. 60mg/kg/day) for 7 days. Echocardiography was performed before and after infusion. Results: In the absence of ISO infusion. the heart of APJ KO mice was not morphologifcally different from that of WT mice. Excessive β-adrenergic stimulation developed significant cardiac hypertrophy in both strains. but to a greater extent in APJ KO mice (the ratio of heart weight to tibial length: 8.1±0.7 versus 7.5±0.7 mg/mm. p< 0.05). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that apelin-APJ system played an important role in preventing catecholamine-induced cardiac hypertrophy.[J Physiol Sci. 2008; 58 Suppl: S59],True,zFumNBEAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/psjproc/2008/0/2008_0_059_3/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0,0,0

Although Ang II has been shown to regulate apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. its role in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) remains elusive. To address this issue. we first performed TUNEL and caspase-3 activity assays with porcine microvascular ECs challenged by serum deprivation. Ang II significantly reduced the ratio of apoptotic cells and caspase-3 activity. The Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) was responsible for these effects. Among the signaling molecules downstream of AT1. we revealed that PI3-kinase/Akt pathway plays a predominant role in the antiapoptotic effect of Ang II. Interestingly. the expression of survivin. a central molecule of cell survival. increased after Ang II stimulation.

In this study. we identified angiotensinogen (ANG). the precursor of vasoactive octapeptide angiotensin II. as a novel target gene of bile acids. In human ANG transgenic mice. administration of cholic acid resulted in the down-regulation of human ANG gene expression in the liver. ANG gene expression in HepG2 cells was also repressed by chenodeoxycholic acid. Because the expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA was induced by chenodeoxycholic acid in HepG2 cells. we analyzed the effects of SHP on the human ANG promoter. Promoter mutation analysis demonstrated that SHP repressed human ANG promoter activity through the element. which has been previously determined as a binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4).

The LCR is composed of five DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSs). at least a subset of which appear to cooperate to form a holocomplex in activating genes within the locus. We previously tested the requirement for proper LCR polarity by inverting it in human beta-globin yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice and observed reduced expression of all the beta-type globin genes regardless of developmental stage.

To elucidate the domain function of CBP. we fused its dissected fragments to Gal 4 DNA-binding domain and transfected the deletion mutants into several cell lines. First. we found that the minimal transactivation domain (MTD) at the N-terminal portion maps to between 344-451 aa. and shows activity in a cell-type dependent manner. Second. by means of the yeast two hybrid screening using CBP fragments as baits. we cloned hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1{alpha}. Stat 2. and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF 4) cDNAs. These results suggested a functional role of MTD located at the CBP/p 300 N-terminal region in connecting to transcriptional factors and a physiological significance of complexes formed in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli to the nucleus.

Other diseases such as diabetes markedly predispose the individual to developing hypertension and thereby accelerates the course of cardiac disease. peripheral vascular disease. stroke. retinopathy and nephropathy. Therefore. hypertension is a significant community health problem and understanding the causes of high blood pressure is of paramount importance. Basically. blood pressure is defined as a function of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. These two parameters are governed by the contractile state of the heart and the crosssectional diameter of the arteriolar resistance vessels. the latter of which depends greatly on vascular smooth muscle tone. Both cardiac function and vascular tone are controlled to a major degree by neuronal and hormonal effector systems. such as the renin-angiotensin system. the kinin-kallikrein system. endothelin and atrial natriuretic peptide. which are thought to be involved in blood pressure regulation in a complex fashion.

However it is only recently that newer. more powerful molecular biological techniques have been used to re-examine the genetic basis for the elevated BP of the SHR (Samani et al.. 1989; Yagisawa et al.. 1990) and other genetically hypertensive rat strains (Samani et al.. 1990). The development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Mullis & Faloona. 1987) has allowed the rapid amplification of specific DNA sequences against a complex mixture of genomic sequences. Using this technique we have established a genetic"" fingerprinting"" technique which utilises repetitive DNA sequences found at irregular intervals throughout the rat and human genome (Witney & Furano. 1984; Nelson et al.. 1989). Using PCR primers homologous to such repetitive elements we have been able to synthesise DNA spanning such units and visualise them as a ladder of discrete bands upon gel electrophoresis. This allows ready comparisons of fingerprint patterns between normal individuals and those with congenital diseases. Major gene insertions or deletions will result in altered lengths between repetitive units and therefore band shifts on the PCR-fingerprint. Here we report the first use of this method in comparing the SHR.

It catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting reaction in the reninangiotensin system. the biochemical cascade for generating a vasoactive peptide. angiotensin II. from its precursor angiotensinogen. which is mainly produced by the liver. The reaction catalyzed by renin is the pace-setting step in the system and thus the enzyme plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and in the pathogenesis of hypertension.Transgenic animals provide an attractive system for analyzing the control of gene expression. This approach permits functional studies of potential regulatory regions responsible for tissue-specific gene expression in vivo in a normal developmental environment. Since the expression of renin and angiotensinogen is strictly regulated in the kidney and liver. respectively. the use of transgenic mice to examine the tissue specificity of expression of these genes is likely to be especially informative. As a first contribution to generate animal model for human hypertension. we have produced transgenic mice bearing the human renin and angiotensinogen genes and characterized the expression of these transgenes in the mice. We have established four transgeinc mouse lines harboring the human renin gene. RNase protection analysis revealed that one of mouse lines. hRN8-12. expresses the human renin gene mainly in the kidney. The mRNA was also detectable in a variety of tissues. such as brain. heart. lung. pancreas. spleen. stomach. testis. and thymus.

Recently. renin gene and its mRNA have been analyzed using 32P-labeled probes to elucidate the cause of essential hypertension at the genomic level. and to clarify the regulation mechanism of renin biosynthesis. The 32P-labeled probe is hard to use under the same radioactivity level throughout a series of experiments. because 32P has a half-life of only 2 weeks. In this study. we established a renin mRNA assay system by 2-dimensional image analyzing system after dot blotting hybridization assay using a biotin-labeled renin cRNA (700 base) as a stable probe. These RNAs were in vitro synthesized from pRRnK700T7 obtained by subcloning rat renin cDNA (KpnI fragment. 303-1001) into pGEM1. a commercially available vector for RNA synthesis in vitro. After hybridization. alkaline phosphatase conjugated with streptavidin was bound to the biotin residues in the RNA-RNA hybrid. and the enzyme was incubated with the substrate. The density of each dot area after developing the blue color was analyzed with an image analyzer. The synthetic mRNA could be detected in the range from 0.5 to 10 ng by this assay system. This range corresponds to 1.10-22.9 ng of the full length mRNA with 1.6 kbases. This assay system does not have a very high sensitivity for measuring mRNA. but it is possibly applicable for RFLP analysis of renin gene after amplification of the fragments by polymerase chain reaction.

Both biophysical studies aimed at elucidating the precise mechanism of in vitro aggregation and animal modeling studies support the emerging notion that an ordered prefibrillar oligomer. or protofibril. may be responsible for cell death and that the fibrillar form that is typically observed at autopsy may actually be neuroprotective.

As an approach to understanding the scrapie-associated modification of PrP. we have studied the processing and sedimentation properties of protease-resistant PrP (PrP-res) in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. Like brain-derived PrP-res. the neuroblastoma cell PrP-res aggregated in detergent lysates. providing evidence that the tendency to aggregate is an intrinsic property of PrP-res and not merely a secondary consequence of degenerative brain pathology.

To gain insight into the mechanism of PrP-res accumulation and the in vivo antiscrapie activity of certain polyanions. we have studied effects of sulfated glycans on PrP metabolism in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. Pentosan polysulfate. like the amyloid-binding dye Congo red. potently inhibited the accumulation of PrP-res in these cells without apparent effects on the metabolism of the normal isoform. The inhibition was due primarily to prevention of new PrP-res accumulation rather than destabilization of preexisting PrP-res.

Such measurements have typically required prolonged bioassays in animals. Highly sensitive. but generally non-quantitative. prion detection methods have been developed based on prions' ability to seed the conversion of normally soluble protease-sensitive forms of prion protein to protease-resistant and/or amyloid fibrillar forms. Here we describe an approach for estimating the relative amount of prions using a new prion seeding assay called real-time quaking induced conversion assay (RT-QuIC). The underlying reaction blends aspects of the previously described quaking-induced conversion (QuIC) and amyloid seeding assay (ASA) methods and involves prion-seeded conversion of the alpha helix-rich form of bacterially expressed recombinant PrPC to a beta sheet-rich amyloid fibrillar form. The RT-QuIC is as sensitive as the animal bioassay. but can be accomplished in 2 days or less. Analogous to end-point dilution animal bioassays. this approach involves testing of serial dilutions of samples and statistically estimating the seeding dose (SD) giving positive responses in 50% of replicate reactions (SD50).

Furthermore. the efficiency with which the proteaseresistant PrP (PrP-res) of one species induces the in vitro conversion of the normal PrP (PrP-sen) of another species to the protease-resistant state correlates with the cross-species transmissibility of TSE agents.

Here degenerate phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ONs) are introduced as low-nM PrP-res conversion inhibitors with strong antiscrapie activities in vivo.

105487,Intramolecular VersusIntermolecular Disulfide Bonds in Prion Proteins,2002,Ervin Welker and Lynne D Raymond and Harold A Scheraga and Byron Caughey,277,Journal of Biological Chemistry,36,33477-33481,Elsevier,Prion protein (PrP) is the major component of the partially protease-resistant aggregate that accumulates in mammals with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The two cysteines of the scrapie form. PrPSc. were found to be in their oxidized (i.e. disulfide) form (Turk. E.. Teplow. D. B.. Hood. L. E.. and Prusiner. S. B. (1988)Eur. J. Biochem. 176. 21–30); however. uncertainty remains as to whether the disulfide bonds are intra- or intermolecular. It is demonstrated here that the monomers of PrPSc are not linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Furthermore. evidence is provided that PrPSc can induce the conversion of the oxidized. disulfide-intact form of the monomeric cellular prion protein to its protease-resistant form without the temporary breakage and subsequent re-formation of the disulfide bonds in cell-free reactions.,True,HUsIcakAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,104,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820745084,11304867484826518290,/scholar?cites=11304867484826518290,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820745084,0,0,0
105488,The importance of the disulfide bond in prion protein conversion,1998,Lynn M Herrmann and Byron Caughey,9,Neuroreport,11,2457-2461,LWW,THE conversion of normal. protease sensitive prion protein (PrP-sen) to the abnormal protease-resistant form (PrP-res) is of central importance in the pathogenesis of scrapie and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In the present study. the effects of reduction of the disulfide bond on the PrP-sen to PrP-res conversion in a cell-free system were examined. The addition of the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol inhibited the cell-free conversion reaction with an IC 50 of 2–2.5 mM. Separate pretreatment of either PrP-sen or PrP-res with dithiothreitol and an alkylating agent also inhibited the conversion reaction. Results of this study show that preservation of the disulfide bond is important in the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res.,True,HUsIcakAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,100,https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/fulltext/1998/08030/the_importance_of_the_disulfide_bond_in_prion.6.aspx,327812615649393268,/scholar?cites=327812615649393268,,,0,0,0

Heavy surface glycosylation may obscure visualization of their fibrillar cores. so we purified severely under-glycosylated prion protein fibrils from scrapie-infected transgenic mice expressing anchorless prion protein. Using electron and atomic force microscopy. we obtained dimensions and morphological information about prion protein core protofilaments which variably intertwined to form scrapie fibrils. Occasional isolated protofilaments were observed. suggesting that the lateral association of protofilaments is neither essential nor invariant in prion protein polymerization. Strain comparisons suggested basic structural differences; ME7 and 22L fibrils contained thinner protofilaments. 22L fibrils preferred left-handed twists. and 22L fibril periodicities averaged 106 nm per half-turn. compared with 64 …,True,HUsIcakAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,99,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458008000651,7696069473041672580,/scholar?cites=7696069473041672580,,,0,0,0

TSE transmission barriers and strains,2003,Byron Caughey,66,,1,109-120,Oxford University Press,Conversion of PrPC to aberrant forms such as PrPSc appears to be critical in the transmission and pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases. In vitro studies have shown that TSE-associated. protease-resistant forms of PrP can cause PrPC to convert to forms that are similarly protease-resistant under a wide variety of conditions. These observations have provided evidence that pathological forms of PrP have at least limited capacity to propagate themselves. which is necessary for them to be infectious. PrP conversion reactions have proven to be highly specific and appear to account. at least in part. for TSE species barriers and the propagation of strains. Such in vitro conversion systems have yielded insights into the molecular mechanisms of TSE disease and are being exploited as screens for anti-TSE drugs and as bases for diagnostic tests.,True,HUsIcakAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC,91,https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-abstract/66/1/109/284794,3511493327807446738,/scholar?cites=3511493327807446738,,https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-pdf/66/1/109/25152087/109.pdf,0,0,0

One hallmark of CWD is the shedding of infectious prions in saliva. as demonstrated by bioassay in deer. It is also clear that the concentration of prions in saliva. blood. urine and feces is much lower than in the nervous system or lymphoid tissues. Rapid in vitro detection of CWD (and other) prions in body fluids and excreta has been problematic due to the sensitivity limits of direct assays (western blotting. ELISA) and the presence of inhibitors in these complex biological materials that hamper detection. Here we use real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) to demonstrate CWD prions in both diluted and prion-enriched saliva samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic white-tailed deer. CWD prions were detected in 14 of 24 (58.3%) diluted saliva samples from CWD-exposed white-tailed deer. including 9 of 14 asymptomatic animals (64.2%). In addition. a phosphotungstic acid enrichment enhanced the RT-QuIC assay sensitivity. enabling detection in 19 of 24 (79.1%) of the above saliva samples. Bioassay in Tg[CerPrP] mice confirmed the presence of infectious prions in 2 of 2 RT-QuIC-positive saliva samples so examined.
