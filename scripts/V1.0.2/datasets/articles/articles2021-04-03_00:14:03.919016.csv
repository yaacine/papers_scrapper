However. uncontrolled nucleation in the micro-defects of nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces could lead to the formation of large pinned droplets. which greatly degrades the performance. Here. we experimentally demonstrate for the first time stable and efficient jumping droplet condensation on a superhydrophobic surface with three-dimensional (3D) copper nanowire networks. Due to the formation of interconnections among nanowires. the micro-defects are eliminated while the spacing between nanowires is reduced. which results in the formation of highly mobile droplets. By preventing flooding on 3D nanowire networks. we experimentally demonstrate a 100% higher heat flux compared with that on the state-of-the-art hydrophobic surface over a wide range of …,True,5ejlQaYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,85,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435117301812,3961744748288110351,/scholar?cites=3961744748288110351,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435117301812,0,0,0

The anisotropically shaped rods are favorable for the rapid transport of photogenerated charge carriers. The substitution of Ti 4+ by S 6+ is primarily incorporated into the lattice of the TiO 2 shell so as to create an intra-band-gap state below the conduction band (CB) position. giving rise to Ti− O− S bonds and thus the visible light response. The presence of electron-deficient S atoms is of benefit to the decreased recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes by capturing electrons (e−). Meanwhile. a tight close interface between K 3 Ti 5 NbO 14 and TiO 2 was formed to achieve a nano-heterojunction structure. leading to the fostered separation of its interfacial photogenerated electrons and holes. The visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) by STNT composites is higher than that by pure K 3 Ti 5 NbO 14. owing to the synergistic effects of S doping and heterojunction. A possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed with a reasonable discussion.

Currently. they still rely on large Li-ion batteries for system startup. In this paper. the application potential of thermoelectric (TE) devices to release this Li-ion dependence has been preliminarily evaluated. Firstly. following the HTPEMFC stack or the methanol reformer. TEGs are embedded inside a gas-liquid heat exchanger to jointly form a TE recovery subsystem for electricity production. A finite-difference model of this subsystem has been built in engineering equation solver (EES) software for optimization. The results show that the recovered power can significantly reduce the dependence on Li-ion battery during startup. especially when this TE subsystem is directly installed after the methanol reformer. Secondly. TE coolers are integrated into the methanol evaporator to reduce the heat loss herein during the HTPEMFC power system startup. It is believed that by reducing this heat loss. the electricity consumption by the evaporator during startup can be steadily reduced. Through the heat-electricity conversion and the TE-assisted heat-loss reduction. the HTPEMFC system dependence on Li-ion battery during startup can be dramatically reduced. The preliminary analyses show that TE device applications inside HTPEMFC power systems are of great value and worth of further studies.,True,mtf2IwsAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/potential-usage-of-thermoelectric-devices-in-a-htpemfc-system-two,,,,,,0,0,0

Indeed. solar thermal devices help reduce primary energy consumption and can reduce electricity demand. thus representing one of the best options for satisfying heating and/or cooling energy supply. The Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES) represents one of the best promising option among the various storage technologies. because the size of the storage can be easily extended by drilling additional boreholes and simply connecting the pipes to the existing boreholes; the overall energy efficiency of this system is about 40–60%.

One example is hotel sectors on small islands that are not connected to mainland energy distribution grids. The use of solar energy systems could be a smart option for reducing energy consumption and tackling seasonal fluctuation. The operation of a weak and isolated electric grid requires attention to the management of power profiles in very short time frames. Energy storage (thermal or electric). as well as building automation control technologies. can be utilised for these aims.

1303782,On the reliability of optimization results for trigeneration systems in buildings. in the presence of price uncertainties and erroneous load estimation,2016,Antonio Piacentino and Roberto Gallea and Pietro Catrini and Fabio Cardona and Domenico Panno,9,Energies,12,1049,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Cogeneration and trigeneration plants are widely recognized as promising technologies for increasing energy efficiency in buildings. However. their overall potential is scarcely exploited. due to the difficulties in achieving economic viability and the risk of investment related to uncertainties in future energy loads and prices. Several stochastic optimization models have been proposed in the literature to account for uncertainties. but these instruments share in a common reliance on user-defined probability functions for each stochastic parameter. Being such functions hard to predict. in this paper an analysis of the influence of erroneous estimation of the uncertain energy loads and prices on the optimal plant design and operation is proposed. With reference to a hotel building. a number of realistic scenarios is developed. exploring all the most frequent errors occurring in the estimation of energy loads and prices. Then. profit-oriented optimizations are performed for the examined scenarios. by means of a deterministic mixed integer linear programming algorithm. From a comparison between the achieved results. it emerges that:(i) the plant profitability is prevalently influenced by the average “spark-spread”(ie. ratio between electricity and fuel price) and. secondarily. from the shape of the daily price profiles;(ii) the “optimal sizes” of the main components are scarcely influenced by the daily load profiles. while they are more strictly related with the average “power to heat” and “power to cooling” ratios of the building.

The first part of this thesis describes the derivations of the three dimensional conservative CMC governing equations and their finite volume discretization for unstructured mesh. The parallel performance of the newly developed CMC code is assessed. The runtime data coupling interface between the 3D-CMC and LES solvers is designed and the different solvers developed during the course of this research are detailed. The aerodynamics of two swirling non-reacting flows from the Sydney and Cambridge burners are first simulated. The main ow structures (e.g. the recirculating zones) in both cases are correctly predicted. The sensitivity analysis about the influences of turbulent inlet boundary. computational domain and mesh refinement on velocity statistics is conducted.

Within the framework of constant density. large activation energy and quasi-steady assumptions. a correlation describing spherical flame propagation speed as a function of flame radius is derived. This correlation is used to assess the influence of gas and particle properties on initiation and propagation of premixed spherical flames.

A transition to alternative energy-efficient technologies could reduce this energy consumption considerably. To quantify the influence of factors that drive consumer choices for light bulbs. we conducted a choice-based conjoint field experiment with 183 participants. We estimated discrete choice models from the data. and found that politically liberal consumers have a stronger preference for compact fluorescent lighting technology and for low energy consumption. Greater willingness to pay for lower energy consumption and longer life was observed in conditions where estimated operating cost information was provided. Providing estimated annual cost information to consumers reduced their implicit discount rate by a factor of five. lowering barriers to adoption of energy efficient alternatives with …,True,zEMbi_kAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,94,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180091300325X,13519176401626090872,/scholar?cites=13519176401626090872,,,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/86077/1/Ecol_Econ.pdf,0,0,0

This uncertainty arises primarily from inconsistencies between national accounts and household surveys and. to a smaller extent. from using aggregated sectors. Researchers may introduce significant inaccuracies by ignoring these inconsistencies when reporting household footprints. We apply the methodology to India and Brazil. where we find the size of this uncertainty to be higher than 20% of footprints at most income levels. We expect that previous estimates for these countries may have been overestimated due to these inconsistencies.

Some research suggests these goals are in conflict. based largely on the observation that a dollar spent at higher income levels is less carbon intensive than at lower income levels. We put this concern to rest. We quantify this effect in its most extreme manifestation. both within countries and between countries. We use a wide range of income elasticities of emissions (0.7–1.0) and scenarios from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) with the highest (SSP4) and lowest (SSP5) between‐country inequality. Within countries. even with assumptions of low elasticities (0.7) and aggressive inequality reduction (Gini coefficient of 0.55 to 0.30). emissions would realistically increase by less than 8%. which would likely occur over several decades.

Indian households also contribute to ambient PM2. 5 to different extents from a number of sources. including biomass-burning cook stoves. transport and industrial manufacturing triggered by household consumption. In this study. we quantify the PM2. 5 contributions by source from. as well as the mortality burden suffered by. individual urban and rural income deciles. We find that the impacts are distributed differently from contributions. Indirect emissions associated with household consumption contribute almost twice as much to ambient PM2. 5 concentrations as direct emissions from biomass cook stoves. We show that the mortality risk from these indirect sources fall disproportionately on lower-income households. exacerbating the mortality risks they already face from using biomass-burning cook stoves. As a result. economy-wide end-of-pipe controls can reduce inequity in contributions to ambient air pollution. However. due to the overwhelming role of household indoor air pollution in premature deaths among the low-income population. clean cook stoves reduce overall inequality in terms of mortality risks to a far greater extent.,True,zEMbi_kAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-126114/latest.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-126114/latest.pdf,0,0,0

Even more importantly. it has not been clarified under which conditions the financial system could instead hamper the low-carbon transition. Overlooking the possible (even temporary) hampering role of the financial system in the low-carbon transition can lead to a large underestimation of climate transition risk. The set of scenarios that financial supervisors recommended to investors to analyse climate transition risk include scenarios labelled as ‘disorderly transition’. Nevertheless. there are important limitations in interpreting such scenarios in terms of a disorderly transition. In particular. since in the climate economic models currently used by financial supervisors. finance plays no role. it is not possible to investigate the conditions for the financial system to act as an enabler or as a barrier for the low-carbon transition. To shed light on this issue. here we analyse how the economic trajectories of these climate economics models are reshaped depending on the timing and the extent by which financial actors assess climate risk.,True,zEMbi_kAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3748642,,,,,,0,0,0

The new value is the consensus of a team of European experts for this question. based on the results of a new contingent valuation (CV) questionnaire that has been applied in 9 countries: France. Spain. UK. Denmark. Germany. Switzerland. Czech Republic. Hungary. and Poland. The total sample size is 1463. A procedure for transferring the results to other countries has also been developed and tested.The approach is innovative because it is based directly on the change of life expectancy (LE). by contrast to previous valuations of air pollution mortality that were based either on accidental deaths or on a small change in the probability of dying.

Security of supply depends on accessibility to primary energy sources. on system adequacy and on market adequacy. We concentrate on the longer term aspects of supply security. namely access to primary fuels and system adequacy in the gas sector and we consider some statistical measures. Regarding import fuel dependency. we conclude that the 2004 enlargement brought abundant local solid fuel sources into the EU; and brought in two completely import oil dependent nations. Cyprus and Malta. Regarding gas dependency. we conclude that natural gas dependency of continental 2004 new member states are significantly higher than the EU average; Hungary and Latvia have a combined issue of high gas dependence for electricity generation and high economic dependence on gas; that gas import dependency is significantly higher in new member states than in the old ones; and that diversification of sources of gas imports is much less for new than for old member states. Natural gas import dependency is a major energy policy issue for continental new EU members. We consider the asset and supply ownerships for gas markets in the region. A key issue also is the dominance of joint ventures of Russian Gazprom with German companies (particularly E. ON Ruhrgas) in the ownership of gas assets and in gas supplies throughout the central and east European region.,True,Y-dnFnEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,11,https://www.eeinstitute.org/european-review-of-energy-market/EREM%205_Article%20Kaderjak-%20Cameron%20and%20Toth.pdf,11200999448239671408,/scholar?cites=11200999448239671408,,,https://www.eeinstitute.org/european-review-of-energy-market/EREM%205_Article%20Kaderjak-%20Cameron%20and%20Toth.pdf,0,0,0

Using IPCC carbon budgets and the IPCC’s AR5 scenario database. and assuming future emissions from other sectors are compatible with a 2°C pathway. we calculate that the 2°C capital stock for electricity will be reached by 2017 based on current trends. In other words. even under the very optimistic assumption that other sectors reduce emissions in line with a 2°C target. no new emitting electricity infrastructure can be built after 2017 for this target to be met. unless other electricity infrastructure is retired early or retrofitted with carbon capture technologies.

These assets typically have long lifetimes and commit large amounts of (future) CO 2 emissions. Here. we analyze the historic development of emission commitments from power plants and compare the emissions committed by current and planned plants with remaining carbon budgets. Based on this comparison we derive the likely amount of stranded assets that would be required to meet the 1.5◦ C–2◦ C global warming goal. We find that even though the growth of emission commitments has slowed down in recent years. currently operating generators still commit us to emissions (∼ 300 GtCO2) above the levels compatible with the average 1.5◦ C–2◦ C scenario (∼ 240 GtCO2).

1303890,Pathways toward zero-carbon electricity required for climate stabilization,2018,Richard Audoly and Adrien Vogt-Schilb and Céline Guivarch and Alexander Pfeiffer,225,Applied energy,,884-901,Elsevier,This paper provides pathways of the carbon content of electricity extracted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth Assessment Report scenarios database. It demonstrates three policy-relevant aspects of the carbon content of electricity that are implicit in most integrated assessment model results but under-discussed in academia and the policy debate. First. climate stabilization at any level from 1.5 °C to 3 °C requires the carbon content of electricity to decrease quickly and become almost carbon-free before the end of the century. As such. the question for policy makers is not whether to decarbonize electricity but when and how to do so.

The notion of ‘green growth’has become widely adopted as a core objective of international institutions and national governments. The concept of ‘green growth’is used flexibly and its definition contested. Green growth is defined as long-run increases in gross domestic product alongside the enhancement of natural capital. An analysis is undertaken that dismisses some environmental concerns. and instead leads to a focus on others. Theoretical economics of green growth are reviewed.

Many of these environmental issues involve the use and abuse of scarce water resources. The huge investments in irrigation infrastructure by Soviet planners resulted in a vast diversion of water flows from the two main rivers of the region—the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya—into arid areas to feed the rapid expansion of region-wide cotton production. and to supply the rapidly growing urban centers in Central Asia. Since water was treated as a free good. it was used wastefully and unsustainably. In addition.

This paper introduces a novel method that extracts. for every given energy sector transition scenario. the implicit amount of new power generation capacity that is added every year. and the required amount of stranding if this scenario is to be in line with its projected generation mix. We show that most scenarios that stabilize warming to below 1.5-2 C require a high level of asset stranding. not only for future capacity additions. but also for already existing and currently planned generators. Such stranding affects China and the US most. The amount of future fossil fuel capacity stranding required. in line with 1.5-2 C warming. has increased by 21% between 2005 and 2015.

1303901,Committed Emissions from Existing and Planned Power Plants and Asset Stranding Required to Meet the Paris Agreement,2020,Cameron Hepburn and Adrien Vogt-Schilb and Ben Caldecott and Alexander Pfeiffer,,,8886,,Inter-American Development Bank,Over the coming decade. the power sector is expected to invest ~7.2 trillion USD in power plants and grids globally. much of it into CO2-emitting coal and gas plants. These assets typically have a long lifetime and commit large amounts of (future) CO2 emissions. Here. we analyze the historic development of emission commitments from power plants and compare the emissions committed by current and planned plants with remaining carbon budgets. Based on this comparison we derive the likely amount of stranded assets that would be required to meet the 1.5-2°C global warming goal. We find that even though the growth of emission commitments has slowed down in recent years. currently operating generators still commit us to emissions (~300 GtCO2) above the levels compatible with the average 1.5-2°C scenario (~240 GtCO2). Furthermore. the current pipeline of power plants would add almost the same amount of additional commitments (~270 GtCO2). Even if the entire pipeline was cancelled. therefore. ~20% of global capacity would need to be stranded to meet the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Our results can help companies and investors re-assess their investments in fossil-fuel power plants. and policymakers strengthen their policies to avoid further carbon lock-in.,True,FY0QAxIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:idb:brikps:8886,,,,,,0,0,0

1303905,The decarbonization identity and pathways to net-zero,2018,Alexander Jan Lukas Pfeiffer,,,,,,Success or failure of climate policies in limiting warming to beneath particular thresholds depends on several physical. economic and social uncertainties. Whilst scenario analysis can be informative as to the types of policies that are required to achieve these goals. the complexity of scenario analysis often masks the underlying fundamental choices. This dissertation introduces the concept of the ‘decarbonization identity’ to simply and systematically describe the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of choices available in future climate policy decisions. The simple identity states that the remaining carbon budget [B] for a given level of warming can be partitioned into four areas: the already committed ‘baked-in’ emissions from existing capital stock [E]; new commitments arising from investments in additional capital stock yet to be made [N]; less the stranding of existing or future capital stock [S]; and the additional atmospheric space created by negative emissions technologies (NETs) [A]. This dissertation finds that currently operating electricity generators [E] would already emit more CO2 (~300 GtCO2) then is compatible with currently available generation-only carbon budgets [B] for a temperature rise of 1.5-2°C (~240 GtCO2). In addition. the current pipeline of planned fossil fuel power plants would add almost the same amount [N] of emission commitments (~270 GtCO2) to this capital stock again. Finally. these carbon budgets are inherently uncertain and depend on future. yet to be achieved. reductions of short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP) emissions.

According to the data collected so far. the establishment. cultivation and harvesting of all four species were performed successfully. without needing new agricultural methods. The chemical composition of the perennial crops is closer to straw than woody biomass fuels therefore technologies for thermal conversion of straw should be considered for these crops. The basis for the economic and environmental assessments has been established. The results will be derived once the plantations have completed a full cycle.,True,3SvQIXQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,21,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Soldatos/publication/237456524_BIOENERGY_CHAINS_FROM_PERENNIAL_CROPS_IN_SOUTH_EUROPE/links/0f31753b5990789b12000000/BIOENERGY-CHAINS-FROM-PERENNIAL-CROPS-IN-SOUTH-EUROPE.pdf,4112012475081126692,/scholar?cites=4112012475081126692,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Soldatos/publication/237456524_BIOENERGY_CHAINS_FROM_PERENNIAL_CROPS_IN_SOUTH_EUROPE/links/0f31753b5990789b12000000/BIOENERGY-CHAINS-FROM-PERENNIAL-CROPS-IN-SOUTH-EUROPE.pdf,0,0,0

Carbon dioxide. produced from almost every energy consuming activity. is the dominant greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Water desalination is an energy intensive activity. and when it is powered by conventional energy sources. significant amounts of CO2 are released. For every cubic metre of fresh water produced. there is a 2 kg of CO2 reduction if renewable energy sources (RES) are used instead of electricity from the local grid. On the other hand. the cost of fresh water produced by desalination is much less if conventional sources of energy are used.Making appropriate policy choices require information on both costs and benefits.

One of the most interesting cases is the calculation of the real cost of electricity. because of the complexity of its generation and distribution process. This cost is sometimes estimated by means of large computerized models of the energy sector. but usually the lack of detail in such models gives unsatisfactory results. For many sectoral studies an overall average is not sufficient. especially when cost differences from sector to sector are significant. as for example in the case of rural electrification. where the real cost of electricity is in general much higher than the national average. because of outstanding transmission and distribution expenses.

This project has been partially supported by the European Commission under the ALTENER programme. The objective of the Multisees project was the elaboration of a multiple criteria decision-making tool for the integration of energy crops in rural regions of Southern Europe. The obtained tool is unduly useful for the analysis of economic potential and for the determination of the most promising bioenergy schemes. It works on a regional bases. and it is able to support decision-makers (farmers. promoters. environmentalists. politicians. etc.) on their decision regarding energy crops cultivation and energy exploitation of the cultivates biomass. This project meant to provide policy makers and entrepreneurs with all quantitative economic and environmental information on potential biomass supplies necessary to decision making in the bioelectricity projects field.

Eleven mixtures were prepared with varying binder contents with the POFA content varying between 25% and 100%; the other constituent materials such as fine aggregate and water were kept constant. All the specimens were cured in oven for 24 h at 65 °C and thereafter kept in room temperature (about 26–29 °C) before testing for the compressive strength.

In addition. another local waste material. manufactured sand (M-sand). was used as a replacement for conventional sand in the development of green geopolymer mortar. Twenty-four mortar mixtures were designed with varying binder contents and alkaline activators. The oven dry curing was also kept consistent for all the mix proportions at a temperature of 65°C for 24 hours. The highest 28-day compressive strength of about 48 MPa was obtained for the mortar containing 20% of MK. 35% of GGBS. and 45% of POFA. The increment of MK beyond 20% leads to reduction of the compressive strength. The GGBS replacement beyond 35% also reduced the compressive strength. The entire specimen achieved average 80% of the 28-day strength at the age of 3 days. The density decreased with the increase of POFA percentage.

The variable investigated includes the quantities of replacement levels of M-sand.

The results show that an average of 76% of the 28-day compressive strength was found at the age of 3 days. The rate of strength development from 3 to 7 days was found between 12 and 16% and it was found much less beyond this period. The addition of 100% M-sand and QD shows insignificant strength reduction compared to mixtures with 100% N-sand. The particle angularity and texture of fine aggregates played a significant role in the strength development due to the filling and packing ability. The rough texture and surface of QD enables stronger bond between the paste and the fine aggregate. The concentration of alkaline solution increased the reaction rate and thus enhanced the development of early age strength.

1303975,Essays on the dynamics of alternative fuel vehicle adoption: insights from the market for hybrid-electric vehicles in the United States,2012,David Ross Keith,,,,,,Despite growing energy security and environmental concerns about dependence on oil as a transportation fuel. gasoline remains the overwhelmingly dominant fuel used by the US automotive fleet. Numerous previous efforts to introduce alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) fueled by hydrogen. biofuels and electricity have failed. and significant barriers to a rapid transition to AFVs remain. One technology that has achieved considerable success in the US is the gasoline hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV). which integrate gasoline and electric powertrain components to significantly improve the efficiency of gasoline use. Since their introduction in 1999. over 2 million HEVs have been sold in the US. with more than 30 HEV models available to consumers today. In this dissertation I explore the dynamics of adoption of HEVs. examining factors influencing consumer adoption of HEVs to date. and. looking forward. the role of HEVs in the emerging market for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). In Essay 1. I examine the market for the iconic Toyota Prius HEV. While more than 1 million Prius vehicles have been sold in the US. this market has been characterized by long wait lists at Toyota dealerships. evidence of supply constraints influencing the diffusion process.

However. evidence indicates that PHEVs are often plugged in more frequently than BEVs in practice. This is somewhat paradoxical: drivers for whom plugging in is optional tend to do so more frequently than those for whom it is necessary. This has led to the coining of a new term – “gas anxiety” – to describe the apparent desire of PHEV drivers to avoid using gasoline.

Diffusion is not uniform: sales are clustered in particular regions such as the West Coast. around Washington DC and north into New York and New England. Several theories seek to explain spatial clustering in social networks. including demographic homophily. social contagion and confounding factors such as marketing exposure. Here the authors explore the extent to which each of these theories explains the observed clusters in adoption patterns. They develop a formal model of spatial technology diffusion capturing the flow of information among regions through people’s social networks. The model is applied to the case of the diffusion of the Toyota Prius hybrid-electric vehicle in the United States. The authors discuss applications of the findings. including implications for the development of effective public policies for government agencies. effective marketing and distribution strategy for auto original equipment manufacturers. and implications for the emerging market for electric vehicles and electric vehicle recharging infrastructure.,True,8Cxx9m0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,11,https://trid.trb.org/view/1130715,2799483747920715873,/scholar?cites=2799483747920715873,,,,0,0,0

Ltd,Constraints on production capacity adjustment present a strategic and operational problem for managers launching products when demand is uncertain. Stock‐outs can be costly if demand exceeds available product supply. as sales are deferred or lost when prospective customers are waitlisted. Recent research on diffusion under supply constraints has analyzed launch strategies to minimize the chance of stock‐outs. Others suggest that waitlisted buyers generate social exposure that can boost customer demand and shape the diffusion process. We develop a generalized model of new product diffusion under supply constraints that explicitly accounts for endogenous customer waitlisting and waitlist‐generated word‐of‐mouth.

1303995,The role of gas anxiety in the charging choices of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle drivers,2016,Yanbo Ge and Don MacKenzie and David Keith,,,,,Transportation Research Board,Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) provide an opportunity to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions without causing range anxiety. As a result. PHEV drivers are commonly assumed to be less dependent on the availability of charging infrastructure than battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers. However there is also evidence that PHEVs plug in more often than BEVs because the owners have gas anxiety - a strong desire to avoid using gasoline. This work examines the existence of gas anxiety by analyzing the factors influencing charging decision of PHEV owners. A web-based stated preference survey was conducted and the data was analyzed using a latent class logit model. The result shows that there are two classes of decision making patterns among PHEV owners: those who value gasoline cost and recharging expenditure almost the same (class 1) and those who value gasoline cost more heavily than recharging cost (class 2). Among those in class 2. the amount of money spent on gasoline has much bigger influence on the utility of charging than the amount spent on electricity at the recharging station. which can be interpreted as a form of gas anxiety.,True,8Cxx9m0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/120865,,,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/120865/Ge-MacKenzie-Keith16-6283_6359_111620150121168674754615.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

A large proportion of regulated promoter sites were involved in synapse maintenance. We found that Mef2c interacts with Ash2l and mediates changes in H3K4me3.

However. the function of Rab27a on brain development is unknown. Here. we identified a form of paracrine communication that regulates spine development between distinct populations of developing cortical neurons. In the developing somatosensory cortex of mice. we show that decreasing Rab27a levels in late-born pyramidal neurons destined for layer (L) 2/3 had no cell-autonomous effect on their synaptic integration but increased excitatory synaptic transmission onto L4 neurons that receive somatosensory information. This effect resulted in an increased number of L4 neurons activated by whisker stimulation in juvenile mice. In addition. we found that Rab27a. the level of which decreases as neurons mature. regulates the release of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in developing neurons in vitro and decreasing Rab27a levels led to the accumulation of CD63-positive vesicular compartments in L2/3 neurons in vivo. Together. our study reveals that Rab27a-mediated paracrine communication regulates the development of synaptic connectivity. ultimately tuning responses to sensory stimulation. possibly via controlling the release of sEVs.

Films of α-PVDF doped with Nile red were stretched at controlled rates at a temperature of 80 °C to produce the α- to β-phase transition. The thermo/mechanical dependent changes in the crystalline structure are related to the physical rotation of the polar (CH2–CF2) group. which can be monitored by steady state fluorescence techniques. The degree of phase transformation is related to variation in the fluorescence. which in turn is linked to local dielectric constant of the polymer. The variation of the refractive index is more associated to the alignment of the polymeric chains than to the phase transformation.

The present study was conducted in a dry region with a semiarid climate. where visceral leishmaniasis occurs in humans and dogs. The occurrence of breeding places in specific microhabitats was investigated in soil samples collected from five houses. which were also the location used for sampling of adults. All the microhabitats sampled by our study were identified as natural breeding places due to the occurrence of immature forms of sand flies. On a weekly basis. the number of adult sand flies captured was positively correlated with the mean temperature from preceding weeks.

In this work. the effect of different 3D geometries of the battery separator on battery performance was studied keeping the same volume. It was observed that the different geometries affect the cycling performance. the best geometry being the perforated one that cycled up to 90 C.

Computer simulations and graphical visualizations play a fundamental role developing mathematical models to examine problems that would be too expensive. too much dangerous. or even impossible to study by direct experimentation. Moreover. virtual prototyping. using modelling and simulating software. is a keystone process to bring down the overall cost of designing and developing novel products. Indeed. the rising number of organisations using these technologies has led to a dramatic increase in demand for better research and skilled professionals in this research area.As in the last symposia. that were great successes in ICNAAM 2014. 2015 and 2016. the aim of this 4th symposium was to provide research regarding modelling and simulation techniques applied to the physical sciences and engineering. where the purpose of the symposium activities was to discuss theoretical studies and experimental results with interest in several topics like modelling in engineering sciences and technology. dynamical systems models and methods. computational methods in engineering. computer science modelling and simulation. computer networks modelling. optimization. simulation and control theory. stochastic optimization. numerical methods and simulation. systems modelling. computational mathematics. analysis of mathematical models. algorithms and data structures. software design. control and systems …,True,beUBjxkAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/275657239.pdf,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/275657239.pdf,0,0,0

The impact of current density. flow rate. initial pH. and supporting electrolyte was evaluated on dye and organic matter removal. Furthermore. the use of dimensionally stable anodes (DSA) was tested to evaluate process performance. Results show that after 240 min. it is possible to achieve full dye and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal. regardless of applied current density. This is due to the generation of powerful oxidants – i.e. hydroxyl radicals and peroxodisulfate–. which attack the organic matter in the wastewater. promoting its complete degradation. However. process efficiency increases when using lower current densities (10 mA cm−2): electric charges of about 5 Ah dm−3 are sufficient to fully remove both dye and COD. while charges higher than 15 Ah dm …,True,ZK4ckE4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,66,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468618300793,5308242945450865339,/scholar?cites=5308242945450865339,,,https://ruidera.uclm.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10578/17554/manuscript_Procion_final_Electr_Acta.pdf.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The influence of the current density and the supporting electrolyte has been studied on dye removal and total mineralization of the organic matter. Results show that electrolysis with diamond electrodes is a suitable technology for an efficient degradation of dye. Nonetheless. the process efficiency increases when using chloride as supporting electrolyte because of the electrochemical generation of hypochlorite in wastewater which significantly contribute to dye removal. On the contrary. the total mineralization of the organic matter is more efficient in sulfate media.

BSCF powders are prepared by solution combustion synthesis. Measurements are collected at different temperatures. under various bias potentials and also recorded after long-term operation. Impedance spectra are thoroughly analyzed by the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) approach and compared to the standard equivalent circuits method. At 700 C. losses are dominated by ionic conduction and charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. while oxygen adsorption and bulk diffusion provide a minor contribution to polarization. The performances of pristine materials are remarkable as a very low polarization resistance is measured at 700 C. After prolonged testing at operative temperature. the BSCF cathodes show increasing total polarization resistance. especially due to progressive limitations in the migration of oxygen ions. caused by secondary phase formation. DRT analysis supports the physical interpretation of phenomena taking place in the material and shows the formation of a new contribution at low frequency which can be ascribed to partial decomposition of BSCF.
