1100663,Terminology of metal-organic frameworks and coordination polymers (IUPAC Recommendations 2013),2013,Stuart R Batten and Neil R Champness and Xiao-Ming Chen and Javier Garcia-Martinez and Susumu Kitagawa and Lars Öhrström and Michael O'Keeffe and M Paik Suh and Jan Reedijk,85,Pure and Applied Chemistry,8,,,A set of terms. definitions. and recommendations is provided for use in the classi- fication of coordination polymers. networks. and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). A hier- archical terminology is recommended in which the most general term is coordination poly- mer. Coordination networks are a subset of coordination polymers and MOFs a further subset of coordination networks. One of the criteria an MOF needs to fulfill is that it contains poten- tial voids. but no physical measurements of porosity or other properties are demanded per se. The use of topology and topology descriptors to enhance the description of crystal structures of MOFs and 3D-coordination polymers is furthermore strongly recommended.,True,GVWEqc8AAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC,787,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/181419/local_181419.pdf,17661258560278844301,/scholar?cites=17661258560278844301,,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/181419/local_181419.pdf,0,0,0

Two main products. 1-acetyl-2-methoxynaphthalene (1.2-AMN) and the desired 2-acetyl-6-methoxynaphthalene (2.6-AMN) are obtained. Variations of reaction temperature. the concentration of the acylating agent. and the weight of the catalyst are investigated to find reaction conditions sufficient to provide for good conversion of 2MN and limited deactivation. Surface-poisoning experiments show that the formation of 1.2-AMN occurs on the external surface of the zeolite. When the external surface of zeolite beta is passivated by coating with amorphous silica. a significant increase in the selectivity of 2.6-AMN is observed and this result is a clear example of shape-selective acylation with zeolite catalysts.

Many studies have attempted to address this by utilizing surfactant-assisting technology to alleviate the diffusion constraints.

1100681,Surfactant-templating of zeolites: from design to application,2017,Alexander Sachse and Javier Garcia-Martinez,29,,9,3827-3853,American Chemical Society,Surfactant-templating is one of the most effective and versatile synthetic strategies for the construction of well-defined porous architectures in solids. Though the principles of molecular self-assembly were disclosed in biological systems long since. the use of amphiphiles to generate porous architectures in inorganic matter has merely emerged at the very end of the 20th century. The present review proposes a voyage from the early developments of surfactant-templating for designing ordered mesoporous solids to the application of its principles for the generation of hierarchical zeolites. A thorough overview on the various strategies employing supramolecular chemistry to designing mesoporosity in zeolites is presented. The efficiency of the postsynthetic surfactant-templating approach in bridging the gap between zeolites and amorphous mesoporous molecular sieves is depicted through assessing their key …,True,GVWEqc8AAAAJ:PQm_lTwdG-sC,80,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00599,5926556299427156110,/scholar?cites=5926556299427156110,,https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/109573/2/Sachse_Garcia-Martinez_2017_ChemMater_accepted.pdf,0,0,0

The resulting aqueous colloids are stable over extended periods of time and can be prepared at high nanoparticle loading (20 g/L of Pd) with no agglomeration. The size of the nanoparticles can be reduced from the nanometer (ca. 3.5 nm) to the sub-nanometer size range (ca. 0.9 nm).

Compared to the micropores of zeolites. these mesopores allow orders-of-magnitude faster mass transport. which can be truly considered as “molecular highways”. However. catalytic conversion of reactant molecules (eg. petroleum feed) is hindered by the low Brønsted acidity and inadequate hydrothermal stability inherently related to the amorphous nature of these materials.[4] Considerable effort has been devoted to resolving this fundamental issue during the past 20 years. Among them. the recently emerged field of hierarchical zeolites. that is. microporous zeolites with at least another pore system of meso-(2–50 nm) or macro-sizes (> 50 nm). These hold special promise because they potentially offer the desired fast diffusion. strong zeolitic acidity. and high hydrothermal stability for optimal catalytic performance.[5] A unique post-synthetic zeolite mesostructuring process uses cationic surfactants. for example. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). the same as that used in the synthesis of MCM-41. as mesopore templates to introduce well-controlled mesoporosity into zeolite crystals. While the process is applicable to many zeolite structures and chemical compositions. significant development and commercialization work was performed …,True,GVWEqc8AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC,78,https://www.academia.edu/download/34517288/Evidences.pdf,18152102791300015252,/scholar?cites=18152102791300015252,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34517288/Evidences.pdf,0,0,0

The influence of the surface chemistry and porosity of the carbon supports on the growth of the zeolite has been studied. The presence of oxygen surface groups on the carbon supports has been found to be necessary to allow the anchorage of the zeolite layer on the carbon. In the cases of carbons with few surface groups an oxidising pretreatment favours the interaction between the synthesis solution and the carbon surface. Different synthesis conditions have been tried to evaluate their influence on the final properties of the composites. The use of clear synthesis solutions and the ageing time before the hydrothermal synthesis are key steps for the successful synthesis.

These techniques. known collectively as scanning probe microscopy (SPM). are important because they provide a hitherto unobtainable level of structural insight into surfaces in solution. Because the charge transfer or capacitive charging event central to electrochemical reactivity occurs within a few atomic diameters of the electrode surface in the inner Helmholtz plane. the detailed arrangement of atoms and molecules at this interface strongly controls the corresponding electrochemical reactivity. Indeed. one of the principle goals in almost every area of chemistry is to correlate structure with physical properties.

1100717,Atomic-resolution electrochemistry with the atomic force microscope: copper deposition on gold,1991,Srinivas Manne and PK Hansma and J Massie and VB Elings and AA Gewirth,251,Science,4990,183-186,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to image an electrode surface at atomic resolution while the electrode was under potential control in a fluid electrolyte. A new level of subtlety was observed for each step of a complete electrochemical cycle that started with an Au(111) surface onto which bulk Cu was electrodeposited. The Cu was stripped down to an underpotential-deposited monolayer and finally returned to a bare Au(111) surface. The images revealed that the underpotential-deposited monolayer has different structures in different electrolytes. Specifically. for a perchloric acid electrolyte the Cu atoms are in a close-packed lattice with a spacing of 0.29 ± 0.02 nanometer (nm). For a sulfate electrolyte they are in a more open lattice with a spacing of 0.49 ± 0.02 nm. As the deposited Cu layer grew thicker. the Cu atoms converged to a (111)-oriented layer with a lattice spacing of 0.26 ± 0.02 nm for both …,True,HjG5kNQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,456,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/251/4990/183.abstract,18213351682577974831,/scholar?cites=18213351682577974831,,,0,0,0

The results of these calculations indicate that the bonding at the site is quite covalent and that substantial electron delocalization occurs. A comparison of Xa calculations for free imidazole and the blue copper site indicates that the splitting of the imidazole irl and t2 and n and tt2 levels is expected to significantly increase upon complexation. Similarly. the 2e and 3a! valence levels of the methylthiolate ligand split into three levels upon complexation to copper. The energy separation between these levels is calculated to decrease relative to the splitting between the 2e and 3at levels in free methylthiolate.

In this study. the potential-dependent behavior of poly(ethylene glycol). with or without chloride ion in a copper electroplating bath is investigated using the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy technique. The presence of chloride proves to play a significant role in enhancing PEG adsorption to the Cu electrode surface. More importantly. spectroscopic evidence strongly suggests the formation of a PEG−Cu−Cl complex. By comparing experiment with vibrational modes calculated by using the Hartree−Fock method with a 3-21G* basis set. the structure of this complex is proposed to be a three-coordinated Cu center with two oxygen atoms from PEG and one chloride ligand. ,True,HjG5kNQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,264,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp034875m,11114980226014643676,/scholar?cites=11114980226014643676,,,0,0,0

1100735,Cu complexes that catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction,2013,Matthew A Thorseth and Claire E Tornow and CM Edmund and Andrew A Gewirth,257,,1,130-139,Elsevier,The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is employed in a large number of systems such as fuel cells and air batteries. Currently. the catalyst with the lowest overpotential for the ORR is the enzyme laccase. Laccase only functions at a very narrow pH range. and its large size prevents high current densities. Using copper based catalysts to mimic the ORR activity is an area with many spectroscopic results. but relatively few electrochemical studies. This review catalogs the various copper based ORR catalysts and their activities.,True,HjG5kNQAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,141,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001085451200077X,3974428485146186729,/scholar?cites=3974428485146186729,,,0,0,0

Prior to electrochemical cycling. the HOPG surface appeared atomicallyflat and atomic structure was observed with the surface under potential control. Cycling between 0.0 and 1.8 V vs AgQRE (silver wirequasi-reference electrode) resulted in the formationof an amorphous graphite oxide overlayer structure exhibiting reduced barrier heights to tunneling. which grew anisotropically into the basal graphite plane. With continued cycling this structure completely covered the surface. forming a rough amorphous film. These images suggest that graphitic oxide overlayer formation occurs according to a nucleation and growth mechanism.We report here studies of the surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) at atomic resolution with the scanning tunneling …,True,HjG5kNQAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,141,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100331a006,17743907276772472694,/scholar?cites=17743907276772472694,,http://bard.cm.utexas.edu/resources/Bard-Reprint/421.pdf,0,0,0

It starts with the known crystallographic results and demonstrates how spectroscopy allows these results to be extended to obtain fundamental insight into reactivity. These studies: (1) demonstrate that the unique spectral features associated with the oxidized blue copper site reflect a novel ground state wavefunction with high anisotropic covalency which plays a key role in activating specific electron transfer pathways; (2) provide the first description of the electronic structure of the reduced blue copper site obtained using variable energy photoelectron spectroscopy as a new method of bioinorganic spectroscopy and (3) determine the change in electronic structure on oxidation which allows for an evaluation of the Jahn-Teller distorting forces present in the oxidized blue copper site.

The results define the requirements for reversible Mg deposition and definitively establish that voltammetric cycling of the electrolyte significantly alters its composition and performance. Elemental analysis. scanning electron microscopy. and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) results demonstrate that irreversible Mg and Al deposits form during early cycles. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data show that inhibitory oligomers develop in THF-based solutions. These oligomers form via the well-established mechanism of a cationic ring-opening polymerization of THF during the initial synthesis of the MACC and under resting conditions. In contrast.

This paper discusses five of these characteristics and presents a strategy for function optimization called the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) method. which promises to be robust. effective. and efficient for a broad class of problems. The SCE method is based on a synthesis of four concepts that have proved successful for global optimization: (a) combination of probabilistic and deterministic approaches; (b) clustering; (c) systematic evolution of a complex of points spanning the space. in the direction of global improvement; and (d) competitive evolution. Two algorithms based on the SCE method are presented. These algorithms are tested by running 100 randomly initiated trials on eight test problems of differing difficulty.

At LHC and top RHIC energies. QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing net-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was created at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the hadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities and lower temperatures. it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a rich structure. such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter which terminates in a critical point. or exotic phases like quarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in our understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of various high-energy heavy-ion research programs.

Epidemiologic studies indicate that exposure to pesticides can be a risk factor in the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). A strong correlation has been reported between exposure to paraquat and PD incidence in Canada. Taiwan. and the United States. This correlation is supported by animal studies showing that paraquat produces toxicity in dopaminergic neurons of the rat and mouse brain. However. it is unclear how paraquat triggers toxicity in dopaminergic neurons. Based on the prooxidant properties of paraquat. it was hypothesized that paraquat may induce oxidative stress-mediated toxicity in dopaminergic neurons.

The sample was adjusted to pH 7.37 (and in a second test to 7.25) and diluted to a series of solutions using hard. standard water. The seed germination thod was employed to test the phytotoxicity of the sample to ten plant species. The experimental results of this study compared to previous studies indicated that cabbage. carrot. Japanese millet. oat. and wheat lost some viability during storage. The germination rates of these species fell below 85% in this study. although the rates of cabbage. Japanese millet. and wheat were above 85% in the previous studies. Of the remaining species with adequate germination rates. cucumber and white proso millet were relatively insensitive to the effluent toxicity.

Although these BLs lead to similar photovoltaic device performance. their structure and blocking capability is actually very different. In one case. the “blocking” layer is porous. allowing an intimate contact of the perovskite with the fluorine-doped tin-dioxide (FTO)-covered glass substrate serving as transparent electron collector. This interface between the perovskite and the FTO shows rectifying behavior. Reverse biasing of such a solar cell allows the determination of the valence-band position of the MaPbI3 and the theoretical maximum attainable photovoltage. We show that under reverse bias strong photocurrent amplification is observed. permitting the cell to work as a high-gain photodetector at low voltage. Without BL. the solar …,True,uKj1EfAAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,104,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz502039k,202706725536580310,/scholar?cites=202706725536580310,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48733296/Strong_Photocurrent_Amplification_in_Per20160910-14339-14uzkc8.pdf,0,0,0

The amount of adsorbed dye on TiO2 surface of ca. 5 μm-thick film was measured as a function of immersion (adsorption) time. The amount of adsorbed dye increases with increasing the adsorption time and keeps constant after saturation. Completion of dye adsorption is found to be more than 5 times faster in 5 mM than in 0.5 mM. Since the change of dye concentration is negligible compared to that of number of TiO2 adsorption site. reaction order and rate constant can be estimated from a pseudo reaction. Among the zeroth-. first-. and second-order simulation. the observed data follow first order reaction for both 0.5 mM and 5 mM cases. The rate constant is estimated to be 0.504 min–1 for 5 mM and 0.094 min–1 for 0.5 mM. which indicates that completion of dye …,True,uKj1EfAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,96,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am2001696,8007355841270343640,/scholar?cites=8007355841270343640,,,0,0,0

The physical origin of this behaviour was analysed by detailed characterization combining current–voltage curves with photo- and electroluminescence (PL and EL) imaging as well as light beam induced current measurements (LBIC). It was found that the most efficient cell shows the highest luminescence and the least efficient cell is most strongly limited by non-radiative recombination.

Pulse radiolysis technique is employed to study the one-electron oxidation of folic acid in homogeneous aqueous solution. The radicals used for this study are CCl3O2•. N3•. SO4•−. Br2•−. OH. and O•−. All these radicals react with folic acid under ambient condition at an almost diffusion-controlled rate producing two types of transients.

Since many process variables affect AM. experimental measurements of residual stresses and distortion are time consuming and expensive. Numerical thermo-mechanical models can be used for their estimation. but the quality of calculations depends critically on the accurate transient temperature field which affects both the residual stresses and distortion. In this study. a well-tested. three-dimensional. transient heat transfer and fluid flow model is used to accurately calculate transient temperature field for the residual stress and distortion modeling.

1100809,Role of phenol derivatives in the formation of silver nanoparticles,2008,Jasmine A Jacob and Harbir S Mahal and Nandita Biswas and Tulsi Mukherjee and Sudhir Kapoor,24,Langmuir,2,528-533,American Chemical Society,We demonstrate that dihydroxy benzenes are excellent reducing agents and may be used to reduce silver ions to synthesize stable silver nanoparticles in air-saturated aqueous solutions. The formation of Ag nanoparticles in deaerated aqueous solution at high pH values suggests that the reduction of silver ions occurs due to oxidation of dihydroxy benzenes and probably on the surface of Ag2O. Pulse radiolysis studies show that the semi-quinone radical does not participate in the reduction of silver ions at short time scales. Nevertheless. results show that primary intermediates undergo slower transformation in the presence of dihydroxy benzenes than in their absence. This slow transformation eventually leads to the formation of silver nanoparticles. The Ag nanoparticles were characterized by UV−vis absorption spectroscopy.

The extraordinary activity of 5 vis‐à‐vis 1–4 against Fe2+‐mediated peroxidation may be attributed to the additional phenolic hydroxy group in the former. which lends it better iron‐chelating and radical‐scavenging properties. In iron‐independent peroxidation. however. the ginger constituent [6]‐dehydrogingerdione (1) showed activity comparable to that of 5; this indicates its higher affinity for the lipid peroxide radical (LOO.). due to its higher hydrophobicity.

The following spectroscopic properties have been calculated; ab initio anharmonic corrections (ω−ν) and estimates of the harmonic frequencies ω for all 30 vibrational modes of C6H6 and C6D6. a complete set of anharmonic constants x and g for C6H6. intensities for the infrared spectrum of C6H6 up to 6148 cm−1. and anharmonic corrections to the Raman scattering factors for the fundamental modes of C6H6. In addition. we have improved on previous calculations of the equilibrium geometry of benzene. using Mo/ller–Plesset perturbation theory and a triple zeta plus double polarization (TZ2P) basis.

Phys. Lett. 199. 211 (1992)] open‐shell singles and doubles coupled‐cluster (OCCSD) method is presented. This formulation is in terms of spatial orbital one‐ and two‐electron integrals. Our new OCCSD method is based on ‘‘symmetric spin orbitals’’ and is thus symmetric (or antisymmetric) in the spin indices. It therefore contains about half the number of independent parameters in the coupled‐cluster wave function compared to other open‐shell CCSD methods. It is shown that the formulation presented here contains less than half the number of n6 steps (where n is the number of molecular orbitals) of other recently proposed open‐shell CCSD methods. A new approach by which amplitudes in our method may be compared with amplitudes in a previous OCCSD method is examined.,True,xLDrI24AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,171,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.464352,12311717406397385622,/scholar?cites=12311717406397385622,,,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Tonto is an object oriented system for computational chemistry. This paper focuses mainly on the Foo. the object oriented language used to implement Tonto. Foo currently translates into Fortran 95. It offers almost all the features of the coming Fortran 2000 except for dynamic types. It goes beyond the Fortran standard in that parameterised types and template-like inheritance mechanisms are provided. Since the method is based on textual inclusion. it generates code which is easy for the compiler and human to understand.

Only one set of spatial orbitals is required. thereby reducing the number of independent coefficients in the perturbed wavefunctions. For second order. the computational cost is shown to be similar to a closed-shell calculation. This formalism is therefore more efficient than the recently developed RMP. ROMP or RMP-MBPT theories. The perturbation theory described herein was designed to have a close correspondence with our recently proposed coupled-cluster theory based on symmetric spin orbitals.

However. hydrogen atoms only scatter x-radiation weakly. so x-rays have not been used routinely to locate them accurately.

We show that. contrary to widespread expectation. hydrogen atoms can be located very accurately using x-ray diffraction. yielding bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms (A–H) that are in agreement with results from neutron diffraction mostly within a single standard deviation.

Here we demonstrate that the number of carbonyl oxygen atoms that surround permeating ions is the most important factor in determining ion selectivity rather than the size of the pore or the strength of the coordinating dipoles. Although the electrostatic properties of the coordinating ligands can lead to Na+ or K+ selectivity at some values of the dipole moment. no significant selectivity arises at the specific value of the dipole moment for carbonyl groups found in potassium channels when the ligands have complete freedom. Rather. we show that the main contribution to selectivity arises from slight constraints on the conformational freedom of the channel protein that limit the number of carbonyl oxygen atoms to a value better suited to K+ than Na+. despite the pore being flexible.

With the advantages of low cost. high sensitivity and ease of accessibility. fluorescence imaging has been widely used for cancer detection in the scientific field. Aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are a class of synthesized fluorescent probes with high brightness and photostability in the aggregate state. Herein. a new positively-charged AIEgen. abbreviated as TPE-IQ-2O. is designed and characterized. TPE-IQ-2O not only can distinguish cancer cells from normal cells with high contrast with the aid of the difference in mitochondrial membrane potential as well as the quantity of mitochondria. but it also works as a promising photosensitizer to kill cancer cells through generation of reactive oxygen species upon white light irradiation. thus making it a promising AIE theranostic system.,True,ZfM9rTMAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,119,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c6sc04947h,9101189680874797165,/scholar?cites=9101189680874797165,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c6sc04947h,0,0,0

Tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics are selected as dark donors to eliminate emission leakage from the donors. The TBET mechanism has been adopted since it experiences less influence from spectral overlapping than Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). making it more flexible for developing cassettes with large pseudo-Stokes shifts. In this work. energy transfer from the TPE derivatives (dark donor) to a rhodamine moiety (acceptor) was illustrated through photophysical spectroscopic studies and the energy transfer efficiency (ETE) was found to be up to 99%. In the solution state. no emission from the donors was observed and large pseudo-Stokes shifts were achieved (>280 nm …,True,ZfM9rTMAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC,117,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c6sc04206f,14096839906506207290,/scholar?cites=14096839906506207290,,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c6sc04206f,0,0,0

This review updates the list of orphan GPCRs and describes the criteria used by NC-IUPHAR to recommend the pairing of an orphan receptor with its cognate ligand(s). The following recommendations are made for new receptor names based on 11 pairings for class A GPCRs: hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors [HCA1 (GPR81) with lactate. HCA2 (GPR109A) with 3-hydroxybutyric acid. HCA3 (GPR109B) with 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid]; lysophosphatidic acid receptors [LPA4 (GPR23). LPA5 (GPR92).

1100883,Identification of human GnIH homologs. RFRP-1 and RFRP-3. and the cognate receptor. GPR147 in the human hypothalamic pituitary axis,2009,Takayoshi Ubuka and Kevin Morgan and Adam J Pawson and Tomohiro Osugi and Vishwajit S Chowdhury and Hiroyuki Minakata and Kazuyoshi Tsutsui and Robert P Millar and George E Bentley,4,PloS one,12,e8400,Public Library of Science,The existence of a hypothalamic gonadotropin-inhibiting system has been elusive. A neuropeptide named gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH. SIKPSAYLPLRF-NH2) which directly inhibits gonadotropin synthesis and release from the pituitary was recently identified in quail hypothalamus. Here we identify GnIH homologs in the human hypothalamus and characterize their distribution and biological activity. GnIH homologs were isolated from the human hypothalamus by immunoaffinity purification. and then identified as MPHSFANLPLRF-NH2 (human RFRP-1) and VPNLPQRF-NH2 (human RFRP-3) by mass spectrometry. Immunocytochemistry revealed GnIH-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies in the dorsomedial region of the hypothalamus with axonal projections to GnRH neurons in the preoptic area as well as to the median eminence. RT-PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing of the PCR products identified human GnIH receptor (GPR147) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus as well as in the pituitary. In situ hybridization further identified the expression of GPR147 mRNA in luteinizing hormone producing cells (gonadotropes). Human RFRP-3 has recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion in cultured sheep pituitary cells by inhibiting Ca2+ mobilization. It also directly modulates GnRH neuron firing. The identification of two forms of GnIH (RFRP-1 and RFRP-3) in the human hypothalamus which targets human GnRH neurons and gonadotropes and potently inhibit gonadotropin in sheep models provides a new paradigm for the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in man and a novel means for …,True,DnWNHDcAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,231,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008400,3139025902838924734,/scholar?cites=3139025902838924734,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008400,0,0,0

Amongst these. Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) and its analogs are widely employed in modulating gonadotropin and sex steroid secretion to treat infertility. precocious puberty and many hormone-dependent diseases including endometriosis. uterine fibroids and prostatic cancer. While these effects are all mediated via modulation of the pituitary gonadotrope GnRH receptor and the Gq signaling pathway. it has become increasingly apparent that GnRH regulates many extrapituitary cells in the nervous system and periphery.

Sample preparation is often the bottleneck in analysis and there is a need to minimise the number of steps to reduce both time and sources of error. There is also a move towards more environmentally friendly techniques. which use less solvent and smaller sample sizes. Smaller sample size becomes important when dealing with real life problems. such as consumer complaints and alleged chemical contamination.

This started with the introduction of commercial instruments first for packed and then for capillary chromatography and it looked as if this would be a technique to rival gas–liquid chromatography and HPLC. The activity developed quite rapidly into packed column supercritical fluid separations then into supercritical fluid extraction. However. in recent years there has been a decline in publications. These later techniques continue to be used but are now principally applied to a limited group of applications where they offer significant advantages over alternative techniques.

The treatment of GeCl2·(1.4-dioxane) with [(i-Pr)2ATI]Li or [(Me)2ATI]Li in a 1:1 molar ratio gave the corresponding monochloro germanium(II) complex.

Constant potential (typically 0.75 V vs Ag/AgCl) is applied on the bottom electrodes in the pores of the alumina template in aqueous solution containing manganese acetate (10 mM) and EDOT monomers (80 mM). We can easily control the structures of coaxial nanowires such as PEDOT shell thickness and nanowire length by varying the applied potential. Electrochemical properties of the coaxial nanowires were investigated for an electrochemical supercapacitor. Coaxial nanowires not only exhibit high specific capacitance values but also maintain them well at high current density.

At low pH. where both the amino and carboxyl groups of the cysteine are protonated. these membranes preferentially reject cations and transport anions. At high pH. where both the amino and carboxyl groups are deprotonated. these membranes preferentially reject anions and transport cations. At pH = 6.0. near the isoelectric point of the chemisorbed cysteine. these membranes show neither cation nor anion transport selectivity. In addition to this electrostatically based selectivity. because of the small inside diameter of the Au nanotubules (as small as 0.9 nm). these membranes show molecular-size-based selectivity. ,True,B7JILz0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,218,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac0008901,12579395949498413633,/scholar?cites=12579395949498413633,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49911086/ac000890120161027-6630-r9lafc.pdf,0,0,0

Ion channel mimics based on both microporous alumina and Au nanotube membranes were investigated. The off state was obtained by making the membranes hydrophobic by chemisorbing either a C18 silane (alumina membrane) or a C18 thiol (Au nanotube membrane). Water and electrolyte are forbidden from entering these very hydrophobic pores/nanotubes. The transition to the on state was induced by the partitioning of a hydrophobic ionic species (e.g.. a drug or a surfactant) into the membrane.

We have solved this structure in a tetragonal crystal form at 2.9 Å resolution. We find that each haem is bound in a pocket formed by the interface between a pair of symmetry-related subunits. The quasi-twofold axis of the haem is closely aligned with the local twofold axis relating these subunits. The axial ligands of the haem are sulphurs of two equivalent methionyl residues (Met 52) from the symmetry-related subunits. A cluster of four water molecules is trapped in the gap between the upper edge of the haem and two extended protein loops which close off the haem from the outer aqueous environment. This is the first structure of a bis-methionine ligated haem-binding site and the first case of a twofold symmetric haem-binding site.,True,r-Ps_WQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,240,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsb0794-453,7817586908158227231,/scholar?cites=7817586908158227231,,,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Glutaraldehyde has been used for several decades as an effective crosslinking agent for many applications including sample fixation for microscopy. enzyme and cell immobilization. and stabilization of protein crystals. Despite of its common use as a crosslinking agent. the mechanism and chemistry involved in glutaraldehyde crosslinking reaction is not yet fully understood. Here we describe feasibility study and results obtained from a new approach to investigate the process of protein crystals stabilization by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. It involves exposure of a model protein crystal (Lysozyme) to glutaraldehyde in alkaline or acidic pH for different incubation periods and reaction arrest by medium exchange with crystallization medium to remove unbound glutaraldehyde. The crystals were subsequently incubated in diluted buffer affecting dissolution of un‐crosslinked crystals.

Ltd,Vacuolar H+‐ATPase (V‐ATPase) has a crucial role in the vacuolar system of eukaryotic cells. It provides most of the energy required for transport systems that utilize the proton‐motive force that is generated by ATP hydrolysis. Some. but not all. of the V‐ATPase subunits are homologous to those of F‐ATPase and the nonhomologous subunits determine the unique features of V‐ATPase. We determined the crystal structure of V‐ATPase subunit C (Vma5p). which does not show any homology with F‐ATPase subunits. at 1.75 Å resolution. The structural features suggest that subunit C functions as a flexible stator that holds together the catalytic and membrane sectors of the enzyme.

The host undergoes a number of conformational changes in order to bind the fluoride by four CH hydrogen bonds. The fluorinated groups attached to the-CH2-groups constitute the electronic driving force for binding of the fluoride and si-multaneously provide stereochemical labels in the resulting com-plex. Several enantiomerization processes that are nondissociative feature hydrogen bond making and breaking steps coupled with multiple bond rotations. Anti-Arrhenius behavior is associated with some of these conformational processes. This suggests that solvent and/or gegenions are involved in the conformational changes and that the complete supersystem may need to be included for a complete analysis of the data.

Scaffoldin comprises a series of functional domains. amongst which is a single cellulose-binding domain and nine cohesin domains which are responsible for integrating the individual enzymatic subunits into the complex. The cohesin domains are highly conserved in their primary amino acid sequences. These domains interact with a complementary domain. termed the dockerin domain. one of which is located on each enzymatic subunit.

The structure is a B-DNA type double helix with a single duplex in the asymmetric unit. One of the bulged adenine bases loops out from the double helix. while the other stacks in to it. This is in contrast to our preliminary finding. which indicated that both adenine bases were looped out. This revised model was confirmed by the use of a covalently bound heavy-atom derivative. The conformation of the looped-out bulge hardly disrupts base stacking interactions of the bases flanking it. This is achieved by the backbone making a “loop-the-loop” curve with the extra adenine flipping over with respect to the other nucleotides in the strand. The looped-out base intercalates into the stacked-in bulge site of a symmetrically …,True,r-Ps_WQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,103,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228369290929E,5474351690664441512,/scholar?cites=5474351690664441512,,,0,0,0

The set of 1500 reviews were randomly collected from TripAdvisor.com across multiple hotels for analysis. A set of four hypotheses were used to test the proposed model. Our results suggest that the number of concepts contained in a review. the average number of concepts per sentence. and the review type contribute to the perceived helpfulness of online reviews. The regular reviews were not statistically significant predictors of helpfulness.

It extends a published “model peak” approach which uses selected ion chromatograms as models for component shape. On the basis of this shape. individual mass spectral peak abundance profiles are extracted to produce a “purified” spectrum. In the present work. ion-counting noise is explicitly treated and a number of characteristic features of GC/MS data are taken into account. This allows spectrum extraction to be reliably performed down to very low signal levels and for overlapping components.

1101026,Detailed kinetic modeling of soot formation in shock-tube pyrolysis of acetylene,1985,Michael Frenklach and David W Clary and William C Gardiner Jr and Stephen E Stein,20,Symposium (International) on Combustion,1,887-901,Elsevier,The chemical reaction pathways to soot were investigated by experimenting with detailed kinetic models of soot formation under the conditions used in shock-tube pyrolysis experiments. The analyses of the computational results revealed a single dominant route for the main soot mass growth. Fused polycyclic aromatics play a particularly important role: their formation reactions are essentially irreversible and have the effect of “pulling” chains of reversible reactions. Hydrogen atoms reactivate aromatic molecules to radicals by abstraction reactions. The main bottleneck appears at the formation of the first aromatic ring. The model explains the time scale of soot formation and soot yields obtained in shock-tube pyrolysis of acetylene and also is in accord with product distributions observed in flames.,True,e8c_15cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,703,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0082078485805786,9629690210531190242,/scholar?cites=9629690210531190242,,,0,0,0

The algorithms were probability-based matching (PBM). dot-product. Hertz et al. similarity index. Euclidean distance. and absolute value distance. The test set consisted of 12.592 alternate spectra of about 8000 compounds represented in the database. Most algorithms were optimized by varying their mass weighting and intensity scaling factors. Rank in the list of candidatc compounds was used as the criterion for accuracy. The best performing algorithm (75% accuracy for rank 1) was the dot-product function that measures the cosine of the angle between spectra represented as vectors.

1101045,Estimating probabilities of correct identification from results of mass spectral library searches,1994,Stephen E Stein,5,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,4,316-323,Springer-Verlag,This work presents a method for using mass spectral match factors reported by library search systems to obtain certain probabilistic indicators of correct identification. The overall probability that a retrieval is correct is formally separated into two independent terms. One of these is the probability that a retrieval is correct assuming that the correct match is contained in the library. This can be computed directly from test results. The other term represents the probability that the spectrum of the unknown compound is actually in the library. While the absolute value of this term cannot be computed. a relative value based solely on search results can be derived. This value may. if desired. be used to refine an initial estimate of the overall probability. Parameters used in this calculation are based on changes in test results caused by the logical removal of the test compounds from the library. These methods were parameterized …,True,e8c_15cAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,168,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jasms.8b00551,16112207406680399834,/scholar?cites=16112207406680399834,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1016/1044-0305(94)85022-4.pdf,0,0,0

Although individual laboratories have developed quality control samples. there is no widely available performance standard of biological complexity (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to characterize LC-MS platform performance.

It was found that reaction pathways to soot relax to the previously identified acetylene-addition mechanism in each case. Fuel molecular structure influences the growth process only at its early stages. first by providing more efficient reaction partners for the formation of aromatic molecules and second by affecting the generation of hydrogen atoms. The model explains the relative sooting tendencies of these fuels for shock tube pyrolysis conditions and agrees with recent observations in laminar diffusion flames.,True,e8c_15cAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,154,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0082078488803370,15937862597427235426,/scholar?cites=15937862597427235426,,,0,0,0

Dordrecht,This literature review presents information about the role of tree root systems for the functioning of agroforestry associations and rotations and attempts to identify root-related criteria for the selection of agroforestry tree species and the design of agroforestry systems. Tree roots are expected to enrich soil with organic matter. feed soil biomass. reduce nutrient leaching. recycle nutrients from the subsoil below the crop rooting zone and improve soil physical properties. among other functions. On the other hand. they can depress crop yields in tree-crop associations through root competition. After a brief review of favourable tree root effects in agroforestry. four strategies are discussed as potential solutions to the dilemma of the simultaneous occurrence of desirable and undesirable tree root functions: 1) the selection of tree species with low root competitiveness. eventually supplemented by shoot pruning; 2) the …,True,hsLiUa4AAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC,236,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-0681-0_6,8415355721976320180,/scholar?cites=8415355721976320180,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43066327/Tree_root_characteristics_as_criteria_fo20160225-25808-28bs59.pdf,0,0,0

However. these earlier studies were conducted when the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was only suspected and was confirmed only in the presence of classic clinical features. In contrast. the diagnosis has recently been established in the early mild stage or more often in an asymptomatic stage because of more frequent or routine determinations of thyroid function tests. especially in the elderly. Thus the subjects in the older studies were severely hypothyroid at the time of diagnosis and may not be representative of the present hypothyroid population.

1101063,Distributed tracking in wireless ad hoc sensor networks,2003,Chee-Yee Chong and Feng Zhao and Shozo Mori and Sri Kumar,,,,,BOOZ-ALLEN AND HAMILTON INC SAN FRANCISCO CA,Target tracking is an important application for wireless ad hoc sensor networks. Because of the energy and communication constraints imposed by the size of the sensors. the processing has to be distributed over the sensor nodes. This paper discusses issues associated with distributed multiple target tracking for ad hoc sensor networks and examines the applicability of tracking algorithms developed for traditional networks of large sensors. when data association is not an issue. the standard pre-predictupdate structure in single target tracking can be used to assign individual tracks to the sensor nodes based on their locations. Track ownership will have to be carefully migrated. using for example information driven sensor tasking. to minimize the need for communication when targets move. when data association is needed in tracking multiple interacting targets. clusters of tracks should be assigned to groups of collaborating nodes. Some recent examples of this type of distributed processing are given.

On the molecular level. chirality often has a profound impact on recognition and interaction events and is thus important to biochemistry and pharmacology. In chemical synthesis. much effort has been directed towards developing asymmetric synthesis strategies that yield product molecules with a significant excess of either the left-handed or right-handed enantiomer. This is usually achieved by making use of chiral auxiliaries or catalysts that influence the course of a reaction. with the enantiomeric excess (ee) of the product linearly related to the ee of the auxiliary or catalyst used.

The alignment of electron spins becomes the point at issue when there is an interaction between two unpaired electrons as in diradicals1 and radical pairs. 2 The Coulombic repulsion between electrons lifts the zeroth-order degeneracy and gives rise to singlet and triplet states of different total energy for these chemical entities. It is the singlet state that is usually more stable. as described by the Heitler-London spinexchange between spins of opposite sign in chemical bonds. Chichibabin’s hydrocarbon 1 with a singlet ground state is a classical example of such diradicals. 3 When theinteracting spins are in orthogonal orbitals. however. the triplet states may be favored.

However. NSC function and/or numbers decline with increasing age. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is unique in that astrocytes secreting Wnt3 promote NSC differentiation in a paracrine manner. Here. we show that both the levels of Wnt3 protein and the number of Wnt3‐secreting astrocytes influence the impairment of adult neurogenesis during aging. The age‐associated reduction in Wnt3 levels affects the regulation of target genes. such as NeuroD1 and retrotransposon L1. as well as the expression of Dcx. which is located adjacent to the L1 loci. Interestingly. the decline in the extrinsic Wnt3 levels and in the intracellular expression of the target genes with aging was reversible.

Rotational homers of Alcohols and Shift of νO–H Absorptions in Phenyl Substituted Alcohols,1959,Michinori Oki and Hiizu Iwamura,32,Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan,9,950-955,The Chemical Society of Japan,The authors observed symmetric νO–H absorptions for methanol and tertiary alcohols and unsymmetric bands for primary and secondary alcohols. The unsymmetric band was divided into two bands. assuming that the band is an overlap of the two symmetric bands. The idea of the rotational isomerism was successfully introduced for assigning the band and the following points were concluded.1) Types I and IV show absorption bands at 3644∼3636 cm−1. type II at 3626∼3629 cm−1. type III at 3615∼3618 cm−1. type V at 3616∼3619 cm−1. type VI at 3608∼3611 cm−1. and type VII at 3613∼3617 cm−1.2) The exception is dialkylphenylcarbinols which show the νO–H absorptions at about 3620 cm−1 and 3608 cm−1. the former being assigned to type III and the latter to type VII.

Many studies have been devoted to the improvement of titania photoactivity by depositing noble metals. 1-4 In particular. deposition of silver on TiO2 colloidal particles has received an extended interest that goes beyond photocatalytic degradation. Thus metallic silver can be photocatalytically deposited on TiO2. and this process can be used in silver recovery. eg. from waste photographic effluents. 5 The photoexcitation of electrons is enhanced if metal particles are incorporated in a TiO2 electrode.

Non-radical activation of dioxygen by monooxygenase enzymes such as the iron-porphyrin-based cytochrome P-450 involves the insertion of one oxygen atom of O 2 into the organic substrate while the other oxygen is reduced to water in the presence of an electron donor. Dioxygenase enzymes. on the other hand. catalyse insertion of both oxygen atoms without reducing agents. Oxidation of hydrocarbons with dioxygen catalysed by transition-metal compounds invariably proceeds by free-radical pathways rather than by dioxygenase-type reactions. and so do not allow the epoxidation of alkenes with molecular oxygen.

One- and two-electron-transfer oxidation of organic substrates is catalyzed by H5PV2Mo10O40 and often occurs via an outer-sphere mechanism. The reduced polyoxometalate is reoxidized in a separate step by O2 with the formation of water. H5PV2Mo10O40 also catalyzes electron transfer−oxygen transfer reactions. Here. in contrast to the paradigm that high-valent oxo species are often stronger oxygen-transfer species than lower-valent species. the opposite occurs. Thus. oxygen transfer from the catalyst is preceded by electron transfer from the organic substrate.

TPD experiments on the surfaces enriched with 18O revealed that water desorbing in the 305 K state from TiO2(100) was isotopically scrambled with the lattice oxygen atoms. strongly suggesting that this TPD state resulted from recombination of surface hydroxyl groups.

Oxidation with O2 at 773 K under UHV conditions was sufficient to generate XPS spectra reflective of fully oxidized CeO2(1 1 1). Surface reduction was carried out by annealing in UHV between 773 and 973 K. and the level of reduction was quantified using changes in the Ce3d3/2 4f0 photoemission peak at 917 eV which results primarily from Ce4+ sites. As expected. the level of surface reduction (generation of Ce3+ sites) increased with increasing temperature.

Numerous studies have shown that these sites can be oxidized by exposure to molecular oxygen. but the mechanism and temperature dependence of this oxidation process are not well understood. We present results that suggest low temperature (< 600 K) O 2 exposure oxidizes oxygen vacancies but also leaves oxygen-containing species on the surface that we propose are oxygen adatoms. The presence of these oxygen adatoms is evident in the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum of water.

This unanimity. however. has not arisen from detailed mechanistic studies. but from a general misunderstanding that surface oxygen and titanium concentration changes measured by techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) can be interpreted mechanistically. This thinking is especially pervasive in investigations of the bulk-assisted reoxidation of ion sputtered TiO 2 surfaces.

Vibrational HREELS indicates that CO2 is linearly bound at the latter sites with a νa(OCO) frequency similar to the gas phase value.

Rutile TiO2(110) specimens were cut from the same crystal and were heated in a furnace to different temperatures which resulted in different states of reduction (colors of the crystals).

The surfaces are investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). low-energy He+ ion scattering (LEIS) and static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SSIMS). Flat (1×1)-terminated TiO2(110) surfaces are obtained by sputtering and annealing in UHV at 880 K. These surfaces are exposed to oxygen gas at elevated temperatures in the range 470–830 K. Formation of irregular networks of pseudo-hexagonal rosettes (6.5 Å×6 Å) and small (11̄0] oriented (1×1) islands along with {001}-oriented strands is induced at temperatures from 470 to 660 K. After annealing above 830 K. only regular (1×1) terraces and white strands are observed.

Molecular methanol is the dominant surface species on the vacuum-annealed TiO2(110) surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Coadsorption of methanol with oxygen results in ∼20% of the adsorbed methanol decomposing to methoxy and OH. Subsequent heating of the surface to ∼350 K desorbs unreacted methanol and OH (as water). leaving a surface with only adsorbed methoxy groups. Using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). we show that adsorbed methoxy is at least an order of magnitude more reactive than molecularly adsorbed methanol for hole-mediated photooxidation. Methoxy photodecomposes through cleavage of a C–H bond forming adsorbed formaldehyde and a surface OH group.

Here we develop a high-throughput rice phenotyping facility (HRPF) to monitor 13 traditional agronomic traits and 2 newly defined traits during the rice growth period. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the 15 traits. we identify 141 associated loci. 25 of which contain known genes such as the Green Revolution semi-dwarf gene. SD1. Based on a performance evaluation of the HRPF and GWAS results. we demonstrate that high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to replace traditional phenotyping techniques and can provide valuable gene identification information.

And the studies show that the photoluminescence of water-soluble CdSe/ZnS quantum dots with core capped by a thinner ZnS shell is more sensitive to temperature than that of ones with core capped by a thicker one. That is. with 50% decrement of the quantum yield the temperature of the former need to arise from 280 K to 295 K. while the latter requires much higher temperature (315.6 K). which means that the integrality of shell coverage is a very important factor on temperature-sensitivity to for the photoluminescence of water-soluble CdSe/ZnS quantum dots.

We quantitatively mapped fatty acids in 26 regions of the four-week-old breastfed baboon CNS. and studied the influence of dietary DHA and ARA supplementation and prematurity on CNS DHA and ARA concentrations. Baboons were randomized into a breastfed (B) and four formula-fed groups: term. no DHA/ARA (T-); term. DHA/ARA supplemented (T+); preterm. no DHA/ARA (P-); preterm and DHA/ARA supplemented (P+).

Brain and nervous tissue is rich in the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Docosahexaenoic acid is required for lower and high order functions in humans because of understood and emerging molecular mechanisms. Among brain components that depend on dietary components. DHA is limiting because its synthesis from terrestrial plant food precursors is low but its utilization when consumed in diet is very efficient. Negligible DHA is found in terrestrial plants. but in contrast. DHA is plentiful at the shoreline where it is made by single-celled organisms and plants. and in the seas supports development of very large marine mammal brains.

We tested the hypothesis that premature infants' lack of exposure to gastrointestinal (GI) BCFA is associated with their microbiota and risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) using a neonatal rat model.   Methods Pups were collected one day before scheduled birth. The pups were exposed to asphyxia and cold stress to induce NEC. Pups were assigned to one of three experimental treatments. DF (dam-fed) ; Control. hand-fed rat milk substitute ; BCFA. hand-fed rat milk substitute with 20%w/w BCFA. Total fat was equivalent (11%wt) for both the Control and BCFA groups.

The mass spectrum of the chemical ionization reagent acetonitrile in an ion trap includes a m/z 54 ion. identified previously as 1-methyleneimino-1-ethenylium ion. We show that it reacts with double bonds of polyunsaturated FAME to yield a series of covalent product ions all appearing at (M + 54)+. Collisional dissociation of these ions yields diagnostic fragments. permitting unambiguous localization of double bonds. For methylene-interrupted and conjugated FAME. one of these fragments results from loss of the hydrocarbon end of the chain. while the other involves loss of the methyl ester.

For ablation of polyimide using higher laser fluence. lower-mass distributions of ions are also observed. The craters formed by the laser ablation of both polyimide and graphite are measured in order to find the volume of material ablated per pulse. which is used to estimate the particle density in the laser-generated plasma.

A strategy is  reported here for high-precision determination of  13C/12C ratios at specific positions in  organic compounds separated from complex mixtures. Free radical  fragmentation of methyl palmitate. a test compound. is induced by an  open tube furnace.

The CO hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the fcc phases of Mo2C and Mo2N are identical. The activity of the hcp phase of Mo2C is half that of the other two catalysts but the olefin selectivity is higher. Elemental analysis reveals that the catalysts contain a substantial amount of oxygen following extended use for CO hydrogenation. The hydrogenolysis activity of both Mo2C phases increases markedly with decreasing content of oxygen in the catalyst. Consistent with the known structure sensitivity of C2H6 hydrogenolysis. the activity of the hcp phase of Mo2C is 200-fold higher than that of the fcc phase. This difference in activity is attributed to differences in the structure of the principal planes exposed by each phase of the carbide.,True,kx1O-t8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,302,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951787901539,13292362048374673506,/scholar?cites=13292362048374673506,,,0,0,0

Multiple-quantum NMR studies indicate clusters of five to seven hydrogen atoms in films prepared at temperatures ranging from 113 to 324 C. In the range from 270 to 324 C. only these small clusters exist. but lower-temperature films also contain larger clusters. A comparison of the ir and NMR results allows the assignment of the 2080-cm− 1 absorption to small hydrogen clusters. Annealing studies indicate hydrogen rearranges prior to evolution. Deposition temperature and annealing temperature have similar effects on hydrogen concentration. but deposition temperature was found to control the density and microstructure of the film.

In general. the water content. active-site content. and transesterification activity of freeze-dried subtilisin Carlsberg preparations containing >96% w/w salt increased with increasing kosmotropicity of the activating salt. Degrees of activation relative to the salt-free enzyme ranged from 33-fold for chaotropic sodium iodide to 2480-fold for kosmotropic sodium acetate. Exceptions to the general trend can be explained by the mechanical properties and freezing characteristics of the salts undergoing lyophilization.

Developments in the field suggest that porous materials such as zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for carbon capture due to their large capacity to selectively adsorb CO2.[1] In particular. MOFs [2] with open metal sites such as Mg2 (dobdc)(dobdc4À= 2. 5-dioxido-1. 4-benzenedicarboxylate; Mg-MOF-74) possess strong CO2-binding sites leading to large experimental CO2 uptake values.

Catalyst characterization,1987,GS Ranhotra and GW Haddix and AT Bell and JA Reimer,108,Journal of Catalysis,1,24-39,Academic Press,The hcp and fcc phases of Mo 2 C and the fcc phase of Mo 2 N have been prepared and characterized. Mo 2 C (hcp) was produced by carburization of metallic Mo. The resulting material is polycrystalline. has a BET surface area of 10–30 m 2/g. and pores 30 Å in diameter. Mo 2 N (fcc) is obtained by NH 3 reduction of MoO 3. The nitride has a high degree of crystallinity. a BET surface area of about 180 m 2/g. and pores about 17 Å in diameter. The fcc phase of Mo 2 C is produced by exposing Mo 2 N to a CH 4 H 2 mixture. This results in a substitution of C for N atoms in the lattice without major changes in the BET area or pore diameter. The preparation of both Mo 2 C (hcp) and Mo 2 C (fcc) is accompanied by the deposition of free carbon.

Inc.,The addition of simple inorganic salts to aqueous enzyme solutions prior to lyophilization results in a dramatic activation of the dried powder in organic media relative to enzyme with no added salt. Activation of both the serine protease subtilisin Carlsberg and lipase from Mucor javanicus resulting from lyophilization in the presence of KCl was highly sensitive to the lyophilization time and water content of the sample. Specifically. for a preparation containing 98% (w/w) KCl. 1% (w/w) phosphate buffer. and 1% (w/w) enzyme. varying the lyophilization time showed a direct correlation between water content and activity up to an optimum. beyond which the activity decreased with increasing lyophilization time.

To date. the scientific basis for the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of most manufactured nanomaterials are not understood. The mechanisms underlying the toxicity of nanomaterials have recently been studied intensively. An important mechanism of nanotoxicity is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overproduction of ROS can induce oxidative stress. resulting in cells failing to maintain normal physiological redox-regulated functions. This in turn leads to DNA damage. unregulated cell signaling. change in cell motility. cytotoxicity. apoptosis. and cancer initiation.

Using in situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and quasi in situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a transmission electron microscope. we show that there is a substantial amount of residual oxygen in nanostructured. oxide-derived copper electrocatalysts but no residual copper oxide.

The tetrahedral symmetry of the ice structure removes the p-character from the 4a1 level. leading to very weak intensity in the pre-edge region. Breaking an accepting H-bond has very little effect on the absorption spectrum. A broken donating H-bond. however. is identified through a strong pre-edge feature in XAS.

The force-matching in the MS−CG methodology is accomplished with an explicit separation of bonded and nonbonded forces. While the nonbonded forces are adopted from this force-matching approach. the bonded forces are obtained from fitting the statistical configurational data from the atomistic simulations.

The photon emissions at each light cone are elliptically polarized. with the major axis locked to the direction of exciton velocity. and helicity specified by the valley indices of the electron and the hole. These finite-velocity light cones allow unprecedented possibilities for optically injecting valley polarization and valley current. and the observation of both direct and inverse valley Hall effects. by exciting interlayer excitons. Our findings suggest potential excitonic circuits with valley functionalities. and unique opportunities to study exciton dynamics and condensation phenomena in semiconducting 2D heterostructures.,True,ZUARbxYAAAAJ:dhZ1Wuf5EGsC,145,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.187002,17081306739895871027,/scholar?cites=17081306739895871027,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01215,0,0,0

Surface properties. such as the number density profile. the orientational ordering. and surface tension. were calculated. Both CG site and electron number density profiles show that. for the ionic liquids with a long enough alkyl chain. a unique multilayer ordering occurs. In contrast. ionic liquids with a shorter chain exhibit an interfacial structure consistent with a monolayer ordering. Detailed analysis indicates that such mono/multilayer ordering results from the strong electrostatic interactions among the polar groups. and the collective short-range interactions among the nonpolar groups.

In this work. we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to show that. when the nonpolar cationic side chain is sufficiently long. due to the stronger van der Waals interactions between the side chains. the structure of ionic liquids goes through a transition from spatially heterogeneous to liquid crystalline-like. For XMIm+/NO3– ionic liquids. change occurs when the number of carbon groups on the cationic side chain varies from 14 to 16.

The EF-CG method determines effective pairwise forces between coarse-grained sites by averaging over the atomistic forces between the corresponding atomic groups in configurations sampled from equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The EF-CG method extracts the transferable part of the MS-CG force field at the cost of reduced accuracy in reproducing certain structural properties. Therefore. the EF-CG method provides an alternative to the MS-CG approach for determining CG force fields that give improved transferability but reduced structural accuracy. The EF-CG method is especially suitable for coarse-graining large molecules with high symmetry. such as bulky organic molecules. and for studying complex phenomena across a …,True,ZUARbxYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,105,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2009/cp/b819182d,18257797408739403508,/scholar?cites=18257797408739403508,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanting_Wang2/publication/24194957_Effective_force_coarse-graining/links/004635354f4dbeaf7b000000/Effective-force-coarse-graining.pdf,0,0,0

Conventional methods for activated carbon (AC) synthesis offer limited control of their surface area and porosity. which results in a typical specific capacitance of 70–120 F g−1 in commercial EDLCs based on organic electrolytes and ionic liquids (ILs). Additionally. typical ACs produced from natural precursors suffer from the significant variation of their properties. which is detrimental for EDLC use in automotive applications. A novel method for AC synthesis for EDLCs is proposed. This method is based on direct activation of synthetic polymers.

The porosity covered ranges from microporous to mesoporous and macroporous carbons. Two modes of templating. using so-called hard and soft templates. are covered. In particular. for hard templating. zeolite templating generates microporous carbons. mesoporous silicates yield mesoporous carbons. while colloidal particles are replicated to large mesoporous and macroporous carbons. Soft-templating. a more recent phenomenon. mainly generates mesoporous carbons. The full range of pore sizes can therefore now be accessed using hard and soft templates to generate highly ordered nanoscale carbons with well-defined and optimised textural properties.

The carbon materials. irrespective of whether they were doped or not. exhibited high surface area (1900−3700 m2/g) and pore volume (0.99 and 1.88 cm3/g). a micropore surface area of 1500−2800 m2/g. and a micropore volume of 0.65−1.24 cm3/g.

N2 sorption studies. and elemental analysis. The incorporation of Al markedly improved the hydrothermal stability of the aluminosilicate materials compared to their pure silica analogue. The improvement in hydrothermal stability was found to be dependent on the Al content. Small amounts of Al (Si/Al = 40.1) afforded much better protection of the mesoporous structure than larger amounts (S/Al = 8.5). A material with an intermediate amount of Al (Si/Al = 23.1) exhibited intermediate stability. The presence of Al in the MCM-41 framework. rather than as extraneous species. was found to be essential in the improvement of hydrothermal stability.

Si and Al are incorporated into the mesoporous framework in proportions dependent on the gel Si/Al ratio. Calcination of the as-synthesised material to remove the occluded amine generates Brønsted acid sites which (depending on Si/Al ratio) are stronger or comparable in strength to those on zeolite-HY (Si/Al=3.65) but weaker than those on ultrastable-Y zeolite (USY).

The “hard template carbonization technique” consists of liquid impregnation of furfuryl alcohol into the pores of the ZIF followed by polymerization and then carbonization during which the ZIF template is removed to generate the microporous carbon (90–95% microporosity) with a surface area of 900–1100 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of ca. 0.7 cm3 g−1. Chemical activation (with KOH at a relatively low temperature of 700 °C for 1 h and a carbon/KOH weight ratio of 1 : 4) of the ZIF-templated carbons increases their porosity by between 30 and 240% depending on their carbonization temperature. to achieve a surface area of up to 3200 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 1.94 cm3 g−1.

The synthesis process involved the assembly of precursor zeolite species. containing ZSM-5 units at various stages of crystallisation. into a mesostructured material. By varying the time allowed for the crystallisation of the precursor zeolite species (between 2 and 8 hours) it was possible to modify the composition of the composite materials (i.e.. zeolite/MCM-48 ratio). Furthermore. it was possible to obtain relatively pure forms of both end members (ZSM-5 and MCM-48) from the precursor zeolite species after appropriate aging.

The metal oxides are fabricated from alkoxide precursors within the pore channels of the carbon templates. Remarkably. only one infiltration cycle was required to introduce (metal alkoxide) molecular precursors into the pores of the carbon templates. Removal of the carbon by calcination (at 500–600 °C) results in porous metal oxides with predominantly hollow sphere morphology. thus demonstrating the replication of the hollow sphere morphology from carbon to metal oxide.

We have studied the influence of synthesis conditions and subsequent treatments of this hybrid electrode under oxygen in order to optimize its performance as a lithium‐insertion cathode. The temperature and duration of this treatment are key parameters in determining the final specific charge of the cathode. The optimal material yielded a specific charge as high as 302 Ah/kg measured at a low discharge rate (C/48) corresponding to the insertion of 2.72 lithium ions per formula unit.

1101389,A unified approach to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,2008,John R Lombardi and Ronald L Birke,112,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,14,5605-5617,American Chemical Society,We present a unified expression for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The expression contains a product of three resonance denominators. representing the surface plasmon resonance. the metal−molecule charge-transfer resonance at the Fermi energy. and an allowed molecular resonance. This latter resonance is that from which intensity is borrowed for charge transfer. and when the molecular resonance is active it is responsible for surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy. We examine this expression in various limits. to explore the relative contribution or each resonance. First. we look at the situation in which only the surface plasmon resonance is active and examine the various contributions to the Raman signal. including the surface selection rules. Then we examine additional contributions from charge-transfer or molecular resonances.

1101390,A unified view of surface-enhanced Raman scattering,2009,John R Lombardi and Ronald L Birke,42,,6,734-742,American Chemical Society,  In the late 1970s. signal intensity in Raman spectroscopy was found to be enormously enhanced. by a factor of 106 and more recently by as much as 1014. when an analyte was placed in the vicinity of a metal nanoparticle (particularly Ag). The underlying source of this huge increase in signal in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy has since been characterized by considerable controversy. Three possible contributions to the enhancement factor have been identified: (i) the surface plasmon resonance in the metal nanoparticle. (ii) a charge-transfer resonance involving transfer of electrons between the molecule and the conduction band of the metal. and (iii) resonances within the molecule itself. These three components are often treated as independently contributing to the overall effect. with the implication that by properly choosing the experimental parameters. one or more can be ignored …,True,-YCgDZ4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,580,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar800249y,9819201879516939030,/scholar?cites=9819201879516939030,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronald_Birke/publication/284841671_Surface_Enhanced_Raman_Spectroscopy/links/5aaaf7980f7e9b882671270b/Surface-Enhanced-Raman-Spectroscopy.pdf,0,0,0

The economic push for dyes with high tinting strength. directly related to high extinction coefficients in the visible range. historically led to the selection of substances that could be used at low concentrations. But a desirable property for the colorist is a major problem for the analytical chemist; the identification of dyes in cultural heritage objects is extremely difficult. Techniques routinely used in the identification of inorganic pigments are generally not applicable to dyes: X-ray fluorescence because of the lack of an elemental signature.

Using monochromatic light of different laser wavelengths to irradiate an initial solution of seed crystals. the size and shape of the products can be controlled.

The stoicheiometry of the complex at the point of maximum light scattering was calculated. yielding a molar ratio. tannin/BSA. of 7:1. Increase in ionic strength by NaCl addition decreased the amount of protein/tannin aggregates. suggesting that hydrophilic forces are the main driving forces in the complexation between BSA and condensed tannins. The influence of the following carbohydrate concentration on the interactions of BSA with procyanidin compounds was assayed using nephelometry: dextran. glucose. arabinogalactan. β-cyclodextrin. pectin. gum arabic. polygalacturonic acid and xanthan.

Further characterization by ESI/MS and NMR (1H. gCOSY) showed them to belong to a new class of pigments described here for the first time. the structure of which consisted of a pyranoanthocyanin moiety linked to a flavanol by a vinyl bridge. The extended conjugation of the π electrons throughout all the pigment molecule is likely to confer a higher stability on it and is probably the origin of the intense blue color. The formation of these pigments was found to arise from the reaction between anthocyanin−pyruvic acid adducts and vinyl−flavanol adducts.

The procyanidin fraction's abilities to inhibit lipid peroxidation induced by 2.2‘-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide dihydrochloride in a liposomal membrane system were examined. The antioxidant capacities of all fractions were evaluated through monitoring oxygen consumption and by measuring the formation of conjugated dienes. All tested fractions provided protection of membranes against peroxyl radicals by increasing the induction time of oxidation. This effect increased up to fraction II but decreased with the increase of the structural complexity of further procyanidin fractions. possibly due to steric hindrance effects exhibited by the more complex fractions.

The degradation rate constants of the anthocyanin−pyruvic acid adducts were much lower than those of the anthocyanidin monoglucosides. The results of both anthocyanins and pyruvic acid adducts show that acylation on the sugar moiety of all the pigments decreased their stability in wine.

1101439,Inhibition of α-amylase activity by condensed tannins,2011,Rui Gonçalves and Nuno Mateus and Victor De Freitas,125,Food Chemistry,2,665-672,Elsevier,The ability of grape seed procyanidins to inhibit α-amylase activity was studied using a colorimetric method. This ability was found to be related with the average degree of polymerisation of the tested procyanidins. These interactions were further evaluated by fluorescence quenching. dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nephelometry. in order to understand the mechanisms by which they occur. A relationship between aggregate formation and enzymatic inhibition was observed. The interaction between procyanidins and enzyme involves a specific interaction as inferred from the calculated apparent bimolecular quenching constant in the fluorescence assays. Further experiments involved the determination of the effect of carbohydrates on the enzymatic inhibition observed. It was shown that pectin and arabic gum inhibited the formation of insoluble aggregates but were unable to restore fluorescence and activity to the …,True,f5u3Y9AAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,129,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814610011581,6702182082149489216,/scholar?cites=6702182082149489216,,,0,0,0

Nature has evolved a number of metalloenzymes such as the heme-containing cytochrome P450 and the nonheme methane monooxygenase. which are capable of effecting such transformations. There has thus been significant interest in modeling such enzyme active sites and developing biomimetic alkane hydroxylation catalysts. In this review. the efforts of the last 10 years in the development of nonheme iron catalysts are summarized and discussed. These catalysts typically act in concert with ROOH or H2O2. With ROOH as oxidant. it is clear from mechanistic studies that alkoxyl radicals are the principal agents that cleave the alkane CH bond to generate long-lived alkyl radicals. This conclusion. for the most part. applies also for oxidations involving H2O2.

In addition. however. when working in highly dipolar solvents like NMP and in the absence of strong ligands. unsaturatedstannanes react with Cul to yield presumably an organocopper species. which then transmetalates to Pd (II).

1101492,Arsenic round the world: a review,2002,Badal Kumar Mandal and Kazuo T Suzuki,58,,1,201-235,Elsevier,This review deals with environmental origin. occurrence. episodes. and impact on human health of arsenic. Arsenic. a metalloid occurs naturally. being the 20th most abundant element in the earth's crust. and is a component of more than 245 minerals. These are mostly ores containing sulfide. along with copper. nickel. lead. cobalt. or other metals. Arsenic and its compounds are mobile in the environment. Weathering of rocks converts arsenic sulfides to arsenic trioxide. which enters the arsenic cycle as dust or by dissolution in rain. rivers. or groundwater. So. groundwater contamination by arsenic is a serious threat to mankind all over the world. It can also enter food chain causing wide spread distribution throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. However. fish. fruits. and vegetables primarily contain organic arsenic. less than 10% of the arsenic in these foods exists in the inorganic form. although the arsenic …,True,CMeMgrIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3720,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914002002680,18148551146413342892,/scholar?cites=18148551146413342892,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.530.2444&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Sci,5,1-7,,Natural polymers such as proteins and polysaccharides though very useful exhibit a limitation in their reactivity and process ability. These shortcomings were overcome by chemical and physical alteration of natural polymers. Among various investigations. the interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) for hydro gels have attracted much attention. It is a combination of at least two polymer chains each in network form. of which at least one is synthesized and/or cross linked in the immediate presence of the other without any covalent bonds between them. Water absorption and desorption properties of these IPN hydro gels were analyzed extensively. The water imbibing property of IPN is responsive not only to the chemical architecture of the macromolecular matrices. but also to the surrounding conditions such as pH. temperature. ionic strength. magnetic field. ultraviolet light. etc. These systems which are also termed as ‘hungry networks’ or ‘intelligent polymers’ are currently the focus of considerable scientific research due to their potential technological application in a large number of areas: medicine. industry. biology and environmental clean-up. Some of the significant applications of IPNs include artificial implants. dialysis membranes. drug-delivery systems. burndressings. etc. This review disserts about application and properties of IPN have enabled this polymer to become the choice of the pharmacologist as oral drug delivery matrices and other applications.,True,CMeMgrIAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,80,https://www.academia.edu/download/51289681/C-rev-IPN.pdf,6187509621067162292,/scholar?cites=6187509621067162292,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51289681/C-rev-IPN.pdf,0,0,0

Two different approaches were utilized. In the first. the electro-initiated polymerization of indene on a platinum electrode was achieved at 2.0 V versus Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile. Then the polyindene-coated electrode was used for the electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole at 1.0 V versus Ag/Ag+. In the second case. electrochemical coating of platinum electrode with polypyrrole at 1.0 V versus Ag/Ag+ was carried out and indene was polymerized on the conducting polymer at 2.0 V versus Ag/ Ag+ in acetonitrile medium. The characterizations of these composites were done by FT-IR. scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).

An initiation mechanism involving electron transfer from photochemically generated onium radical cations to thiophene was proposed. N‐Ethoxy‐2‐methylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate and triphenylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate were also found to be effective in facilitating the polymerization of thiophene. Polymerization is accompanied with the film formation on the surface of the reaction tube. The photochemically obtained polymers were characterized by FT‐IR. DSC. and SEM analyses and compared with those obtained by oxidative and electrochemical means. Electrical conductivities of the samples were measured by four‐probe technique.

To exploit this potential. they must remain luminescent and stably dispersed in water and biological fluids over a wide range of pH and salt concentration. There have been many challenges in creating such stable water-dispersible Si QDs. including instability of photoluminescence due their fast oxidation in aqueous environments and the difficulty of attaching hydrophilic molecules to Si QD surfaces. In this paper. we report the preparation of highly stable aqueous suspensions of Si QDs using phospholipid micelles. in which the optical properties of Si nanocrystals are retained.

Transferrin (Tf) was conjugated to the polyelectrolyte-coated nanorods for targeted in vitro delivery to cancer cells. Dark-field imaging was used to confirm the receptor-mediated uptake of nanorods into HeLa cells. which is known to overexpress the transferrin receptor (TfR). Minimal uptake was observed with untargeted nanorods. Electron microscopy was used to confirm that the intracellular uptake of the nanorods predominantly occurred via the Tf−TfR interaction and the nanorods localized in vesicular structures such as endosomes. ,True,5ZIy9fsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,241,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0733419,12208931681896254611,/scholar?cites=12208931681896254611,,,0,0,0

The shift in the localized longitudinal plasmon resonance peak of gold nanorods (GNRs) was used to show their interaction with siRNA. Plasmonic enhanced dark field imaging was used to visualize the uptake of these nanoplexes in dopaminergic neurons in vitro. Gene silencing of the nanoplexes in these cells was evidenced by the reduction in the expression of key proteins (DARPP-32. ERK. and PP-1) belonging to this pathway. with no observed cytotoxicity.

It is directed as much towards senior undergraduate and postgraduate students in universities as it is towards the practitioners of the art of colloid stabilization working in industry. The text has also been written with the needs of biologists. especially biochemists and physiologists. in mind because the stability of so many natural systems is influenced by macromolecules. No prior knowledge of colloid or polymer science is assumed. All the relevant modern theories (and there has been a dramatic proliferation of these) are developed ab initio as required.

This short communication is an attempt (by an international group of polymer chemists meeting under the auspices of the IUPAC Working Party on “Modeling of Free Radical Polymerization Kinetics and Processing”) to initiate a solution to this problem by seeing if agreement exists on the values of some fundamental kinetic parameters for simple monomers. determined using quite different experimental techniques (eg. comparing bulk …,True,knasz0sAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,185,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pol.1988.140260704,109164709275382299,/scholar?cites=109164709275382299,,,0,0,0

Inc.,The kinetics of the emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate at 50°C have been studied in seeded systems using both chemical initiation and γ‐radiolysis initiation. Both steady‐state rates and (for γ‐radiolysis) the relaxation from the steady state were observed. The average number of free radicals per particle was quite high (e.g.. ∼0.7 for 10−3 mol dm−3 S2O28 initiator). The data are quantitatively interpreted using a generalized Smith–Ewart–Harkins model. allowing for free radical entry. exit. biomolecular termination within the latex particles. and aqueous phase hetero‐termination and re‐entry.

It was found that when a steric stabilizing barrier was supplemented by an electrostatic barrier. no change in the incipient flocculation point was evident at high ionic strengths. Dispersions sterically stabilized by commercial Pluronic nonionic surfactants. which are based on poly(ethylene oxide). exhibited incipient flocculation behavior similar to model dispersions stabilized by poly (ethylene) oxide. It is shown that dispersions which undergo flocculation on heating must be enthalpically stabilized. at least immediately below the incipient flocculation temperature; conversely. those that flocculate on cooling are entropically stabilized. at least just above the critical flocculation temperature (c.f.t.).

Flocculation occurs in dispersion media which are of better solvency for the stabilizing moieties. in free solution. than the corresponding theta-solvents.

At this critical wp. the two free radicals formed from initiator decomposition are immobilized by propagation faster than they can diffuse apart; consequently. their likely fate is to become trapped in close proximity to each other and undergo geminate recombination. A quantitative theory for the onset of this phenomenon is derived. This effect explains why some bulk polymerizations are extremely slow at high conversions while the corresponding emulsion polymerizations are not; further. it removes apparent discrepancies between kp values directly measured from ESR in emulsion polymerizations and those estimated from bulk kinetics.

No comparable theory for steric stabilization exists. although some general principles which appear to govern this type of stabilization have been delineated.

For these enthalpically stabilized dispersions. the flocculation potency of an electrolyte is determined by its ability to convert water into a theta-solvent for the stabilizing moieties. The order of decreasing flocculation effectiveness for the anions studied (SO4= > Cl− > NO3− > CNS− > Br− > I−) parallels that of the Hofmeister series. The order for cations (Rb+ = K+ = Na+ = Cs+ > NH4+ = Sr++ > Li+ = Ca++ = Ba++ = Mg++) is in direct conflict with the postulate that the more highly hydrated ions are the more effective flocculants.

The PNIPAM chains collapsed to a minimum size in the water-rich region and then reswelled on further addition of the alcohol. Both collapse and reswelling were reversible. The collapse of the higher molecular weight PNIPAM chains with narrower polydispersity was found to proceed almost to completion and to be relatively sharp prior to the attainment of θ conditions.
