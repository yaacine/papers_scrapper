We report the implementation of a genotyping and validation algorithm that enables robust tumor mutation profiling in the clinical setting.  Methodology We developed and implemented an optimized mutation profiling platform (“OncoMap”) to interrogate ∼400 mutations in 33 known oncogenes and tumor suppressors. many of which are known to predict response or resistance to targeted therapies. The performance of OncoMap was analyzed using DNA derived from both frozen and FFPE clinical material in a diverse set of cancer types. A subsequent in-depth analysis was conducted on histologically and clinically annotated pediatric gliomas. The sensitivity and specificity of OncoMap were 93.8% and 100% in fresh frozen tissue; and 89.3% and 99.4% in FFPE-derived DNA. We detected known mutations at the expected frequencies in common cancers. as well as novel mutations in adult and pediatric cancers that are likely to predict heightened response or resistance to existing or developmental cancer therapies. OncoMap profiles also support a new molecular stratification of pediatric low-grade gliomas based on BRAF mutations that may have immediate clinical impact.

Globin gene expression within cultured mouse erythroleukemia cells is highly dependent on NF-E2. To examine the requirement for this factor in vivo. we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to generate mice lacking the hematopoietic-specific subunit. p45 NF-E2. The most dramatic aspect of the homozygous mutant mice was an absence of circulating platelets. which led to the death of most animals due to hemorrhage. In contrast. the effect of loss of NF-E2 on the erythroid lineage was surprisingly mild. Although neonates exhibited severe anemia and dysmorphic red-cell changes. probably compounded by concomitant bleeding. surviving adults exhibited only mild …,True,yh-VN8sAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,249,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/19/8690.short,7287928598950855327,/scholar?cites=7287928598950855327,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/92/19/8690.full.pdf,0,0,0

To define the mechanisms governing its transcriptional regulation. we replaced upstream sequences including a DNase I hypersensitive (HS) region with a neomycin-resistance cassette by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells and generated mice either harboring this mutation (neoΔHS) or lacking the selection cassette (ΔneoΔHS). Studies of the consequences of these targeted mutations provide novel insights into GATA-1 function in erythroid cells. First. the neoΔHS mutation leads to a marked impairment in the rate or efficiency of erythroid cell maturation due to a modest (4- to 5-fold) decrease in GATA-1 expression.

Platelet packaging and release concludes at the tips of each proplatelet. Essential in this process is the distribution of organelles and platelet-specific granules into the nascent platelets. To investigate the mechanism of delivery of organelles into putative platelets. the distribution and dynamics of organelles/granules was monitored. Individual organelles are sent from the cell body to the proplatelets where they move bidirectionally until they are captured at proplatelet ends.

Through preserving neuromuscular synapses. increasing neuronal Mfn2 prevents skeletal muscle wasting in both SOD1G93A and aged mice. whereas deletion of neuronal Mfn2 produces neuromuscular synaptic dysfunction and skeletal muscle atrophy. Neuromuscular synaptic loss after sciatic nerve transection can also be alleviated by Mfn2.

1162357,The bHLH transcription factors OLIG2 and OLIG1 couple neuronal and glial subtype specification,2002,Qiao Zhou and David J Anderson,109,Cell,1,61-73,Cell Press,OLIG1 and OLIG2 are basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors expressed in the pMN domain of the spinal cord. which sequentially generates motoneurons and oligodendrocytes. In Olig1/2 double-mutant mice. motoneurons are largely eliminated. and oligodendrocyte differentiation is abolished. Lineage tracing data suggest that Olig1−/−2−/− pMN progenitors instead generate V2 interneurons and then astrocytes. This apparent conversion likely reflects independent roles for OLIG1/2 in specifying motoneuron and oligodendrocyte fates. Olig genes therefore couple neuronal and glial subtype specification. unlike proneural bHLH factors that control the neuron versus glia decision. Our results suggest that in the spinal cord.

We have identified two bHLH factors.

Expression of Oligo2 in the spinal cord precedes that of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). the earliest known marker of oligodendrocyte precursors. by several days. Ectopic expression of Oligo2 in vivo causes ectopic expression of Sox10. an HMG-box transcription factor expressed in oligodendrocyte and other glial precursors.

Just prior to oligo-dendrocyte precursor formation. the domains of Olig2 and Nkx2.2 expression switch from being mutually exclusive to overlapping. and Neurogenins1 and 2 are extinguished within this region. Coexpression of Olig2 with Nkx2.2 in the spinal cord promotes ectopic and precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation. Both proteins function as transcriptional repressors in this assay. This effect is blocked by forced expression of Neurogenin1. By contrast. misexpression of Olig2 alone derepresses Neurogenins and promotes motoneuron differentiation. Olig2 therefore functions sequentially in motoneuron and oligodendrocyte fate specification.

A major challenge of lineage conversion is to generate specific cell subtypes. The pancreatic islets contain three major hormone-secreting endocrine subtypes: insulin+ β-cells. glucagon+ α-cells. and somatostatin+ δ-cells. We previously reported that a combination of three transcription factors. Ngn3. Mafa. and Pdx1. directly reprograms pancreatic acinar cells to β-cells. We now show that acinar cells can be converted to δ-like and α-like cells by Ngn3 and Ngn3+Mafa respectively. Thus. three major islet endocrine subtypes can be derived by acinar reprogramming. Ngn3 promotes establishment of a generic endocrine state in acinar cells. and also promotes δ-specification in the absence of other factors. δ-specification is in turn suppressed by Mafa and Pdx1 during α- and β-cell induction.

We find that cell spreading. proliferation. and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are all enhanced in cells cultured in gels with faster relaxation. Strikingly. MSCs form a mineralized. collagen-1-rich matrix similar to bone in rapidly relaxing hydrogels with an initial elastic modulus of 17 kPa.

Thus. the creation of a polarized epithelial interface accessible from apical or basolateral side is critical. Here. we demonstrated the generation of an intestinal epithelial monolayer using canine biopsy-derived colonic organoids (colonoids). We optimized the culture condition to form an intact monolayer of the canine colonic epithelium on a nanoporous membrane insert using the canine colonoids over 14 days. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed a physiological brush border interface covered by the microvilli with glycocalyx. as well as the presence of mucin granules. tight junctions. and desmosomes. The population of stem cells as well as differentiated lineage-dependent epithelial cells were verified by immunofluorescence staining and RNA in situ hybridization. The polarized expression of P-glycoprotein efflux pump was confirmed at the apical membrane. Also. the epithelial monolayer formed tight- and adherence-junctional barrier within 4 days. where the transepithelial electrical resistance and apparent permeability were inversely correlated.

The biopsy-derived intestinal organoids provide genetic information of patients with physiological cytodifferentiation. However. the enclosed lumen and static culture condition substantially limit the utility of patient-derived organoids for microbiome-associated disease modeling. Here. we report a patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) physiodynamic mucosal interface-on-a-chip (PMI Chip) that provides a microphysiological intestinal milieu under defined biomechanics. The real-time imaging and computational simulation of the PMI Chip verified the recapitulation of non-linear luminal and microvascular flow that simulates the hydrodynamics in a living human gut. The multiaxial deformations in a convoluted microchannel not only induced dynamic cell strains but also enhanced particle mixing in the lumen microchannel. Under this physiodynamic condition. an organoid-derived epithelium obtained from the patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. ulcerative colitis. or colorectal cancer independently formed 3D epithelial layers with disease-specific differentiations. Moreover. co-culture with the human fecal microbiome in an anoxic–oxic interface resulted in the formation of stochastic microcolonies without a loss of epithelial barrier function.

1162459,Tissue Engineering Strategies for Intervertebral Disc Treatment Using Functional polymers,2019,Y. Choi and M. H. Park and K. Lee,11,Polymers,5,871,,Intervertebral disc (IVD) is the fibrocartilage between the vertebrae. allowing the spine to move steadily by bearing multidirectional complex loads. Aging or injury usually causes degeneration of IVD. which is one of the main reasons for low back pain prevalent worldwide and reduced quality of life. While various treatment strategies for degenerative IVD have been studied using in vitro studies. animal experiments. and clinical trials. there are unsolved limitations for endogenous regeneration of degenerative IVD. In this respect. several tissue engineering strategies that are based on the cell and scaffolds have been extensively researched with positive outcomes for regeneration of IVD tissues. Scaffolds made of functional polymers and their diverse forms mimicking the macro-and micro-structure of native IVD enhance the biological and mechanical properties of the scaffolds for IVD regeneration. In this review. we discuss diverse morphological and functional polymers and tissue engineering strategies for endogenous regeneration of degenerative IVD. Tissue engineering strategies using functional polymers are promising therapeutics for fundamental and endogenous regeneration of degenerative IVD.

These animal models should have direct biological and translational relevance to the underlying disease they are supposed to mimic. Aging dogs not only naturally develop a cognitive decline in many aspects including learning and memory deficits. but they also exhibit human-like individual variability in the aging process. Neurodegenerative processes that can be observed in both human and canine brains include the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) found as diffuse plaques in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). including the gyrus proreus (i.e.. medial orbital PFC). as well as the hippocampus and the cerebral vasculature. Tau pathology. a marker of neurodegeneration and dementia progression. was also found in canine hippocampal synapses. Various epidemiological data show that human patients with neurodegenerative diseases have concurrent intestinal lesions. and histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs decades before neurodegenerative changes. Gut microbiome alterations have also been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. as well as inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

Some prophages carry additional genes that may enhance the toxicity and survival ability of their host bacteria. This phenomenon is predominant in Staphylococcus aureus. a very common human pathogen. Bioinformatics analysis of several staphylococcal prophages revealed a highly conserved 40-bp untranslated region upstream of the int gene. A small transcript encoding phage integrase was identified to be initiated from the region. demonstrating that the untranslated region contained a promoter for int. No typical recognition sequence for either σA or σB was identified in the 40-bp region. Experiments both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that σH recognized the promoter and directed transcription. Genetic deletion of sigH altered the int expression. and subsequently. the excision proportion of prophage DNAs. Phage assays further showed that sigH affected the ability of spontaneous lysis and lysogenization in S. aureus. suggesting that sigH plays a role in stabilizing the lysogenic state.

Previous studies on BoNTs have generally utilized the major SNARE homologues expressed in brain (VAMP2. syntaxin 1. and SNAP-25). However. BoNTs target peripheral motor neurons and cause death by paralyzing respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm. Here we report that VAMP1. but not VAMP2. is the SNARE homologue predominantly expressed in adult rodent diaphragm motor nerve terminals and in differentiated human motor neurons. In contrast to the highly conserved VAMP2. BoNT-resistant variations in VAMP1 are widespread across vertebrates. In particular. we identified a polymorphism at position 48 of VAMP1 in rats. which renders VAMP1 either resistant (I48) or sensitive (M48) to BoNT/D. Taking advantage of this finding. we showed that rat diaphragms with I48 in VAMP1 are insensitive to BoNT/D compared to rat diaphragms with M48 in VAMP1. This unique intra-species comparison establishes VAMP1 as a physiological toxin target in diaphragm motor nerve terminals. and demonstrates that the resistance of VAMP1 to BoNTs can underlie the insensitivity of a species to members of BoNTs. Consistently. human VAMP1 contains I48. which may explain why humans are insensitive to BoNT/D.

In Bacillus subtilis. a model Gram-positive organism. the DNA binding activity of CtsR is regulated by McsAB-mediated phosphorylation of the protein where phosphorylated CtsR is a substrate for degradation by the ClpCP complex. Surprisingly. the mcsAB genes are absent from many Gram-positive bacteria. including streptococci; therefore. how CtsR activity is modulated in those bacteria remains unknown. Here we show that the posttranslational modulation of CtsR activity is different in Streptococcus mutans. a dental pathogen. We observed that of all of the Clp-related proteins. only ClpL is involved in the degradation of CtsR. Neither ClpP nor ClpC had any effect on the degradation of CtsR.

TcdB can be divided into multiple subtypes/variants based on their sequence variations. of which four (TcdB1-4) are dominant types found in major epidemic isolates. Here. we find that these variants are highly diverse in their receptor preference: TcdB1 uses two known receptors CSPG4 and Frizzled (FZD) proteins. TcdB2 selectively uses CSPG4. TcdB3 prefers to use FZDs. whereas TcdB4 uses neither CSPG4 nor FZDs. By creating chimeric toxins and systematically switching residues between TcdB1 and TcdB3. we determine that regions in the N-terminal cysteine protease domain (CPD) are involved in CSPG4-recognition. We further evaluate the pathological effects induced by TcdB1-4 with a mouse intrarectal installation model. TcdB1 leads to the most severe overall symptoms. followed by TcdB2 and TcdB3. When comparing the TcdB2 and TcdB3. TcdB2 causes stronger oedema while TcdB3 induces severer inflammatory cell infiltration.

TcdB is known to utilize frizzled-1. 2. 7 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4) as protein receptors. By using human cervical cancer cell line HeLa CSPG4 knockout (CSPG4−/−) cells as well as TcdB mutants which do not bind to either CSPG4 or frizzled-1. 2. 7. or both. we evaluated the impact of the individual receptors for cytopathic and cytotoxic effects of TcdB. We compared TcdB from the reference strain VPI10463 (TcdB VPI) and the endemic strain R20291 (TcdB R20) which does not interact with frizzled-1. 2. 7. TcdB VPI devoid of CSPG4 binding (TcdB VPI ΔCROP) shows identical cytopathic potency as full-length TcdB in HeLa CSPG4−/− cells. indicating that interaction with frizzled proteins is not affected in the presence of the C-terminal CROP domain. We validated CSPG4 as cellular receptor for both TcdB toxinotypes in HeLa and HEp-2 cells. By exchange of a single phenylalanine residue. 1597 with serine. we generated a mutated TcdB VPI variant (TcdB VPI F1597S) that in accordance with TcdB R20 lacks binding to frizzled-1. 2. 7 and showed identical potency as TcdB R20 on HeLa cells. This enabled us to estimate the respective share of CSPG4 and frizzled-1. 2. 7 in the cytotoxic and cytopathic effect induced by TcdB. Our data reveal that binding to frizzled-1. 2. 7 and to CSPG4 occurs independently and in an additive manner.

Effective 35 therapeutic targets for BRCA1-deficient BLBC remain lacking. By utilizing a BRCA1-deficient 36 BLBC mouse model based on intraductal injection of Krt8-Cre adenovirus to inactivate Brca1 37 and Trp53 in luminal mammary epithelial cells. here we report that the Wnt receptor Frizzled 7 38 (FZD7) serves as a biomarker and therapeutic target in the resulting mammary tumor cells and is 39 particularly enriched in cancer stem cells/tumor-initiating cells (CSCs/TICs). Inhibiting FZD7-40 mediated Wnt signaling using a nontoxic FZD-binding fragment of C. difficile toxin B (TcdBFBD) 41 attenuates growth of BRCA1-deficient tumor organoids and xenografted tumors. without 42 damaging Wnt-sensitive tissues such as bones in vivo. Finally. FZD1/2/7-positive cells are 43 enriched in chemotherapy-resistant cells in both BLBC and luminal breast tumors treated with 44 cisplatin. and TcdBFBD synergizes strongly with cisplatin in inhibiting both tumor types.

Using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. we found that ELIC. a pLGIC from Erwinia chrysanthemi. expanded the extracellular end and contracted the intracellular end of its pore during transition from the resting to an apparent desensitized state. Importantly. the contraction at the intracellular end of the pore likely forms a gate to restrict ion transport in the desensitized state. This gate differs from the hydrophobic gate present in the resting state. Conformational changes of the TM2-TM3 loop were limited to the N-terminal end. The TM4 helices and the TM3-TM4 loop appeared relatively insensitive to agonist-mediated structural rearrangement.

Using crystallography. site-directed mutagenesis. and two-electrode voltage clamp measurements. we identified two functionally relevant sites in the extracellular (EC) domain of the bacterial pLGIC from Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC). One site is at the C-loop region. where the NQN mutation (D91N. E177Q. and D178N) eliminated inter-subunit salt bridges in the open-channel GLIC structure and thereby shifted the channel activation to a higher agonist concentration. The other site is below the C-loop. where binding of the anesthetic ketamine inhibited GLIC currents in a concentration dependent manner. To understand how a perturbation signal in the EC domain. either resulting from the NQN mutation or ketamine binding. is transduced to the channel gate. we have used the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to determine dynamic responses of the GLIC channel and signaling pathways upon initial perturbations in the EC domain of GLIC. Despite the existence of many possible routes for the initial perturbation signal to reach the channel gate. the PMT model in combination with Yen's algorithm revealed that perturbation signals with the highest probability flow travel either via the β1–β2 loop or through pre-TM1. The β1–β2 loop occurs in either intra- or inter-subunit pathways. while pre-TM1 occurs exclusively in inter-subunit pathways.

To identify compatible structural motifs we use the Erebus webserver. to search the protein data bank (PDB) for user-defined structural scaffolds. To identify potential design mutations we use the Eris webserver. which accurately predicts changes in protein stability resulting from mutations.

1162561,A potential energy surface bifurcation in terpene biosynthesis,2009,Young J Hong and Dean J Tantillo,1,Nature chemistry,5,384-389,Nature Publishing Group,Terpenes comprise a class of natural products that includes molecules with thousands of distinct structurally and stereochemically complex molecular architectures. The core hydrocarbon frameworks of these molecules are constructed via carbocation rearrangements promoted by terpene synthase (cyclase) enzymes. Although many mechanistic details for such reactions have been uncovered. the factors that control which carbocation intermediates and transition-state structures form are not well understood. Here we show that rearrangement pathways that pass through particular transition-state structures can bifurcate after the transition state. The resulting pathways lead to terpenes with distinctly different skeletons from each other. Although these types of bifurcating pathways have been described previously for some small molecules. the possibility that they may have an important role in the production of complex …,True,ZPdDLjQAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,76,https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.287,4208202944835501458,/scholar?cites=4208202944835501458,,,0,0,0

Is it worthwhile to implement policies designed to increase competition in transport markets? Focusing on air transport. this paper quantifies the effects of liberalization of air cargo markets on transport costs. Between 1990 and 2003. the United States implemented a series of Open Skies Agreements. providing a unique opportunity to assess the effect that a change in the competition regime has on prices. In our sample. Open Skies Agreements reduce air transport costs by 9% and increase by 7% the share of imports arriving by air.

1162570,Saving for development: how Latin America and the Caribbean can save more and better,2016,Eduardo Cavallo and Tomás Serebrisky,,,,329,Springer Nature,In discussions about saving in Latin America and the Caribbean. a common critique is that the region saves little. Indeed. the data support this statement: the region saves from 10 to 15 percentage points of GDP less than the most dynamic countries of Emerging Asia. At the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). we know that understanding why this occurs and. above all. how and in what way Latin America saves is crucial for the region’s economic growth and the well-being of its people. That is why we have decided to devote the 2016 edition of our institutional publication Development in the Americas (DIA) to studying this topic and to proposing solutions to address this critical problem. We believe this publication comes at an opportune moment. The engines of economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean following the most recent financial crisis have been gradually weakening. The region can no longer count on a favorable external environment. and so it is time to look for new domestic sources that can drive our economies forward. The standard response to the relative lack of saving in the region is that its impact on growth is low since countries ultimately can turn to external saving to finance the region’s investment needs. We believe that this view ignores a crucial consideration: it is very difficult to attract external capital on favorable conditions if Latin Americans themselves do not save or invest in their countries. Besides. in the current environment. when interest rates in developed nations are rising and capital is no longer abundant. the prescription to turn to external financing as a palliative for our low saving is probably more …,True,yQ3nV4QAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC,86,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28148/1001846.pdf?sequence=1,11772946286750033635,/scholar?cites=11772946286750033635,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28148/1001846.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1162577,Sizing electricity losses in transmission and distribution systems in Latin America and the Caribbean,2014,Raúl Jiménez and Tomás Serebrisky and Jorge Mercado,,Published by Inter-American Development Bank,,,,Electricity loss is a key component in measuring the efficiency and financial sustainability of the power sector. It represents the difference between the amount of electricity that enters the network and the amount that is delivered to end-users. reflecting the degree of productivity of transmission and distribution systems. Losses also include the electricity delivered but not billed. directly translating into financial losses and. to a great extent. representing an indicator of the operational soundness of utilities.Reducing electricity losses could help achieve the goal of universal access to electricity services. Lower electricity losses are associated with greater financial sustainability of utilities. as additional revenues increase cost recovery. enhance the capitalization of the power sector. and improve the sector’s capacity to invest. In addition. lower electricity losses can potentially contribute to reducing air pollution emissions. as well as to decreasing electricity tariffs for consumers.

1162581,An assessment of port reform in Argentina: outcomes and challenges ahead,2005,Tomás Serebrisky* and Lourdes Trujillo,32,Maritime Policy & Management,3,191-207,Taylor & Francis Group,During the 1990s Argentina engaged in a process of restructuring and deregulation of its ports. The main objective of the reform was to increase efficiency and service quality and to reduce the size and role of the public sector in ports. Overall. it was expected to allow the transport sector to adjust its capacity to demand changes and to facilitate international trade while contributing to the reduction of the fiscal burden of this sector.

1162583,Time goes by: recent developments on the theory and practice of the discount rate,2015,Javier Campos and Tomás Serebrisky and Ancor Suárez-Alemán,,"Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank",,,,The concept of a “discount rate” is central to any economic decision involving the use of resources in different periods of time. This is particularly relevant in the evaluation of policies and public investment projects in developing countries by both governments and international institutions. where the social consequences of incorrect or suboptimal decisions may be very significant for its long-term development. Although economic theory suggests that a project’s discount rate should reflect the competitive. risk-adjusted opportunity cost of funding the project. there is no consensus on how to measure this cost. Furthermore. since many countries in Latin America and elsewhere have recently improved their macroeconomic fundamentals. and–subsequently–reduced their costs of accessing to credit. it seems reasonable to review the criteria to determine their required social discount rate (SDR). In fact. during the last decades. the academic debate on this topic has been passionate. but economists have not yet reached a compromise on how to finally close it. This document critically reviews the existing literature from the 1950s to 2015 to categorize the main contributions in this field. to provide an adequate context to the existing controversies and to jump from the theory to real world to see what countries and international institutions are doing with respect to the social discount rate.Approaches to choosing SDR are generally placed into two categories: the descriptive approach and the prescriptive approach. The descriptive approach is often justified on Pareto efficiency grounds. using a description of how society discounts instead of having analysts …,True,yQ3nV4QAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC,28,https://publications.iadb.org/en/bitstream/handle/11319/7206/Time_Goes_By_Recent_Development,11938362348023463660,/scholar?cites=11938362348023463660,,https://publications.iadb.org/en/bitstream/handle/11319/7206/Time_Goes_By_Recent_Development,0,0,0

The need for connecting people and markets is part of national policies in different territories. The existence of remote areas. that is. those that under strict market criteria would not be transport supplied due to lack of commercial profitability. has led to the development of different public policies aimed to support air connectivity in regions where commercial airline operations are not viable. This paper provides a mapping of existing policies applied worldwide to provide air connectivity to remote areas. and critically reviews policies promoting air connectivity. including: 1) route-based policies; 2) passenger-based policies; 3) airline-based policies; and 4) airport-based policies.

In 1985. an important reform was carried out in order to create a new administrative authority to coordinate all public transport modes and establish a single fare for all of them. This reform prompted a huge growth in public transport usage. even though it reduced the funding coverage ratio of the transport system. Since then. Madrid’s public transport system has been undergoing an increasing level of subsidization. which might jeopardize the financial viability of the city public transport system in the future. In this paper. we present a detailed analysis of the evolution of the public transport funding policy in Madrid in recent years. We found that the increasing level of subsidy can hardly be explained on the basis of equity issues.

The United Kingdom began the trend. followed by             other countries adopting new forms of infrastructure             ownership and management. To control infrastructure             licensing and the ""natural monopoly""             characteristics of some airport services. governments             developed regulatory policies for airport systems. The             operation of an airport creates incentives to transfer the             airport's market power to the air transport market. If             the airport market is regulated but the airport operator is             allowed to control at least one airline. those incentives             can give rise to anticompetitive practices aimed at             displacing competing airlines.

1162589,The role of advocacy in competition policy: the case of the argentine gasoline market,2003,Tomás Serebrisky,3130,,,,World Bank Publications,In 2000 the Argentine antitrust authorities conducted a study of the state of competition in the gasoline market. The study concludes with a set of policy recommendations (that is. limits to vertical integration and to the duration of contracts between oil companies and gasoline stations) which were subsequently implemented by the Argentine government. This was one of the rare occasions where the Argentine antitrust authorities exercised its advocacy role in a country that underwent an extensive process of deregulation and privatization. Serebrisky assesses the design and impact of the policies recommended by the Argentine antitrust authorities. In particular. he evaluates under which circumstances the new policies can reduce barriers to entry and foster competition in the Argentine gasoline market.This paper—a product of the Finance and Private Sector Development Division.

Horizontal distribution and abundance of the larvae were determined. The rate of ring formation on the otolith was related to the marginal increments and time of day. The Laird–Gompertz growth model was adjusted to the data and instantaneous growth rates were compared for anchovy larvae of other habitats in the SW Atlantic. Larval growth rates for several stocks were shown to be dependent on environmental conditions and the calculated size at first feeding on the temperature. producing geographical variation of larval growth rate throughout the distribution range of the species.

The abundance of arapaima was found to be positively related to the area and depth of the water column. and hence volume of lakes. Greater depth of water column also was related positively with the abundance and presence of arapaima in connecting channels. The abundance of arapaima was positively related to the connectivity of the lake with other water bodies. The principal reason for arapaima to prefer habitats that are deep. large. and connected to other water bodies appears to be increased survival through lower susceptibility to extreme drought events and increased mobility and availability of food resources.

Mas conservar a pesca brasileira é possível somente através de uma abordagem ao estudo eo manejo pesqueiro diferente daquela usada até hoje. Nas linhas abaixo. eu sugiro que é necessário resolver dois problemas relacionados com a falta de consideração do fator humano e das características da pesca brasileira.Talvez. o problema mais importante é que a maioria da ciência pesqueira é. na verdade. biologia pesqueira. A ciência pesqueira que nos ensinaram. e que hoje em dia ensinamos nas salas de aula. não dá suficiente atenção ao papel do elemento humano. A ciência pesqueira reduziu o elemento humano a conceitos simplistas como. por exemplo.‘esforço’de pesca. entre outros. Dessa forma. os processos sociais que crescentemente ameaçam as populações de peixes foram quase que completamente marginalizados do estudo da pesca. Uma evidência disso é que os três livros mais citados na ciência pesqueira (Walters 1986. Hilborn & Walters 1992. Wootton 1998) enfocam-se quase que exclusivamente na biologia e ecologia dos peixes e em estratégias de pesca.

More than one-third of amphibian species are globally threatened. and over 120 species have likely suffered global extinction since 1980. Most alarmingly. many rapid declines and extinctions are occurring in pristine sites lacking obvious adverse effects of human activities. The causes of these “enigmatic” declines remain highly contested. Still. lack of long-term data on amphibian populations severely limits our understanding of the distribution of amphibian declines. and therefore the ultimate causes of these declines. Here. we identify a systematic community-wide decline in populations of terrestrial amphibians at La Selva Biological Station. a protected old-growth lowland rainforest in lower Central America.

In an effort to synthesize data describing ecological responses of animals to fragmentation across two classes of independent variables (taxonomic group and landscape). we sampled 148 studies of five major faunal groups from the primary literature and analyzed data on 13 variables extracted from those studies. We focused our analyses on three classes of dependent variables (effects of area and isolation on species richness. z values. and nestedness and species composition).

The type of system used depends on the size and natural history of the target organism as well as time and resources. Some marking methods require special equipment. training. or permits from state or national wildlife agencies. Marks can be permanent. temporary. datespecific. or individual-specific. Long-term studies of populations require that marks be permanent. Temporary marks can be used if information on behavior over the course of a day or night is required (Jacobson 1985). Date-specific marks (all animals are given identical marks during a sample period) can be applied more rapidly in the field than individualspecific marks. and it is simpler to take data from recaptured animals marked by date. Most population estimators accommodate the use of date-specific marks. If a project requires detailed infomiation on space-use patterns or growth rates in addition to an estimate of population size. individual-specific marks must be used.,True,vFaqgp8AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,249,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/4678/Appendix_2.pdf,4346146959967293678,/scholar?cites=4346146959967293678,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/4678/Appendix_2.pdf,0,0,0

Climatic change is a global factor that has been implicated in some of these declines. In this paper. we speculate on how Neotropical anurans might respond to changes in climate predicted by Hulme and Viner (1998). We focus on two distinct groups of Neotropical anurans: frogs that live and oviposit in leaf litter and frogs that congregate at ponds to breed. Increased temperature. increased length of dry season. decreased soil moisture. and increased inter-annual rainfall variability will affect Neotropical frogs strongly. We expect that these changes will directly affect frogs by changing reproductive success and breeding periodicity. and indirectly by altering the invertebrate prey base.

NY: American Museum of Natural History,Pico Tamacuari. the highest point (2340 m) in the Sierra Tapirapec6. dominates the skyline on the border between Brazil and Venezuela. It is a granitic dome that rises some 800 m above the wet montane forest below. This forest supports a depauperate herpetofauna reminiscent of a middle elevation forest fauna on a sandstone table mountain (tepui). Eleven species of amphibians and reptiles were collected during a six-day period in the dry season (March). at 1160-1460 m above sea level. This sample includes six new frogs (Hyalinobatrachium crurifasciatum. n. sp.. Colostethus tamacu-arensis. n. sp.. Stefania tamacuarina. n. sp.. Eleutherodactylus avius. n. sp.. E. cavernibardus. n. sp.. E. memorans. n. sp.). At least some of these have counterparts that are endemic to tepuis. Other species include a frog (Hyla benitezi) and two lizards (Arthrosaura synaptolepis. Neusticu-rus racenisi) endemic to the Pantepui Region. and a lizard (Anolis chrysolepis) and a snake (Thamnodynastes pallidus) widely distributed in Amazonia and Guayana. All five of these nonendemic Tamacuari species occur also on sandstone tepuis. It seems not to matter to such species whether the underlying rock is sandstone or granite.

The rate of discovery and description of amphibian and reptile species. unlike that of birds and mammals. continues to increase. Many of these new taxa are from South America (Bauer 1998; Glaw and Kohler 1998). a continent for which 60% of the species of amphibians have been described in the past 40 years (Duellman 1999). In contrast to other continents. South America has only moderate topographic complexity. Lowlands cover about half of the continent and are associated primarily with the major drainage systems of the Orinoco. Amazon. and Parana rivers. The highland regions are generally discrete and occur in the northeast (Guayana Shield). the southeast (Brazilian Shield). and along the western margin of the continent (Andes). Narrow coastal lowlands fringe these upland areas in the east and west. Even though the tropical lowland regions and their wet forests contribute substantially to herpetofaunal species diversity. species diversity among amphibians is highest in montane regions. where the numbers of endemics are high (usually above 75%; Duellman 1999). Comparable data for species of reptiles are not available. but typically. species diversity of reptiles in montane regions lags behind that of amphibians (eg. amphibians make up 64% of the Andean herpetofauna; Duellman 1979c).

This report explores the relation between climate change. climate policies. and poverty outcomes by examining three questions: the (static) impact on poor people's livelihood and well-being; the impact on the risk for non-poor individuals to fall into poverty; and the impact on the ability of poor people to escape poverty. The report explores various channels through which climate change and policies will affect poverty: economic impacts through incomes and prices; natural disasters and their effects on assets and livelihoods; and health impacts. It also investigates policy options to ensure adaptation and mitigation policies--such as adaptive and well-targeted social protection. public investments. and financial inclusion policies--contribute to poverty reduction and protect poor people against climate change impacts.

But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it. By focusing on aggregate losses—the traditional approach to disaster risk—we restrict our consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have assets to lose in the first place. and largely ignore the plight of poor people. This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect people’s well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting. and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor people’s vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters. but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the world’s poor. such as expanding financial inclusion. disaster risk and health insurance. social protection and adaptive safety nets. contingent finance and reserve funds. and universal access to early warning systems.

This Climatic Change Letter uses a global energy-economy model to address this gap by assessing in a common framework both the costs of climate policies and oil scarcity. taking into account macroeconomic feedbacks. It shows that both costs are of the same order of magnitude. Moreover. our results suggest that. in the context of a limited and uncertain amount of ultimately recoverable oil resources. climate policies reduce the world vulnerability to peak oil. Of course. specific policies could also reduce this vulnerability. But by shifting energy use toward coal. they would lead to soaring greenhouse gases emissions.

However. the climate change externality could be corrected without such a sacrifice. It is possible to set a carbon value. and use it to create ‘carbon certificates’ that can be accepted as part of commercial banks’ legal reserves. These certificates can be distributed to low-carbon projects. and be exchanged by investors against concessional loans. reducing capital costs for low-carbon projects. As the issuance of carbon certificates would increase the quantity of money. it will either lead to accelerated inflation or induce the Central Bank to raise interest rates.

These policy instruments imply different transitions to the same balanced growth path. The optimal carbon price minimizes the discounted social cost of the transition to clean capital. but may prompt premature retirement of existing polluting capacities and significant private costs in the form of stranded assets. Second-best mandates and feebates affect new investment decisions without providing incentives to under-use existing polluting equipment. These instruments lead to higher discounted social costs. but smoother abatement costs. and do not result in premature retirement or stranded assets.

1162655,Transition to clean capital. irreversible investment and stranded assets,2014,Julie Rozenberg and Adrien Vogt-Schilb and Stephane Hallegatte,,,,,The World Bank,This paper uses a Ramsey model with two types of capital to analyze the optimal transition to clean capital when polluting investment is irreversible. The cost of climate mitigation decomposes as a technical cost of using clean instead of polluting capital and a transition cost from the irreversibility of pre-existing polluting capital. With a carbon price. the transition cost can be limited by underutilizing polluting capital. at the expense of a loss in the value of polluting assets (stranded assets) and a drop in income. In contrast. policy instruments that focus on redirecting investments—such as feebates or environmental standards—prevent underutilization of existing capital. avoid stranded assets. and reduce short-term losses; but they reduce emissions more slowly and increase the intertemporal cost of the transition.

Socio-environmental systems (SES) modeling integrates knowledge and perspectives into conceptual and computational tools that explicitly recognize how human decisions affect the environment. Depending on the modeling purpose. many SES modelers also realize that involvement of stakeholders and experts is fundamental to support social learning and decision-making processes for achieving improved environmental and social outcomes. The contribution of this paper lies in identifying and formulating grand challenges that need to be overcome to accelerate the development and adaptation of SES modeling. Eight challenges are delineated: bridging epistemologies across disciplines; multi-dimensional uncertainty assessment and management; scales and scaling issues; combining qualitative and quantitative methods and data; furthering the adoption and impacts of SES modeling on policy; capturing structural changes; representing human dimensions in SES; and leveraging new data types and sources. These challenges limit our ability to effectively use SES modeling to provide the knowledge and information essential for supporting decision making. Whereas some of these challenges are not unique to SES modeling and may be pervasive in other scientific fields. they still act as barriers as well as research opportunities for the SES modeling community.

An analysis of hundreds of baseline scenarios for future economic development in the absence of climate change in 92 countries shows that the drivers of poverty eradication differ across countries. Two representative scenarios are selected from these hundreds. One scenario is optimistic regarding poverty and is labeled? prosperity;? the other scenario is pessimistic and labeled? poverty.? Results from sector analyses of climate change impacts? in agriculture. health. and natural disasters? are introduced in the two scenarios. By 2030. climate change is found to have a significant impact on poverty. especially through higher food prices and reduction of agricultural production in Africa and South Asia. and through health in all regions. But the magnitude of these impacts depends on development choices. In the prosperity scenario with rapid. inclusive. and climate-informed development. climate change increases poverty by between 3 million and 16 million in 2030.

A Ramsey model is built with two types of capital: brown capital that produces a negative externality and green capital that does not. Abatement is obtained through structural change (green capital accumulation) and possibly through under-utilization of brown capital. Capital-based instruments and the carbon price lead to the same long-term balanced growth path. but they differ during the transition phase. The carbon price maximizes social welfare but may cause temporary under-utilization of brown capital. hurting the owners of brown capital and the workers who depend on it. Capital-based instruments cause larger intertemporal welfare loss. but they maintain the full utilization of brown capital. smooth efforts over time. and cause lower immediate utility loss. Green industrial policies including such capital-based instruments may thus be used to increase the political acceptability of a carbon price.

The amount of these adverse impacts is assessed through a general equilibrium model which endogenizes both the reduction of oil exportation revenues under international climate policy and the macroeconomic effect of carbon pricing on Middle-East's economy. We show that compensating the drop of exportation revenues does not offset GDP and welfare losses because of the time profile of the general equilibrium effects. When considering instead compensation based on GDP losses. the effectiveness of monetary transfers proves to be drastically limited by general equilibrium effects in opened economies.

Over recent decades the notion of risk being the basis for flood management decisions has become widely accepted and operationalised through the use of models and quantified risk analysis providing the evidence for risk-informed decision making. However. it is now abundantly apparent that changes in time. at a range of scales. of pertinent variables that determine risk are not a second order consideration but. instead. fundamentally challenge the conventional approach to flood risk management. The nature of some of these changes. particularly those that operate on extended timescales. are highly uncertain. yet decisions that may have implications for several decades still have to be taken. In this paper we explore how flood risk management may be adapted to address processes of uncertain future change. We identify a range of levels at which change may be incorporated in decision making: in the representation of uncertain non-stationary quantities; in the rules that are used to identify preferred options; in the variety of options that may be contemplated for flood risk management; in the scope of problem definition. which increasingly extends to address multiple hazards and multiple functions of river basins; and in the social and organizational characteristics that promote adaptive capacity. Integrated responses to changing flood risk need to attend to each of these levels of decision making. from the technicalities of non-stationarity. to the promotion of resilient societies.,True,IPB7Xw0AAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC,395,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/10/509/2010/,12163973106683413909,/scholar?cites=12163973106683413909,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/10/509/2010/nhess-10-509-2010.pdf,0,0,0

1162675,Foresight: Future Flooding. Scientific Summary,2004,Edward Evans,1,,,,Department of Trade and Industry,As explained in Chapter 3. it is important to differentiate between drivers of flood risk that operate at the catchment scale and those that affect urban areas-the investigation of urban flood risk requires modelling on a finer scale.Attempts to model flood risks arising from the intra-urban drivers are hindered by the absence of an equivalent to the RASP riskmodelling tool that was the basis for our estimates of national flood risk on the catchment scale (Chapter 4). This chapter therefore describes the estimation of future nationwide risks in the urban area. which has been performed without recourse to national modelling. Instead. our calculations are based on the analysis of changes in two of the most important drivers of intra-urban flood risk.

Confidence in model estimates of future climate evolution has been enhanced via a range of advances since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR). Climate models are based on well-established physical principles and have been demonstrated to reproduce observed features of recent climate (see Chapters 8 and 9) and past climate changes (see Chapter 6). There is considerable confidence that Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change. particularly at continental and larger scales. Confidence in these estimates is higher for some climate variables (eg. temperature) than for others (eg. precipitation). This summary highlights areas of progress since the TAR:• Enhanced scrutiny of models and expanded diagnostic analysis of model behaviour have been increasingly facilitated by internationally coordinated efforts to collect and disseminate output from model experiments performed under common conditions. This has encouraged a more comprehensive and open evaluation of models. The expanded evaluation effort. encompassing a diversity of perspectives. makes it less likely that significant model errors are being overlooked.,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:9hYaGTfn7EkC,2332,https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1765216/component/file_1765214/content,14750900660436683651,/scholar?cites=14750900660436683651,,https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_1765216/component/file_1765214/content,0,0,0

But doing so is not easy for at least two reasons. First. due to the rate of climate change. new infrastructure will have to be able to cope with a large range of changing climate conditions. which will make design more difficult and construction more expensive. Second. uncertainty in future climate makes it impossible to directly use the output of a single climate model as an input for infrastructure design. and there are good reasons to think that the needed climate information will not be available soon. Instead of optimizing based on the climate conditions projected by models. therefore. future infrastructure should be made more robust to possible changes in climate conditions.

The report explores various channels through which climate change and policies will affect poverty: economic impacts through incomes and prices; natural disasters and their effects on assets and livelihoods; and health impacts. It also investigates policy options to ensure adaptation and mitigation policies--such as adaptive and well-targeted social protection. public investments. and financial inclusion policies--contribute to poverty reduction and protect poor people against climate change impacts.

The long-term growth models used in climate change assessments. however. cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To investigate this issue. a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. This exercise allowed us to define the economic amplification ratio. as the ratio of the overall production loss due to an event to its direct costs. This ratio could be used to improve the cost–benefit analysis of prevention measures. We found also that. unlike a Solow-like model.

But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it.

This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect people’s well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting. and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor people’s vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters. but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the world’s poor. such as expanding financial inclusion. disaster risk and health insurance. social protection and adaptive safety nets. contingent finance and reserve funds. and universal access to early warning systems. Efforts to reduce disaster risk and poverty go hand in hand. Because disasters impoverish so many. disaster risk management is inseparable from poverty …,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:7iKzEIWBYlQC,263,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yNmbDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=info:RLjq_NSlfGcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3L3cRadtxK&sig=x0UgG2w-c16RCv-EiFxHDVF2L4I,7457017417213589572,/scholar?cites=7457017417213589572,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yNmbDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=info:RLjq_NSlfGcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3L3cRadtxK&sig=x0UgG2w-c16RCv-EiFxHDVF2L4I,0,0,0
1162713,Can natural disasters have positive consequences? Investigating the role of embodied technical change,2009,Stéphane Hallegatte and Patrice Dumas,68,Ecological Economics,3,777-786,Elsevier,It has been suggested that disasters might have positive economic consequences. through the accelerated replacement of capital. This possibility is referred to as the productivity effect. This effect is investigated using a model with embodied technical change. In this framework. disasters can influence the production level but cannot influence the growth rate. in the same way than the saving ratio in a Solow-like model. Depending on reconstruction quality. indeed. accounting for embodied technical change can either decrease or increase disaster costs. but is never able to turn disasters into positive events. Moreover. a better but slower reconstruction amplifies the short-term consequences of disasters. but pays off over the long-term. Regardless. the productivity effect cannot prevent the existence of a bifurcation when disaster damages exceed the reconstruction capacity. potentially leading to poverty traps.,True,7xxEWRkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,253,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908002863,8585054542274834123,/scholar?cites=8585054542274834123,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52716489.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we demonstrate an approach to assess future risks and quantify the benefits of adaptation options at a city-scale. with application to flood risk in Mumbai. In 2005. Mumbai experienced unprecedented flooding. causing direct economic damages estimated at almost two billion USD and 500 fatalities. Our findings suggest that by the 2080s. in a SRES A2 scenario. an ‘upper bound’ climate scenario could see the likelihood of a 2005-like event more than double. We estimate that total losses (direct plus indirect) associated with a 1-in-100 year event could triple compared with current situation (to $690–$1.890 million USD). due to climate change alone. Continued rapid urbanisation could further increase the risk level.

After each of these events. media. insurance companies. and international institutions publish numerous assessments of the “cost of the disaster.” However these assessments are based on different methodologies and approaches. and they often reach different results. Besides methodological differences. these discrepancies are due to the multi-dimensionality in disaster impacts and their large redistributive effects. which make it unclear what is included in the estimates.

This paper aims at clarifying this in an analytical framework and proposing foundations for green growth.

The data available show that at high densities of gamebird release. negative environmental impacts are likely to occur. and may in some cases be severe. In the majority of cases however. where densities are moderate. it is likely that impacts are minor or may be offset by beneficial habitat management. In areas where good habitat management is combined with low release densities. or in areas that work to promote breeding populations of gamebirds. impacts may be largely positive.,True,yNp2ifMAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,22,http://robyorke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gamebird-release.pdf,14809598216577064425,/scholar?cites=14809598216577064425,,http://robyorke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gamebird-release.pdf,0,0,0

Indonesia,2014,Suzanne M Stas,145,,,,CIFOR,The loss of ecosystem services due to deforestation is of global concern. Financial mechanisms such as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) have been proposed as ways to support the conservation of tropical forests. Crucial steps in the implementation of REDD+ are to estimate national-level carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and to collect data on local biomass and carbon stocks. In this research. above-ground biomass (AGB) values and associated carbon stocks in a lowland secondary forest are estimated and compared with those in an adjacent primary forest. both growing on limestone in Seram. the Moluccas.

Under these two scenarios. biodiversity follows much the same fate as the forest 49 (Fig. 2)(Edwards et al. 2014). 5051 Spatial determinants of tropical deforestation. other than roads and linear transport routes 52 (eg rivers. train lines). include additional factors associated with accessibility (eg slope. 53 topography. distance to settlements) and the suitability of the land for conversion to 54 alternative uses (Laurance et al. 2002; Gaveau et al. 2009). While the relationship between 55 deforestation. logging roads and certification highlighted here could thus potentially be 56 confounded by a number of additional variables. roads into tropical forests are a well-known 57 precursor to much more high-impact forms of disturbance.

Alterations to natural disturbance regimes. such as those brought about by logging. have the potential to shift relative species abundances and the community composition of forests. resulting in population declines for commercially valuable species. Timber operations therefore need to minimise such changes if long-term sustainability is to be achieved within the industry. Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been promoted widely as an alternative management strategy to conventional selective logging. as it employs practices that decrease the negative impacts of logging within forests. However. the long-term sustainability of RIL. including the influence it has on the regeneration of species targeted for timber extraction. is still uncertain.

1162743,The impacts of non-native gamebird release in the UK: an updated evidence review,2020,Lucy R Mason and Jake E Bicknell and Jennifer Smart and Will J Peach,,,,,,• Recreational shooting of non-native gamebirds (pheasants and red-legged partridges) in the UK is underpinned by a suite of management practices. A major aspect is the annual large-scale release of birds to be shot. which is steadily increasing with an estimated 57 million birds released in 2016; this scale of non-native gamebird release exceeds any similar activity in Europe or North America. Approximately one third of released birds are shot. while the majority of the remaining birds die from other causes during the year of release or survive in very low numbers to join the population of pheasants and partridges now residing in the wild in the UK.• The number of gamebirds released has increased since the 1990s. while the number shot has remained relatively stable. and this reduction in releasing-efficiency is potentially driven by a reduction in gamebird survival and an increase in late winter shooting. meaning that more birds must be released during autumn to ensure enough survive to be shot in January.• There is concern that this large and increasing release of gamebirds and associated shooting practices may be having negative impacts on the UK’s native wildlife.

Guyana,2007,Jake E Bicknell and Christopher Chin,4,Conservation Evidence,,94-98,www.conservationevidence.com,Deforestation is one of the major global conservation issues. Solutions are being sought to tackle this ongoing forest loss. including establishment of initiatives to provide new sources of income for local communities that promote the sustainable use of forests in the interest of biodiversity conservation. One such project ‘Iwokrama’. demonstrates how tropical forests and associated habitats can be sustainably used. In the central Guyana wetlands of the Rupununi. illegal fishing of arapaima Arapaima gigas. had led to a huge reduction in its numbers. Iwokrama responded by initiating the Arapaima Management Plan in 2002. This highlighted the need for another source of local income from fisheries. and a business that undertakes sustainable harvest of fish for the aquarium trade was developed. Harvesting of a few selected fish species is carried-out by members of the local community who are paid a daily wage. Fishing methods target individual species to avoid incidental by-catch. Four species are primarily caught as they are numerous in the Rupununi and are of high trade value. To ensure ecological and economical sustainability. catch per unit effort is monitored; where this begins to drop for any given species. harvesting is suspended and the population is allowed to recover before harvesting resumes. The project has developed into a self-sustaining business. managed by the community themselves. During 2005. the project reached financial sustainability with current profits of over US$3.000 feeding back into local community initiatives.,True,yNp2ifMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/48130,9338073449912883423,/scholar?cites=9338073449912883423,,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/48130/1/Bicknell%20and%20Chin%20Conservation%20evidence%20aquarium%20fisheries.pdf,0,0,0

1162753,Velocity profiles. unsteady friction losses and transient modelling,1999,Bruno Brunone and Bryan Karney and Marco Ferrante,,,,1-11,,Transient flows in closed-conduits have traditionally been modeled as one-dimensional flows with the assumption that both velocity profiles and friction losses can be accurately predicted on the basis of equivalent steady state (i.e.. average) values of velocity. More recently. a host of more complex fluid models have been suggested. but there has been little experimental basis for selecting one model over another. This paper reviews the significance of these questions and briefly overviews various historical approaches that have been proposed for improving the numerical modeling of the fluid structure during transient events.

A juicio de la articulista. esta formulación es insuficiente frente a la dificultad que presentan las conductas constitutivas de abuso sexual: la equivocidad de su expresión. Frente a ello se hace necesario recurrir a un elemento subjetivo. que determine la punibilidad de la conducta. Acto de significación sexual viene a ser un elemento normativo relacionado con la ilicitud de la conducta. constituye un llamado de atención al juez sobre la existencia de actos con distinto significado. cuya ilicitud va a estar determinada por la presencia de un elemento subjetivo.

UNAM,Por ser parte fundamental de uno de los fenómenos de migración e hibernación más sorprendentes y llamativos del mundo. la Reserva de la Biosfera Mariposa Monarca (RBMM) se ha convertido en una de las áreas naturales protegidas más emblemáticas de nuestro país. Sin embargo. sigue enfrentándose a serios problemas de fragmentación. perturbación y pérdida de sus bosques. Uno de los elementos del paisaje que más se ha reconocido como causa y efecto de la perturbación y pérdida de espacios forestales son los caminos. Utilizando mosaicos elaborados con fotografías aéreas digitales de marzo de 2003. escala 1:20 000. y recorridos en campo registrados con GPS. se identificaron 20 574 km de caminos dentro de los límites de la RBMM; 55% del ellos son brechas y 37% veredas. ambos abiertos específicamente para el aprovechamiento forestal. Las carreteras pavimentadas y las terracerías representan. respectivamente. 2 y 6% de la red. Esos 2 574 km de caminos se traducen en una densidad promedio de 4.7 km/km². No obstante. el análisis a nivel de predio revela valores de densidad aún más altos. especialmente en el lado michoacano. que alcanzan hasta 13.6 km/km². Asimismo. multiplicando los respectivos tipos de caminos por su ancho promedio de lecho. se encontró que 880 ha de la Reserva están ocupadas por caminos. lo cual tiene serias repercusiones sobre la vegetación. el suelo. la red de drenaje y la accesibilidad a los recursos.,True,D31xo7EAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,11,http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0188-46112005000200006,18257538900714162689,/scholar?cites=18257538900714162689,,http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0188-46112005000200006,0,0,0
1162760,La frustración en delitos de mera actividad a la luz de determinadas sentencias,2005,María Cecilia Ramírez,1,Revista de Derecho (Valparaiso),XXVI,133-141,Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso,De acuerdo a la posición doctrinaria mayoritaria no se concibe la frustración como forma de imperfecta ejecución en los delitos formales o de mera actividad. Éstos darían lugar sólo a la tentativa; en cambio. sí sería posible hablar de frustración en los delitos de resultado. Sin embargo. existen sentencias de tribunales superiores. incluso por la vía de recalificar la tentativa a la frustración. que han dado lugar a esta última en un clásico delito de mera actividad como es la violación. Una primera posibilidad es considerar que la decisión de los sentenciadores ha estado guiada por el efecto penológico que ello conlleva. cuestión que en las sentencias comentadas no parece ser el factor determinante. En efecto. éstas se hacen cargo de analizar las etapas de desarrollo del delito y. conforme a ello. conclu-,True,D31xo7EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,11,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/1736/173619921008.pdf,5805439005093944075,/scholar?cites=5805439005093944075,,https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/1736/173619921008.pdf,0,0,0

Danaus plexippus.en México). resaltando la relación entre la conservación de la biodiversidad y el aprovechamiento de los recursos naturales. Para alcanzar ese objetivo se consideró adecuado aplicar una metodología de análisis del paisaje. la cual se puede resumir en tres puntos fundamentales: 1)la realización de un inventario de los principales componentes naturales y humanos presentes en el territorio analizado; 2) la delimitación de unidades del paisaje a través de las discontinuidades marcadas por dichos componentes; y.3) el análisis y síntesis de la problemática del territorio a través de las unidades de paisaje definidas. Asimismo. todos los métodos particulares de análisis y diagnóstico en los que se consideró información espacial fueron aplicados en el entorno de sistemas de información geográfica (SIG).

1162762,Lessons from Four Decades of Infrastructure Project-Related Conflicts in Latin America and the Caribbean,2017,Graham George Watkins and Sven-Uwe Mueller and Hendrik Meller and Maria Cecilia Ramirez and Tomás Serebrisky and Andreas Georgoulias,,"Report. Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, DC",,,,This report investigates the nature and consequences of conflict in infrastructure projects in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). To the best of the authors’ knowledge. this is the first study on this scale at the infrastructure industry. A hybrid quantitative and qualitative research approach provided the data for the study. 32 interviews were conducted with 42 sustainability experts involved in the development of infrastructure in LAC. Then. a database of 200 conflict-affected infrastructure projects across six sectors was created to assess the nature and drivers of conflicts. the companies’ response to conflicts. and the material implications for projects. companies. and societies.Our analysis demonstrates that the nature of conflicts is multidimensional. and more dynamic than traditionally conceived by both firms and governments. Most conflicts materialize through the interaction of environmental. social. governance. and economic drivers over a long period. Overall. deficient planning. reduced access to resources. lack of community benefits. and lack of adequate consultation were the most prominent conflict drivers. In many cases. conflicts escalated because grievances and community concerns accumulated. going unresolved for many years. In general. conflicts may arise during any phase of an infrastructure project. but our analysis shows that the earliest phases are increasingly vulnerable to conflicts. Most projects in the database that were cancelled or postponed faced conflicts before operations.,True,D31xo7EAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC,9,https://publications.iadb.org/en/handle/11319/8502,3868744856055648753,/scholar?cites=3868744856055648753,,https://publications.iadb.org/en/bitstream/handle/11319/8502/Lecciones-de-cuatro-decadas-de-conflicto-en-torno-a-proyectos-de-infraestructura-en-America-Latina-y-el-Caribe.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Centro Provincial de Ciencias Médicas Provincia de Cienfuegos,Fundamento: Es necesario conocer a fondo todos los elementos que intervienen. favorecen. predisponen y desencadenan la ocurrencias de hechos violentos que conllevan a la muerte. En este sentido. una caracterización epidemiológica de este problema puede esclarecer los modos de actuación para su abordaje. Objetivo: caracterizar la ocurrencia de muertes violentas en la provincia. Métodos: se realizó un estudio descriptivo retrospectivo. desde enero hasta diciembre del año 2012. de 144 fallecidos por muerte violenta. de etiología médico legal suicida. accidental u homicida. Se analizaron las variables edad. sexo. procedencia. lugar de ocurrencia del hecho. causa básica de la defunción y etiología medico legal de la muerte. Resultados: las muertes violentas acaecieron fundamentalmente en hombres (76.3 %) y el grupo de edades más afectado el de mayores de 60 años. La etiología médico legal más frecuente fue la accidental. Los hechos violentos ocurrieron predominantemente en los lugares públicos (49.3 %). El ahorcamiento y los accidentes del tránsito en sus diferentes modalidades (atropello. colisión. despiste y vuelco). fueron las causas básicas de muerte violenta más frecuentes. Conclusión: se concluye que en el año 2012 la mayor parte de las muertes violentas ocurridas en Cienfuegos tuvieron lugar en sitios públicos. por causas accidentales. aunque el suicidio por ahorcamiento también representó una considerable proporción.

Legal y Forense,En la presente ponencia. se expone detalladamente el proceso de valoración de la idoneidad parental de uno y otro progenitor en procesos de familia. siguiendo la tendencia actual a no centrarse precisamente en los llamados criterios negativos de atribución de las custodias infantiles. En opinión de la ponente y desde su perspectiva de psicóloga forense. tan importante como diagnosticar o identificar el trastorno. es determinar cómo y en qué grado ese trastorno afecta al desempeño parental. al ejercicio de las responsabilidades parentales que lleva a cabo ese progenitor. Además en el transcurso de las rupturas matrimoniales o de pareja aparece con frecuencia cierta pseudopatología o malestar subclínico asociado a este estrés de primer orden. Esta sintomatología puede llegar a tener una incidencia importante en el propio afrontamiento de la ruptura y ser un buen predictor del ajuste de los hijos a la separación parental. como veremos más adelante. Así que conviene considerarla también al analizar las alternativas de custodia.

Experimental evidence from a developing country,2018,Ofer Malamud and Santiago Cueto and Julián Cristia and Diether W Beuermann,,,,,IDB Working Paper No. IDB-WP-960,This paper provides experimental evidence for the impact of home internet access on a broad range of child outcomes in Peru. Children who were randomly chosen to receive laptops with high-speed internet access are compared with i) those who did not receive laptops and ii) those who only received laptops without internet. It is found that providing free internet access led to improved computer and internet proficiency relative to those without laptops and improved internet proficiency compared to those with laptops only. However. there were no significant effects of internet access on math and reading achievement. cognitive skills. self-esteem. teacher perceptions. or school grades when compared to either group.

Ltd.,We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1‐km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean. minimum. and maximum temperature.

We used the thin‐plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation. using latitude. longitude. and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density. elevation bias in the weather stations. and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation.

It is used in analyses in ecology. hydrology. agriculture. climatology. geology. pedology. geomorphology. and many others. as a means both of explaining processes and of predicting them through modeling. Our capacity to understand and model these processes depends on the quality of the topographic data that are available. Most countries have much of the land surface covered by cartographic maps at varying scales and of varying accuracies. In most tropical countries. these maps are produced through manual interpretation of stereo pairs of aerial photos. and in some cases the topographic data can be erroneous or missing where cloud was present. With the advent of satellite imagery covering the globe. various global datasets of topography have been produced. of increasingly better resolution. from 10 arc-minutes (approximately 18 km at the equator) to 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km at the equator) using the United States Geological Survey (USGS) product.

We used current and projected future climate data for~ 2055. and the Ecocrop model to predict the impact of climate change on areas suitable for all crops listed in Table 1 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and other major staple and cash crops. Most detrimentally affected in terms of reduction of suitable areas for a range of crops will be sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. areas with the least capacity to cope. Conversely. Europe and North America will see an increase in area suitable for cultivation. These regions have the greatest capacity to manage climate change impacts.To minimize the impacts of these climate and other environmental changes. it will be crucial to breed new varieties for improved resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses is. Plant breeders need to increase their attention to breeding varieties that have greater tolerance to local abiotic stresses such as drought. flooding and extreme temperatures as well as continuing to breed for resistance to pests and diseases. Priorities for breeding should consider the magnitude of the predicted impacts on productivity of the crop. the number of people who depend on the crop and their level of poverty. and the opportunities for significant gains through breeding. Local knowledge of ecological interactions. traditional varieties. and the genetic diversity in the wild relatives of domesticated crops provide rich resources on which to build priority breeding programmes for climate change-tolerant varieties.,True,wW-l1boAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,203,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Redden3/publication/226709979_Biodiversity_Challenges_with_Climate_Change/links/562019a908aed8dd19404532.pdf,15124277598970667494,/scholar?cites=15124277598970667494,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Redden3/publication/226709979_Biodiversity_Challenges_with_Climate_Change/links/562019a908aed8dd19404532.pdf,0,0,0

Several researchers (particularly climatic researchers) state that original GCM (General Circulation Model) resolution should be kept in order to manage. understand and not bias or alter uncertainties produced by GCMs themselves; however. a coarse resolution of 100 or 200km (or even more) is simply not practical for assessing agricultural landscapes. particularly in the tropics. where orographic and climatic conditions vary significantly across relatively small distances. Moreover. changes in topography and climate variables are not the only factors accounting for variability in agriculture; soils and socioeconomic drivers. also often differ over small distances. influencing agro-ecosystems. increasing uncertainties. and making forecasting and assessment models more inaccurate and complicated to calibrate.

It involves a number of distinct stages. which are nevertheless linked and interrelated. from the selection of priority taxa. to the design and implementation of complementary conservation strategies and the development and exchange of the results of germplasm use (Maxted et al.. 1997a). These different components generate various types of data. including information on the identity (passport data) and characteristics of germplasm (characterization and evaluation data). which are crucial for the effectiveness of the process as a whole. In the end. these data refer to stands of wild or cultivated plants found growing in specific. known places. The location of these places on the surface of the earth is also included in the passport data of genebank and herbarium documentation. This means that the data associated with germplasm are'geo-referenced'. and therefore amenable to'spatial analysis'. or the description and modelling of patterns and relationships in geographical data (Bailey. 1994). Each of the different components of the process of conservation and use of genetic resources not only generates. but also requires. data. For example. germplasm collection results in data on the distribution. the phenology. the ethnobotany and. once characterization and evaluation have been carried out. the genetic diversity of the target taxon.

Parts of the energy sector are preparing to meet this demand by increasing renewable energy production. which is necessary to combat climate change. But many renewable energy sources have a large energy sprawl—the amount of land needed to produce energy—which can threaten biodiversity and conservation. Is it possible to meet this rise in energy demand. while still conserving natural places and species? In Energy Sprawl Solutions. scientists Joseph M. Kiesecker and David Naugle provide a roadmap for preserving biodiversity despite the threats of energy sprawl. Their strategy—development by design—brings together companies. communities. and governments to craft blueprints for sustainable land development.

1162813,Trading Forest Products in Cambodia: Challenges. Threats. and Opportunities for Resin,2003,Prom Tola and Bruce McKenney,,,28,,Cambodia Development Resource Institute,Forests support rural livelihoods in Cambodia in a number of important ways. Almost all rural Cambodians use forest resources for cooking fuel and construction materials. Many also collect other products for household use and income generation through trade. such as bamboo. rattan. resin. wild fruits and vegetables. and medicinal materials. In addition to products. forests provide habitat for flora and fauna diversity. essential ecological services. and in some areas have important cultural and spiritual significance to surrounding communities.,True,E8yWjYsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,15,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1955742883756117147&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1955742883756117147,/scholar?cites=1955742883756117147,,,0,0,0

There are now approximately 45 compensatory mitigation programs for biodiversity impacts worldwide. with another 27 programs in development. While offsets have great potential as a conservation tool. their establishment requires overcoming a number of conceptual and methodological hurdles. In Australia. new policy changes at the national and state (ie. Western Australia) level require that offsets follow a set of general principles:(1) Environmental offsets may not be appropriate for all projects and will only be considered after avoidance and mitigation options have been pursued;(2) Environmental offsets will be based on sound environmental information and knowledge;(3) Establishing goals for offsets requires an estimate of expected direct and indirect impacts;(4) Environmental offsets will be focused on longer term strategic outcomes;(5) Environmental offsets will be cost-effective. as well as relevant and proportionate to the significance of the environmental value being impacted. Here we focus on the challenges of determining and implementing offsets using a real world example from a voluntary offset process undertaken for Barrick Gold’s Kanowna Belle mine site in Western Australia to highlight those challenges and potential solutions.

The inside radius of the nanotubules can be varied at will; nanotubule radii as small as 0.8 nanometer are reported. These membranes show selective ion transport analogous to that observed in ion-exchange polymers. Ion permselectivity occurs because excess charge density can be present on the inner walls of the metal tubules. The membranes reject ions with the same sign as the excess charge and transport ions of the opposite sign. Because the sign of the excess charge on the tubule can be changed potentiostatically. a metal nanotubule membrane can be either cation selective or anion selective. depending on the potential applied to the membrane.,True,GNk3qeDeW94C:u5HHmVD_uO8C,785,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/268/5211/700.abstract,2032843077837817708,/scholar?cites=2032843077837817708,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA292712.pdf,0,0,0

The support is a commercially available microporous polycarbonate filter with cylindrical nanoscopic pores. The gold nanotubules are prepared via electroless deposition of Au onto the pore walls; i.e.. the pores acts as templates for the nanotubules. We have shown that by controlling the Au deposition time. Au nanotubules that have effective inside diameters of molecular dimensions (<1 nm) can be prepared. Hence. these membranes are a new class of molecular sieves. In addition. because these membranes are composed of an electronically conductive material. excess charge can be applied to the tubules by electrochemical charging in an electrolyte solution.

Measurements were successfully conducted on a particle of 15 μm diam resulting in impedance magnitude on the order of MΩ. The impedance spectra exhibited (i) one semicircle in the high frequency region.(ii) Warburg impedance in low frequencies. and finally.(iii) a limiting capacitance in the very low frequencies. The spectra were analyzed using a modified Randles-Ershler circuit. so that the reaction kinetics could be precisely evaluated. The charge transfer resistance decreased as the potential increased. whereas the double layer capacitance was almost invariant with the potential.

However. because they are random aggregates of particular or tubular nanocarbons. the postmodification of enzymes to their intrananospace is generally hard to control. Here. we describe a free-standing film of carbon nanotube forest (CNTF) that can form a hybrid ensemble with enzymes through liquid-induced shrinkage.

The performance of the biocathode was fourfold improved by optimizing its hydrophobicity.

By screening a chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cDNA library under moderately stringent hybridization conditions. we picked up a series of cDNA clones for a novel maf-related gene which we named mafK. We also identified another maf-related gene named mafF by screening a chicken genomic library using a mafK probe. Structural analyses suggested that the mafK and mafF genes consist of three exons. The exon-intron structures of the two genes resemble each other. but differ from that of the chicken c-maf gene. As compared to the c-Maf protein. the proteins encoded by the mafK and the mafF genes are rather small in size and lack the regions corresponding to the amino terminal acidic domain present in the c-Maf protein. On the other hand. the structures of the b-Zip domain are well conserved among these Maf-related proteins. When overexpressed by using an avian retroviral vector. the two maf-related genes did not induce morphological transformation of CEF cells but induced colony formation in soft agar with very low efficiencies.

The technique uses reversible sealing of elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds on surfaces to sequentially deliver various fluids or cells onto specific locations on a substrate. Microwells on the substrate were used to capture and immobilize cells within low shear stress regions inside channels. By using an array of channels it was possible to deposit multiple cell types. such as hepatocytes. fibroblasts. and embryonic stem cells. on the substrates. Upon formation of the cell arrays on the substrate. the PDMS mold could be removed. generating a multiphenotype array of cells.

Microfabricated hydrogel substrates provide a potentially useful platform for directing cells into biomimetic tissue architecture in vitro. Here. we present microgrooved methacrylated gelatin hydrogels as a suitable platform to build muscle-like fibrous structures in a facile and highly reproducible fashion. Microgrooved hydrogel substrates with two different ridge sizes (50 and 100 μm) were fabricated to assess the effect of the distance between engineered myofibers on the orientation of the bridging C2C12 myoblasts and the formation of the resulting multinucleated myotubes.

One approach to spatially pattern cells is by dielectrophoresis (DEP). DEP has characteristics that are important for cell manipulation. such as high accuracy. speed. scalability. and the ability to handle both adherent and non-adherent cells.

One of the isolated clones encodes the μ1 subunit of the adaptor complex AP-1 involved in clathrin-dependent protein sorting. We found that Doublecortin also interacts in yeast with μ2 from the AP-2 complex. Mutagenesis and pull-down experiments showed that these interactions were mediated through a tyrosine-based sorting signal (YLPL) in the C-terminal part of Doublecortin. The functional relevance of these interactions was suggested by the coimmunoprecipitation of Doublecortin with AP-1 and AP-2 from mouse brain extracts.

Homologies bridging the great divide between deuterostomes and protostomes have served as the basis for current models of animal evolution and development. It is now appreciated that these two clades share a common developmental toolkit consisting of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. These patterning genes sometimes show common expression patterns and genetic interactions. suggesting the existence of similar or even conserved regulatory apparatus. However. previous studies have found no regulatory sequence conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes. Here we describe the first such enhancers. which we call bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores). Bicores show conservation of sequence and gene synteny. Sequence conservation of Bicores reflects conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. We predict that Bicores act as response elements to signaling pathways. and we show that Bicores are developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. Although the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the protostome and deuterostome clades. additional Bicores may be revealed as our understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilaterian genomes continue to grow.,True,XAYitDsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,63,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002852,18429216312441928782,/scholar?cites=18429216312441928782,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002852,0,0,0

During these movements. young neurons must attach and subsequently detach from their substrate to facilitate migration. but little is known about the mechanisms cells use to release their attachments. We show that the machinery for clathrin-mediated endocytosis is positioned to regulate the distribution of adhesion proteins in a subcellular region just proximal to the neuronal cell body. Inhibiting clathrin or dynamin function impedes the movement of migrating neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting dynamin function in vitro shifts the distribution of adhesion proteins to the rear of the cell.

The specific regulatory interactions between these factors. many key upstream and downstream genes. and the enhancers that mediate all these interactions remain mostly uncharacterized. We perform p300 ChIP-seq to identify over 6.600 candidate enhancers active in the dorsal cerebral wall of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice. Over 95% of the peaks we measure are conserved to human. Eight of ten (80%) candidates tested using mouse transgenesis drive activity in restricted laminar patterns within the neocortex. GREAT based computational analysis reveals highly significant correlation with genes expressed at E14.5 in key areas for neocortex development. and allows the grouping of enhancers by known biological functions and pathways for further studies. We find that multiple genes are flanked by dozens of candidate enhancers each. including well-known key neocortical genes as well as suspected and novel genes. Nearly a quarter of our candidate enhancers are conserved well beyond mammals.

Here. we show that the physiological vascular permeability that precedes implantation is directly controlled by progesterone receptor (PR) and is independent of VEGF. Global or endothelial-specific deletion of PR blocks physiological vascular permeability in the uterus. whereas misexpression of PR in the endothelium of other organs results in ectopic vascular leakage. Integration of an endothelial genome-wide transcriptional profile with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that PR induces an NR4A1 (Nur77/TR3)-dependent transcriptional program that broadly regulates vascular permeability in response to progesterone.

1163240,The crosstalk between endothelial cells and macrophages: biological consequences,2013,Huanhuan He,,,,,,The link between blood cells and the vasculature is rooted in early development. Endothelial cells. lining the interior surface of the entire circulatory system are responsible for the origin of all definitive blood cells. In the adult. such functional interdependency continues. Endothelial cells regulate hematopoietic cell differentiation within the bone marrow niche. They also coordinate homing of inflammatory cells. facilitate immune-surveillance and modulate several functional aspects of hematopoietic cell interaction with tissues under homeostatic and pathologic conditions. The aim of this dissertation is to extend our knowledge of the crosstalk between endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells. especially in regards to macrophages.First. we investigated the ability of endothelial cells to function as a niche for hematopoietic cell expansion. We showed that endothelial cells derived from various organs of adult mice could support long-term growth of hematopoietic cells. Interestingly. we found that the promotion of hematopoietic cell proliferation was regulated in an organ-specific manner. meaning endothelial cells from different origins supported hematopoietic stem cells at different levels. We further explored the role of AML1. an essential transcription factor in definitive hematopoiesis. We found that AML1 in the endothelium was able to enhance and further support hematopoietic cell proliferation. Finally. we examined the effect of cytokines on hematopoietic cell differentiation and found that IL-3 preferentially promotes myelopoiesis.

We report a simple and universal approach to fabricate robust. hydrogel-based. nanofiber-enabled encapsulation devices (NEEDs) with macroscopic dimensions. In this design. we take advantage of the well-known capillary action that holds wetting liquid in porous media. By impregnating the highly porous electrospun nanofiber membranes of pre-made tubular or planar devices with hydrogel precursor solutions and subsequent crosslinking. we obtained various nanofiber-enabled hydrogel devices. This approach is broadly applicable and does not alter the water content or the intrinsic chemistry of the hydrogels.

Neutrophils. one of the first immune cells to be recruited to implantation sites. have been suggested to contribute to the establishment of the inflammatory microenvironment that initiates the fibrotic response. However. the precise numbers and roles of neutrophils in response to implanted devices remains unclear. Using a mouse model of peritoneal microcapsule implantation. we show 30–500 fold increased neutrophil presence in the peritoneal exudates in response to implants. We demonstrate that these neutrophils secrete increased amounts of a variety of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Further. we observe that they participate in the foreign body response through the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on implant surfaces.

The absence of reports studying an animal model of the early stages of this disease has precluded the development of preventive therapeutic strategies. A cholesterol-fed (0.25% cholesterol in chow) rabbit model of atherosclerosis that is characterized by a moderate level of hypercholesterolemia was studied to determine its efficacy as a model of early AVS. Cellular. structural and morphological changes in the aortic valves of these rabbits were studied. METHODS: Twenty rabbits were assigned randomly to four experimental groups: Group 1 received normal chow for 40 weeks; group 2 received 0.25% cholesterol-supplemented chow for 20 weeks; group 3 received 0.25% cholesterol-supplemented chow for 40 weeks; and group 4 received 0.25% cholesterol-supplemented chow for 20 weeks followed by normal chow for an additional 20 weeks. The aortas and aortic valves were analyzed using immunohistochemical and histological methods to detect cellular and structural components of the developing lesions. RESULTS: All rabbits in groups 2. 3 and 4 developed atherosclerotic lesions in their aortas. Aortic valves from these animals demonstrated thickening. lipid deposition. a change in collagen content and organization. a reorganization of elastin. and the presence of both macrophage infiltrate and osteopontin.

To permit long-term cellular imaging. RGs are traditionally required to be integrated into the cellular genome. This poses a potential safety risk and regulatory bottleneck for clinical translation as integration can lead to cellular transformation. To address this issue. we have developed non-integrative. replicating minicircles (MCs) as an alternative platform for safer monitoring of cells in living subjects. We developed both plasmids and minicircles containing the scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MAR) of the human interferon-beta gene. driven by the CMV promoter. and expressing the bioluminescence RG firefly luciferase. Constructs were transfected into breast cancer cells. and expanded S/MAR minicircle clones showed luciferase signal for greater than 3 months in culture and minicircles remained as episomes. Importantly. luciferase activity in clonal populations was slowly lost over time and this corresponded to a loss of episome. providing a way to reversibly label cells. To monitor cell proliferation in vivo. 1.5×106 cells carrying the S/MAR minicircle were implanted subcutaneously into mice (n = 5) and as tumors developed significantly more bioluminescence signal was noted at day 35 and 43 compared to day 7 post-implant (p<0.05).

Its gene is present in bands 21-24 on human chromosome 1 and contains 14 exons spanning about 13 kilobases of DNA. The main function of E-selectin as one of the selectin family is the rolling of leukocytes along the blood vessel wall which is the early step in leuckocyte adhesion to the blood vessel wall followed by migration. Several recent findings regarding the genetic background of atherosclerosis have indicated that DNA polymorphisms in genes encoding adhesion molecules are associated with a higher risk of severe atherosclerosis (2).

Arabidopsis encodes ten AGO proteins and a large network of small RNAs. How these small RNAs are sorted into specific AGO complexes remains largely unknown. We have cataloged small RNAs resident in four AGO complexes. We found that AGO2 and AGO4 preferentially recruit small RNAs with a 5′ terminal adenosine. whereas AGO1 harbors microRNAs (miRNAs) that favor a 5′ terminal uridine. AGO5 predominantly binds small RNAs that initiate with cytosine. Changing the 5′ terminal nucleotide of an miRNA predictably redirected it into a different AGO complex and alters its biological activity.

Here we show that HeLa cells depleted for Bub1 by RNA interference are defective in checkpoint signaling. Bub1 directly phosphorylates Cdc20 in vitro and inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of APC/CCdc20 catalytically. A Cdc20 mutant with all six Bub1 phosphorylation sites removed is refractory to Bub1-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition in vitro. Upon checkpoint activation. Bub1 itself is hyperphosphorylated and its kinase activity toward Cdc20 is stimulated. Ectopic expression of the nonphosphorylatable Cdc20 mutant allows HeLa cells to escape from mitosis in the presence of spindle damage. Therefore. Bub1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc20 is required for proper checkpoint signaling.

However. how epigenetic information carried by histone modifications propagates through mitotic divisions remains elusive. To address this question. the DNA replication–dependent nucleosome partition pattern must be clarified. Here. we report significant amounts of H3.3-H4 tetramers split in vivo. whereas most H3.1-H4 tetramers remained intact. Inhibiting DNA replication–dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting events. which suggests that (i) the replication-independent H3.3 deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating two new H3.3-H4 dimers and (ii) the majority of splitting events occurred during replication-dependent deposition.

Upon perception of pathogen-derived signals. plants accumulate defense hormones such as ethylene (ET). jasmonate. salicylate. and damage-associated molecular patterns to amplify immune responses. In particular. the Arabidopsis peptide Pep1 and its family members are thought to be damage-associated molecular patterns that trigger immunity through Pep1 receptor kinases PEPR1 and PEPR2.

IL-33 is thought to be activated via caspase-1-dependent proteolysis. similar to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. but this remains unproven.

Immediately after recruitment. the single polypeptide FLICE zymogen is proteolytically processed to the active dimeric species composed of large and small catalytic subunits. Since all caspases cleave their substrates after Asp residues and are themselves processed from the single-chain zymogen to the two-chain active enzyme by cleavage at internal Asp residues. it follows that an upstream caspase can process a downstream zymogen.

Distinct members of the  family are involved in both the initiation and execution phases of cell  death. with the initiator caspases being recruited to multicomponent  signaling complexes. Initiation of apoptotic events depends on  the ability of the signaling complexes to generate an active protease.  The mechanism of activation of the caspases that constitute the  different apoptosis-signaling complexes can be explained by an  unusual property of the caspase zymogens to autoprocess to an active  form. This autoprocessing depends on intrinsic activity that resides in  the zymogens of the initiator caspases.

M45 is a viral inhibitor of RIP activation that provides a direct cell type-dependent replication benefit to the virus while modulating other biological processes signaling via the RIP1 adaptor such as activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 as well as other mediators of cell death.,True,k0jXH1wAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,169,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820816007,12074399938500327303,/scholar?cites=12074399938500327303,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820816007,0,0,0

Apo2L/TRAIL is unusual as compared to any other cytokine as it interacts with a complex system of receptors: two pro-apoptotic death receptors and three anti-apoptotic decoys. This protein has generated tremendous excitement as a potential tumor-specific cancer therapeutic because. as a stable soluble trimer. it selectively induces apoptosis in many transformed cells but not in normal cells. Transcriptional activation of Apo2L/TRAIL by interferons (IFNs) through specific regulatory elements in its promoter. and possibly by a number of other cytokines. reveals its possible involvement in the activation of natural killer cells. cytotoxic T lymphocytes. and dendritic cells.

Cystatins play multiple roles in physiology and pathology. including tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative disorders. and a number of cathepsins are thought to be involved in cancer and other diseases as regulators of a variety of biochemical processes. Preferential attention has been paid to the deregulation and imbalance between cathepsins and cystatins in invasion and metastasis of several neoplasias. We have previously reportad that cystatin D prometes cell adhesion and decreases proliferation. migration and invasion of colon carcinoma cells. lt is downregulated during human colon carcinogenesis. and considerad as a candidate tumor suppressor gene that is transcriptionally induced by 1.25(OH)2D3. the most active metabolite of vitamin D. mediating its protective effects against this neoplasia (Álvarez-Díaz et al.. J. Clin. lnvest.. 2009). The finding that mutant forms of cystatin D with no protease inhibitory activity lack the antimigratory but not the antiproliferative effect on colon cancer cells indicates that cystatin D has cathepsin-independent mechanism(s) of action. Cathepsins have traditionally been considerad endosomal/lysosomal or secreted proteases; however. new evidences support their localization in other cellular compartments. Recent studies have reported the activity of cathepsin L. a cystatin D target. within the cell nucleus. Analogously. a few cystatins and other protease inhibitors have been found to act in the nuclear compartment …,True,oivVnZIAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,0,https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/152779,,,,,0,0,0

Additionally. 1.25(OH)2D3 activates rapid. non-genomic signaling pathways. We have reported that 1.25(OH)2D3 inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation of human colon carcinoma cells via the control of a high number of genes and the antagonism of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (Pálmer et al.. J. Cell Biol.. 2001; Cancer Res.. 2003). 1.25(OH)2D3 increases the expression of CDH1/E-cadherin RNA and protein through the activation of a rapid non-genomic pathway (Ca2+-RhoA-ROCK-MSK1) and the subsequent increase in transcription (Ordóñez-Morán et al.. J. Cell Biol.. 2008). Additionally. it induces other proteins involved in epithelial adhesion structures such as the tight junctions components claudin-7. occludin and ZO-1. These effects are partially mediated by the induction of CST5/cystatin D. a protease inhibitor that regulates gene expression within the cell nucleus. and KDM6B/JMJD3 histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase. and by the repression of SPROUTY-2. a modulator of tyrosine kinase receptor signalling (Alvarez-Díaz et al..

The new compounds 5a–c were efficiently synthesized from ketone 9 (which is readily accessible from the Inhoffen–Lythgoe diol) with overall yields of 15%. 6%. and 3% for 5a. 5b. and 5c. respectively. The triene system was introduced by the Pd-catalyzed tandem cyclization–Suzuki coupling method. The new analogues were assayed against human colon and breast cancer cell lines and in mice. All new vitamin D3 analogues bound less strongly to the VDR than 1α.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but had similar antiproliferative. pro-differentiating. and transcriptional activity as the native hormone.

The active vitamin D metabolite 1α. 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1. 25 (OH) 2D3) regulates gene transcription via its nuclear receptor (VDR). and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of gene expression have also been proposed. We have identified microRNA-22 (miR-22) and several other miRNA species as 1. 25 (OH) 2D3 targets in human colon cancer cells. Remarkably. miR-22 is induced by 1. 25 (OH) 2D3 in a time-. dose-. and VDR-dependent manner. In SW480-ADH and HCT116 cells. miR-22 loss-offunction by transfection of a miR-22 inhibitor suppresses the antiproliferative effect of 1. 25 (OH) 2D3. Additionally. miR-22 inhibition increases cell migration per se and decreases the antimigratory effect of 1. 25 (OH) 2D3 in both cell types. In silico analysis shows a significant overlap between genes suppressed by 1. 25 (OH) 2D3 and miR-22 putative target genes. Consistently. miR-22 inhibition abrogates the 1. 25 (OH) 2D3–mediated suppression of NELL2. OGN. HNRPH1. RERE and NFAT5 genes. In 39 out of 50 (78%) human colon cancer patients. miR-22 expression was found lower in the tumour than in the matched normal tissue and correlated directly with that of VDR. Our results indicate that miR-22 is induced by 1. 25 (OH) 2D3 in human colon cancer cells and it may contribute to its antitumour action against this neoplasia. at Pennsylvania State University on May 12. 2016 http://hmg. oxfordjournals. org/,True,oivVnZIAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.912.1600&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.912.1600&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

La 1.25(OH)2D3 inhibe la proliferación y promueve la diferenciación de células humanas de cáncer de colon. Nuestros resultados indican que estas acciones se deben. al menos en parte. al antagonismo de la vía de señalización Wnt/β-catenina. cuya activación aberrante es el paso inicial en cáncer colorrectal. por tres mecanismos: a) la unión de VDR a β-catenina. que impide la formación de complejos β-catenina-TCF y la activación de sus genes diana; b) la inducción de la expresión de CDH1/Ecadherina. que codifica una proteína esencial en la unión intercelular en epitelios supresora de invasividad y favorece la relocalización de β-catenina desde núcleo a la membrana plasmática; y c) la inducción de la expresión de DICKKOPF(DKK)-1. que codifica un inhibidor de la vía Wnt/β-catenina con actividad supresora tumoral. La deficiencia de VDR en ratones Apcmin que expresan una forma mutada del gen supresor Apc contribuye a la activación de la vía Wnt/β-catenina y causa un aumento de la carga tumoral.

Unlike 3D edgeless bilayer vesicles. colloidal monolayer membranes form open structures with an exposed edge. thus presenting an opportunity to study elasticity of fluid sheets. Membranes assembled from single-component chiral rods form flat disks with uniform edge twist.

In this limit. disk-shaped membranes become unstable. instead forming structures with scalloped edges. where two adjacent lobes with opposite handedness are separated by a cusp-shaped point defect.

The complex structure of the monolayer edge modifies its fluctuations. effectively smoothing out the interface. We demonstrate that long filaments such as F-actin or flagella preferentially dissolve in the membrane's edge and can be used to control its interfacial properties. This effect is not driven by energetic interactions. but is rather a direct consequence of the intrinsic geometry of the constituent particles; hence we call such filaments geometrical edgeactants. Using optical manipulation techniques we adsorb individual filaments onto the edge of the colloidal membrane and measure their influence on the edge fluctuations. Edgeactants stiffen the interface. increasing its bending rigidity by up to an order of magnitude.

However. very few of these investigations evaluated the use of intramuscular progesterone in twin pregnancies. A few studies that used 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in twin pregnancies had mainly included unselected twin pregnancies.

However. many properties of such MT bundles have not been studied experimentally. In this work. we combine optical trapping techniques with an umbrella sampling method in order to measure the depletion force acting on individual microtubule in the axial direction within the bundle. We find depletion force is independent of bundle overlap length and measure its magnitude to be on the order of tens of k B/T μm. We explore the dependence of the depletion force on concentration of depletant (PEG 20K) as well as K+ ions (necessary for screening electrostatic repulsion between MT filaments).

However. when such particles are embedded in a membrane. the inter-particle potential is significantly modified by membrane mediated forces and gives rise to novel phase behavior. Visualizing and manipulating such inclusions in a lipid bilayer is difficult due to the nanometer length scales involved. Here. we use a model system of micron sized colloidal membranes doped with molecules shorter or longer than that of the bulk. Surprisingly. the dopant molecules form self-limited finite size clusters.

We investigated the mobility of individual filaments in actin and microtubule based bundles. We find that microtubules. bundled under the influence of low concentrations of depleting agent. slide with respect to each other due to thermal effects. Using darkfield microscopy and filament-tracking software we analyzed this sliding as 1-dimensional diffusion. Our analysis reveals that this process is subdiffusive. likely due to a stick-slip mechanism. In contrast. actin filaments within a bundle do not exhibit any sliding motion. We therefore used laser tweezers to actively pull actin filaments past each other at a constant velocity. The resulting data showed that force scales linearly with velocity and overlap length of the filaments.,True,Zspw1skAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010APS..MARV18004W/abstract,,,,,0,0,0

Schrödinger cat sources. faster-than-light communication and violation of the Born rule) which can only be ignored in simple typical situations. We harness the power of spontaneous localization models. historically constructed to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. to build a consistent theory of (stochastic) semiclassical gravity in the Newtonian limit. Our model makes quantitative and potentially testable predictions: we recover the Newtonian pair potential up to a short distance cutoff (hence. we predict no one-particle self-interaction) and uncover an additional gravitational …,True,isGoFyYAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,61,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.024026,1276661664531167386,/scholar?cites=1276661664531167386,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08705,0,0,0

We reveal the existence of a transition. depending on OQRW moduli. in the internal system behaviors from simple oscillations to random flips between two unstable pure states. This induces a transition in the orbital motions from the usual diffusion to ballistically induced diffusion with a large mean free path and large effective diffusion constant at large times.

Using the machinery of continuous measurement theory and feedback. it was shown that one could construct well-behaved models of hybrid quantum-classical dynamics at the price of an imposed (nonunique) decoherence structure. We introduce a principle of least decoherence (PLD) which allows us to naturally single out a unique model from all the available options; up to some unspecified short distance regularization scale. Interestingly. the resulting model is found to coincide with the old—erstwhile only heuristically motivated—proposal of Penrose and one of us for gravity-related spontaneous decoherence and collapse.

The model suggests that the binding of additional dsDNA base pairs to the DNA/RecA filament alters the tension in dsDNA that was already bound to the filament. resulting in a nonlinear increase in the mechanical energy as a function of the number of bound base pairs.

The resulting semiclassical theory of Newtonian gravity preserves the statistical interpretation of quantum states of matter in contrast with mean field approaches. It can be seen as a discrete version of recent proposals of consistent hybrid quantum classical theories. The model is in agreement with known experimental data and introduces new falsifiable predictions:(1) single particles do not self-interact.(2) the 1/r gravitational potential of Newtonian gravity is cut off at short (≲ 10− 7 m) distances. and (3) gravity makes spatial superpositions decohere at a rate inversely proportional to that coming from the vanilla GRW model.

Recently. a construction of such states in the continuum was put forward. providing a first step towards the goal of solving quantum field theories (QFTs) variationally. However. the proposed manifold of continuous tensor network states (CTNSs) is difficult to study in full generality. because the expectation values of local observables cannot be computed analytically. In this paper. we study a tractable subclass of CTNSs. the Gaussian CTNSs (GCTNSs). and benchmark them on simple quadratic and quartic bosonic QFT Hamiltonians. We show that GCTNSs provide arbitrarily accurate approximations to the ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians. and decent estimates for quartic ones at weak coupling. Since they capture the short distance behavior of the theories we consider exactly. GCTNSs even allow to renormalize away simple divergences variationally.

1163798,Variational method in relativistic quantum field theory without cutoff,2021,Antoine Tilloy,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07733,,,,The variational method is a powerful approach to solve many-body quantum problems non perturbatively. However. in the context of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT). it needs to meet 3 seemingly incompatible requirements outlined by Feynman: extensivity. computability. and lack of UV sensitivity. In practice. variational methods break one of the 3. which translates into the need to have an IR or UV cutoff. In this letter. I introduce a relativistic modification of continuous matrix product states that satisfies the 3 requirements jointly in 1+ 1 dimensions. I apply it to the self-interacting scalar field. without UV cutoff and directly in the thermodynamic limit. Numerical evidence suggests the error decreases faster than any power law in the number of parameters. while the cost remains only polynomial.,True,isGoFyYAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07733,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07733,0,0,0

Several such studies have underscored the need for detailed study of morphology of primary cilia and structure-function mapping of its morphology with its ability to transduce signals.

The basic architecture of a DNA-origami barrel is depicted for the 87-nm outer diameter variant (90-nm barrel) in Fig. 1. and for other barrel variants in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1-11 24. One perspective for the architecture of 90-nm barrels is as coaxially stacked DNA duplex rings 25. Another perspective is a single-layer corrugated sheet. built on a honeycomb lattice. where each double helix is 48 turns long and arranged horizontally; in the view in Fig. 1 b. the concave side is facing the viewer. We designate the helices closer to the viewer as middle helices (cyan in Fig. 1) and the helices further from the viewer as outer helices (blue in Fig. 1). To add structural rigidity. a parallel inner-helix ridge (magenta in Fig. 1) is mounted on every middle helix. The inner-helix layer consists of short miniscaf strands. rather than the long M13 scaffold strand. which hybridize to the staple strands to form the scaffold-parity side of the DNA duplex 26 (Supplementary Note 1). A useful feature of a DNA-origami barrel is the presentation of a rhombic lattice of strand nick points that can serve as pixel sites. each spaced~ 8 nm apart from six nearest neighbors and available for potential functionalization by guests. on both inside (concave) and outside (convex) surfaces. As a comparison. the typical Rothemund rectangle is designed with nick points. projecting from one face. arranged in a rhombic lattice with~ 5-nm spacing. We designed barrel monomers with diameters from 30 to 90 nm. and heights ranging from 19 (4 outer helices. 5 inner helices) to 65 nm (14 outer helices. 15 inner helices).

Here we show that [Ca2+]i oscillations are a biochemical phenomenon emanating from regulation of Ca2+ signaling by the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. [Ca2+]i oscillations evoked by G protein–coupled receptors require the action of RGS proteins. Inhibition of endogenous RGS protein action disrupted agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations by a stepwise conversion to a sustained response. Based on these findings and the effect of mutant RGS proteins and anti-RGS protein antibodies on Ca2+ signaling. we propose that RGS proteins within the G protein–coupled receptor complexes provide a biochemical control of [Ca2+]i oscillations.,True,TznTrPgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,96,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276501002118,15288364433127733112,/scholar?cites=15288364433127733112,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276501002118,0,0,0

However. regulation of this anion channel is only poorly understood. In this paper we demonstrate that VDAC purified from rat liver mitochondria can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA phosphorylates VDAC linearly up to fifteenfold in sixty minutes. The level of VDAC phosphorylation increases to twofold and sevenfold of control value after ten and thirty minutes of reaction. respectively.

P2X7R has a unique property of forming large pore upon repeated or prolonged application of agonist like ATP or 2′. 3′-(4-benzoyl) benzoyl ATP. It has been proposed that pannexin 1 (panx1) hemichannel associates with P2X7R to form large pore. though the actual mechanism is not yet understood. Calcium concentration in extracellular milieu drops in many patho-physiological conditions. e.g. ischemia. when P2X7R/pannexin is also known to be activated. Therefore. we hypothesize that extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) plays an important role in the coupling of P2X7R–panx1 and subsequent membrane permeabilization.

Although hemichannels consisting of connexins are more widely documented. hemichannels of pannexins. proteins homologous to invertebrate gap junction proteins also have been studied. There are at least 21 different connexin and three pannexin isotypes. This variety in isotypes results in tissue‐specific hemichannels. which have been implicated in varied events ranging from development. cell survival. to cell death. Hemichannel function varies with its spatio‐temporal opening. thus demanding a refined degree of regulation.

1163833,Dual mode of gating of voltage-dependent anion channel as revealed by phosphorylation,2001,Amal K Bera and Subhendu Ghosh,135,Journal of structural biology,1,67-72,Academic Press,The single-channel electrophysiological properties of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of mitochondria from rat liver have been investigated under normal and phosphorylated (with protein kinase A) conditions. Experimental observations show that phosphorylation does not affect the current level and the opening probability in the positive clamping potentials. but leads to lowering of current magnitude and opening probability in the negative clamping potentials. The opening probability versus voltage (V) plot for native VDAC fits a Gaussian function symmetric around V = 0. whereas the same for phosphorylated VDAC fits a linear combination of two Gaussian functions.

The glycosylation pattern of expressed Panx1 varied greatly among different cell lines. In contrast to connexin (Cx) containing GJs (Cx-GJs). junctional conductance (G j) of pannexin GJs (Panx-GJs) is very less sensitive to junctional voltage. Both Panx1 and Panx3 junctions favoured anionic dyes over cations to permeate.

Here we showed that silencing of VDAC1 protected HeLa cells from aspirin-induced cell death. Compared to the wild type cells. VDAC1 knocked down cells showed lesser change of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ m). upon aspirin treatment. Aspirin augmented ATP and ionomycin-induced mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake which was abolished in VDAC1 knocked down cells. Aspirin dissociated bound hexokinase II (HK-II) from mitochondria. Further. aspirin promoted the closure of recombinant human VDAC1. reconstituted in planar lipid bilayer. Taken together. these results imply that VDAC1 serves as a novel target for aspirin.

1163848,Contribution of intracellular calcium and pH in ischemic uncoupling of cardiac gap junction channels formed of connexins 43. 40. and 45: a critical function of C-terminal domain,2013,Giriraj Sahu and Amal Kanti Bera,8,PloS one,3,e60506,Public Library of Science,Ischemia is known to inhibit gap junction (GJ) mediated intercellular communication. However the detail mechanisms of this inhibition are largely unknown. In the present study. we determined the vulnerability of different cardiac GJ channels formed of connexins (Cxs) 43. 40. and 45 to simulated ischemia. by creating oxygen glucose deprived (OGD) condition. 5 minutes of OGD decreased the junctional conductance (Gj) of Cx43. Cx40 and Cx45 by 53±3%. 64±1% and 85±2% respectively. Reduction of Gj was prevented completely by restricting the change of both intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and pH (pHi) with potassium phosphate buffer. Clamping of either [Ca2+]i or pHi. through BAPTA (2 mM) or HEPES (80 mM) respectively. offered partial resistance to ischemic uncoupling. Anti-calmodulin antibody attenuated the uncoupling of Cx43 and Cx45 significantly but not of Cx40. Furthermore. OGD could reduce only 26±2% of Gj in C-terminus (CT) truncated Cx43 (Cx43-Δ257). Tethering CT of Cx43 to the CT-truncated Cx40 (Cx40-Δ249). and Cx45 (Cx45-Δ272) helped to resist OGD mediated uncoupling. Moreover. CT domain played a significant role in determining the junction current density and plaque diameter. Our results suggest; OGD mediated uncoupling of GJ channels is primarily due to elevated [Ca2+]i and acidic pHi. though the latter contributes more. Among Cx43. Cx40 and Cx45. Cx43 is the most resistant to OGD while Cx45 is the most sensitive one. CT of Cx43 has major necessary elements for OGD induced uncoupling and it can complement CT of Cx40 and Cx45.,True,TznTrPgAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0060506,75489733418264130,/scholar?cites=75489733418264130,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0060506,0,0,0
